            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IF it were possible to trace back to their beginnings, in each individual, those good
               or evil impulses that have become ruling affections, in most cases the origin would
               not be found until we had reached the home of childhood. Here it is that impressions
               are made, which become lasting as existence itself. But the influence of home is not
               alone salutary or baneful in early years. Wherever a home exists, there will be found
               the nursery of all that is excellent in social or civil life, or of all that is
               deformed. Every man and woman we meet in society, exhibit, in unmistakable
               characters, the quality of their homes. The wife, the husband, the children, the
               guest, bear with them daily a portion of the spirit pervading the little circle from
               which they have come forth. If the sun shines there, a light will be on their
               countenances; but shadows, if clouds are in the sky of home. If there be disorder,
               defect of principle, discord among the members, neglect of duty, and absence of kind
               offices, the sphere of those who constitute that home can hardly<pb n="6-7"
                  xml:id="VAC5621-00000004"/> be salutary. They will add little to the common stock
               of good in the social life around them. We need not say how different will be the
               influence of those whose home-circle is pervaded by higher, purer, and truer
               principles.</p>
            <p>A word to the wise is, we are told, sufficient. He, therefore, who speaks a true word
               in the ear of the wise, has planted a seed that will surely spring up and yield good
               fruit. May we hope that all into whose hands this little book is destined to come are
               wise, and that the few suggestive words spoken therein, as "hints to make home
               happy," will fall into good ground. If this be so, "The Home Mission" will not be
               fruitless. Though no annual reports of what it has accomplished are made, its silent
               and unobtrusive work, we trust, will be none the less effectual.</p>

               <head>A VISION OF CONSOLATION.</head>
               <p>THE tempest of grief which, for a time, had raged so wildly in the heart of Mrs.
                  Freeland, exhausted by its own violence, sobbed itself away, and the stricken
                  mother passed into the land of dreams.</p>
               <p>To the afflicted, sleep comes with a double blessing —rest is given to the wearied
                  body and to the grieving spirit. Often, very often, the Angel of Consolation bends
                  to the dreaming ear, and whispers words of hope and comfort that from no living
                  lips had yet found utterance.</p>
               <p>And it was so now with the sleeping mother. A few hours only had passed since she
                  stood looking down, for the last time, on the fair face of her youngest born. Over
                  his bright, blue eyes, into whose heavenly depths she had so loved to gaze, the
                  pale lids had closed for ever. Still lingered around his lips the smile left there
                  by the angels, as, with a kiss of love, they received his parting spirit. In the
                  curling masses of his rich, golden hair, the shadows nestled away, as of old,
                  while his tiny fingers held a few white blossoms, as with a living grasp. Was it
                  death or sleep? So like a sleeping child the sweet boy lay, that it seemed every
                     moment<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC5621-00000005"/> ment as if his lips would
                  unclose, his eyes open to the light, and his voice come to the listening ear with
                  its tones of music.</p>
               <p>If to the mother had come this illusion, it remained not long. Wild with grief,
                  she turned away as the sweet face she had so loved to gaze upon was hidden from
                  her straining eyes for ever.</p>
               <p>Hidden from her eyes, did we say? Only hidden from her natural eyes. Still he was
                  before the eyes of her spirit in all his living beauty. But, to her natural
                  affections, he was lost—even as he had faded from before her natural eyes; and, in
                  the agony of bereavement, it seemed that her heart would break. Back to her
                  darkened chamber she went. Her nearest and dearest friends gathered around,
                  seeking lovingly to sustain her in her great affliction; but she refused to be
                  comforted.</p>
               <p>At length, as at first said, the tempest of grief, which, for a time, raged so
                  violently in the heart of Mrs. Freeland, sobbed itself away, and the stricken
                  mother passed into the land of dreams.</p>
               <p>For the most part, dreams are fantastic. Yet they are not always so. In states of
                  deep sorrow or strong trial, when the heart turns from the natural world, hopeless
                  of aid or consolation, truth often comes in dreams and similitudes.</p>
               <p>The mother found herself in the company of two beautiful maidens, in the very
                  flower of youth; and as she gazed earnestly into their faces, which seemed
                  transparent from an inward celestial light, she saw expectation therein—loving
                  expectation. They stood beneath the eastern portico of a pleasant dwelling, around
                  which stately trees—the branches vocal with the song of feathered minstrels—lifted
                  their green tops far up into the crystal air. Flowers of a thousand hues and sweet
                  odours were woven into forms and figures of exquisite beauty upon the carpet of
                  living green spread over the teeming earth, while groups of little children
                  sported one with another, and mingled their happy voices with the melody of
                  birds.</p>
               <p>Yet, amid all this external joy and beauty, the hand of grief still lay upon the
                  mother's heart; and when she looked upon the sportive infants around her, she
                  sighed for her own babe. Even as she sighed, one of the maidens turned to her and
                  said, while her whole countenance was lit up with a glow of delight—</p>
               <p>"It has come. A new babe is born unto heaven."</p>
               <p>And, as she spoke, she gathered her arms quickly to her bosom, and the wondering
                  mother saw lying thereon her own child. The other maiden was already bending over
                  the infant—already had she greeted its coming with a kiss of love. Quickly both
                  retired within the dwelling, and the bereaved mother went with them, eager to
                  receive the babe she had lost.</p>
               <p>"Oh, my child! my child!" she said. "Give me my child."</p>
               <p>And ere the words had died upon her lips, the maiden who had received the babe
                  gave it into her arms, when she clasped it with a wild delight, and rained tears
                  of gladness upon its face.</p>
               <p>For a time, the two maidens looked upon the mother in silence, and in their bright
                  countenances love and pity were blended. At length, one of them<pb n="10-11"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000006"/> said to her, (and she smiled sweetly, and spoke
                  with an exquisite, penetrating tenderness,)—</p>
               <p>"Your heart is full of love for your babe?"</p>
               <p>"He is dearer to me than life—dearer than a thousand lives," replied the mother
                  quickly, drawing the babe closer to her bosom.</p>
               <p>"Love seeks to bless the object of its regard."</p>
               <p>There was a meaning in the words and tone of the maiden, as she said this, that
                  caused the mother to look into her face earnestly.</p>
               <p>"This is not the land of sickness, of sorrow, of death," resumed the maiden, "but
                  the land of eternal life and blessedness. Into this land your babe has been born.
                  You are here only as a visitant, and must soon return to bear a few more trials
                  and pains, a few more conflicts with evil; but the end is your preparation for
                  these heavenly regions."</p>
               <p>A shadow fell instantly upon the mother's heart. Tears rushed to her eyes, and she
                  drew her arms more tightly about her babe.</p>
               <p>"Shall we keep this babe in our heavenly home, or will you bear it with you back
                  to the dark, cold, sad regions of mortality?"</p>
               <p>"Do not take from me my more than life!" sobbed the mother wildly. "Oh! I cannot
                  give you my child;" and more eagerly she hugged it to her breast.</p>
               <p>For a time there was silence. Then one of the maidens laid gently her hand upon
                  the mother, and she lifted her bowed head.</p>
               <p>"Come," said the maiden.</p>
               <p>The mother arose, and the two walked into the open air, and passing through the
                  group of children sporting on the lawn and in the gardens, went for what seemed
                  the space of a mile, until they came to a forest, into the depths of which they
                  penetrated; and, for a time, the farther they went the darker and more gloomy it
                  became, until scarcely a ray of light from the arching sky came down through the
                  dense and tangled foliage. At last they were beyond the forest.</p>
               <p>"Look," said the companion.</p>
               <p>The mother lifted her eyes—the babe had strangely passed from her arms. A
                  dwelling, familiar in aspect, stood near, and through an open window she saw a
                  sick child lying upon a bed, and knew it as her own. Its little face was distorted
                  by pain and flushed with fever; and as it tossed restlessly to and fro, its moans
                  filled her ears. She stretched forth her hands, yearning to give some relief; even
                  as she did so, the scene faded from her view, and next she saw an older child,
                  bearing still the linaments of her own. There was the same broad, white forehead
                  and clustering curls; the same large, bright eyes and full, ruddy lips; but, alas!
                  not the soft vail of innocence which had given the features of the babe such a
                  heavenly charm. The fine brow was contracted with passion; the eyes flashed with
                  an evil light; and the lips were tightly drawn, and with something of defiance,
                  against the teeth. The boy was resisting, with a stern determination, the will of
                  the parents—was setting at naught those early salutary restraints which are the
                  safeguard of youth.</p>
               <p>"Oh! my unhappy boy!" cried the mother.</p>
               <p>The scene changed as she spoke. The boy, now<pb n="12-13"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000007"/> grown up to manhood, once more stood before her.
                  Alas! how had the light of innocence faded from his countenance, giving place to a
                  shadow of evil, the very darkness of which caused a cold shudder to pass through
                  the mother's frame.</p>
               <p>"Look again," said the maiden, as this scene was fading.</p>
               <p>But the mother hid her face in her hands, and turned weeping away.</p>
               <p>"Look again." And this time there was something so heart-cheering in the maiden's
                  voice, that the mother lifted her tearful eyes. She was back again in the
                  beautiful place from which she had gone forth a little while before, and her babe,
                  beautiful as innocence itself, lay sweetly sleeping in the arms of the lovely
                  maiden who had received it on its first entrance into heaven. With a heart full of
                  joy, the mother now bent over the slumbering babe, kissing it again and again.</p>
               <p>"Grieving mother," said the angel-maiden, in tones of flute-like softness, "God
                  saw that it would not be good for your child to remain on earth, and he therefore
                  removed it to this celestial region, where no evil can ever penetrate. To me, as
                  an angel-mother, it has been given; and I will love it and care for it with a love
                  as pure and tender as the love that yearns in your bosom. As its infantile mind
                  opens, I will pour in heavenly instruction, that it may grow in wisdom and become
                  an angel. Will you not let me have it freely?"</p>
               <p>"But why may I not remain here and be its heavenly mother? Oh! I will love and
                  care for it with a tenderness and devotion equal to, if not exceeding yours."</p>
               <p>Even while the mother spoke there was a change. She saw before her other objects
                  of affection. There was her husband, sitting in deep dejection, sorrowing for the
                  loss of one who was dear as his own life; while three children, the sight of whom
                  stirred her maternal heart to its profoundest depths, lay sleeping in each other's
                  arms, the undried tears yet glistening on their lashes.</p>
               <p>The wife and mother stretched forth her hands toward these beloved ones, eager to
                  be with them again and turn their grief into gladness. But, in a moment, there
                  passed another change. The pleasant home in which her children had been sheltered
                  for years, no longer held them; the fold had been broken up and the tender lambs
                  scattered. One of these little ones the mother saw, sitting apart from a group of
                  sportive children, weeping over some task work. The bloom on her cheek had
                  faded—its roundness was gone—the light of her beautiful eyes was quenched in
                  tears. And, as she looked, a woman came to the child and spoke to her harshly. She
                  was about springing forward, when another scene was presented. Her first-born, a
                  noble-spirited boy, to whose future she had ever looked with pride and pleasure,
                  stood before her. Alas! how changed. Every thing about him showed the want of a
                  mother's care and considerate affection; and from his dear, young face had already
                  vanished the look of joyous innocence she had so loved to contemplate.</p>
               <p>Again the mother was in the presence of the angel-maiden, to whose loving arms a
                  good God had<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC5621-00000008"/> confided the babe, which, in
                  his wisdom, he had removed from the earth. And the angel-maiden, as she looked
                  first at the babe in her arms and then at the mother, smiled sweetly and said—</p>
               <p>"He is safe here; will you not let him remain?"</p>
               <p>And, with a gushing heart, the mother answered, "Not for worlds would I take him
                  with me into the outer life of nature. Oh, no! He is safe—let him remain."</p>
               <p>"And you will return to those who still need your love and care?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes," said the mother, earnestly. "Let me go to them again. Let me be their
                  angel on earth."</p>
               <p>And she bent hastily to the heaven-born babe, kissing it with tearful
                  fondness.</p>
               <p>There came now another change. The mother was back again in her chamber of sorrow;
                  and undried tears were yet upon her cheeks. But she was comforted and reconciled
                  to the great affliction which had been sent for good from heaven.</p>
               <p>Those who saw Mrs. Freeland in the first wild grief that followed the loss of her
                  babe, wondered at her serene composure when she came again among them. And they
                  wondered long, for she spoke not of this Vision of Consolation. It was too sacred
                  a thing to be revealed, to any save the companion of her life.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>THE STEP-MOTHER.</head>
               <p>THERE are few positions in social life of greater trial and responsibility than
                  that of a step-mother; and it too rarely happens that the woman who assumes this
                  position, is fitted for the right discharge of its duties. In far too many cases,
                  the widower is accepted as a husband because he has a home, or a position to
                  offer, while the children are considered as a drawback in the bargain. But it
                  sometimes happens, that a true woman, from genuine affection, unites herself with
                  a widower, and does it with a loving regard for his children, and with the purpose
                  in her mind of being to them, as far as in her power lies, a wise and tender
                  mother.</p>
               <p>Such a woman was Agnes Green. She was in her thirty-second year when Mr. Edward
                  Arnold, a widower with four children, asked her to become his wife. At twenty-two,
                  Agnes had loved as only a true woman can love. But the object of that love proved
                  himself unworthy, and she turned away from him. None knew how deep the heart-trial
                  through which she passed—none knew how intensely she suffered. In part, her pale
                  face and sobered brow witnessed, but only in part; for many said she was cold, and
                  some even used the word heartless, when they spoke of her. From early womanhood a
                     beautiful<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC5621-00000009"/> ful ideal of manly
                  excellence had filled her mind; and with this ideal she had invested one who
                  proved false to the high character. At once the green things of her heart withered
                  and for a long time its surface was a barren waste. But the woman was yet strong
                  in her. She must love something. So she came forth from her heart-seclusion, and
                  let her affections, like a refreshing and invigorating stream, flow along many
                  channels. She was the faithful friend, the comforter in affliction, the wise
                  counsellor. More than once had she been approached with offers of marriage, by men
                  who saw the excellence of her character, and felt that upon any dwelling, in which
                  she was the presiding spirit, would rest a blessing. But none of them were able to
                  give to the even pulses of her heart a quicker motion.</p>
               <p>At last she met Mr. Arnold. More than three years had passed since the mother of
                  his children was removed by death, and, since that time, he had sought, with all a
                  father's tenderness and devotion, to fill her place to them. How imperfectly, none
                  knew so well as himself. As time went on, the want of a true woman's affectionate
                  care for his children was more and more felt. All were girls except the youngest,
                  their ages ranging from twelve downward, and this made their mother's loss so much
                  the more a calamity. Moreover, his feeling of loneliness and want of
                  companionship, so keenly felt in the beginning, instead of diminishing,
                  increased.</p>
               <p>Such was his state of mind when he met Agnes Green. The attraction was mutual,
                  though, at first, no thought of marriage came into the mind of either. A second
                  meeting stirred the placid waters in the bosom of Agnes Green. Conscious of this,
                  and fearful lest the emotion she strove to repress might become apparent to other
                  eyes, she assumed a certain reserve, not seen in the beginning, which only
                  betrayed her secret, and at once interested Mr. Arnold, who now commenced a close
                  observation of her character. With every new aspect in which this was presented,
                  he saw something that awakened admiration; something that drew his spirit nearer
                  to her as one congenial. And not the less close was her observation.</p>
               <p>When, at length, Mr. Arnold solicited the hand of Agnes Green, she was ready to
                  respond. Not, however, in a selfish and self-seeking spirit; not in the narrow
                  hope of obtaining some great good for herself, was her response made, but in full
                  view of her woman's power to bless, and with an earnest, holy purpose in her
                  heart, to make her presence in his household indeed a blessing.</p>
               <p>"I must know your children better than I know them now, and they must know me
                  better than they do, before I take the place you wish me to assume," was her reply
                  to Mr. Arnold, when he spoke of an early marriage.</p>
               <p>And so means were taken to bring her in frequent contact with the children. The
                  first time she met them intimately, was at the house of a friend. Mary, the oldest
                  girl, she found passionate and self-willed; Florence, the second, good-natured,
                  but careless and slovenly; while Margaret, the third, was in ill health, and
                  exceedingly peevish. The little brother, Willy, was a beautiful, affectionate
                  child, but in consequence of injudicious management, very<pb n="18-19"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000010"/> badly spoiled. Take them altogether, they presented
                  rather an unpromising aspect; and it is no wonder that Agnes Green had many
                  misgivings at heart, when the new relation contemplated, and its trials and
                  responsibilities, were pictured to her mind.</p>
               <p>The earnestly-asked question by Mr. Arnold, after this first interview,—"What do
                  you think of my children?"—was not an easy one to answer. A selfish, unscrupulous
                  woman, who looked to the connection as something to be particularly desired on her
                  own account, and who cared little about duties and responsibilities, might have
                  replied, "Oh, they are lovely children!" or, "I am delighted with them!" Not so
                  Agnes Green. She did not reply immediately, but mused for some moments,
                  considerably embarrassed, and in doubt what to say. Mr. Arnold was gazing intently
                  in her face.</p>
               <p>"They do not seem to have made a favourable impression," said he, speaking with
                  some disappointment in his tone and manner.</p>
               <p>A feeble flush was visible in the face of Agnes Green, and also a slight quiver of
                  the lips as she answered:</p>
               <p>"There is too much at stake, as well in your case as my own, to warrant even a
                  shadow of concealment. You ask what I think of your children, and you expect me to
                  answer truly?"</p>
               <p>"I do," was the almost solemnly-spoken reply.</p>
               <p>"My first hurried, yet tolerably close, observation, has shown me, in each, a
                  groundwork of natural good."</p>
               <p>"As their father," replied Mr. Arnold, in some earnestness of manner, "I know
                  there is good in them,—much good. But they have needed a mother's care."</p>
               <p>"When you have said that, how much has been expressed! If the garden is not
                  cultivated, and every weed carefully removed, how quickly is it overrun with
                  things noxious, and how feeble becomes the growth of all things good and
                  beautiful! It is just so with the mind. Neglect it, and bad habits and evil
                  propensities will assuredly be quickened into being, and attain vigorous
                  life."</p>
               <p>"My children are not perfect, I know, but—"</p>
               <p>Mr. Arnold seemed slightly hurt. Agnes Green interrupted him, by saying, in a mild
                  voice, as she laid her hand gently upon his arm:</p>
               <p>"Do not give my words a meaning beyond what they are designed to convey. If I
                  assume the place of a mother to your children, I take upon myself all the
                  responsibilities that the word 'mother' involves. Is not this so?"</p>
               <p>"Thus I understand it."</p>
               <p>"My duty will be, not only to train these children for a happy and useful life
                  here, but for a happy and useful life hereafter."</p>
               <p>"It will."</p>
               <p>"It is no light thing, Mr. Arnold, to assume the place of a mother to children
                  who, for three years, have not known a mother's affectionate care. I confess that
                  my heart shrinks from the responsibility, and I ask myself over and over again,
                  'Have I the requisite wisdom, patience, and self-denial?'"</p>
               <p>"I believe you have," said Mr. Arnold, who was beginning to see more deeply into
                  the heart of<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC5621-00000011"/> Agnes. "And now," he added,
                  "tell me what you think of my children."</p>
               <p>"Mary has a quick temper, and is rather self-willed, if my observation is correct,
                  but she has a warm heart. Florence is thoughtless, and untidy in her person, but
                  possesses a happy temper. Poor Maggy's ill health has, very naturally, soured her
                  disposition. Ah, what can you expect of a suffering child, who has no mother? Your
                  little Willy is a lovely boy, somewhat spoiled—who can wonder at this?—but
                  possessing just the qualities to win for him kindness from every one."</p>
               <p>"I am sure you will love him," said Mr. Arnold, warmly.</p>
               <p>"I have no doubt on that subject," replied Agnes Green. "And now," she added,
                  "after what I have said, after showing you that I am quick to see faults, once
                  more give this matter earnest consideration. If I become your wife, and take the
                  place of a mother to these children, I shall, at once,—wisely and lovingly, I
                  trust,—begin the work of removing from their minds every noxious weed that neglect
                  may have suffered to grow there. The task will be no light one, and, in the
                  beginning, there may be rebellion against my authority. To be harsh or hard is not
                  in my nature. But a sense of duty will make me firm. Once more, I say, give this
                  matter serious consideration. It is not yet too late to pause."</p>
               <p>Mr. Arnold bent his head in deep reflection. For many minutes he sat in silent
                  self-communion, and sat thus so long, that the heart of Agnes Green began to beat
                  with a restricted motion, as if there was a heavy pressure on her bosom. At last
                  Mr. Arnold looked up, his eyes suddenly brightening, and his face flushing with
                  animation. Grasping her hands with both of his, he said:</p>
               <p>"I have reflected, Agnes, and I do not hesitate. Yes, I will trust these dear ones
                  to your loving guardianship. I will place in your hands their present and eternal
                  welfare, confident that you will be to them a true mother."</p>
               <p>And she was. As often as it could be done before the time appointed for the
                  marriage, she was brought in contact with the children. Almost from the beginning,
                  she was sorry to find in Mary, the oldest child, a reserve of manner, and an
                  evident dislike toward her, which she in vain sought to overcome. The groundwork
                  of this she did not know. It had its origin in a remark made by the housekeeper,
                  who, having learned from some gossipping relative of Mr. Arnold that a new wife
                  was soon to be brought home, and, also, who this new wife was to be, made an
                  imprudent allusion to the fact, in a moment of forgetfulness.</p>
               <p>"Your new mother will soon put you straight, my little lady," said she, one day,
                  to Mary, who had tried her beyond all patience.</p>
               <p>"My new mother! Who's she, pray?" was sharply demanded.</p>
               <p>"Miss Green," replied the unreflecting housekeeper. "Your father's going to bring
                  her home one of these days, and make her your mother, and she'll put you all
                  right—she'll take down your fine airs, my lady!"</p>
               <p>"Will she?" And Mary, compressing her lips<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC5621-00000012"
                  /> tightly, and drawing up her slender form to its full height, looked the image
                  of defiance.</p>
               <p>From that moment a strong dislike toward Miss Green ruled in the mind of Mary; and
                  she resolved, should the housekeeper's assertion prove true, not only to set the
                  new authority at defiance, but to inspire, if possible, the other children with
                  her own feelings.</p>
               <p>The marriage was celebrated at the house of Mr. Arnold, in the presence of his own
                  family and a few particular friends, Agnes arriving at the hour appointed.</p>
               <p>After the ceremony, the children were brought forward, and presented to their new
                  mother. The youngest, as if strongly drawn by invisible chords of affection,
                  sprung into her lap, and clasped his little arms lovingly about her neck. He
                  seemed very happy. The others were cold and distant, while Mary fixed her eyes
                  upon the wife of her father, with a look so full of dislike and rebellion, that no
                  one present was in any doubt as to how she regarded the new order of things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arnold was a good deal fretted by this unexpected conduct on the part of Mary;
                  and, forgetful of the occasion and its claims, spoke to her with some sternness.
                  He was recalled to self-possession by the smile of his wife, and her
                  gently-uttered remark, that reached only his own ear:</p>
               <p>"Don't seem to notice it. Let it be my task to overcome prejudices."</p>
               <p>During the evening Mary did not soften in the least toward her step-mother. On the
                  next morning, when all met, for the first time, at the breakfast table, the
                  children gazed askance at the calm, dignified fied woman who presided at the
                  table, and seemed ill at ease. On Mary's lip, and in her eye, was an expression so
                  like contempt, that it was with difficulty her father could refrain from ordering
                  her to her own room.</p>
               <p>The meal passed in some embarrassment. At its conclusion, Mr. Arnold went into the
                  parlour, and his wife, entering at once upon her duties, accompanied the children
                  to the nursery, to see for herself that the two oldest were properly dressed for
                  school. Mary, who had preceded the rest, was already in contention with the
                  housekeeper. Just as Mrs. Arnold—so we must now call her—entered the room, Mary
                  exclaimed, sharply:</p>
               <p>"I don't care what you say, I'm going to wear this bonnet!"</p>
               <p>"What's the trouble?" inquired Mrs. Arnold, calmly.</p>
               <p>"Why, you see, ma'am," replied the housekeeper, "Mary is bent on wearing her new,
                  pink bonnet to school, and I tell her she mustn't do it. Her old one is good
                  enough."</p>
               <p>"Let me see the old one," said Mrs. Arnold. She spoke in a very pleasant tone of
                  voice.</p>
               <p>A neat, straw bonnet, with plain, unsoiled trimming, was brought forth by the
                  housekeeper, who remarked:</p>
               <p>"It's good enough to wear Sundays, for that matter."</p>
               <p>"I don't care if it is, I'm not going to wear it today. So don't bother yourself
                  any more about it."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, Mary, you will," said Mrs. Arnold, very kindly, yet firmly.</p>
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC5621-00000013"/>
               <p>"No, I won't!" was the quick, resolute answer. And she gazed, unflinchingly, into
                  the face of her step-mother.</p>
               <p>"I'll call your father, my young lady! This is beyond all endurance!" said the
                  housekeeper, starting for the door.</p>
               <p>"Hannah!" The mild, even voice of Mrs. Arnold checked the excited housekeeper.
                  "Don't speak of it to her father,—I'm sure she doesn't mean what she says. She'll
                  think better of it in a moment."</p>
               <p>Mary was hardly prepared for this. Even while she stood with unchanged exterior,
                  she felt grateful to her step-mother for intercepting the complaint about to be
                  made to her father. She expected some remark or remonstrance from Mrs. Arnold. But
                  in this she was mistaken. The latter, as if nothing unpleasant had occurred,
                  turned to Florence, and after a light examination of her dress, said to the
                  housekeeper:</p>
               <p>"This collar is too much soiled; won't you bring me another?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, it's clean enough," replied Florence, knitting her brows, and affecting
                  impatience. But, even as she spoke, the quick, yet gentle hands of her step-mother
                  had removed the collar from her neck.</p>
               <p>"Do you think it clean enough now?" said she, as she placed the soiled collar
                  beside a fresh one, which the housekeeper had brought.</p>
               <p>"It <emph>is</emph> rather dirty," replied Florence, smiling.</p>
               <p>And now Mrs. Arnold examined other articles of her dress, and had them changed,
                  re-arranged her hair, and saw that her teeth were properly brushed. While this was
                  progressing, Mary stood a little apart, a close observer of all that passed. One
                  thing she did not fail to remark, and that was the gentle firmness of her
                  step-mother, which was in strong contrast with the usual scolding, jerking, and
                  impatience of the housekeeper, as manifested on these occasions.</p>
               <p>By the time Florence was ready for school, Mary's state of mind had undergone
                  considerable change, and she half regretted the exhibition of ill temper and
                  insulting disobedience she had shown. Yet was she in no way prepared to yield. To
                  her surprise, after Florence was all ready, her step-mother turned to her and
                  said, in a mild, cheerful voice, as if nothing unpleasant had occurred,</p>
               <p>"Have you a particular reason for wishing to wear your new bonnet, this morning,
                  Mary?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, ma'am, I have." The voice of Mary was changed considerably, and her eyes
                  fell beneath the mild, but penetrating, gaze of her step-mother.</p>
               <p>"May I ask you the reason?"</p>
               <p>There was a pause of some moments; then Mary replied:</p>
               <p>"I promised one of the girls that I'd wear it. She asked me to. She wanted to see
                  it."</p>
               <p>"Did you tell Hannah this?"</p>
               <p>"No, ma'am. It wouldn't have been any use. She never hears to reason."</p>
               <p>"But you'll find me very different, Mary," said Mrs. Arnold, tenderly. "I shall
                  ever be ready to hear reason."</p>
               <p>All this was so far from what Mary had anticipated, that her mind was half
                  bewildered. Her step-mother's clear sight penetrated to her very thoughts.<pb
                     n="26-27" xml:id="VAC5621-00000014"/> Taking her hand, she drew her gently to
                  her side. An arm was then placed lovingly around her.</p>
               <p>"My dear child,"—it would have been a hard heart, indeed, that could have resisted
                  the influence of that voice, "let us understand each other in the beginning. You
                  seem to look upon me as an enemy, and yet I wish to be the very best friend you
                  have in the world. I have come here, not as an exacting and overbearing tyrant,
                  but to seek your good and promote your happiness in every possible way. I will
                  love you; and may I not expect love in return? Surely you will not withhold
                  that."</p>
               <p>As Mrs. Arnold spoke thus, she felt a slight quiver in the hand she had taken in
                  her own. She continued:</p>
               <p>"I cannot hope to fill the place of your dear mother, now in heaven. Yet even as
                  she loved you, would I love you, my child." The voice of Mrs. Arnold had become
                  unsteady, through excess of feeling. "As she bore with your faults, I will bear
                  with them; as she rejoiced over every good affection born in your heart, so will I
                  rejoice."</p>
               <p>Outraged by the conduct of Mary, the housekeeper had gone to Mr. Arnold, whom she
                  found in the parlour, and repeated to him, with a colouring of her own, the
                  insolent language his child had used. The father hurried up stairs in a state of
                  angry excitement. No little surprised was he, on entering the nursery, to see Mary
                  sobbing on the breast of her step-mother, whose gentle hands were softly pressed
                  upon the child's temples, and whose low, soothing voice was speaking to her words
                  of comfort for the present, and cheerful hope for the future. Unobserved by
                  either, Mr. Arnold stood for a moment, and then softly retired, with a gush of
                  thankfulness in his heart, that he had found for his children so true and good a
                  mother.</p>
               <p>With Mary there was no more trouble. From that hour, she came wholly under the
                  influence of her step-mother, learning day by day, as she knew her better, to love
                  her with a more confiding tenderness. Wonderful was the change produced on the
                  children of Mr. Arnold in a single year. They had, indeed, found a mother.</p>
               <p>It is painful to think how different would have been the result, had the
                  step-mother not been a true woman. Wise and good she was in her sphere; loving and
                  unselfish; and the fruit of her hand was sweet to the taste, and beautiful to look
                  upon.</p>
               <p>How few are like her! How few who assume the position of step-mother,—a position
                  requiring patience, long-suffering, and unflinching self-denial,—are fitted for
                  the duties they so lightly take upon themselves! Is it any wonder their own lives
                  are made, at times, miserable, or that they mar, by passion or exacting tyranny,
                  the fair face of humanity, in the children committed to their care? Such lose
                  their reward.</p>

               <head>POWER OF KINDNESS.</head>
               <p>"TOM! Here!" said a father to his boy, speaking in tones of authority.</p>
               <p>The lad was at play. He looked toward his father, but did not leave his
                  companions.</p>
               <p>"Do you hear me, sir?" spoke the father, more sternly than at first.</p>
               <p>With an unhappy face and reluctant step, the boy left his play and approached his
                  parent.</p>
               <p>"Why do you creep along at a snail's pace?" said the latter, angrily. "Come
                  quickly, I want you. When I speak, I look to be obeyed instantly. Here, take this
                  note to Mr. Smith, and see that you don't go to sleep by the way. Now run as fast
                  as you can go."</p>
               <p>The boy took the note. There was a cloud upon his brow. He moved away, but at a
                  slow pace.</p>
               <p>"You, Tom! Is that doing as I ordered? Is that going quickly?" called the father,
                  when he saw the boy creeping away. "If you are not back in half an hour, I will
                  punish you."</p>
               <p>But the words had but little effect. The boy's feelings were hurt by the
                  unkindness of the parent. He experienced a sense of injustice; a consciousness
                  that wrong had been done him. By nature he was like his father, proud and
                  stubborn; and these qualities of his mind were aroused, and he indulged in them,
                  fearless of consequences.</p>
               <p>"I never saw such a boy," said the father, speaking to a friend who had observed
                  the occurrence. "My words scarcely make an impression on him."</p>
               <p>"Kind words often prove most powerful," said the friend. The father looked
                  surprised.</p>
               <p>"Kind words," continued the friend, "are like the gentle rain and the refreshing
                  dews; but harsh words bend and break like the angry tempest. The first develop and
                  strengthen good affections, while the others sweep over the heart in devastation,
                  and mar and deform all they touch. Try him with kind words; they will prove a
                  hundred fold more powerful."</p>
               <p>The latter seemed hurt by the reproof; but it left him thoughtful. An hour passed
                  away ere his boy returned. At times during his absence he was angry at the delay,
                  and meditated the infliction of punishment. But the words of remonstrance were in
                  his ears, and he resolved to obey them. At last the lad came slowly in with a
                  cloudy countenance, and reported the result of his errand. Having stayed far
                  beyond his time, he looked for punishment, and was prepared to receive it with an
                  angry defiance. To his surprise, after delivering the message he had brought, his
                  father, instead of angry reproof and punishment, said kindly, "Very well, my son;
                  you can go out to play again."</p>
               <p>The boy went out, but was not happy. He had disobeyed and disobliged his father,
                  and the thought of this troubled him. Harsh words had not clouded<pb n="30-31"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000016"/> his mind nor aroused a spirit of reckless anger.
                  Instead of joining his companions, he went and sat down by himself, grieving over
                  his act of disobedience. As he thus sat, he heard his name called. He
                  listened.</p>
               <p>"Thomas, my son," said his father, kindly. The boy sprang to his feet, and was
                  almost instantly beside his parent.</p>
               <p>"Did you call, father?"</p>
               <p>"I did, my son. Will you take this package to Mr. Long for me?"</p>
               <p>There was no hesitation in the boy's manner. He looked pleased at the thought of
                  doing his father a service, and reached out his hand for the package. On receiving
                  it, he bounded away with a light step.</p>
               <p>"There is a power in kindness," said the father, as he sat musing, after the lad's
                  departure. And even while he sat musing over the incident, the boy came back with
                  a cheerful, happy face, and said—</p>
               <p>"Can I do any thing else for you, father?"</p>
               <p>Yes, there is the power of kindness. The tempest of passion can only subdue,
                  constrain, and break; but in love and gentleness there is the power of the summer
                  rain, the dew, and the sunshine.</p>

               <head>BEAR AND FORBEAR.</head>
               <p>"DON'T talk to me in such a serious strain, Aunt Hannah. One would really think,
                  from what you say, that James and I would quarrel before we were married a
                  month."</p>
               <p>"Not so soon as that, Maggy dear. Heaven grant that it may not come so soon as
                  that! But, depend upon it, child, if you do not make 'bear and forbear' your
                  motto, many months will not have passed, after your wedding-day, without the
                  occurrence of some serious misunderstanding between you and your husband."</p>
               <p>"If anybody else were to say that to me, Aunt Hannah, I would be very angry."</p>
               <p>"For which you would be a very foolish girl. But it is generally the way that good
                  advice is taken, it being an article of which none think they stand in need."</p>
               <p>"But what in the world can there be for James and I to have differences about? I
                  am sure that I love him most truly; and I am sure he loves me as fondly as I love
                  him. In mutual love there can be no strife—no emulation, except in the performance
                  of good offices. Indeed, aunt, I think you are far too serious."</p>
               <p>"Over the bright sky bending above you, my dear niece, I would not, for the world,
                  bring a cloud<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC5621-00000017"/> even as light as the filmy,
                  almost viewless gossamer. But I know that clouds must hide its clear, calm,
                  passionless blue, either earlier or later in life. And what I say now, is with the
                  hope of giving you the prescience required to avoid some of the storms that may
                  threaten to break upon your head."</p>
               <p>"Neither cloud nor storm will ever come from that quarter of the sky from which
                  you seem to apprehend danger."</p>
               <p>"Not if both you and James learn to bear and forbear in your conduct toward each
                  other."</p>
               <p>"We cannot act otherwise."</p>
               <p>"Then there will be no danger."</p>
               <p>Margaret Percival expressed herself sincerely. She could not believe that there
                  was the slightest danger of a misunderstanding ever occurring between her and
                  James Canning, to whom she was shortly to be married. The well-meant warning of
                  her aunt, who had seen and felt more in life than she yet had, went therefore for
                  nothing.</p>
               <p>A month elapsed, and the young and lovely Maggy pledged her faith at the altar. As
                  the bride of Canning, she felt that she was the happiest creature in the world.
                  Before her was a path winding amid green and flowery places, and lingering by the
                  side of still waters; while a sunny sky bent over all.</p>
               <p>James Canning was a young lawyer of some talent, and the possessor of a good
                  income independent of his profession. Like others, he had his excellencies and his
                  defects of character. Naturally, he was of a proud, impatient spirit, and, from a
                  child, had been restless under dictation. As an offset to this, he was a man of
                  strict integrity, generous in his feelings, and possessed of a warm heart. Aunt
                  Hannah had known him since he was a boy, and understood his character thoroughly;
                  and it was this knowledge that caused her to feel some concern for the future
                  happiness of her niece, as well as to speak to her timely words of caution. But
                  these words were not understood.</p>
               <p>"We've not quarrelled yet, Aunt Hannah, for all your fears," said the young wife,
                  three or four months after her marriage.</p>
               <p>"For which I am truly thankful," replied Aunt Hannah. "Still, I would say now, as
                  I did before, 'Bear and forbear.'"</p>
               <p>"That is, I must BEAR every thing and FORBEAR in every thing. I hardly think that
                  just, aunt. I should say that James ought to do a little of this as well as
                  me."</p>
               <p>"Yes, it is his duty as well as yours. But you should not think of his duty to
                  you, Maggy, only of your duty to him. That is the most dangerous error into which
                  you can fall, and one that will be almost certain to produce unhappiness."</p>
               <p>"Would you have a wife never think of herself?"</p>
               <p>"The less she thinks of herself, perhaps, the better; for the more she thinks of
                  herself, the more she will love herself. But the more she thinks of her husband,
                  the more she will love him and seek to make him happy. The natural result of this
                  will be, that her husband will feel the warmth and perceive the unselfishness of
                  her love; this will cause him to lean toward her with still greater tenderness,<pb
                     n="34-35" xml:id="VAC5621-00000018"/> and prompt him to yield to her what
                  otherwise he might have claimed for himself."</p>
               <p>"Then it is the wife who must act the generous, self-sacrificing part?"</p>
               <p>"If I could speak as freely to James as I can speak to you, Maggy, I should not
                  fail to point out his duty of bearing and forbearing, as plainly as I point out
                  yours. All should be mutual, of course. But this can never be, if one waits for
                  the other. If you see your duty, it is for you to do it, even if he should fail in
                  his part."</p>
               <p>"I don't know about that, aunt. I think, as you said just now, that all this is
                  mutual."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry you cannot or will not understand me, Maggy," replied Aunt Hannah.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry too, aunt; but I certainly do not. However, don't, pray, give yourself
                  any serious concern about James and me. I assure you that we are getting along
                  exceedingly well; and why this should not continue is more than I can make
                  out."</p>
               <p>"Well, dear, I trust that it may. There is no good reason why it should not. You
                  both have virtues enough to counterbalance all defects of character."</p>
               <p>On the evening of that very day, as the young couple sat at the tea-table, James
                  Canning said, as his wife felt, rather unkindly, at the same time that there was a
                  slight contraction of his brow—</p>
               <p>"You seem to be very much afraid of your sugar, Maggy. I never get a cup of tea or
                  coffee sweet enough for my taste."</p>
               <p>"You must have a sweet palate. I am sure it is like syrup, for I put in several
                  large lumps of sugar," replied Margaret, speaking in a slightly offended tone.</p>
               <p>"Taste it, will you?" said Canning, pushing his cup across the table with an
                  impatient air.</p>
               <p>Margaret sipped a little from the spoon, and then, with an expression of disgust
                  in her face, said—</p>
               <p>"Pah! I'd as lief drink so much molasses. But here's the sugar bowl. Sweeten it to
                  your taste."</p>
               <p>Canning helped himself to more sugar. As he did so his wife noticed that his hand
                  slightly trembled, and also that his brow was drawn down, and his lips more arched
                  than usual.</p>
               <p>"It's a little matter to get angry about," she thought to herself. "Things are
                  coming to a pretty pass, if I'm not to be allowed to speak."</p>
               <p>The meal was finished in silence. Margaret felt in no humour to break the
                  oppressive reserve, although she would have been glad, indeed, to have heard a
                  pleasant word from the lips of her husband. As for Canning, he permitted himself
                  to brood over the words and manner of his wife, until he became exceedingly
                  fretted. They were so unkind and so uncalled for. The evening passed unsocially.
                  But morning found them both in a better state of mind. Sleep has a wonderful power
                  in restoring to the mind its lost balance, and in calming down our blinding
                  passions. During the day, our thoughts and feelings, according with our natural
                  state, are more or less marked by the disturbances that selfish purposes ever
                  bring; but in sleep, while the mind rests and our governing ends lie dormant, we
                  come into purer spiritual associations, and the soul, as well as the body,
                  receives a healthier tone.</p>
               <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC5621-00000019"/>
               <p>The morning, therefore, found Canning and his wife in better states of mind. They
                  were as kind and as affectionate as usual in their words and conduct, although,
                  when they sat down to the breakfast table, they each experienced a slight feeling
                  of coldness on being reminded, too sensibly, of the unpleasant occurrence of the
                  previous evening. Margaret thought she would be sure to please her husband in his
                  coffee, and therefore put into his cup an extra quantity of sugar, making it so
                  very sweet that he could with difficulty swallow it. But a too vivid recollection
                  of what had taken place on the night before, caused him to be silent about it. The
                  second cup was still sweeter. Canning managed to sip about one-third of this, but
                  his stomach refused to take any more. Noticing that her husband's coffee, an
                  article of which he was very fond, stood, nearly cup-full, beside his plate, after
                  he had finished his breakfast, Margaret said—</p>
               <p>"Didn't your coffee suit you?"</p>
               <p>"It was very good; only a little too sweet."</p>
               <p>"Then why didn't you say so?" she returned, in a tone that showed her to be hurt
                  at this reaction upon what she had said on the previous evening. "Give me your
                  cup, and let me pour you out some more."</p>
               <p>"No, I thank you, Margaret, I don't care about any more."</p>
               <p>"Yes, you do. Come, give me your cup. I shall be hurt if you don't. I'm sure there
                  is no necessity for drinking the coffee, if not to your taste. I don't know what's
                  come over you, James."</p>
               <p>"And I'm sure I don't know what's come over you," Canning thought, but did not
                  say. He handed up his cup, as his wife desired. After filling it with coffee, she
                  handed it back, and then reached him the sugar and cream.</p>
               <p>"Sweeten it to your own taste," she said, a little fretfully; "I'm sure I tried to
                  make it right."</p>
               <p>Canning did as he was desired, and then drank the coffee, but it was with the
                  utmost difficulty that he could do so.</p>
               <p>This was the first little cloud that darkened the sky of their wedded life; And it
                  did not fairly pass away for nearly a week. Nor then did the days seem as bright
                  as before. The cause was slight—very slight—but how small a thing will sometimes
                  make the heart unhappy. How trifling are the occurrences upon which we often lay,
                  as upon a foundation, a superstructure of misery! Had the earnestly urged precept
                  of Aunt Hannah been regarded, —had the lesson—"Bear and Forbear," been well
                  learned and understood by Margaret, this cloud had never dimmed the sun of their
                  early love. A pleasant word, in answer to her husband's momentary impatience,
                  would have made him sensible that he had not spoken with propriety, and caused him
                  to be more careful in future. As it was, both were more circumspect, but it was
                  from pride instead of love, —and more to protect self than from a tender regard
                  for each other.</p>
               <p>Only a month or two passed before there was another slight collision. It made them
                  both more unhappy than they were before. But the breach was quickly healed. Still
                  scars remained, and there were times when the blood flowed into these
                     cicatrices<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC5621-00000020"/> trices so feverishly as to
                  cause pain. Alas! wounds of the spirit do not close any more perfectly than do
                  wounds of the body—the scars remain forever.</p>
               <p>And thus the weeks and months went by. Neither of the married partners had learned
                  the true secret of happiness in their holy relation,—neither of them felt the
                  absolute necessity of bearing and forbearing. Little inequalities of character,
                  instead of being smoothed off by gentle contact, were suffered to strike against
                  each other, and produce, sometimes, deep and painful wounds—healing, too often,
                  imperfectly; and too often remaining as festering sores.</p>
               <p>And yet Canning and his wife loved each other tenderly, and felt, most of their
                  time, that they were very happy. There were little things in each that each wished
                  the other would correct, but neither felt the necessity of self-correction.</p>
               <p>The birth of a child drew them together at a time when there was some danger of a
                  serious rupture. Dear little Lilian, or "Lilly," as she was called, was a chord of
                  love to bind them in a closer union.</p>
               <p>"I love you more than ever, Maggy," Canning could not help saying to his wife, as
                  he kissed first her lips and then the soft cheek of his child, a month after the
                  babe was born.</p>
               <p>"And I am sure I love you better than I did, if that were possible," returned
                  Margaret, looking into her husband's face with a glance of deep affection.</p>
               <p>As the babe grew older the parent's love for it continued to increase, and, with
                  this increase, their happiness. The chord which had several times jarred harshly
                  between them, slept in profound peace.</p>
               <p>But, after this sweet calm, the surface of their feelings became again ruffled.
                  One little incongruity of character after another showed itself in both, and there
                  was no genuine spirit of forbearance in either of them to meet and neutralize any
                  sudden effervescence of the mind. Lilly was not a year old, before they had a
                  serious misunderstanding that made them both unhappy for weeks. It had its origin
                  in a mere trifle, as such things usually have. They had been taking tea and
                  spending an evening with a friend, a widow lady, for whom Mrs. Canning had a
                  particular friendship. As there was no gentleman present during the evening, the
                  time passed rather heavily to Canning, who could not get interested in the
                  conversation of the two ladies. Toward nine o'clock he began to feel restless and
                  impatient, and to wonder if his wife would not soon be thinking about going home.
                  But the time passed wearily until ten o'clock, and still the conversation between
                  the two ladies was continued with undiminished interest, and, to all appearance,
                  was likely to continue until midnight.</p>
               <p>Canning at length became so restless and wearied that he said, thinking that his
                  wife did not probably know how late it was,—</p>
               <p>"Come, Margaret, isn't it 'most time to go home?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Canning merely looked into her husband's face, but made no answer.</p>
               <p>More earnestly than ever the ladies now appeared to enter upon the various themes
                  for conversation that presented themselves, all of which were very<pb n="40-41"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000021"/> frivolous to the mind of Canning, who was
                  exceedingly chafed by his wife's indifference to his suggestion about going home.
                  He determined, however, to say no more if she sat all night. Toward eleven o'clock
                  she made a movement to depart, and after lingering in the parlor before she went
                  up stairs to put on her things, and in the chamber after her things were on, and
                  on the stairs, in the passage, and at the door, she finally took the arm of her
                  husband and started for home. Not a word was uttered by either until they had
                  walked the distance of two squares, when Margaret, unable to keep back what she
                  wanted to say any longer, spoke thus,—</p>
               <p>"James, I will thank you, another time, when we are spending an evening out, not
                  to suggest as publicly as you did to-night that it is time to go home. It's very
                  bad manners, let me tell you, in the first place; and in the second place, I don't
                  like it at all. I do not wish people to think that I have to come and go just at
                  your beck or nod. I was about starting when you spoke to me, but sat an hour
                  longer just on purpose."</p>
               <p>The mind of Canning, already fretted, was set on fire by this.</p>
               <p>"You did?" he said.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I did. And I can tell you, once for all, that I wish this to be the last
                  time you speak to me as you did to-night."</p>
               <p>It was as much as the impatient spirit of Canning could do to keep from
                  replying—</p>
               <p>"It's the last time I will ever speak to you at all," and then leaving her in the
                  street, with the intention of never seeing her again. But suddenly he thought of
                  Lilly, and the presence of the child in his mind kept back the mad words from his
                  lips. Not one syllable did he utter during their walk home, although his wife said
                  much to irritate rather than soothe him. Nor did a sentence pass his lips that
                  night.</p>
               <p>At the breakfast table on the next morning, the husband and wife were coldly
                  polite to each other. When the meal was completed, Canning retired to his office,
                  and his wife sought her chamber to weep. The latter half repented of what she had
                  done, but her contrition was not hearty enough to prompt to a confession of her
                  fault. The fact that she considered her husband to blame, stood in the way of
                  this.</p>
               <p>Reserve and coldness marked the intercourse of the unhappy couple for several
                  weeks; and then the clouds began to break, and there were occasional glimpses of
                  sunshine.</p>
               <p>But, before there was a clear sky, some trifling occurrence put them again at
                  variance. From this time, unhappily, one circumstance after another transpired to
                  fret them with each other, and to separate, rather than unite them. Daily, Canning
                  grew more cold and reserved, and his wife met him in a like uncompromising spirit.
                  Even their lovely child—their darling blue-eyed Lilly—with her sweet little voice
                  and smiling face, could not soften their hearts toward each other.</p>
               <p>To add fuel to this rapidly enkindling fire of discord, was the fact that Mrs.
                  Canning was on particularly intimate terms with the wife of a man toward whom her
                  husband entertained a settled and well-grounded dislike, and visited her more
                     frequently<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5621-00000022"/> than she did any one of her
                  friends. He did not interfere with her in the matter, but it annoyed him to hear
                  her speak, occasionally, of meeting Mr. Richards at his house, and repeating the
                  polite language he used to her, when he detested the character of Richards, and
                  had not spoken to him for more than a year.</p>
               <p>One day Mrs. Canning expressed a wish to go in the evening to a party.</p>
               <p>"It will be impossible for me to go to-night, or, indeed, this week," Canning
                  said. "I am engaged in a very important case, which will come up for trial on
                  Friday, and it will take all my time properly to prepare for it. I shall be
                  engaged every evening, and perhaps late every night."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Canning looked disappointed, and said she thought he might spare her one
                  evening.</p>
               <p>"You know I would do so, Margaret, with pleasure," he replied, "but the case is
                  one involving too much to be endangered by any consideration. Next week we will go
                  to a party."</p>
               <p>When Canning came home to tea, he found his wife dressed to go out.</p>
               <p>"I'm going to the party, for all you can't go with me," said she.</p>
               <p>"Indeed! With whom are you going?"</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Richards came in to see me after dinner, when I told her how much
                  disappointed I was about not being able to go to the party to-night. She said that
                  she and her husband were going, and that it would give them great pleasure to call
                  for me. Am I not fortunate?"</p>
               <p>"But you are not going with Mr. and Mrs. Richards?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed I am! Why not?"</p>
               <p>"Margaret! You must not go."</p>
               <p>"Must not, indeed! You speak in quite a tone of authority, Mr. Canning;" and the
                  wife drew herself up haughtily.</p>
               <p>"Authority, or no authority, Margaret"—Canning now spoke calmly, but his lips were
                  pale—"I will never consent that my wife shall be seen in a public assembly with
                  Richards. You know my opinion of the man."</p>
               <p>"I know you are prejudiced against him, though I believe unjustly."</p>
               <p>"Madness!" exclaimed Canning, thrown off his guard. "And this from you?"</p>
               <p>"I don't see that you have any cause for getting into a passion, Mr. Canning,"
                  said his wife, with provoking coolness. "And, I must say, that you interfere with
                  my freedom rather more than a husband has any right to do. But, to cut this matter
                  short, let me tell you, once for all, that I am going to the assembly to-night
                  with Mr. and Mrs. Richards. Having promised to do so, I mean to keep my
                  promise."</p>
               <p>"Margaret, I positively forbid your going!" said Canning, in much excitement.</p>
               <p>"I deny your right to command me! In consenting to become your wife, I did not
                  make myself your slave; although it is clear from this, and other things that have
                  occurred since our marriage, that you consider me as occupying that position."</p>
               <p>"Then it is your intention to go with this man?"<pb n="44-45"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000023"/> said Canning, again speaking in a calm but deep
                  voice.</p>
               <p>"Certainly it is."</p>
               <p>"Very well. I will not make any threat of what I will do, Margaret. But this I can
                  assure you, that lightly as you may think of this matter, if persevered in, it
                  will cause you more sorrow than you have ever known. Go! Go against my
                  wish—against my command, if you will have it so—and when you feel the consequence,
                  lay the blame upon no one but yourself. And now let me say to you, Margaret, that
                  your conduct as a wife has tended rather to estrange your husband's heart from you
                  than to win his love. I say this now, because I may not have—"</p>
               <p>"James! It is folly for you to talk to me after that fashion," exclaimed Margaret,
                  breaking in upon him. "I—"</p>
               <p>But before she could finish the sentence, Canning had left the room, closing the
                  door hard after him.</p>
               <p>Just an hour from this time, Mr. and Mrs. Richards called in their carriage for
                  Mrs. Canning, who went with them to the assembly. An hour was a long period for
                  reflection, and ought to have afforded sufficient time for the wife of Canning to
                  come to a wiser determination than that from which she acted.</p>
               <p>Not half a dozen revolutions of the carriage wheels had been made, however, before
                  Margaret repented of what she had done. But it was now too late. The pleasure of
                  the entertainment passed before her, but it found no response in her breast. She
                  saw little but the pale, compressed lip and knit brow of her husband, and heard
                  little but his word of disapproval proval. Oh! how she did long for the confused
                  pageant that was moving before her, and the discordant mingling of voices and
                  instruments, to pass away, that she might return and tell him that she repented of
                  all that she had done.</p>
               <p>At last the assembly broke up, and she was free to go back again to the home that
                  had not, alas! proved as pleasant a spot to her as her imagination had once
                  pictured it.</p>
               <p>"And that it has not been so," she murmured to herself, "he has not been all to
                  blame."</p>
               <p>On being left at the door, Mrs. Canning rang the bell impatiently. As soon as
                  admitted, she flew up stairs to meet her husband, intending to confess her error,
                  and beg him earnestly to forgive her for having acted so directly in opposition to
                  his wishes. But she did not find him in the chamber. Throwing off her bonnet and
                  shawl, she went down into the parlours, but found all dark there.</p>
               <p>"Where is Mr. Canning?" she asked of a servant.</p>
               <p>"He went away about ten o'clock, and has not returned yet," was replied.</p>
               <p>This intelligence caused Mrs. Canning to lean hard on the stair-railing for
                  support. She felt in an instant weak almost as an infant.</p>
               <p>Without further question, she went back to her chamber, and looked about fearfully
                  on bureaus and tables for a letter addressed to her in her husband's handwriting.
                  But nothing of this met her eye. Then she sat down to await her husband's return.
                  But she waited long. Daylight found her an anxious watcher; he was still away.</p>
               <p>The anguish of mind experienced during that unhappy<pb n="46-47"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000024"/> happy night, it would be vain for us to attempt to
                  picture. In the morning, on descending to the parlour, she found on one of the
                  pier-tables a letter bearing her name. She broke the seal tremblingly. It did not
                  contain many words, but they fell upon her heart with an icy coldness. <q>

                              <p>"MARGARET: Your conduct to-night has decided me to separate myself
                                 from a woman who I feel neither truly loves nor respects me. The
                                 issue which I have for some time dreaded has come. It is better for
                                 us to part than to live in open discord. I shall arrange every
                                 thing for your comfortable support, and then leave the city,
                                 perhaps for ever. You need not tell our child that her father
                                 lives. I would rather she would think him dead than at variance
                                 with her mother.</p>

               </p>
               <p>These were the words. Their effect was paralyzing. Mrs. Canning had presence of
                  mind enough to crush the fatal letter into her bosom, and strength enough to take
                  her back to her chamber. When there, she sunk powerless upon her bed, and remained
                  throughout the day too weak in both body and mind to rise or think. She could do
                  little else but feel.</p>
               <p>Five years from the day of that unhappy separation, we find Mrs. Canning in the
                  unobtrusive home of Aunt Hannah, who took the almost heart-broken wife into the
                  bosom of her own family, after the passage of nearly a year had made her almost
                  hopeless of ever seeing him again. No one knew where he was. Only once did
                  Margaret hear from him, and that was on the third day after he had parted from
                  her, when he appeared in the court-room, and made a most powerful argument in
                  favour of the client whose important case had prevented his going with his wife to
                  the assembly. After that he disappeared, and no one could tell aught of him. A
                  liberal annuity had been settled upon his wife, and the necessary papers to enable
                  her to claim it transmitted to her under a blank envelope.</p>
               <p>Five years had changed Margaret sadly. The high-spirited, blooming, happy woman,
                  was now a meek, quiet, pale-faced sufferer. Lilly had grown finely, all
                  unconscious of her mother's suffering, and was a very beautiful child. She
                  attracted the notice of everyone.</p>
               <p>"Aunt Hannah," said Margaret, one day after this long, long period of suffering,
                  "I have what you will call a strange idea in my mind. It has been visiting me for
                  weeks, and now I feel much inclined to act from its dictates. You know that Mr.
                  and Mrs. Edwards are going to Paris next month. Ever since Mrs. Edwards mentioned
                  it to me, I have felt a desire to go with them. I don't know why, but so it is. I
                  think it would do me good to go to Paris and spend a few months there. When a
                  young girl, I always had a great desire to see London and Paris; and this desire
                  is again in my mind."</p>
               <p>"I would go, then," said Aunt Hannah, who thought favourably of any thing likely
                  to divert the mind of her niece from the brooding melancholy in which it was
                  shrouded.</p>
               <p>To Paris Mrs. Canning went, accompanied by her little daughter, who was the
                  favourite of every one<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC5621-00000025"/> on board the
                  steamer in which they sailed. In this gray city, however, she did not attain as
                  much relief of mind as she had anticipated. She found it almost impossible to take
                  interest in any thing, and soon began to long for the time to come when she could
                  go back to the home and heart of her good Aunt Hannah. The greatest pleasure she
                  took was in going with Lilly to the Gardens of the Tuileries, and amid the crowd
                  there to feel alone with nature in some of her most beautiful aspects. Lilly was
                  always delighted to get there, and never failed to bring something in her pocket
                  for the pure white swans that floated so gracefully in the marble basin into which
                  the water dashed cool and sparkling from beautiful fountains.</p>
               <p>One day, while the child was playing at a short distance from her mother, a man
                  seated beside a bronze statue, over which drooped a large orange tree, fixed his
                  eyes upon her admiringly, as hundreds of others had done. Presently she came up
                  and stood close to him, looking up into the face of the statue. The man said
                  something to her in French, but Lilly only smiled and shook her head.</p>
               <p>"What is your name, dear?" he then said in English.</p>
               <p>"Lilly," replied the child.</p>
               <p>A quick change passed over the man's face. With much more interest in his voice,
                  he said—</p>
               <p>"Where do you live? In London?"</p>
               <p>"Oh no, sir; I live in America."</p>
               <p>"What is your name besides Lilly?"</p>
               <p>"Lilly Canning, sir."</p>
               <p>The man now became strongly agitated. But he contended vigorously with his
                  feelings.</p>
               <p>"Where is your mother, dear?" he asked, taking her hand as he spoke, and gently
                  pressing it between his own.</p>
               <p>"She is here, sir," returned Lilly, looking inquiringly into the man's face.</p>
               <p>"Here!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir. We come here every day."</p>
               <p>"Where is your mother now?"</p>
               <p>"Just on the other side of the fountain. You can't see her for the lime-tree."</p>
               <p>"Is your father here, also?" continued the man.</p>
               <p>"No, I don't know where my father is." "Is he dead?" "No, sir; mother says he is
                  not dead, and that she hopes he will come home soon. Oh! I wish he would come
                  home. We would all love him so!"</p>
               <p>The man rose up quickly, and turning from the child, walked hurriedly away. Lilly
                  looked after him for a moment or two, and then ran back to her mother.</p>
               <p>On the next day Lilly saw the same man sitting under the bronze statue. He
                  beckoned to her, and she went to him.</p>
               <p>"How long have you been in Paris, dear?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"A good many weeks," she replied.</p>
               <p>"Are you going to stay much longer?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know. But mother wants to go home."</p>
               <p>"Do you like to live in Paris?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir. I would rather live at home with mother and Aunt Hannah."</p>
               <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC5621-00000026"/>
               <p>"You live with Aunt Hannah, then?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir. Do you know Aunt Hannah?" and the child looked up wonderingly into the
                  man's face.</p>
               <p>"I used to know her," he replied.</p>
               <p>Just then Lilly heard her mother calling her, and she started and ran away in the
                  direction from which the voice came. The man's face grew slightly pale, and he was
                  evidently much agitated. As he had done on the evening previous, he rose up
                  hastily and walked away. But in a short time he returned, and appeared to be
                  carefully looking about for some one. At length he caught sight of Lilly's mother.
                  She was sitting with her eyes upon the ground, the child leaning upon her, and
                  looking into her face, which he saw was thin and pale, and overspread with a hue
                  of sadness. Only for a few moments did he thus gaze upon her, and then he turned
                  and walked hurriedly from the garden.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Canning sat alone with her child that evening, in the handsomely-furnished
                  apartments she had hired on arriving in Paris.</p>
               <p>"He told you that he knew Aunt Hannah?" she said, rousing up from a state of deep
                  thought.</p>
               <p>"Yes, ma. He said he used to know her."</p>
               <p>"I wonder"—</p>
               <p>A servant opened the door, and said that a gentleman wished to see Mrs.
                  Canning.</p>
               <p>"Tell him to walk in," the mother of Lilly had just power to say. In breathless
                  suspense she waited for the space of a few seconds, when the man who had spoken to
                  Lilly in the Gardens of the Tuileries entered and closed the door after him. Mrs.
                  Canning raised her eyes to his face. It was her husband! She did not cry out nor
                  spring forward. She had not the power to do either.</p>
               <p>"That's him now, mother!" exclaimed Lilly.</p>
               <p>"It's your father!" said Mrs. Canning, in a deeply breathed whisper.</p>
               <p>The child sprung toward him with a quick bound and was instantly clasped in his
                  arms.</p>
               <p>"Lilly, dear Lilly!" he sobbed, pressing his lips upon her brow and cheeks. "Yes!
                  I am your father!"</p>
               <p>The wife and mother sat motionless and tearless with her eyes fixed upon the face
                  of her husband. After a few passionate embraces, Canning drew the child's arms
                  from about his neck, and setting her down upon the floor, advanced slowly toward
                  his wife. Her eyes were still tearless, but large drops were rolling over his
                  face.</p>
               <p>"Margaret!" he said, uttering her name with great tenderness.</p>
               <p>He was by her side in time to receive her upon his bosom, as she sunk forward in a
                  wild passion of tears.</p>
               <p>All was reconciled. The desolate hearts were again peopled with living affections.
                  The arid waste smiled in greenness and beauty.</p>
               <p>In their old home, bound by threefold cords of love, they now think only of the
                  past as a severe lesson by which they have been taught the heavenly virtue of
                  forbearance. Five years of intense suffering changed them both, and left marks
                  that after years can never efface. But selfish impatience and pride were all
                  subdued, and their hearts melted into<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC5621-00000027"/>
                  each other, until they became almost like one heart. Those who meet them now, and
                  observe the deep, but unobtrusive affection with which they regard each other,
                  would never imagine, did they not know their previous history, that love, during
                  one period of that married life, had been so long and so totally eclipsed.</p>

               <head>THE SOCIAL SERPENT.</head>
               <p>A LADY, whom we will call Mrs. Harding, touched with the destitute condition of a
                  poor, sick widow, who had three small children, determined, from an impulse of
                  true humanity, to awaken, if possible, in the minds of some friends and
                  neighbours, an interest in her favour. She made a few calls, one morning, with
                  this end in view, and was gratified to find that her appeal made a favourable
                  impression. The first lady whom she saw, a Mrs. Miller, promised to select from
                  her own and children's wardrobe a number of cast-off garments for the widow, and
                  to aid her in other respects, at the same time asking Mrs. Harding to call in on
                  the next day, when she would be able to let her know what she could do.</p>
               <p>Pleased with her reception, and encouraged to seek further aid for the widow, Mrs.
                  Harding withdrew and took her way to the house of another acquaintance. Scarcely
                  had she left, when a lady, named Little, dropped in to see Mrs. Miller. To her the
                  latter said, soon after her entrance:</p>
               <p>"I've been very much interested in the case of a poor widow this morning. She is
                  sick, with three little children dependent on her, and destitute of almost every
                  thing. Mrs. Harding was telling me about it."</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Harding!" The visitor's countenance changed, and she looked unutterable
                  things. "I wonder!" she added, in well assumed surprise, and then was silent.</p>
               <p>"What's the matter with Mrs. Harding?" asked Mrs. Miller.</p>
               <p>"I should think," said Mrs. Little, "that she was in nice business, running
                  around, gossiping about indigent widows, when some of her own relatives are so
                  poor they can hardly keep soul and body together."</p>
               <p>"Is this really so?" asked Mrs. Miller.</p>
               <p>"Certainly it is. I had it from my chambermaid, whose sister is cook next door to
                  where a cousin of Mrs. Harding's lives, and she says they are, one half of their
                  time, she really believes, in a starving condition."</p>
               <p>"But does Mrs. Harding know this?"</p>
               <p>"She ought to know it, for she goes there sometimes, I hear."</p>
               <p>"She didn't come merely to gossip about the poor widow," said Mrs. Miller. "Her
                  errand was to obtain something to relieve her necessities."</p>
               <p>"Did you give her any thing?" asked Mrs. Little.</p>
               <p>"No; but I told her to call and see me to-morrow, when I would have something for
                  her."</p>
               <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC5621-00000028"/>
               <p>"Do you want to know my opinion of this matter?" said Mrs. Little, drawing herself
                  up, and assuming a very important air.</p>
               <p>"What is your opinion?"</p>
               <p>"Why, that there is no poor widow in the case at all."</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Little!"</p>
               <p>"You needn't look surprised. I'm in earnest. I never had much faith in Mrs.
                  Harding, at the best."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>am</emph> surprised. If there was no poor widow in the case, what did she
                  want with charity?"</p>
               <p>"She has poor relations of her own, for whom, I suppose, she's ashamed to beg. So
                  you see my meaning now."</p>
               <p>"You surely wrong her."</p>
               <p>"Don't believe a word of it. At any rate, take my advice, and be the almoner of
                  your own bounty. When Mrs. Harding comes again, ask her the name of this poor
                  widow, and where she resides. If she gives you a name and residence, go and see
                  for yourself."</p>
               <p>"I will act on your suggestion," said Mrs. Miller. "Though I can hardly make up my
                  mind to think so meanly of Mrs. Harding; still, from the impression your words
                  produce, I deem it only prudent to be, as you term it, the almoner of my own
                  bounty."</p>
               <p>The next lady upon whom Mrs. Harding called, was a Mrs. Johns, and in her mind she
                  succeeded in also awakening an interest for the poor widow.</p>
               <p>"Call and see me to-morrow," said Mrs. Johns, "and I'll have something for
                  you."</p>
               <p>Not long after Mrs. Harding's departure, Mrs. Little called, in her round of
                  gossipping visits, and to her Mrs. Johns mentioned the case of the poor widow,
                  that matter being, for the time, uppermost in her thoughts.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Harding's poor widow, I suppose," said Mrs. Little, in a half-sneering,
                  half-malicious tone of voice.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Johns looked surprised, as a matter of course.</p>
               <p>"What do you mean?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"Oh, nothing, much. Only I've heard of this destitute widow before."</p>
               <p>"You have?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and between ourselves,"—the voice of Mrs. Little became low and
                  confidential—"it's the opinion of Mrs. Miller and myself, that there is no poor
                  widow in the case."</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Little! You astonish me! No poor widow in the case! I can't understand this.
                  Mrs. Harding was very clear in her statement. She described the widow's condition,
                  and very much excited my sympathies. What object can she have in view?"</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Miller and I think," said the visitor, "and with good reason, that this poor
                  widow is only put forward as a cover."</p>
               <p>"As a cover to what?"</p>
               <p>"To some charities that she has reasons of her own for not wishing to make
                  public."</p>
               <p>"Still in the dark. Speak out more plainly."</p>
               <p>"Plainly, then, Mrs. Johns, we have good reasons for believing, Mrs. Miller and I,
                  that she is begging for some of her own poor relations. Mrs. Miller is going to
                  see if she can find the widow."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! That's another matter altogether. I promised to do something in the case,
                  but shall now<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5621-00000029"/> decline. I couldn't have
                  believed such a thing of Mrs. Harding! But so it is; you never know people until
                  you find them out." </p>
               <p>"No, indeed, Mrs. Johns. You never spoke a truer word in your life," replied Mrs.
                  Little, emphatically.</p>
               <p>On the day following, after seeing the poor widow, ministering to some of her
                  immediate wants, and encouraging her to expect more substantial relief, Mrs.
                  Harding called, as she had promised to do, on Mrs. Miller. A little to her
                  surprise, that lady received her with unusual coldness; and yet, plainly, with an
                  effort to seem friendly.</p>
               <p>"You have called about the poor widow you spoke of yesterday?" said Mrs.
                  Miller.</p>
               <p>"Such is the object of my present visit."</p>
               <p>"What is her name?"</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Aitken."</p>
               <p>"Where did you say she lived?"</p>
               <p>The residence was promptly given.</p>
               <p>"I've been thinking," said Mrs. Miller, slightly colouring, and with some
                  embarrassment, "that I would call in and see this poor woman myself."</p>
               <p>"I wish you would," was the earnest reply of Mrs. Harding. "I am sure, if you do
                  so, all your sympathies will be excited in her favour."</p>
               <p>As Mrs. Harding said this, she arose, and with a manner that showed her feelings
                  to be hurt, as well as mortified, bade Mrs. Miller a formal good-morning, and
                  retired. Her next call was upon Mrs. Johns. Much to her surprise, her reception
                  here was quite as cold; in fact, so cold, that she did not even refer to the
                  object of her visit, and Mrs. Johns let her go away without calling attention to
                  it herself. So affected was she by the singular, and to her unaccountable change
                  in the manner of these ladies, that Mrs. Harding had no heart to call upon two
                  others, who had promised to do something for the widow, but went home
                  disappointed, and suffering from a troubled and depressed state of feeling.</p>
               <p>So far as worldly goods were concerned, Mrs. Harding could not boast very large
                  possessions. She was herself a widow; and her income, while it sufficed, with
                  economy, to supply the moderate wants of her family, left her but little for
                  luxuries, the gratification of taste, or the pleasures of benevolence. Quick to
                  feel the wants of the needy, no instance of destitution came under her observation
                  that she did not make some effort toward procuring relief.</p>
               <p>What now was to be done? She had excited the sick woman's hopes—had promised that
                  her immediate wants, and those of her children, should be supplied. From her own
                  means, without great self-denial, this could not be effected. True, Mrs. Miller
                  and Mrs. Johns had both promised to call upon the poor widow, and, in person,
                  administer relief. But Mrs. Harding did not place much reliance on this; for
                  something in the manner of both ladies impressed her with the idea that their
                  promise merely covered a wish to recede from their first benevolent
                  intentions.</p>
               <p>"Something must be done" said she, musingly. And then she set herself earnestly to
                  the work of devising ways and means. Where there is a will there is a way. No
                  saying was ever truer than this.</p>
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC5621-00000030"/>
               <p>It was, perhaps, a week later, that Mrs. Little called again upon Mrs. Miller.</p>
               <p>"What of Mrs. Harding's poor widow?" said the former, after some ill-natured
                  gossip about a mutual friend.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I declare! I've never thought of the woman since," replied Mrs. Miller, in a
                  tone of self-condemnation. "And I promised Mrs. Harding that I would see her. I
                  really blame myself."</p>
               <p>"No great harm done, I presume," said Mrs. Little.</p>
               <p>"I don't know about that. I'm hardly prepared to think so meanly of Mrs. Harding
                  as you do. At any rate, I'm going this day to redeem my promise."</p>
               <p>"What promise?"</p>
               <p>"The promise I made Mrs. Harding, that I would see the woman she spoke of, and
                  relieve her, if in need."</p>
               <p>"You'll have all your trouble for nothing."</p>
               <p>"No matter, I'll clear my conscience, and that is something. Come, wont you go
                  with me?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Little declined the invitation at first; but, strongly urged by Mrs. Miller,
                  she finally consented. So the two ladies forthwith took their way toward the
                  neighbourhood in which Mrs. Harding had said the needy woman lived. They were
                  within a few doors of the house, which had been very minutely described by Mrs.
                  Harding, when they met Mrs. Johns.</p>
               <p>"Ah!" said the latter, with animation, "just the person, of all others, I most
                  wished to see. How could you, Mrs. Miller, so greatly wrong Mrs. Harding?"</p>
               <p>"Me wrong her, Mrs. Johns? I don't understand you." And Mrs. Miller looked
                  considerably astonished.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Little informed me that you had good reasons for believing all this story
                  about a poor widow to be a mere subterfuge, got up to cover some doings of her own
                  that Mrs. Harding was ashamed to bring to the light."</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Little!" There was profound astonishment in the tones of Mrs. Miller, and
                  her eyes had in them such an indignant light, as she fixed them upon her
                  companion, that the latter quailed under her gaze.</p>
               <p>"Acting from this impression," resumed Mrs. Johns, "I declined placing at her
                  disposal the means of relief promised; but, instead, told her that I would myself
                  see the needy person for whom she asked aid. This I have, until now, neglected to
                  do; and this neglect, or indifference I might rather call it, has arisen from a
                  belief that there was no poor widow in the case. Wrong has been done, Mrs. Miller,
                  great wrong! How could you have imagined such baseness of Mrs. Harding?"</p>
               <p>"And there <emph>is</emph> a poor, sick widow, in great need?" said Mrs. Miller,
                  now speaking calmly, and with regained self-possession.</p>
               <p>"There is a sick widow," replied Mrs. Johns, "but not at present in great need.
                  Mrs. Harding has supplied immediate wants."</p>
               <p>"Well, Mrs. Little!" Mrs. Miller again turned her eyes, searchingly, upon her
                  companion.</p>
               <p>"I—I—thought so. It was my impression—I had good reason for—I—I" stammered Mrs.
                  Little.</p>
               <p>"It should have been enough for you to check a<pb n="60-61"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000031"/> benevolent impulse in my case by your unfounded
                  suggestions. Not content with this, however, you must use my name in still further
                  spreading your unjust suspicions, and actually make me the author of charges
                  against a noble-minded woman, which had their origin in your own evil
                  thoughts."</p>
               <p>"I will not bear such language!" said the offended Mrs. Little, indignantly; and
                  turning with an angry toss of the head, she left the ladies to their own
                  reflections.</p>
               <p>"I am taught one good lesson from this circumstance," said Mrs. Miller, as they
                  walked away; "and that is, never to even seem to have my good opinion of another
                  affected by the allegations and surmises of a social gossip. Such people always
                  suppose the worst, and readily pervert the most unselfish actions into moral
                  offences. The harm they do is incalculable."</p>
               <p>"And, as in the present case," remarked Mrs. Johns, "they make others responsible
                  for their base suggestions. Had Mrs. Little not coupled your name with the implied
                  charges against Mrs. Harding, my mind would not have been poisoned against
                  her."</p>
               <p>"While not a breath of suspicion had ever crossed mine until Mrs. Little came in,
                  and wantonly intercepted the stream of benevolence about to flow forth to a needy,
                  and, I doubt not, most worthy object."</p>
               <p>"We have made of her an enemy. At least you have; for you spoke to her with
                  smarting plainness," said Mrs. Johns.</p>
               <p>"Better the enmity of such than their friendship," replied Mrs. Miller. "Their
                  words of detraction cannot harm so much as the poison of evil thoughts toward
                  others, which they ever seek to infuse. Your dearest friend is not safe from them,
                  if she be pure as an angel. Let her name but pass your lips, and instantly it is
                  breathed upon, and the spotless surface grows dim."</p>

                  <ref target="#return_001">*</ref>[The following brief passage is from our story,
                  "The Wife," in the series "Maiden," "Wife," and "Mother."]</p></note>
               <p>A NEW chord vibrated in Anna's heart, and the music was sweeter far in her
                  spirit's ear, than any before heard. She was changed. Suddenly she felt that she
                  was a new creature. Her breast was filled with deeper, purer, and tenderer
                  emotions. She was a mother! A babe had been born to her! A sweet pledge of love
                  lay nestling by her side, and drawing its life from her bosom. She was happy—how
                  happy cannot be told. A mother only can <emph>feel</emph> how happy she was on
                  first realizing the new emotions that thrill in a young mother's heart.</p>
               <p>As health gradually returned to her exhausted frame, and friends gathered around
                  her with warm congratulations, Anna felt that she was indeed beginning a new life.
                  Every hour her soul seemed to enlarge, and her mind to be filled with higher and
                  purer thoughts. Before the birth of her babe, she suffered much more than even her
                  husband had supposed<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC5621-00000032"/> posed, both in body
                  and mind. Her spirits were often so depressed that it required her utmost effort
                  to receive him with her accustomed cheerfulness at each period of his loved
                  return. But, living as she did in the ever active endeavour to bless others, she
                  strove daily and hourly to rise above every infirmity. Now, all was peace
                  within—holy peace. There came a Sabbath rest of deep, interior joy, that was
                  sweet, unutterably sweet. Body and spirit entered into this rest. No wind ruffled
                  the still, bright waters of her life. She was the same, and yet not the same.</p>
               <p>"I cannot tell you, dear husband! how happy I am," she said, a few weeks after her
                  babe was born. "Nor can I describe the different emotions that pervade my heart.
                  When our babe is in my arms, and especially when it lies at my bosom, it seems as
                  if angels were near me."</p>
               <p>"And angels are near you," replied her husband. "Angels love innocence, and
                  especially infants, that are forms of innocence. They are present with them, and
                  the mother shares the blessed company, for she loves her babe with an unselfish
                  love, and this the angels can perceive, and, through it, affect her with a measure
                  of their own happiness.</p>
               <p>"How delightful the thought! Above all, is the mother blessed. She suffers
                  much—her burden is hard to bear—the night is dark—but the morning that opens upon
                  her is the brightest a human soul knows during its earthly pilgrimage. And no
                  wonder. She has performed the highest and holiest of offices—she has given birth
                  to an immortal being—and her reward is with her."</p>
               <p>Hartley had loved his wife truly, deeply, tenderly. Every day, he saw more and
                  more in her to admire. There was an order, consistency, and harmony in her
                  character as a wife, that won his admiration. In the few months they had passed
                  since their marriage, she had filled her place to him, perfectly. Without seeming
                  to reflect how she should regulate her conduct toward her husband, in every act of
                  her wedded life she had displayed true wisdom, united with unvarying love. All
                  this caused his heart to unite itself more and more closely with hers. But now,
                  that she held to him the twofold relation of a wife and mother, his love was
                  increased fourfold. He thought of her, and looked upon her, with increased
                  tenderness.</p>
               <p>"Mine, by a double tie," he said, with a full realization of his words, when he
                  first pressed his lips upon the brow of his child, and then, with a fervour unfelt
                  before, upon the lips of his wife. "As you have been a good wife, you will be a
                  good mother," he added, with emotion.</p>

               <head>THE GENTLE WARNING.</head>
               <p>"Do not accept the offer, Florence," said her friend Carlotti.</p>
               <p>A shade of disappointment went over the face of the fair girl, who had just
                  communicated the pleasing fact that she had received an offer of marriage.</p>
               <p>"You cannot be happy as the wife of Herman Leland," added Carlotti.</p>
               <p>"How little do you know this heart," returned the fond girl.</p>
               <p>"It is because I know it so well that I say what I do. If your love be poured out
                  for Herman Leland, Florence, it will be as water on the desert sand."</p>
               <p>"Why do you affirm this, Carlotti?"</p>
               <p>"A woman can truly love only the moral virtue of her husband."</p>
               <p>"I do not clearly understand you."</p>
               <p>"It is only genuine goodness of heart that conjoins in marriage."</p>
               <p>"Well?"</p>
               <p>"Just so far as selfish and evil affections find a place in the mind of either the
                  husband or wife, will be the ratio of unhappiness in the marriage state. If there
                  be any truth in morals, or in the doctrine of affinities, be assured that this is
                  so. It is neither intellectual attainments nor personal attractions that make
                  happiness in marriage. Far, very far from it. All depends upon the quality of the
                  affections. If these be good, happiness will come as a natural consequence; but if
                  they be evil, misery will inevitably follow so close a union."</p>
               <p>"Then you affirm that Mr. Leland is an evil-minded man?"</p>
               <p>"Neither of us know him well enough to say this positively, Florence. Judging from
                  what little I have seen, I should call him a selfish man; and no selfish man can
                  be a good man, for selfishness is the basis of all evil."</p>
               <p>"I am afraid you are prejudiced against him, Carlotti."</p>
               <p>"If I have had any prejudices in the matter, Florence, they have been in his
                  favour. Well-educated, refined in his manners, and variously accomplished, he
                  creates, on nearly all minds, a favourable impression. Such an impression did I at
                  first feel. But the closer I drew near to him, the less satisfied did I feel with
                  my first judgment. On at least two occasions, I have heard him speak lightly of
                  religion."</p>
               <p>"Of mere cant and sectarianism, perhaps."</p>
               <p>"No; he once spoke lightly of a mother for making it a point to require all her
                  children to repeat their prayers before going to bed. On another occasion, he
                  alluded to one of the sacraments of the church in a way that produced an inward
                  shudder. From that time, I have looked at him with eyes from which the scales have
                  been removed; and the more I seek to penetrate beneath the surface of his
                  character, the more do I see what repels me. Florence,<pb n="66-67"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000034"/> dear, let me urge you, as one who tenderly loves
                  you and earnestly desires to see you happy, to weigh the matter well ere you
                  assent to this proposal."</p>
               <p>"I'm afraid, Carlotti," said Florence in reply to this, "that you have let small
                  causes influence your feelings toward Mr. Leland. We all speak lightly, at times,
                  even on subjects regarded as sacred—not because we despise them, but from casual
                  thoughtlessness. It was, no doubt, so with Mr. Leland on the occasion to which you
                  refer."</p>
               <p>"We are rarely mistaken, Florence," replied Carlotti, "as to the real sentiment
                  involved in the words used by those with whom we converse. Words are the
                  expressions of thoughts, and these the form of affections. What a man really feels
                  in reference to any subject, will generally appear in the tones of his voice, no
                  matter whether he speak lightly or seriously. Depend upon it, this is so. It was
                  the manner in which Leland spoke that satisfied me as to his real feelings, more
                  than the language he used. Judging him in this way, I am well convinced that, in
                  his heart, he despises religion; and no man who does this, can possibly make a
                  right-minded woman happy."</p>
               <p>The gentle warning of Carlotti was not wholly lost on Florence. She had great
                  confidence in the judgment of her friend, and did not feel that it would be right
                  to wholly disregard her admonitions.</p>
               <p>"What answer can I make?" said she, drawing a long sigh. "He urges an early
                  response to his suit."</p>
               <p>"Duty to yourself, Florence, demands a time for consideration. Marriage is a thing
                  of too vital moment to be decided upon hurriedly. Say to him in reply, that his
                  offer is unexpected, and that you cannot give an immediate answer, but will do so
                  at the earliest possible moment."</p>
               <p>"So cold a response may offend him."</p>
               <p>"If it does, then he will exhibit a weakness of character unfitting him to become
                  the husband of a sensible woman. If he be really attracted by your good qualities,
                  he will esteem you the more for this act of prudence. He will understand that you
                  set a high regard upon the marriage relation, and do not mean to enter into it
                  unless you know well the person to whom you commit your happiness in this world,
                  and, in all probability, the next."</p>
               <p>"A coldly calculating spirit, Carlotti, that nicely weighs and balances the merits
                  and defects of one beloved, is, in my view, hardly consonant with true happiness
                  in marriage. All have defects of character. All are born with evil inclinations of
                  one kind or another. Love seeks only for good in the object of affection.
                  Affinities of this kind are almost spontaneous in their birth. We love more from
                  impulse than from any clear appreciation of character—perceiving good qualities by
                  a kind of instinct rather than searching for them."</p>
               <p>"A doctrine, Florence," said Carlotti, "that has produced untold misery in the
                  married life. As I said at first, it is only the moral virtue of her husband that
                  a woman can love—it is only this, as a uniting principle, that can make two
                  married partners one. The qualities of all minds express themselves in words and
                  actions, and, by a close observance<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC5621-00000035"/> of
                  these latter, we may determine the nature of the former. We cannot perceive them
                  with sufficient clearness to arrive at a sound judgment: the only safe method is
                  to determine the character of the tree by its fruits. Take sufficient time to
                  arrive at a knowledge of Mr. Leland's character by observation, and then you can
                  accept or reject him under the fullest assurance that you are acting wisely."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you are right," murmured Florence. "I will weigh carefully what you have
                  said."</p>
               <p>And she did so. Much to the disappointment of Mr. Leland, he received a reply from
                  Florence asking a short time for reflection.</p>
               <p>When Florence next met the young man, there was, as a natural consequence, some
                  slight embarrassment on both sides. On separating, Florence experienced a certain
                  unfavourable impression toward him, although she could not trace it to any thing
                  he had said or done. At their next meeting, Leland's reserve had disappeared, and
                  he exhibited a better flow of spirits. He was more off his guard than usual, and
                  said a good many things that rather surprised Florence.</p>
               <p>Impatient of delay, Leland again pressed his suit; but Florence was further than
                  ever from being ready to give an answer. She was not prepared to reject him, and
                  as little prepared to give a favourable answer. Her request to be allowed further
                  time for consideration, wounded his pride; and, acting under its influence, he
                  determined to have his revenge on her by suing for the hand of another maiden, and
                  bearing her to the altar while she was hesitating over the offer he had made. With
                  this purpose in view, he penned a kind and polite note, approving her
                  deliberation, and desiring her to take the fullest time for reflection.
                  "Marriage," said he, in this note, "is too serious a matter to be decided upon
                  hastily. It is a life-union, and the parties who make it should be well satisfied
                  that there exists a mutual fitness for each other."</p>
               <p>Two days passed after Florence received this note before seeing her friend
                  Carlotti. She then called upon her in order to have further conversation on the
                  subject of the proposal she had received. The tenor of this note had produced a
                  favourable change in her feelings, and she felt strongly disposed to make a speedy
                  termination of the debate in her mind by accepting her attractive suitor.</p>
               <p>"Are you not well?" was her first remark on seeing Carlotti, for her friend looked
                  pale and troubled.</p>
               <p>"Not very well, dear," replied Carlotti, making an effort to assume a cheerful
                  aspect.</p>
               <p>The mind of Florence was too intent on the one interesting subject that occupied
                  it to linger long on any other theme. But a short time elapsed before she said,
                  with a warmer glow on her cheeks—</p>
               <p>"I believe I have made up my mind, Carlotti."</p>
               <p>"About what?"</p>
               <p>"The offer of Mr. Leland."</p>
               <p>"Well, what is your decision?" Carlotti held her breath for an answer.</p>
               <p>"I will accept him."</p>
               <p>Without replying, Carlotti arose, and going to a drawer, took therefrom a letter
                  addressed to herself and handing it to Florence, said—</p>
               <p>"Read that."</p>
               <p>There was something ominous in the manner of Carlotti, which caused Florence to
                  become agitated. Her hands trembled as she unfolded the letter. It bore the date
                  of the day previous, and read thus:— <q>
                     <floatingText>
                        <body>
                           <div type="letter">
                              <p>"MY DEAR CARLOTTI: From the first moment I saw you, I felt that you
                                 were the one destined to make me happy or miserable. Your image has
                                 been present to me, sleeping or waking, ever since. I can turn in
                                 no way that it is not before me. The oftener I have met you, the
                                 more have I been charmed by the gentleness, the sweetness, the
                                 purity, and excellence of your character. With you to walk through
                                 life by my side, I feel that my feet would tread a flowery way; but
                                 if heaven have not this blessing in store for me, I shall be, of
                                 all men, most miserable. My heart is too full to write more. And
                                 have I not said enough? Love speaks in brief but eloquent language.
                                 Dear young lady, let me hear from you speedily. I shall be wretched
                                 until I know your decision. Heaven give my suit a favourable
                                 issue!</p>
                              <closer>
                                 <salute>Yours, devotedly,</salute>
                                 <signed>"HERMAN LELAND."</signed>
                              </closer>
                           </div>
                        </body>
                     </floatingText>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>A deadly paleness overspread the countenance of Florence as the letter dropped
                  from her hands; and she leaned back against her friend to prevent falling to the
                  floor. But, in a little while, she recovered herself.</p>
               <p>"And this to <emph>you</emph>?" said she, with a quivering lip, as she gazed
                  earnestly into the face of her friend.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Florence, that to <emph>me</emph>."</p>
               <p>"Can I trust my own senses? Is there not some illusion? Let me look at it
                  again."</p>
               <p>And Florence stooped for the letter, and fixed her eyes upon it once more. The
                  language was plain, and the handwriting she knew too well.</p>
               <p>"False-hearted!" she murmured, in a low and mournful voice, covering her face and
                  sobbing.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Florence," said her friend, "he is false-hearted. How thankful am I that you
                  have escaped! Evidently in revenge for your prudent deliberation, he has sought an
                  alliance with another. Had that other one accepted his heartless proposal, he
                  would have met your favourable answer to his suit with insult."</p>
               <p>For a long time, Florence wept on the bosom of her friend. Then her feelings grew
                  calmer, and her mind became clear.</p>
               <p>"What an escape!" fell from her lips as she raised her head and turned her still
                  pale face toward Carlotti. "Thanks, my wiser friend, for your timely, yet gentle
                  warning! Your eyes saw deeper than mine."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes; you have made an escape!" said Carlotti. "With such a man, your life
                  could only have been wretched."</p>
               <p>"Have you answered his letter?" asked Florence.</p>
               <p>"Not yet. But if you are inclined to do so, we will, on the same sheet of paper
                  and under the same envelope, each decline the honour of an alliance. Such a rebuke
                  he deserves, and we ought to give it."</p>
               <p>And such a rebuke they gave.</p>
               <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC5621-00000037"/>
               <p>A few months later, and Leland led to the altar a young lady reputed to be an
                  heiress.</p>
               <p>A year afterward, just on the eve of Florence's marriage to a gentleman in every
                  way worthy to take her happiness in his keeping, she sat alone with her fast
                  friend Carlotti. They were conversing of the bright future.</p>
               <p>"And for all this joy, in store for me, Carlotti," said Florence, leaning toward
                  her friend and laying her hand affectionately on her cheek, "I am indebted to
                  you."</p>
               <p>"To me? How to me, dear?" asked Carlotti.</p>
               <p>"You saved me from an alliance with Leland. Oh, into what an abyss of wretchedness
                  would I have fallen! I heard to-day that, after cruelly abusing poor Agnes in
                  Charleston, where they removed, he finally abandoned her. Can it be true?"</p>
               <p>"It is, I believe, too true. Agnes came back to her friends last week, bringing
                  with her a babe. I have not seen her; but those who have tell me that her story of
                  suffering makes the heart ache. She looks ten years older."</p>
               <p>"Ah me!" sighed Florence. "Marriage—how much it involves! Even now, as I stand at
                  its threshold, with so much that looks bright in the future, I tremble. Of
                  Edward's excellent character and goodness of heart, all bear testimony. He is
                  every thing I could wish; but will I make him happy?"</p>
               <p>"Not all you could wish," said Carlotti, seriously. "None are perfection here; and
                  you must not expect this. You will find, in your husband's character, faults.
                  Anticipate this; but let the anticipation prepare you to bear with rather than be
                  hurt when they appear, and do not seek too soon to correct them. It is said by a
                  certain deeply-seeing writer on spiritual themes, that when the angels come to try
                  one, they explore his mind only to find the good therein, that they may excite it
                  to activity. Be, then, your husband's angel; explore his mind for the good it
                  contains, and seek to develop and strengthen it. Looking intently at what is good
                  in him, you will not be likely to see faults looming up and assuming a magnitude
                  beyond their real dimensions. But when faults appear, as they assuredly will,
                  compare them with your own; and, as you would have him exercise forbearance toward
                  you, do you exercise forbearance toward him. Be wise in your love, my friend.
                  Wisdom and love are married partners. If you separate them, neither is a safe
                  guide. But if you keep them united, like a rower who pulls both oars, you will
                  glide swiftly forward in a smooth sea."</p>
               <p>Florence bent her head as she listened, and every word of her friend made its
                  impression. Long after were they remembered and acted upon, and they saved her
                  from hours of pain. Florence is a happy wife; but how near did she come to making
                  shipwreck of her love-freighted heart? There are times when, in thinking of it,
                  she trembles.</p>

               <head>KATE'S EXPERIMENT.</head>
               <p>KATE HARBELL, a high-spirited girl, who had a pretty strong will of her own, was
                  about being married. Like a great many others of her age and sex who approach the
                  matrimonial altar, Kate's notions of the marriage relation were not the clearest
                  in the world.</p>
               <p>Ferdinand Lee, the betrothed of Kate, a quiet, sensitive young man, had, perhaps,
                  as strong a will as the young lady herself, though it was more under the control
                  of reason. He was naturally impatient of dictation or force, and a strong love of
                  approbation made him feel keenly any thing like satire, ridicule or censure. To
                  point him to a fault was to wound if not offend him. Here lay the weakness of his
                  character. All this, on the other side, was counterbalanced by kind feelings, good
                  sense, and manly principles. He was above all meanness or dishonour.</p>
               <p>Of course, Kate did not fully understand his character. Such a thing as a young
                  girl's accurate knowledge of the character of the man she is about to marry, is of
                  very rare occurrence. She saw enough of good qualities to make her love him with
                  tenderness and devotion; but she also saw personal defects that were disagreeable
                  in the object of her affections. But she did not in the least doubt that all these
                  she could easily correct in him after she became his wife.</p>
               <p>From a defect of education, or from a natural want of neatness and order,
                  Ferdinand Lee was inclined to <choice>
                     <sic>carelessnes</sic>
                     <corr>carelessness</corr>
                  </choice> in his attire; and also exhibited a certain want of polish in his
                  manners and address that was, at times, particularly annoying to Kate.</p>
               <p>"I'll break him of that when I get him," said the young lady to a married friend,
                  alluding to some little peculiarity both had noticed.</p>
               <p>"Don't be too certain," returned the lady, smiling.</p>
               <p>"You'll see."</p>
               <p>Kate tossed her head in a resolute way.</p>
               <p>"I'll see you disappointed."</p>
               <p>"Wait a little while. Before I'm his wife six months, you'll hardly know the man,
                  there'll be such a change."</p>
               <p>"The change is far more likely to take place in you."</p>
               <p>"Why do you say that, Mrs. Morton?" inquired Kate, looking grave.</p>
               <p>"Because I think so. Men are not so easily brought into order, and the attempt at
                  reformation and correction by a young wife generally ends in painful
                  disappointment. If you begin this work you will, in all probability, find yourself
                  tasked beyond your ability. I speak from some experience, having been married for
                  about ten years, and having seen a good many young girls come up into our ranks
                  from the walks of single blessedness. Take my advice, and look away from
                  Frederick's faults and disagreeable peculiarities as much as possible, and
                     think<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC5621-00000039"/> more of his manly traits of
                  character—his fine sentiments, and honourable principles."</p>
               <p>"I do look at them and love them," replied Kate, with animation. "These won my
                  heart at first, and now unite me to him in bonds that cannot be broken. But if on
                  a precious gem there be a slight blemish that mars its beauty, shall we not seek
                  to remove the defect, and thus give the jewel a higher lustre? Will you say,
                  no?"</p>
               <p>"I will, if in the act there be danger of injuring the gem."</p>
               <p>"I don't understand you, Mrs. Morton?"</p>
               <p>"Reflect for a moment, and see if my meaning is not apparent."</p>
               <p>"You think I will offend him if I point out a fault, or seek to correct it?"</p>
               <p>"A result most likely to follow."</p>
               <p>"I will not think so poorly of his good sense," answered Kate, with some gravity
                  of manner. The suggestion half offended her.</p>
               <p>"None are perfect, my young friend; don't forget that," said Mrs. Morton, with
                  equal seriousness. "To think differently is a common mistake of persons
                  circumstanced as you are."</p>
               <p>"It's no mistake of mine, let me assure you," replied Kate. "I can see faults as
                  quickly as any one. Love can't blind me. It is because I see defects in Frederick
                  that I wish to correct them."</p>
               <p>"And you trust to his good sense to take the work of correction kindly?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly I do."</p>
               <p>"Then you most probably think him more perfect than he really is. Very few people
                  can bear to be told of their faults, and fewer still to be told of them by those
                  they love. Love is expected to be blind to defects; therefore, when it is seen
                  looking at and pointing them out, the feeling produced is, in the very nature of
                  things, a disagreeable one. Take my advice, and let Frederick's faults alone, at
                  least for a year after you are married; and even then put your hand on them very
                  lightly, and as if by accident."</p>
               <p>"Do you think I could see him lounge, or, rather, slide down in his chair in that
                  ungraceful way, and not speak to him about it? Not I. It makes me nervous now;
                  and, if I wasn't afraid he might take it unkindly, would call his attention to
                  it."</p>
               <p>"Do you think he will be less likely to take it unkindly after marriage?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly. Then I will have a right to speak to him about it."</p>
               <p>"Then marriage will give you certain rights over your husband?"</p>
               <p>"It will give him rights over me, and a very poor rule that is which doesn't work
                  both ways. Marriage will make him my husband; and, surely, a wife may tell her
                  husband that he is not perfect, without offending him."</p>
               <p>"Kate, Kate; you don't know what you are talking about, child!"</p>
               <p>"I think I do."</p>
               <p>"And I know you don't."</p>
               <p>"Oh, well, Mrs. Morton, we won't quarrel about it," said Kate, laughing. "I mean
                  to make one of the best of wives, and have one of the best of husbands to be
                  found. He will require a little fixing up to<pb n="78-79"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000040"/> make him just to my mind, but don't you fear but
                  what I'll do it in the gentlest possible manner. Women have more taste than men,
                  you know, and a man never looks and acts just right until he gets a woman to take
                  charge of him."</p>
               <p>A happy bride Kate became a few months after this little conversation took place,
                  and Lee thought himself the most fortunate of men in obtaining such a lovely,
                  accomplished, and right-minded woman for a wife. Swiftly glided away the sweet
                  honey-moon, without a jar of discord, though, during the time, Kate saw a good
                  many things not exactly to her mind, and which she set down as needing
                  correction.</p>
               <p>One evening, it was just five weeks after the marriage, and when they were snugly
                  settled in their own house, Frederick Lee was seated before the grate, in a
                  handsome rocking-chair, his body in a position that it would have required a
                  stretch of language to pronounce graceful or becoming. He had drawn off one of his
                  boots, that was lying on the floor, and the leg from which it had been taken was
                  hanging over an arm of his chair. He had slipped forward in the chair—his ordinary
                  mode of sitting, or, rather, lying—so far that his head, which, if he had been
                  upright, would have been even with the top of the back, was at least twelve inches
                  below it. To add to the effect of his position, he was swinging the bootless leg
                  that hung across the arm of the chair with a rapid, circling motion. He had been
                  reclining in this inelegant attitude for about ten minutes, when Kate, who had
                  permitted herself to become a good deal annoyed by it, said to him, rather
                  earnestly—</p>
               <p>"Do, Frederick, sit up straight, and try and be a little more graceful in your
                  positions."</p>
               <p>"What's that?" inquired the young man, as if he had not heard distinctly.</p>
               <p>"Can't you sit up straight?"</p>
               <p>Kate smiled; but Lee saw that it was a forced smile.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes," he answered, indifferently. "I can sit up straight as an arrow, but I
                  find this attitude most agreeable."</p>
               <p>"If you knew how you looked," said Kate.</p>
               <p>"How do I look?" asked the young man, playfully.</p>
               <p>"Oh! you look—you look more like a country clod-hopper than any thing else."</p>
               <p>There was a sharpness in Kate's tones that fell unpleasantly on the ears of the
                  young man.</p>
               <p>"Do I, indeed!" was his rather cold remark. Yet he did not change his
                  position.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, you do," said the wife, who was, by this time, beginning to feel a good
                  deal of irritation; for she saw that Frederick was not inclined to respond in the
                  way she had hoped, to her very reasonable desire that he would assume a more
                  graceful attitude. "The fact is," she continued, impelled to further utterance by
                  the excited state of her feelings, although she was conscious of having already
                  said more than was agreeable to her husband, "you ought to correct yourself of
                  these ungraceful and undignified habits. It shows a want of"—</p>
               <p>Kate stopped suddenly. She felt that she was about using words that would
                  inevitably give offence.</p>
               <p>"A want of what?" inquired Lee, in a low, firm<pb n="80-81"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000041"/> voice, while he continued to look his young wife
                  steadily in the face.</p>
               <p>Kate's eyes fell to the floor and she remained silent.</p>
               <p>"Ungraceful and undignified. Humph!"</p>
               <p>Lee was evidently hurt at this allegation, as the tone in which he repeated the
                  words clearly showed.</p>
               <p>"Do you call your present attitude graceful?" Kate asked, rallying herself under
                  the reflection that she was right.</p>
               <p>"It is comfortable for me; and, therefore, ought to be graceful in your eyes," was
                  the young man's perverse answer. Not the slightest change had yet taken place in
                  his position.</p>
               <p>This was beyond what the high spirited lady could bear, and she retorted with more
                  feeling than discretion:</p>
               <p>"Love is not blind in my case, I can assure you, Frederick, and never will be. You
                  are very ungraceful and untidy, and annoy me, sometimes, excessively. I wish you
                  would try to correct these things."</p>
               <p>"You do?"</p>
               <p>There was something cool and provoking in the way Lee said this.</p>
               <p>"I do, Frederick, and I'm in earnest."</p>
               <p>The cheeks of Kate were in a glow, and her eyes lit up, and her lips
                  quivering.</p>
               <p>"How long since you made the discovery that I was only a country clod-hopper?"
                  said Lee, who was particularly annoyed by Kate's unexpected charges against his
                  good-breeding.</p>
               <p>"I didn't say you were only a country clod-hopper," replied Kate.</p>
               <p>"I believe you used the words. My ears rarely deceive me. I must own to feeling
                  highly complimented."</p>
               <p>"Do sit up straight, Frederick! Do take your leg from over the arm of that chair!
                  You make me so nervous that I can hardly contain myself."</p>
               <p>"Really! I thought a man was privileged to sit in any position he pleased in his
                  own house."</p>
               <p>The excitement of Kate's mind had, by this time, reached a crisis. Bursting into
                  tears, she hurried from the room, and went sobbing up to her chamber.</p>
               <p>Here was a fine state of affairs, indeed! Was ever a man so perverse and
                  unreasonable?</p>
               <p>Did Frederick Lee follow, quickly, his weeping wife? No; his pride was too deeply
                  wounded for that.</p>
               <p>"A country clod-hopper! Undignified and ungraceful! Upon my word!" Such were some
                  of his mental ejaculations. And then, as his feelings grew excited, he started up
                  from his chair and began pacing the floor, muttering, as he did so—</p>
               <p>"It is rather late in the day to make this discovery! Why didn't she find it out
                  before? Humph!"</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, Kate had thrown herself across her bed, where she lay, weeping
                  bitterly.</p>
               <p>What a storm had suddenly been blown about their ears!</p>
               <p>It was fully an hour before Frederick Lee's disturbed feelings began to run at all
                  clear. He was both surprised and offended. What could all this mean? What had all
                  at once come over his young wife?</p>
               <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC5621-00000042"/>
               <p>"A country clod-hopper!" he muttered to himself over and over again.
                  "Ungraceful—ungenteel, and all that! Very complimentary, indeed!"</p>
               <p>When Lee joined his wife in their chamber, two hours after she had left him, he
                  found that she had retired to bed and was sleeping.</p>
               <p>On the next morning both looked very sober, and both were cold and distant. A few
                  words only passed between them. It was the same when they met at dinner-time, and
                  the same when Lee came home in the evening. During the whole of this day, the
                  thought of each was upon the other; but it was not a forgiving thought. Kate
                  cherished angry feelings toward her husband; and Lee continued to be offended at
                  the freedom of expression which his young wife had ventured to use toward him. Of
                  course, both were very unhappy.</p>
               <p>The formal intercourse of the tea-table having ended, Lee, feeling little inclined
                  to pass the evening with his reserved and sober-looking partner, put on his hat,
                  and merely remarking that he would not return until bed-time, left the house. This
                  act startled Kate. With the jar of the closing door came a gush of tears. The
                  evening was passed alone. How wretched she felt as the hours moved slowly on!</p>
               <p>It was nearly eleven o'clock when Lee came home. By that time, the mind of Kate
                  was in an agony of suspense. More than once the thought that he had abandoned her
                  intruded itself, and filled her with fear and anguish. What a relief to her
                  feelings it was when she heard the rattle of his night-key in the lock! But she
                  could not meet him with a smile. She could not throw her arms around his neck, and
                  press her hot cheek to his. No: for she felt that he was angry with her without
                  just cause, and had visited with unjust severity a light offence—if, so far as she
                  was concerned, her act were worthy to be called an offence.</p>
               <p>And so they looked coldly upon each other when they met, and then averted their
                  eyes.</p>
               <p>The morning broke, but with no fairer promise of a sunny day. Clouds obscured
                  their whole horizon. Coldly they parted after the brief and scarcely tasted meal.
                  How wretched they were!</p>
               <p>During the forenoon, Mrs. Morton, the friend of Mrs. Lee, called in to see her
                  young friend.</p>
               <p>"Why, Kate! What has happened?" she exclaimed, the moment she saw her.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lee tried to smile and look indifferent, as she answered—</p>
               <p>"Happened? Why do you say that?"</p>
               <p>"You look as if you hadn't a friend left in the world!"</p>
               <p>"And I don't know that I have," said Mrs. Lee, losing, all at once, her
                  self-command, and permitting the ready tears to gush forth.</p>
               <p>"Why, Kate, dear!" exclaimed Mrs. Morton, drawing her arm around the neck of her
                  young friend. "What is the meaning of all this? Something wrong with
                  Frederick?"</p>
               <p>Kate was silent.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Morton reflected for a moment, and then said—</p>
               <p>"Been trying to correct some of his faults, ha?"</p>
               <p>No answer. But the sobbing became less violent.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Kate! Kate! I warned you of this."</p>
               <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC5621-00000043"/>
               <p>"Warned me of what?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lee lifted her head, and tried to assume an air of dignity as she spoke.</p>
               <p>"I warned you that Frederick would not bear it, if you attempted to lay your hand
                  upon his faults."</p>
               <p>Kate raised her head higher, and compressed her lips. Still she did not
                  answer.</p>
               <p>"A young husband, naturally enough, thinks himself faultless—at least in the eyes
                  of his wife."</p>
               <p>"Very far from faultless is Frederick in my eyes," said Kate. "My love is not
                  blind, and so I told him."</p>
               <p>"You did!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I did, and in so many words," replied Kate, with spirit.</p>
               <p>"Ah, silly child!" returned her friend. "Already you have the reward of your
                  folly. I forewarned you how it would be."</p>
               <p>"Are my wishes, feelings, and taste to be of no account whatever?" said Kate,
                  warmly. "Frederick is to be and do just what he pleases, and I must say nothing,
                  do nothing, and bear every thing. Was this the contract between us? No, Mrs.
                  Morton!"</p>
               <p>The bright eyes of Mrs. Lee flashed with indignant fire.</p>
               <p>"Come, come, Katy, dear! Don't let that impulsive heart of thine lead thee too far
                  aside from the path of prudence and safety. I am sure that Frederick Lee is no
                  self-willed, exacting, domestic tyrant. I could not have been so deceived in him.
                  But tell me the particular cause of your trouble. What has been said and done? You
                  have given offence, and he has become offended. Tell me the whole story, Kate, and
                  then I'll know what to say and do for the restoration of your peace."</p>
               <p>"You are aware," said Kate, after a brief pause, and with a deepening flush on her
                  cheeks, "how awkward and untidy Frederick is at times,—how he lounges in his
                  chair, and throws his body into all manner of ungraceful attitudes."</p>
               <p>"Well?"</p>
               <p>"This, as you know, has always annoyed me sadly. Night before last, I felt so
                  worried with him, that I could not help speaking right out."</p>
               <p>"Ah! when you were worried?"</p>
               <p>"Of course. If I hadn't felt worried, I wouldn't have said any thing."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! Well, what did you say? Was your tone of voice low and full of love, and
                  your words as gentle as the falling dew?"</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Morton!"</p>
               <p>There was a half-angry, indignant expression in the voice of Kate.</p>
               <p>"Did you lay your hand lightly, like the touch of a feather, upon the fault you
                  designed to correct, or did you grasp it rudely and angrily?"</p>
               <p>Kate's eyes drooped beneath those of her friend.</p>
               <p>"You were annoyed and excited," continued Mrs. Morton. "This by your own
                  acknowledgment, and, in such a frame of mind, you charged with faults the one who
                  had vainly thought himself, at least in your eyes, perfect. And he, as a natural
                  consequence, was hurt and offended. But what did you say to him?"</p>
               <p>"I hardly know what I said, now," returned Kate. "But I know I used the words
                  ungraceful, undignified, and country clod-hopper."</p>
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC5621-00000044"/>
               <p>"Why, Kate! I am surprised at you! And this to so excellent a man as Frederick,
                  who, from all the fair and gentle ones around him, chose you to be his bosom
                  friend and life companion. Kate, Kate! That was unworthy of you. That was unkind
                  to him. I do not wonder that he was hurt and offended."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I was wrong, Mrs. Morton," said Kate, as tears began to flow again. "But
                  Frederick's want of order, grace, and neatness, is dreadful. I cannot tell you how
                  much it annoys me."</p>
               <p>"You saw all this before you were married."</p>
               <p>"Not all of it."</p>
               <p>"You saw enough to enable you to judge of the rest."</p>
               <p>"True; but then I always meant to correct these things in him. They were but
                  blemishes on a jewel of surpassing value."</p>
               <p>"Ah, Kate, you have proved the truth of what I told you before your marriage. It
                  is not so easy a thing to correct the faults of a husband—faults confirmed by long
                  habit. Whenever a wife attempts this, she puts in jeopardy, for the time being at
                  least, her happiness, as you have done. A man is but little pleased to make the
                  discovery that his wife thinks him no better than a country clod-hopper; and it is
                  no wonder that he should be offended, if she, with strange indiscreetness and want
                  of tact, tells him in plain terms what she thinks. Your husband is sensitive,
                  Kate."</p>
               <p>"I know he is."</p>
               <p>"And keenly alive to ridicule."</p>
               <p>"I am not aware of that."</p>
               <p>"Then your reading of his character is less accurate than mine. Moreover, he has a
                  pretty good opinion of himself."</p>
               <p>"We all have that."</p>
               <p>"And a strong will, quiet as he is in exterior."</p>
               <p>"Not stronger, perhaps, than I have."</p>
               <p>"Take my advice, Kate," said Mrs. Morton, seriously, "and don't bring your will in
                  direct opposition to his."</p>
               <p>"And why not? Am I not his equal? He is no master of mine. I did not sell myself
                  as his slave, that his will should be my law!"</p>
               <p>"Silly child! How madly you talk!" said Mrs. Morton. "Not for the world would I
                  have Frederick hear such utterance from your lips. Does he not love you tenderly?
                  Has he not, in every way, sought your happiness thus far in your brief married
                  life? Is he not a man of high moral virtue? Does not your alliance with him rather
                  elevate than depress you in the social rank? And yet, forsooth, because he lounges
                  in his chair, and permits his body, at times, to assume ungraceful attitudes, you
                  must throw the apple of discord into your pleasant home to mar its beautiful
                  harmonies."</p>
               <p>"Surely, a wife may be permitted to speak to her husband, and even seek to correct
                  his faults," said Kate.</p>
               <p>"Better shut her eyes to his faults, if seeing them is to make them both unhappy.
                  You are in a very strange mood, Kate."</p>
               <p>"Am I?" returned Mrs. Lee, querulously.</p>
               <p>"You are; and the quicker it passes away, the better for both yourself and
                  husband."</p>
               <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC5621-00000045"/>
               <p>"I don't know how soon it will pass away," sighed Kate, moodily.</p>
               <p>"Good-morning," said Mrs. Morton, rising and making a motion to depart.</p>
               <p>"You are not going?"</p>
               <p>Kate glanced up with a look of surprise.</p>
               <p>"Yes; I am afraid to stay here any longer," was the affected serious reply. "I
                  might catch something of your spirit, and then my husband would find a change in
                  his pleasant home. Good-morning. May I see you in a better state of mind when we
                  meet again."</p>
               <p>And saying this, Mrs. Morton passed from the room so quickly that Kate could not
                  arrest the movement; so she remained seated, though a little disturbed by her
                  friend and monitor's sudden departure.</p>
               <p>What Mrs. Morton had said, although it seemed not to impress the mind of her young
                  friend, yet lingered there, and now began gradually to do its work.</p>
               <p>As for Frederick Lee, he was unhappy enough. The words of Kate had stung him
                  severely.</p>
               <p>"And so, in her eyes, I am no better than a country clod-hopper!"</p>
               <p>Almost every hour was this repeated—sometimes mentally and sometimes aloud; and at
                  each repetition it disturbed his feelings and awakened an unforgiving spirit.</p>
               <p>"A clod-hopper, indeed! Wonder she never made this discovery before!"</p>
               <p>This was the thought of Lee as he left his place of business to return home, on
                  the evening of the day on which Mrs. Morton called upon Kate. Why would he not
                  look away from this? Why would he ponder over and magnify the offence of Kate? Why
                  would he keep this ever before his eyes? His self-love had been wounded. His pride
                  had been touched. The weapon of ridicule had been used against him, and to
                  ridicule he was morbidly sensitive. Kate should have read his character more
                  closely, and should have understood it better. But she was ignorant of his
                  weaknesses, and bore heavily upon them ere aware of their existence.</p>
               <p>It was in this brooding, clouded, and unforgiving state of mind that Frederick Lee
                  took his way homeward. On entering his dwelling, which he did almost noiselessly,
                  he went into the parlour and seated himself in the very place where he was sitting
                  when Kate began, so unexpectedly to him, her unsuccessful work of reformation.
                  Every thing around reminded him of that unfortunate evening—even the lounging
                  position he so naturally assumed, sliding down, as he did, in the chair, and
                  throwing one of his legs over the arm.</p>
               <p>"It is comfortable for me," said he, moodily to himself; "and it's my own house.
                  If she don't like it, let her—"</p>
               <p>He did not finish the sentence, for he felt that his state of mind was not what it
                  should be, and that to speak thus of his wife was neither just nor kind.</p>
               <p>Unhappy young man! Is it thus you visit the light offence—for it was light, in
                  reality—of the loving and gentle young creature who has given her happiness, her
                  very life into your keeping? Could<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC5621-00000046"/> you
                  not bear a word from her? Are you so perfect, that her eyes must see no defect? Is
                  she never to dare, on penalty of your stern displeasure, to correct a fault—to
                  seek to lift you, by her purer and better taste, above the ungraceful and unmanly
                  habits consequent upon a neglected boyhood? What if her hand was laid rather
                  heavily upon you? What if her feelings did prompt her to use words that had better
                  been left unsaid? It was the young wife's pride in her husband that warmed her
                  into undue excitement, and this you should have at once comprehended.</p>
               <p>If Frederick Lee did not think precisely as we have written, his thoughts
                  gradually inclined in that direction. Still he felt moody, and his feelings warmed
                  but little toward Kate.</p>
               <p>Thus he sat for some ten or fifteen minutes. At the end of this time, he heard
                  light footsteps coming down the stairs. He knew them to be those of his wife. He
                  did not move nor make a sound, but rather crouched lower in his chair, the back of
                  which was turned toward the door. But his thought was on his wife. He saw her with
                  the eyes of his mind—saw her with her clouded countenance. His heart throbbed
                  heavily against his side, and he partially held his breath.</p>
               <p>Now her footsteps moved along the passage, and now he was conscious that she had
                  entered the room where he sat. Not the slightest movement did he make—not a sign
                  did he give of his presence. There he sat, shrinking down in his chair, moody,
                  gloomy, and angry with Kate in his heart.</p>
               <p>Was she aware of his presence? Had she heard him enter the house? Such were the
                  questioning thoughts that were in his mind.</p>
               <p>Footsteps moved across the room. Now Kate was at the mantel-piece, a few feet from
                  the chair he occupied, for he heard her lay a book thereon. Now she passed to the
                  back window, and throwing it up, pushed open the shutters, giving freer entrance
                  to the waning light.</p>
               <p>A deep silence followed. Now the stillness is broken by a gentle sigh that floats
                  faintly through the room. How rebukingly smote that sigh upon the ears of Lee! How
                  it softened his heart toward Kate, the young and loving wife of his bosom! A
                  slower movement in the current of his angry feelings succeeds to this. Then it
                  becomes still. There is a pause.</p>
               <p>But where is Kate? Has she left the room? He listens for some movement, but not
                  the slightest sound meets his ear.</p>
               <p>"Kate!" No, he did not utter the word aloud, in tender accents, though it was in
                  his heart and on his tongue. Nor did he start up or move. No, as if spell-bound,
                  he remained crouching down in his chair.</p>
               <p>All at once he is conscious that some one is bending above him, and, in the next
                  moment, warm lips touch his forehead, gently, hesitatingly, yet with a lingering
                  pressure.</p>
               <p>"Kate! Dear Kate!"</p>
               <p>He has sprung to his feet, and his arms are flung around his wife.</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, Frederick, if I seemed unkind to you," sobbed Kate, as soon as she
                  could command<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC5621-00000047"/> her voice. "There was no
                  unkindness in my heart —only love."</p>
               <p>"It is I who most need to ask forgiveness," replied Lee. "I who have—"</p>
               <p>"Hush! Not a word of that now," quickly returned Kate, placing her hand upon his
                  mouth. "Let the past be forgotten."</p>
               <p>"And forgiven, too," said Lee, as he pressed his lips eagerly to those of his
                  wife.</p>
               <p>How happy they were at this moment of reconciliation! How light seemed the causes
                  which had risen up to mar the beautiful harmony of their lives! Haw weak and
                  foolish both had been, as their acts now appeared in eyes from which had fallen
                  the scales of passion!</p>
               <p>Both were wiser than in the aforetime. Kate tried to look away, as much as
                  possible, from the little faults which at first so much annoyed her; while her
                  husband turned his thoughts more narrowly upon himself, at the same time that he
                  made observation of other men, and was soon well convinced that sundry changes in
                  his habits and manners might be made with great advantage. The more his eyes were
                  opened to these little personal defects, the more fully did he forgive Kate for
                  having in the beginning laid her hand upon them, though not in the gentlest
                  manner.</p>
               <p>"Six months have passed since you were married," said Mrs. Morton one day to
                  Kate.</p>
               <p>"Yes, six months have flown on wings of perfume," replied the happy wife.</p>
               <p>"I saw Frederick yesterday."</p>
               <p>"Did you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; and I knew him the moment my eyes rested upon him."</p>
               <p>"Knew him! Why shouldn't you know him?"</p>
               <p>Kate looked a little surprised.</p>
               <p>"I thought he was to be so changed under your hands in six months, that I would
                  hardly recognise him."</p>
               <p>There was an arch look in Mrs. Morton's eyes, and a merry flutter in her
                  voice.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Morton! Now that is too bad!"</p>
               <p>"Your experiment failed, did it not, dear?"</p>
               <p>The door of the room in which the ladies were sitting opened at the moment, and
                  Frederick Lee entered.</p>
               <p>"Not entirely," whispered Kate, as she bent to the ear of her friend. "He is
                  vastly improved—at least, in my eyes."</p>
               <p>"And in others' eyes, too," thought Mrs. Morton, as she arose and returned the
                  young man's smiling salutation.</p>

               <head>"MY FORTUNE'S MADE."</head>
               <p>My young friend, Cora Lee, was a gay, dashing girl, fond of dress, and looking
                  always as if, to use a common saying, just out of a bandbox. Cora was a belle, of
                  course, and had many admirers. Among the number of these, was a young man named
                  Edward Douglass, who was the very "pink" of neatness in all matters pertaining to
                  dress, and exceedingly particular in his observance of the little proprieties of
                  life.</p>
               <p>I saw, from the first, that if Douglass pressed his suit, Cora's heart would be an
                  easy conquest, and so it proved.</p>
               <p>"How admirably they are fitted for each other!" I remarked to my husband, on the
                  night of their wedding. "Their tastes are similar, and their habits so much alike,
                  that no violence will be done to the feelings of either in the more intimate
                  associations that marriage brings. Both are neat in person and orderly by
                  instinct, and both have good principles."</p>
               <p>"From all present appearances, the match will be a good one," replied my husband.
                  There was, I thought, something like reservation in his tone.</p>
               <p>"Do you really think so?" I said, a little ironically, for Mr. Smith's approval of
                  the marriage was hardly warm enough to suit my fancy.</p>
               <p>"Oh, certainly! Why not?" he replied.</p>
               <p>I felt a little fretted at my husband's mode of speaking, but made no further
                  remark on the subject. He is never very enthusiastic nor sanguine, and did not
                  mean, in this instance, to doubt the fitness of the parties for happiness in the
                  marriage state—as I half imagined. For myself, I warmly approved of my friend's
                  choice, and called her husband a lucky man to secure, for his companion through
                  life, a woman so admirably fitted to make one like him happy. But a visit which I
                  paid to Cora one day about six weeks after the honeymoon had expired, lessened my
                  enthusiasm on the subject, and awoke some unpleasant doubts. It happened that I
                  called soon after breakfast. Cora met me in the parlour, looking like a very
                  fright. She wore a soiled and rumpled morning wrapper; her hair was in papers; and
                  she had on dirty stockings, and a pair of old slippers down at the heels.</p>
               <p>"Bless me, Cora!" said I. "What is the matter? Have you been sick?"</p>
               <p>"No. Why do you ask? Is my dishabille rather on the extreme?"</p>
               <p>"Candidly, I think it is, Cora," was my frank answer.</p>
               <p>"Oh, well! No matter," she carelessly replied, "my fortune's made."</p>
               <p>"I don't clearly understand you," said I.</p>
               <p>"I'm married, you know."</p>
               <p>"Yes; I am aware of that fact."</p>
               <p>"No need of being so particular in dress now."</p>
               <p>"Why not?"</p>
               <p>"Didn't I just say?" replied Cora. "My fortune's made. I've got a husband."</p>
               <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC5621-00000049"/>
               <p>Beneath an air of jesting, was apparent the real earnestness of my friend.</p>
               <p>"You dressed with a careful regard to taste and neatness, in order to win Edward's
                  love?" said I.</p>
               <p>"Certainly I did."</p>
               <p>"And should you not do the same in order to retain it?"</p>
               <p>"Why, Mrs. Smith! Do you think my husband's affection goes no deeper than my
                  dress? I should be very sorry indeed to think that. He loves me for myself."</p>
               <p>"No doubt of that in the world, Cora. But remember that he cannot see what is in
                  your mind except by what you do or say. If he admires your taste, for instance, it
                  is not from any abstract appreciation thereof, but because the taste manifests
                  itself in what you do. And, depend upon it, he will find it a very hard matter to
                  approve and admire your correct taste in dress, for instance, when you appear
                  before him, day after day, in your present unattractive attire. If you do not
                  dress well for your husband's eyes, for whose eyes, pray, do you dress? You are as
                  neat when abroad as you were before your marriage."</p>
               <p>"As to that, Mrs. Smith, common decency requires me to dress well when I go upon
                  the street or into company, to say nothing of the pride one naturally feels in
                  looking well."</p>
               <p>"And does not the same common decency and natural pride argue as strongly in
                  favour of your dressing well at home, and for the eye of your husband, whose
                  approval and whose admiration must be dearer to you than the approval and
                  admiration of the whole world?"</p>
               <p>"But he doesn't want to see me rigged out in silks and satins all the time. A
                  pretty bill my dressmaker would have against him! Edward has more sense than that,
                  I flatter myself."</p>
               <p>"Street or ball-room attire is one thing, Cora, and becoming home apparel another.
                  We look for both in their places."</p>
               <p>Thus I argued with the thoughtless young wife, but my words made no impression.
                  When abroad, she dressed with exquisite taste, and was lovely to look upon; but at
                  home, she was careless and slovenly, and made it almost impossible for those who
                  saw her to realize that she was the brilliant beauty they had met in company but a
                  short time before. But even this did not last long. I noticed, after a few months,
                  that the habits of home were confirming themselves, and becoming apparent abroad.
                  Her "fortune was made," and why should she now waste time or employ her thoughts
                  about matters of personal appearance?</p>
               <p>The habits of Mr. Douglass, on the contrary, did not change. He was as orderly as
                  before, and dressed with the same regard to neatness. He never appeared at the
                  breakfast-table in the morning without being shaved; nor did he lounge about in
                  the evening in his shirt-sleeves. The slovenly habits into which Cora had fallen
                  annoyed him seriously; and still more so, when her carelessness about her
                  appearance began to manifest itself abroad as well as at home. When he hinted any
                  thing on the subject, she did not hesitate to reply, in a jesting<pb n="98-99"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000050"/> manner, that her fortune was made, and she need not
                  trouble herself any longer about how she looked.</p>
               <p>Douglass did not feel very much complimented; but as he had his share of good
                  sense, he saw that to assume a cold and offended manner would do no good.</p>
               <p>"If your fortune is made, so is mine," he replied on one occasion, quite coolly
                  and indifferently. Next morning he made his appearance at the breakfast table with
                  a beard of twenty-four hours' growth.</p>
               <p>"You haven't shaved this morning, dear," said Cora, to whose eyes the
                  dirty-looking face of her husband was particularly unpleasant.</p>
               <p>"No," he replied, carelessly. "It's a serious trouble to shave every day."</p>
               <p>"But you look so much better with a cleanly-shaved face."</p>
               <p>"Looks are nothing—ease and comfort every thing," said Douglass.</p>
               <p>"But common decency, Edward."</p>
               <p>"I see nothing indecent in a long beard," replied the husband.</p>
               <p>Still Cora argued, but in vain. Her husband went off to his business with his
                  unshaven face.</p>
               <p>"I don't know whether to shave or not," said Douglass next morning, running his
                  hand over his rough face, upon which was a beard of forty-eight hours' growth. His
                  wife had hastily thrown on a wrapper, and, with slip-shod feet and head like a
                  mop, was lounging in a large rocking-chair, awaiting the breakfast-bell.</p>
               <p>"For mercy's sake, Edward, don't go any longer with that shockingly dirty face,"
                  spoke up Cora. "If you knew how dreadfully you look!"</p>
               <p>"Looks are nothing," replied Edward, stroking his beard.</p>
               <p>"Why, what's come over you all at once?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing; only it's such a trouble to shave every day."</p>
               <p>"But you didn't shave yesterday."</p>
               <p>"I know; I am just as well off to-day as if I had. So much saved, at any
                  rate."</p>
               <p>But Cora urged the matter, and her husband finally yielded, and mowed down the
                  luxuriant growth of beard.</p>
               <p>"How much better you do look!" said the young wife. "Now don't go another day
                  without shaving."</p>
               <p>"But why should I take so much trouble about mere looks? I'm just as good with a
                  long beard as with a short one. It's a great deal of trouble to shave every day.
                  You can love me just as well; and why need I care about what others say or
                  think?"</p>
               <p>On the following morning, Douglass appeared not only with a long beard, but with a
                  bosom and collar that were both soiled and rumpled.</p>
               <p>"Why, Edward! How you do look!" said Cora. "You've neither shaved nor put on a
                  clean shirt."</p>
               <p>Edward stroked his face and run his fingers along the edge of his collar,
                  remarking, indifferently, as he did so—</p>
               <p>"It's no matter. I look well enough. This being so very particular in dress is
                  waste of time, and I'm getting tired of it."</p>
               <p>And in this trim Douglass went off to his business<pb n="100-101"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000051"/> ness, much to the annoyance of his wife, who could
                  not bear to see her husband looking so slovenly.</p>
               <p>Gradually the declension from neatness went on, until Edward was quite a match for
                  his wife; and yet, strange to say, Cora had not taken the hint, broad as it was.
                  In her own person she was as untidy as ever.</p>
               <p>About six months after their marriage, we invited a few friends to spend a social
                  evening with us, Cora and her husband among the number. Cora came alone, quite
                  early, and said that her husband was very much engaged, and could not come until
                  after tea. My young friend had not taken much pains with her attire. Indeed, her
                  appearance mortified me, as it contrasted so decidedly with that of the other
                  ladies who were present; and I could not help suggesting to her that she was wrong
                  in being so indifferent about her dress. But she laughingly replied to me—</p>
               <p>"You know my fortune's made now, Mrs. Smith. I can afford to be negligent in these
                  matters. It's a great waste of time to dress so much."</p>
               <p>I tried to argue against this, but could make no impression upon her.</p>
               <p>About an hour after tea, and while we were all engaged in pleasant conversation,
                  the door of the parlour opened, and in walked Mr. Douglass. At first glance I
                  thought I must be mistaken. But no, it was Edward himself. But what a figure he
                  did cut! His uncombed hair was standing up, in stiff spikes, in a hundred
                  different directions; his face could not have felt the touch of a razor for two or
                  three days; and he was guiltless of clean linen for at least the same length of
                  time. His vest was soiled; his boots unblacked; and there was an unmistakable hole
                  in one of his elbows.</p>
               <p>"Why, Edward!" exclaimed his wife, with a look of mortification and distress, as
                  her husband came across the room, with a face in which no consciousness of the
                  figure he cut could be detected.</p>
               <p>"Why, my dear fellow! What is the matter?" said my husband, frankly; for he
                  perceived that the ladies were beginning to titter, and that the gentlemen were
                  looking at each other, and trying to repress their risible tendencies; and
                  therefore deemed it best to throw off all reserve on the subject.</p>
               <p>"The matter? Nothing's the matter, I believe. Why do you ask?" Douglass looked
                  grave.</p>
               <p>"Well may he ask, what's the, matter?" broke in Cora, energetically. "How could
                  you come here in such a plight?"</p>
               <p>"In such a plight?" And Edward looked down at himself, felt his beard, and ran his
                  fingers through his hair. "What's the matter? Is any thing wrong?"</p>
               <p>"You look as if you'd just waked up from a nap of a week with your clothes on, and
                  come off without washing your face or combing your hair," said my husband.</p>
               <p>"Oh!" And Edward's countenance brightened a little. Then he said with much gravity
                  of manner—</p>
               <p>"I've been extremely hurried of late; and only left my store a few minutes ago. I
                  hardly thought it worth while to go home to dress up. I knew we were all friends
                  here. Besides, <emph>as my fortune is made</emph>"—and he glanced with a look not
                  to be mistaken<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC5621-00000052"/> taken toward his wife—"I
                  don't feel called upon to give as much attention to mere dress as formerly. Before
                  I was married, it was necessary to be particular in these matters, but now it's of
                  no consequence."</p>
               <p>I turned toward Cora. Her face was like crimson. In a few moments she arose and
                  went quickly from the room. I followed her, and Edward came after us pretty soon.
                  He found his wife in tears, and sobbing almost hysterically.</p>
               <p>"I've got a carriage at the door," said he to me, aside, half laughing, half
                  serious. "So help her on with her things, and we'll retire in disorder."</p>
               <p>"But it's too bad in you, Mr. Douglass," replied I.</p>
               <p>"Forgive me for making your house the scene of this lesson to Cora," he whispered.
                  "It had to be given, and I thought I could venture to trespass upon your
                  forbearance."</p>
               <p>"I'll think about that," said I, in return.</p>
               <p>In a few minutes Cora and her husband retired, and in spite of good breeding and
                  every thing else, we all had a hearty laugh over the matter, on my return to the
                  parlour, where I explained the curious little scene that had just occurred.</p>
               <p>How Cora and her husband settled the affair between themselves, I never inquired.
                  But one thing is certain, I never saw her in a slovenly dress afterward, at home
                  or abroad. She was cured.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>THE GOOD MATCH.</head>
               <p>"MY heart is now at rest," remarked Mrs. Presstman to her sister, Mrs. Markland.
                  "Florence has done so well. The match is such a good one."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Presstman spoke with animation, but her sister's countenance remained rather
                  grave.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Barker is worth at least eighty thousand dollars," resumed Mrs. Presstman.
                  "And my husband says, that if he prospers in business as he has done for the last
                  ten years, he will be the richest merchant in the city. Don't you think we have
                  been fortunate in marrying Florence so well?"</p>
               <p>"So far as the securing of wealth goes, Florence has certainly done very well,"
                  returned Mrs. Markland. "But, surely, sister, you have a higher idea of marriage
                  than to suppose that wealth in a husband is the primary thing. The quality of his
                  mind is of much more importance."</p>
               <p>"Oh, certainly, that is not to be lost sight of. Mr. Barker is an excellent man.
                  Every one speaks well of him. No one stands higher in the community than he
                  does."</p>
               <p>"That may be. But the general estimation in which a man is held does not, by any
                  means, determine his fitness to become the husband of one like Florence. I think
                  that when I was here last spring,<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC5621-00000053"/> there
                  was some talk of her preference for a young physician. Was such really the
                  case?"</p>
               <p>"There was something of that kind," replied Mrs. Presstman, the colour becoming a
                  very little deeper on her cheek—"a foolish notion of the girl's. But that was
                  broken off long ago. It would not do. We could not afford to let her marry a young
                  doctor with a poor practice. We knew her to be worthy something much higher, as
                  the result has shown."</p>
               <p>"Doctor Estill, I believe, was his name?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"I remember him very well—and liked him much. Was Mr. Barker preferred by Florence
                  to Doctor Estill?"</p>
               <p>"Why, yes—no—not at first," half-stammered Mrs. Presstman. "That is, you know, she
                  was foolish, like all young girls, and thought she loved him. But that passed
                  away. She is now as happy as she can be."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Markland felt that it was not exactly right to press this matter now that the
                  mischief, if any there were, had been done, and so remarked no further upon the
                  subject. But the admission made in her sister's reply to her last question pained
                  her. It corroborated a suspicion that crossed her mind, when she saw her niece,
                  that all was not right within—that the good match which had been made was only
                  good in appearance. She had loved Florence for the innocence, purity, and
                  elevation of soul that so sweetly characterized her. She knew her to be
                  susceptible of tender impressions, and capable of loving deeply an object really
                  worthy of her love. This plant had been, she feared, removed from the warm
                  green-house of home, where the earth had touched tenderly its delicate roots,
                  while its leaves put forth in a genial air, and placed in a hard soil and a
                  chilling atmosphere, still to live on, but with its beauty and fragrance gone. She
                  might be mistaken. But appearances troubled her.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Markland lived in a neighbouring city, and was on a visit to her sister.
                  During the two weeks that elapsed, while paying this visit, she heard a great deal
                  about the excellent match that Florence had made. No one of the acquaintances of
                  the family had any thing to say that was not congratulatory. More than one mother
                  of an unmarried daughter, she had good cause for concluding, envied her sister the
                  happiness of having the rich Mr. Barker for a son-in-law. When she parted with her
                  niece, on the eve of her return home, there were tears in her mild blue eyes. It
                  was natural—for Florence loved her aunt, and to part with her was painful. Still,
                  those tears troubled Mrs. Markland. She ought of them hours, and days, and months
                  after, as a token that all was not right in her gentle breast.</p>
               <p>Briefly let us now sketch a scene that passed twenty years from this period.
                  Twenty years! That is a long time. Yes—but it is a period that tests the truth or
                  falsity of the leading principles with which we set out in life. Twenty years! Ah!
                  how many, even long before that time elapses, prove the fallaciousness of their
                  hopes! discover the sandy foundation upon which they have built!</p>
               <p>Let us introduce Mrs. Barker. Her husband has realized even more than he had hoped
                  for, in the item of wealth. He is worth a million.<pb n="106-107"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000054"/> Rather a small sum in his eye, it is true, now that
                  he possesses it. And from this very fact, its smallness, he is not happy—for is
                  not Mr. T—— worth three millions of dollars? Mr. T——, who is no better, if as good
                  as he is? But what of Mrs. Barker? Ah, yes. Let us see how time has passed with
                  her. Let us see if the hours have danced along with her to measures of glad music,
                  or in cadence with a pensive strain. Has hers indeed been a <emph>good
                     match</emph>? We shall see.</p>
               <p>Is that sedate-looking woman, with such a cold expression upon her face, who sits
                  in that elaborately furnished saloon, or parlour, dreamily looking into the
                  glowing grate, Mrs. Barker? Yes, that is the woman who made a <emph>good
                     match</emph>. Can this indeed be so? I see, in imagination, a gentle, loving
                  creature, whose eyes and ears are open to all things beautiful in creation, and
                  whose heart is moved by all that is good and true. Impelled by the very nature
                  into which she has been born—woman's nature—her spirit yearns for high, holy,
                  interior companionship. She enters into that highest, holiest, most interior
                  relationship—marriage. She must be purely happy. Is this so? Can the woman we have
                  introduced at the end of twenty years be the same being with this gentle girl?
                  Alas! that we should have it to say that it is so. There has been no affliction to
                  produce this change—no misfortune. The children she has borne are all about her,
                  and wealth has been poured liberally into her lap. No external wish has been
                  ungratified. Why, then, should her face wear habitually so strange an expression
                  as it does?</p>
               <p>She had been seated for more than half an hour in an abstract mood, when some one
                  came in. She knew the step. It was that of her husband. But she did not turn to
                  him, nor seem conscious of his presence. He merely glanced toward his wife, and
                  then sat down at some distance from her, and took up a newspaper. Thus they
                  remained until a bell announced the evening meal, when both arose and passed in
                  silence to the tea-room. There they were joined by their four children, the eldest
                  at that lovely age when the girl has blushed into young womanhood. All arranged
                  themselves about the table, the younger children conversing together in an under
                  tone, but the father, and mother, and Florence, the oldest child, remaining
                  silent, abstracted, and evidently unhappy from some cause.</p>
               <p>The mother and daughter eat but little, and that compulsorily. After the meal was
                  finished, the latter retired to her own apartment, the other children remained
                  with their books in the family sitting-room, and Mr. and Mrs. Barker returned to
                  the parlour.</p>
               <p>"I am really out of all patience with you and Florence!" the former said, angrily,
                  as he seated himself beside his wife, in front of the grate. "One would think some
                  terrible calamity were about to happen."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Barker made no reply to this. In a moment or two her husband went on, in a
                  dogmatical tone.</p>
               <p>"It's the very best match the city affords. Show me another in any way comparable.
                  Is not Lorimer worth at least two millions?—and is not Harman his only son and
                  heir? Surely you and the girl must both be beside yourselves to think of objecting
                  for a single moment."</p>
               <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC5621-00000055"/>
               <p>"A good match is not always made so by wealth," Mrs. Barker returned, in a firm
                  voice, compressing her lips tightly, as she closed the brief sentence.</p>
               <p>"You are beside yourself," said the husband, half sneeringly.</p>
               <p>Perhaps I am," somewhat meekly replied Mrs. Barker. Then becoming suddenly excited
                  from the quick glancing of certain thoughts through her mind, she retorted
                  angrily. Her husband did not hesitate to reply in a like spirit. Then ensued a war
                  of words, which ended in a positive declaration that Florence should marry Harman
                  Lorimer. At this the mother burst into tears and left the room.</p>
               <p>After that declaration was made, Mrs. Barker knew that further opposition on her
                  part was useless. Florence was gradually brought over by the force of angry
                  threats, persuasions, and arguments, so as finally to consent to become the wife
                  of a man from whom her heart turned with instinctive aversion. But every one
                  called it such a good match, and congratulated the father and mother upon the
                  fortunate issue.</p>
               <p>What Mrs. Barker suffered before, during, and after the brilliant festivities that
                  accompanied her tenderly-loved daughter's sacrifice, cannot all be known. Her own
                  heart's history for twenty long years came up before her, and every page of that
                  history she read over, with a weeping spirit, as the history of her sweet child
                  for the dreary future. How many a leaf in her heart had been touched by the frost;
                  had withered, shrunk, and dropped from affection's stem—how many a bud had failed
                  to show its promised petals—how many a blossom had drooped and died ere the tender
                  germ in its bosom could come forth into hardy existence. Inanimate golden leaves,
                  and buds, and blossoms—nay, even fruits were a poor substitute for these. A
                  woman's heart cannot be satisfied with them.</p>
               <p>In her own mind, obduracy and coldness had supervened to the first states of
                  disappointed affection. But her heart had rebelled through long, long years
                  against the violence to which it had been subjected—and the calmness, or rather
                  indifference, that at last followed was only like ice upon the surface of a
                  stream—the water still flowing on beneath. Death to the mother would have been a
                  willing sacrifice, could it have saved her child from the living death that she
                  had suffered. But it would not. The father was a resolute tyrant. Money was his
                  god, and to that god he offered up even his child in sacrifice.</p>
               <p>Need the rambling hints contained in this brief sketch—this dim outline—be
                  followed by any enforcing reflections? An opposite picture, full of light and
                  warmth, might be drawn, but would it tend to bring the truth to clearer
                  perception, where mothers —true mothers—mothers in spirit as well as in name—are
                  those to whom we hold up the first picture? We think not.</p>
               <p>Wealth, reputation, honours, high intelligence in a man—all or either of these—do
                  not constitute him a good match for your child. Marriage is of the heart—the
                  blending of affection with affection, and thought with thought. How, then, can one
                  who loves all that is innocent, and pure, and holy, become interiorly conjoined
                  with a man who is a gross,<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC5621-00000056"/> selfish
                  sensualist? a man who finds happiness only in the external possession of wealth,
                  or honours, or in the indulgence of luxuries? It is impossible! Take away these,
                  and give her, in their stead, one with whom her affections can blend in perfect
                  harmony—one with whom she can become united as one—and earth will be to her a
                  little heaven.</p>
               <p>In the opposite course, alas! the evil does not always stop with your own child.
                  The curse is too often continued unto the third and fourth generation—yea, even
                  through long succeeding ages—to eternity itself! Who can calculate the evil that
                  may flow from a single perversion of the marriage union—that is, a marriage
                  entered into from other than the true motives? None but God himself!</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>THE BROTHER'S TEMPTATION.</head>
               <p>"COME, Henry," said Blanche Armour to her brother, who had seemed unusually silent
                  and thoughtful since tea time,—"I want you to read while I make this cap for
                  ma."</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, Blanche, if you please, I don't feel like reading to-night," the
                  brother replied, shading his face both from the light and the penetrating glance
                  of his sister, as he spoke.</p>
               <p>Blanche did not repeat the request, for it was a habit with her never to urge her
                  brother; nor, indeed, any one, to do a thing for which he seemed disinclined. She,
                  therefore, took her work-basket, and sat down by the centre-table, without saying
                  any thing farther, and commenced sewing. But she did not feel quite easy, for it
                  was too apparent that Henry was disturbed about something. For several days he had
                  seemed more than usually reserved and thoughtful. Now he was gloomy as well as
                  thoughtful. Of course, there was a cause for this. And as this cause was hidden
                  from Blanche, she could not but feel troubled. Several times during the evening
                  she attempted to draw him out into conversation, but he would reply to her in
                  monosyllables, and then fall back into his state of silent abstraction of mind.
                  Once or twice he got up and walked across the floor, and then again resumed his
                  seat, as if he had compelled himself to sit down by<pb n="112-113"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000057"/> a strong effort of the will. Thus the time passed
                  away, until the usual hour of retiring for the night came, when Blanche put up her
                  work, and rising from her chair by the centre-table, went to Henry, and stooping
                  down over him, as he lay half reclined upon the sofa, kissed him tenderly, and
                  murmured an affectionate "good night."</p>
               <p>"Good night, dear," he returned, without rising or adding another word.</p>
               <p>Blanche lingered a moment, and then, with a repressed sigh, left the room, and
                  retired to her chamber. She could not understand her brother's strange mood. For
                  him to be troubled and silent was altogether new. And the cause? Why should he
                  conceal it from her, toward whom, till now, he had never withheld any thing that
                  gave him either pleasure or pain?</p>
               <p>The moment Blanche retired, the whole manner of Henry Armour changed. He arose
                  from the sofa and commenced walking the floor with rapid steps, while the deep
                  lines upon his forehead and his strongly compressed lips showed him to be
                  labouring under some powerful mental excitement. He continued to walk thus
                  hurriedly backward and forward for the space of half an hour; when, as if some
                  long debated point had been at last decided, he grasped the parlour door with a
                  firm hand, threw it open, took from the rack his hat, cloak, and cane, and in a
                  few moments was in the street.</p>
               <p>The jar of the street door, as it closed, was distinctly heard by Blanche, and
                  this caused the troubled feeling which had oppressed her all the evening, to
                  change into one of anxiety. Where could Henry be going at this late hour? He
                  rarely stayed out beyond ten o'clock; and she had never before known him to leave
                  the house after the usual bedtime of the family. His going out had, of course,
                  something to do with his unhappy mood. What could it mean? She could not suspect
                  him of any wrong. She knew him to be too pure-minded and honourable. But there was
                  mystery connected with his conduct—and this troubled her. She had just laid aside
                  a book, that she had taken up for the purpose of reading a few pages before
                  retiring for the night, and commenced disrobing herself, when the sound of the
                  door closing after her brother startled her, and caused her to pause and think.
                  She could not now retire, for to sleep would be impossible. She, therefore, drew a
                  shawl about her, and again resumed her book, determined to sit up until Henry's
                  return. But little that she read made a very distinct impression on her mind. Her
                  thoughts were with her brother, whom she tenderly loved, and had learned to
                  confide in as one of pure sentiments and firm principles.</p>
               <p>While Henry Armour still lingered at home in moody indecision of mind, a small
                  party of young men were assembled in an upper room of a celebrated refectory,
                  drinking, smoking, and indulging in conversation, a large portion of which would
                  have shocked a modest ear. They were all members of wealthy and respectable
                  families. Some had passed their majority, and others still lingered between
                  nineteen and twenty-one,—that dangerous age for a young man—especially if he be so
                  unfortunate as to have little to do, and a liberal supply of pocket money.</p>
               <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC5621-00000058"/>
               <p>"Confound the fellow! What keeps him so long?" said one of the company, looking at
                  his watch. "It's nearly ten o'clock, and he has not made his appearance."</p>
               <p>"Whom do you mean? Armour?" asked another.</p>
               <p>"Certainly I do. He promised to join us again to-night."</p>
               <p>"So he did! But I'll bet a pewter sixpence he won't come."</p>
               <p>"Why?"</p>
               <p>"His sister won't let him. Don't you know that he is tied to her apron string
                  almost every night, the silly fellow! Why don't he be a man, and enjoy life as it
                  goes?"</p>
               <p>"Sure enough! What is life worth, if its pleasures are all to be sacrificed for a
                  sister?" returned the other, sneeringly.</p>
               <p>"Here! Pass that champagne," interrupted one of the company. "Let Harry Armour
                  break his engagement for a sister if he likes. That needn't mar our enjoyment.
                  There are enough of us here for a regular good time."</p>
               <p>"Here's a toast," cried another, as he lifted a sparkling glass to his
                  lips—"Pleasant dreams to the old folks!"</p>
               <p>"Good! Good! Good!" passed round the table, about which the young revellers were
                  gathered, and each drained a glass to the well understood sentiment.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, young Armour had left his home, having decided at last, and
                  after a long struggle with himself, to join this gay company, as he had agreed to
                  do. It was, in fact, a little club, formed a short time previous, the members of
                  which met once a week to eat, drink, smoke, and corrupt each other by ridiculing
                  those salutary moral restraints which, once laid aside, leave the thoughtless
                  youth in imminent danger of ruin.</p>
               <p>Henry Armour had been blessed with a sister a year or two older than himself, who
                  loved him tenderly. The more rapid development of her mind, as well as body, had
                  given her the appearance of maturity that enabled her to exercise a strong
                  influence over him. Of the dangers that beset the path of a young man, she knew
                  little or nothing. The constant effort which she made to render home agreeable to
                  her brother by consulting his tastes, and entering into every thing that seemed to
                  give him pleasure, did not, therefore, spring from a wish to guard him from the
                  world's allurements; it was the spontaneous result of a pure fraternal affection.
                  But it had the right effect. To him, there was no place like home; nor any smile
                  so alluring, or voice so sweet, as his sister's. And abroad, no company possessed
                  a perfect charm, unless Blanche were one of its members.</p>
               <p>This continued until Henry gained his twenty-second year, when, as a law student,
                  he found himself thrown more and more into the company of young men of his own
                  age, and the same standing in society. An occasional ride out with one and another
                  of these, at which times an hour at least was always spent in a public house,
                  opened to him new scenes in life, and for a young man of lively, buoyant mind, not
                  altogether unattractive. That there was danger in these paths he did not attempt
                     to<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC5621-00000059"/> disguise from himself. More than
                  one, or two, or three, whom he met on almost every visit he made to a fashionable
                  resort for young men, about five miles from the city, showed too strong
                  indications of having passed beyond the bounds of self-control, as well in their
                  use of wines and stronger drinks as in their conduct, which was too free from
                  those external decent restraints that we look for even in men who make no
                  pretensions to virtue. But he did not fear for himself. The exhibitions which
                  these made of themselves instinctively disgusted him. Still, he did not perceive
                  that he was less and less shocked at some things he beheld, and more than at first
                  inclined to laugh at follies which verged too nearly upon moral delinquencies.</p>
               <p>Gradually his circle of acquaintance with young men of the gay class extended, and
                  a freer participation with them in many of their pleasures came as a natural
                  consequence.</p>
               <p>"Come," said one of them to him, as the two met in the street, by accident, one
                  evening,—"I want you to go with me."</p>
               <p>"But why should I go with you? Or, rather, where are you going?" asked Armour.</p>
               <p>"To meet some of our friends down at C——'s," replied the young man.</p>
               <p>"What are you going to do there?" farther inquired Armour.</p>
               <p>"Nothing more than to drink a glass of wine, and have some pleasant chit-chat. So
                  come along."</p>
               <p>"Will I be welcome?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly you will. I'll guarantee that. Some half dozen of us have formed a
                  little club, and each member has the privilege of inviting any one he pleases.
                  To-night I invite you, and on the next evening I expect to see you present, not as
                  a guest, but as a member. So come along, and see how you like us."</p>
               <p>Armour had no definite object in view. He had walked out, because he felt rather
                  listless at home, Blanche having retired with a sick headache. It required,
                  therefore, no persuasion to induce him to yield to the friend's invitation.
                  Arrived at C——'s, a fashionable house of refreshment, the two young men passed up
                  stairs and entered one of the private apartments of the house, which they found
                  handsomely furnished and brilliantly lighted. In this, gathered around a circular,
                  or rather oblong table, were five or six young men, nearly all of them well known
                  to Armour. On the table were bottles of wine and glasses—the latter filled.</p>
               <p>"Just in time!" cried the president of the club. "Henry Armour, I bid you welcome!
                  Here's a place waiting for you," placing his hand upon a chair by his side as he
                  spoke. "And now," as Armour seated himself, "let me fill your glass. We were
                  waiting for a sentiment to find its way out of some brain as you came in, and our
                  brimming glasses had stood untasted for more than a minute. Can't you help us to a
                  toast?"</p>
               <p>"Here's to good fellowship!" said Armour, promptly lifting his glass, and touching
                  it to that of the president.</p>
               <p>"To be drunk standing," added the president.</p>
               <p>All rose on the instant, and drank with mock solemnity to the sentiment of their
                  guest.</p>
               <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC5621-00000060"/>
               <p>Then followed brilliant flashes of wit, or what was thought to be wit. To these
                  succeeded the song, the jest, the story,—and to these again the sparkling
                  wine-cup. Gayly thus passed the hours, until midnight stole quietly upon the
                  thoughtless revellers. Surprised, on reference to his watch, to find that it was
                  one o'clock, Armour arose and begged to be excused.</p>
               <p>"I move that our guest be excused on one condition," said the friend who had
                  brought him to the company. "And that is, on his promise to meet with us again, on
                  this evening next week."</p>
               <p>"What do you think of the condition?" asked the president, who, like nearly all of
                  the rest, was rather the worse for the wine he had taken, looking at Armour as he
                  spoke.</p>
               <p>"I agree to it with pleasure," was the prompt reply.</p>
               <p>"Another drink before you go, then," said the president, "and I will give the
                  toast. Fill up your glasses."</p>
               <p>The bottle again passed round the table.</p>
               <p>"Here's to a good fellow!" was the sentiment announced. It was received standing.
                  Armour then retired with bewildered senses. The gay scene that had floated before
                  his eyes, and in which himself had been an actor, and the freedom with which he
                  had taken wine, left him confused, almost in regard to his own identity. He did
                  not seem to himself the same person he had been a few hours before. A new world
                  had opened before him, and he had, almost involuntarily, entered into, and become
                  a citizen of that world. Long after he had reached his home, and retired to his
                  bed, did his imagination revel amid the scenes he had just left. In sleep, too,
                  fancy was busy. But here came a change. Serpents would too often glide across the
                  table around which the gay company, himself a member, were assembled; or some
                  other sudden and more appalling change scatter into fragments the bright phantasma
                  of his dreams.</p>
               <p>The sober morning found him in a soberer mood. Calm, cold, unimpassioned
                  reflection came. What had he been doing? What path had he entered; and whither did
                  it lead? These were questions that would intrude themselves, and clamour for an
                  answer. He shut his eyes and endeavoured again to sleep. Waking thoughts were
                  worse than the airy terrors which had visited him in sleep. At length he arose,
                  with dull pains in his head, and an oppressive sluggishness of the whole body. But
                  more painful than his own reflections, or the physical consequences of the last
                  night's irregularity, was the thought of meeting Blanche, and bearing the glance
                  of her innocent eyes. He felt that he had been among the impure, —and worse, that
                  he had enjoyed their impure sentiments, and indulged with them in excess of wine.
                  The taint was upon him, and the pure mind of his sister must instinctively
                  perceive it. These thoughts made him wretched. He really dreaded to meet her. But
                  this could not be avoided.</p>
               <p>"You do not look well, brother," said Blanche, almost as soon as she saw him.</p>
               <p>"I am not well," he replied, avoiding her steady look. "My head aches, and I feel
                  dull and heavy."</p>
               <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC5621-00000061"/>
               <p>"What has caused it, brother?" the affectionate girl asked, with a look and voice
                  of real concern.</p>
               <p>Now this was, of all others, the question that Henry was least prepared to answer.
                  He could not utter a direct falsehood. From that his firm principles shrunk. Nor
                  could he equivocate, for he considered equivocation little better than a direct
                  falsehood. "Why should I wish to conceal any part of my conduct from her?" he
                  asked himself, in his dilemma. But the answer was instant and conclusive. His
                  participation in the revelry of the last night was a thing not to be whispered in
                  her ear. Not being prepared, then, to tell the truth, and shrinking from falsehood
                  and equivocation, Armour preferred silence as the least evil of the three. The
                  question of Blanche was not, therefore, answered. At the breakfast-table, his
                  father and mother remarked upon his appearance. To this, he merely replied that he
                  was not well. As soon as the meal was over, he went out, glad to escape the eye of
                  Blanche, which, it seemed to him, rested searchingly upon him all the while.</p>
               <p>A walk of half an hour in the fresh morning air dispelled the dull pain in his
                  head, and restored his whole system to a more healthy tone. This drove away, to
                  some extent, the oppressive feeling of self-condemnation he had indulged. The
                  scenes of the previous evening, though silly enough for sensible young men to
                  engage in, seemed less objectionable than they had appeared to him on his first
                  review. To laugh involuntarily at several remembered jests and stories, the points
                  of which were not exactly the most chaste or reverential, marked the change that a
                  short period had produced in his state of mind. During that day, he did not fall
                  in with any of his wild companions of the last evening, too many of whom had
                  already fairly entered the road to ruin. The evening was spent at home, in the
                  society of Blanche. He read while she sewed, or he turned for her the leaves of
                  her music book, or accompanied her upon the flute while she played him a favourite
                  air upon the piano. Conversation upon books, music, society, and other topics of
                  interest, filled up the time not occupied in these mental recreations, and added
                  zest, variety, and unflagging interest to the gently-passing hours. On the next
                  evening they attended a concert, and on the next a party. On that succeeding,
                  Henry went out to see a friend of a different character from any of those with
                  whom he had passed the hours a few nights previous—a friend about his own age, of
                  fixed habits and principles, who, like himself, was preparing for the bar. With
                  him he spent a more rational evening than with the others, and, what was better,
                  no sting was left behind.</p>
               <p>Still, young Armour could never think of the "club" without having his mind thrown
                  into a tumult. It awoke into activity opposing principles. Good and evil came in
                  contact, and battled for supremacy. There was in his mind a clear conviction that
                  to indulge in dissipation of that character, would be injurious both to moral and
                  physical health. And yet, having tasted of the delusive sweets, he was tempted to
                  further indulgence. Meeting with some two or three of the "members" during the
                  week, and listening to their extravagant praise of<pb n="122-123"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000062"/> the "club," and the pleasure of uniting in
                  unrestrained social intercourse, made warm by generous wine, tended to make more
                  active the contest going on within—for the good principles that had been stored up
                  in his mind were not to be easily silenced. Their hold upon his character was
                  deep. They had entered into its warp and woof, and were not to be eradicated or
                  silenced in a moment. As the time for the next meeting of the club approached,
                  this battle grew more violent. The condition into which it had brought him by the
                  arrival of the night on which he had promised again to join his gay friends, the
                  reader has already seen. He was still unable to decide his course of action.
                  Inclination prompted him to go; good principles opposed. "But then I have passed
                  my word that I would go, and my word must be inviolable." Here reason came in to
                  the aid of his inclinations, and made in their favour a strong preponderance.</p>
               <p>We have seen that, yet undecided, he lingered at home, but in a state of mind
                  strangely different from any in which his sister had ever seen him. Still debating
                  the question, he lay, half reclined upon the sofa, when Blanche touched her
                  innocent lips to his, and murmured a tender good-night. That kiss passed through
                  his frame like an electric current. It came just as his imagination had pictured
                  an impure image, and scattered it instantly. But no decision of the question had
                  yet been made, and the withdrawal of Blanche only took off an external restraint
                  from his feelings. He quietly arose and commenced pacing the floor. This he
                  continued for some time. At last the decision was made.</p>
               <p>"I have passed my word, and that ends it," said he, and instantly left the house.
                  Without permitting himself to review the matter again, although a voice within
                  asked loudly to be heard, he walked hastily in the direction of the club-room. In
                  ten minutes he gained the door, opened it without pausing, and stood in the midst
                  of the wild company within. His entrance was greeted with shouts of welcome, and
                  the toast, "Here's to a good fellow!" with which he had parted from them, was
                  repeated on his return, all standing as it was drunk.</p>
               <p>To this followed a sentiment that cannot be repeated here. It was too gross. All
                  drunk to it but Armour. He could not, for it involved a foul slander upon the
                  other sex, and he had a sister whose pure kiss was yet warm upon his lips. The
                  individual who proposed the toast marked this omission, and pointed it out by
                  saying—</p>
               <p>"What's the matter, Harry? Is not the wine good?"</p>
               <p>The colour mounted to the young man's face as he replied, with a forced smile—</p>
               <p>"Yes, much better than the sentiment."</p>
               <p>"What ails the sentiment?" asked the propounder of it, in a tone of affected
                  surprise.</p>
               <p>"I have a sister," was the brief, firm reply of Armour.</p>
               <p>"So Charley, here, was just saying," retorted the other, with a merry laugh; "and,
                  what is more, that he'd bet a sixpence you were tied to her apron-string, and
                  would not be here to-night! Ha! ha!"</p>
               <p>The effect of this upon the mind of Armour was decisive. He loved, nay, almost
                  revered his sister.<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC5621-00000063"/> She had been like
                  an angel of innocence about his path from early years. He knew her to be as pure
                  as the mountain snow-flake. And yet that sister's influence over him was sneered
                  at by one who had just uttered a foul-mouthed slander upon her whole sex. The
                  scales fell instantly from his eyes. He saw the dangerous ground upon, which he
                  stood; while the character of his associates appeared in a new light. They were on
                  a road that he did not wish to travel. There were serpents concealed amid the
                  flowers that sprung along their path, and he shuddered as he thought of their
                  poisonous fangs. Quick as a flash of light, these things passed through his mind,
                  and caused him to act with instant resolution. Rising from the chair he had
                  already taken, he retired, without a word, from the room. A sneering laugh
                  followed him, but he either heard it not or gave it no heed.</p>
               <p>The book which Blanche resumed after she had heard her brother go out, soon ceased
                  to interest her. She was too much troubled about him to be able to fix her mind on
                  any thing else. His singularly disturbed state, and the fact of his having left
                  the house at that late hour, caused her to feel great uneasiness. This was
                  beginning to excite her imagination, and to cause her to fancy many reasons for
                  his strange conduct, none of which were calculated in any degree to allay the
                  anxiety she felt. Anxiety was fast verging upon serious alarm, when she heard the
                  sound of footsteps approaching the house. She listened breathlessly. Surely it was
                  the sound of Henry's footsteps! Yes! Yes! It was indeed her brother. The tears
                  gushed from her eyes as she heard him enter below and pass up to his chamber. He
                  was safe from harm, and for this her heart lifted itself up in fervent
                  thankfulness! How near he had been to falling, that pure-minded maiden never knew,
                  nor how it had been her image and the remembrance of her parting kiss that had
                  saved him in the moment of his greatest danger. Happy he who is blest with such a
                  sister! And happier still, if her innocence be suffered to overshadow him in the
                  hours of temptation!</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>THE HOME OF TASTE.</head>
               <p>THERE are three words, in the utterance of which more power over the feelings is
                  gained than in the utterance of any other words in the language. These are
                  "Mother," "Home," and "Heaven." Each appeals to a different emotion—each bears
                  influence over the heart from the cradle to the grave.—And just in the degree that
                  this influence is active, are man's best interests secured for time and
                  eternity.</p>
               <p>Only of "home" do we here intend to speak; and, in particular, as to the influence
                  of the home of taste. We hear much, in these days, of enlarging the sphere of
                  woman's social duties; as if, in the sphere of home, nothing remained to be done,
                  and she must either fold her hands in idleness, or step<pb n="126-127"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000064"/> forth to engage with man in life's sterner
                  conflicts. But it is not true that our homes are as they might be, if their
                  presiding genius fully comprehended all that was needed to make home what the word
                  implies. Among those in poorer circumstances, this is especially so. They are too
                  apt to regard matters of taste as mere superfluities; to speak lightly of order,
                  neatness, and ornament; to think time and money spent on such things as useless.
                  But this is a serious mistake, involving, often, the most lamentable
                  consequences.</p>
               <p>If we expect our children to grow up with a love for things pure and orderly, we
                  must surround them with the representations thereof in the homes where first
                  impressions are formed. The mind rests upon and is moulded by things external to a
                  far greater extent than many suppose. These are not only a mirror, reflecting all
                  that passes before the surface, but a highly sensitive mirror, that, like the
                  Daguerreotype plate, retains the image it receives. If the image be orderly and
                  beautiful, it will ever have power to excite orderly and beautiful thoughts in the
                  mind; but if it be impure and disorderly, its lasting influence will be debasing.
                  If you meet with a coarse, vulgar-minded man or woman, and are able to trace back
                  the thread of life until the period of early years, you will be sure to find the
                  existence of coarse and vulgar influences; and, in most cases, the opposite will
                  alike be found to hold good.</p>
               <p>There is no excuse for disorder in a household, no matter how small or how low the
                  range of income, but idleness or indifference. The time required to maintain
                  neatness, order, and cleanliness, is small, if the will is active and the hands
                  prompt. Every home, even the poorest, may become a home of taste, and present
                  order and forms of beauty, if there is only a willing purpose in the mind.</p>
               <p>It is often charged upon men—particularly operatives with low wages—that they do
                  not love their homes, preferring to spend their evening hours in bar-rooms, or
                  wandering about with other men as little attracted by the household sphere as
                  themselves, until the time for rest. If you were to go into the homes of such, in
                  most cases, you would hardly wonder at the aversion manifested. The dirty,
                  disordered rooms, which their toiling wives deem it a waste of time and labour to
                  make tidy and comfortable for their reception, it would be a perversion to call
                  homes. Home attracts; but these repel. And so, with a feeling of discomfort, the
                  men wander away, fall into temptation, and usually spend, in self-indulgence,
                  money that otherwise would have gone to increase home comforts, if there had been
                  any to increase. And so it is, in its degree, in the homes of every class. The
                  more pleasant, orderly, and tasteful home is made, in all its departments and
                  associations, the stronger is its attractive power, and the more potent its
                  influence over those who are required to go forth into the world and meet its
                  thousand allurements. If every thing is right there, it will surely draw them
                  back, with a steady retraction, through all their absent moments, and they will
                  feel, on repassing the threshold, that, in the wide, wide world, there is no spot
                  to them so full of blessings.</p>
               <p>What true woman does not aspire to be the genius of such a home?</p>

               <head>THE TWO SYSTEMS.</head>
               <p>"IT'S no use to talk; I can't do it. The idea of punishing a child in cold blood
                  makes me shiver all over. I certainly think that, in the mind of any one who can
                  do it, there must be a latent vein of cruelty."</p>
               <p>This remark was made by Mrs. Stanley to her friend and visiter Mrs. Noland.</p>
               <p>"I have known parents," she continued, "who would go about executing some
                  punishment with a coolness and deliberation that to me was frightful. No promise,
                  no appeal, no tear of alarm or agony, from the penitent little culprit, would have
                  the least effect. The law must be fulfilled even to the jot and tittle."</p>
               <p>"The disobedient child, doubtless, knew the law," remarked Mrs. Noland.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps so. But even if it did, great allowance ought to be made for the ardor
                  with which children seek the gratification of their desires, and the readiness
                  with which they forget."</p>
               <p>"No parent should lay down a law not right in itself; nor one obedience to which
                  was not good for the child."</p>
               <p>"But it is very hard to do this. We have not the wisdom of Solomon. Every day,
                  nay, almost every hour, we err in judgment; and especially in a matter so little
                  understood as the management of children."</p>
               <p>"Better, then, have very few laws, and them of the clearest kind. But, having
                  them, implicit obedience should be exacted. At least, that is my rule."</p>
               <p>"And you punish for every infraction?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly. But, I am always sure that the child is fully aware of his fault, and
                  let my punishment be graduated according to the wilfulness of the act."</p>
               <p>"And you do this coolly?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes. I never punish a child while I am excited with a feeling of indignation
                  for the offence."</p>
               <p>"If I waited for that to pass off, I could never punish one of my children."</p>
               <p>"Do you find, under this system, that your children are growing up orderly and
                  obedient?"</p>
               <p>"No, indeed! Of course I do not. Who ever heard of orderly and obedient children?
                  In fact, who would wish their children to be mere automatons? I am sure I would
                  not. They are, by nature, restless, and impatient of control. It will not do to
                  break down their young spirits. As for punishments, I don't believe much in them,
                  any how. I have an idea that the less they are brought into requisition the
                  better. They harden children. Kindness, long suffering, and forbearance will
                  accomplish a great deal more, and in the end be better for the child."</p>
               <p>At this moment a little fellow came sliding into the parlour, with a look that
                  said plainly enough, "I know you don't want me here."</p>
               <p>"Run out, Charley, dear," said Mrs. Stanley, in a mild voice.</p>
               <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC5621-00000066"/>
               <p>But Charley did not seem to notice his mother's words, for he continued advancing
                  toward her, until he was by her side, when he paused and looked the visiter
                  steadily in the face.</p>
               <p>"Charley, you must run out, my dear," said Mrs. Stanley, in a firmer and more
                  decided voice.</p>
               <p>But Charley only leaned heavily against his mother, not heeding in the smallest
                  degree her words. Knowing how impossible it would be to get the child out of the
                  room, without a resort to violence, Mrs. Stanley said no more to him, but
                  continued the conversation with her friend. She had only spoken a few words,
                  however, before Charley interrupted her by saying—</p>
               <p>"Mother!—Mother!—Give me a piece of cake."</p>
               <p>"No, my son. You have had cake enough this afternoon," replied Mrs. Stanley.</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, do, mother, give me a piece of cake."</p>
               <p>"It will make you sick, Charley."</p>
               <p>"No, it won't. Please give me some."</p>
               <p>"I had rather not."</p>
               <p>"Yes, mother. Oh do! I want a piece of cake."</p>
               <p>"Go 'way, Charles, and don't tease me."</p>
               <p>There was a slight expression of impatience in the mother's voice. The child
                  ceased his importunities for a few moments, but just as Mrs. Stanley had commenced
                  a sentence, intended to embody some wise saying in regard to the management of
                  children, the little boy broke in upon her with—</p>
               <p>"I say, mother, give me a piece of cake, won't you?" in quite a loud voice.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Stanley felt irritated by this importunity, but she governed herself.
                  Satisfied that there would be no peace unless the cake were forthcoming, she said,
                  looking affectionately at the child:</p>
               <p>"Poor little fellow! I suppose he does feel hungry. I don't think another piece of
                  cake will hurt him. Excuse me a moment, Mrs. Noland."</p>
               <p>The cake was obtained by Charley in the very way he had, hundreds of times before,
                  accomplished his purpose, that is, by teasing it out of his mother. For the next
                  ten minutes the friends conversed, unmolested. At the end of that time Charley
                  again made his appearance.</p>
               <p>"Go up into the nursery, and stay with Ellen," said Mrs. Stanley.</p>
               <p>The child took no notice, whatever, of this direction, but walked steadily up to
                  where his mother was sitting, saying, as he paused by her side—</p>
               <p>"I want another piece of cake."</p>
               <p>"Not any more, my son."</p>
               <p>"Yes, mother. Give me some more."</p>
               <p>"No." This was spoken in a very positive way. Charley began to beg in a whining
                  tone, which, not producing the desired effect, soon rose into a well-defined
                  cry.</p>
               <p>"I declare! I never saw such a hungry set as my children are. They will eat
                  constantly from morning until night." Mrs. Stanley did not say this in the most
                  amiable tone of voice.</p>
               <p>"Mother! I want a piece of cake," cried Charley.</p>
               <p>"I'll give you one little piece more; but, remember, that it will be the last; so
                  don't ask me again."</p>
               <p>Charley stopped crying at once. Mrs. Stanley went out with him. As soon as she was
                  far enough from the parlour not to be heard, she took Charley<pb n="132-133"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000067"/> by the shoulders, and giving him a violent shake,
                  said—</p>
               <p>"You little rebel, you! If you come into the parlour again, I'll skin you!"</p>
               <p>The cake was given. Charley cared about as much for the threat as he did for the
                  shaking. He had gained his end.</p>
               <p>"I pray daily for patience to bear with my children," said Mrs. Stanley, on
                  returning to the parlour. "They try us severely."</p>
               <p>"That they do," replied Mrs. Noland. "But it is in our power, by firmness,
                  consistency, and kindness, to render our tasks comparatively light."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps so. I try to be firm, and consistent, and kind with my children; to
                  exercise toward them constant forbearance; but, after all, it is very hard to know
                  exactly how to govern them."</p>
               <p>"Mother, can't I go over into the square?" asked Emma, looking into the parlour
                  just at this time. She was a little girl about eight years old.</p>
               <p>"I would rather not have you go, my dear," returned Mrs. Stanley.</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, mother, do let me go," urged Emma.</p>
               <p>"Ellen can't go with you now; and I do not wish you to go alone."</p>
               <p>"I can go well enough, mother."</p>
               <p>"Well, run along then, you intolerable little tease, you!"</p>
               <p>Emma scampered away, and Mrs. Stanley remarked—</p>
               <p>"That is the way. They gain their ends by importunity."</p>
               <p>"But should you allow that, my friend?"</p>
               <p>"There was no particular reason why Emma should not go to the square. I didn't
                  think, at first, when I said I would rather not have her go, or I would have said
                  'yes' at once. It is so difficult to decide upon children's requests on the spur
                  of the moment."</p>
               <p>"But after you had said that you did not want her to go to the square, would it
                  not have been better to have made her abide by your wishes?"</p>
               <p>"I don't think it would have been right for me to have deprived the child of the
                  pleasure of playing in the square, from the mere pride of consistency. I was wrong
                  in objecting at first—to have adhered to my objection would have been still a
                  greater wrong; —don't you think so?"</p>
               <p>"I do not," returned Mrs. Noland. "I know of no greater evil in a family, than for
                  the children to discover that their parents vacillate in any matter regarding
                  them. A denial once made to any request should be positive, even if, in a moment
                  after, it be seen to have been made without sufficient reason."</p>
               <p>"I cannot agree with you. Justice, I hold, to be paramount in all things. We
                  should never wrong a child."</p>
               <p>The third appearance of Charley again broke in upon the conversation.</p>
               <p>"Give me another piece of cake, mother."</p>
               <p>"What! Didn't I tell you that there was no more for you? No! you cannot have
                  another morsel."</p>
               <p>"I want some more cake," whined the child.</p>
               <p>"Not a crumb more, sir."</p>
               <p>The whine rose into a cry.</p>
               <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC5621-00000068"/>
               <p>"Go up stairs, sir."</p>
               <p>Charley did not move.</p>
               <p>"Go this instant."</p>
               <p>"Give me some cake."</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>The cry swelled into a loud bawl.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Stanley became excessively annoyed. "I never saw such persevering children in
                  my life," said she, impatiently. "They don't regard what I say any more than if I
                  had not spoken. Charles! Go out of the parlour this moment!"</p>
               <p>The tone in which this was uttered the child understood. He left the parlour
                  slowly, but continued to cry at the top of his voice. The parlour bell was rung,
                  and Ellen the nurse appeared.</p>
               <p>"Do, Ellen, give that boy another piece of cake! There is no other way to keep him
                  quiet."</p>
               <p>In about three minutes after this direction had been given, all was still again.
                  Mrs. Stanley now changed the topic of conversation. Her manner was not quite so
                  cheerful as before. The conduct of Charley had worried and mortified her.</p>
               <p>The last piece of cake had not been really wanted. Charley asked for it because a
                  spirit of opposition had been aroused, but he had no appetite to eat it. It was
                  crumbled about the floor and wasted. His mother had peace for the next hour. After
                  that she went into the kitchen to give directions, and make some preparations for
                  tea. Charley was by her side.</p>
               <p>"Ellen, take this child out," said she.</p>
               <p>Ellen took hold of Charley's arm.</p>
               <p>"No!—no!—Go 'way, Ellen!" he screamed.</p>
               <p>"There!—there!—never mind. Let him stay," said the mother.</p>
               <p>A jar of preserved fruit was brought forth.</p>
               <p>"Give me some?" asked Charley.</p>
               <p>"No, not now. You will get some at the table."</p>
               <p>"I want some now. Give me some now."</p>
               <p>A spoonful of the preserves was put into a saucer, and given to the child.</p>
               <p>"Give me some more," said he, holding up his saucer in about half a minute.</p>
               <p>"No. Wait until tea is ready."</p>
               <p>"Give me some sweetmeats. I want more, mother!"</p>
               <p>"I tell you, no."</p>
               <p>A loud bawl followed.</p>
               <p>"I declare this child will worry me to death!" exclaimed the mother, her mind all
                  in confusion, lading out a large spoonful of the fruit, and putting it into his
                  saucer.</p>
               <p>When this was eaten, still more was demanded, and peremptorily refused. Crying was
                  resorted to, but without effect, though it was loud and deafening. Finding this
                  unsuccessful, the spoiled urchin determined to help himself. As soon as his
                  mother's back was turned, he clambered up to the table and seized the jar
                  containing the preserves. In pulling it over far enough to get his spoon into it,
                  the balance of the jar was destroyed, and over it went, rolling off upon the
                  floor, and breaking with a loud crash. At the moment this occurred, Mrs. Stanley
                  entered the room. Her patience, that had been severely tried, was now completely
                  overthrown. She was angry enough to punish her child, and feel a delight in
                     doing<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC5621-00000069"/> ing so. Seizing him by one
                  arm, she lifted him from the floor, as if he had been but a feather, and hurried
                  with him up to her chamber. There she whipped him unmercifully, and then put him
                  to bed. He continued to cry after she had done so, when she commanded him to stop
                  in a voice that he dared not disobey. An hour afterward, when much cooled down,
                  she passed through the chamber. She looked down upon her little boy with a feeling
                  of repentance for her anger and the severity of her punishment. This feeling was
                  in no way mitigated on hearing the child sob in his sleep. The mother felt very
                  unhappy.</p>
               <p>So much for Mrs. Stanley—so much for her tenderness of feeling—so much for her
                  warm-blooded system. Its effects need not be exposed further. Its folly need not
                  be set in any plainer light.</p>
               <p>Some weeks afterward she was spending an afternoon with Mrs. Noland. Her favourite
                  topic was the management of children, and she introduced it as usual, inveighing
                  as was her wont against the cruelty of punishing children—especially in cold
                  blood, as she called it. For her part, she never punished except in extreme cases,
                  and not then, unless provoked to do so. Unless she felt angry, and punished on the
                  spur of the moment, she could not do it at all. During the conversation, which was
                  led pretty much by Mrs. Stanley, a child, about the age of Charley, came into the
                  parlour. He walked up to his mother and whispered some request in her ear.</p>
               <p>"Oh no, Master Harry!" was the smiling, but decided reply.</p>
               <p>The child lingered with a look of disappointment. At length he came up, and
                  kissing his mother, asked again, in a sweet, earnest way, for what he had been at
                  first denied.</p>
               <p>"After I said no!" And Mrs. Noland looked gravely into his face.</p>
               <p>Tears came into Henry's eyes. But he said no more. In a moment or two he silently
                  left the room.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Noland! How could you resist that dear little fellow? I declare it was right
                  down cruel in you."</p>
               <p>The eyes of Mrs. Stanley glistened as she spoke.</p>
               <p>"It would have been far more cruel to him if I had yielded, after once having said
                  'no'—far more cruel had I given him what I knew would have injured him."</p>
               <p>"But, I don't see how you could refuse so dear a child, when he asked you in such
                  a sweet, affectionate manner. I should have given him any thing in the world he
                  had asked for."</p>
               <p>"That's not my way. I say 'no' only when I have good reason, and then I never
                  change."</p>
               <p>"Never?"</p>
               <p>"Never."</p>
               <p>Henry appeared at the parlour door again.</p>
               <p>"Come in, dear," said Mrs. Noland.</p>
               <p>The child came quickly forward, put up his mouth to kiss her, and then nestled
                  closely by his mother's side. The conversation continued, without the slightest
                  interruption from him.</p>
               <p>"Dear little fellow," said Mrs. Stanley, once or twice, looking into the child's
                  face, and smoothing his hair with her hand.</p>
               <p>When the tea bell rung, the family assembled in<pb n="138-139"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000070"/> the dining-room. A visiter made it necessary that
                  one of the children should wait. Henry was by the table as usual.</p>
               <p>"Harry, dear," said his mother, "you will have to wait and come with Ellen."</p>
               <p>The child felt very much disappointed. He looked up into his mother's face for a
                  moment, and then, without a word, went out of the room.</p>
               <p>"Poor little fellow! It is really a pity to make him wait; and he is so good,"
                  said Mrs. Stanley. "I am sure we can make room for him. Do call him back, and let
                  him sit by me."</p>
               <p>And she moved close to one of the older children as she spoke. "Here is plenty of
                  room."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Noland thought for a moment, and then told the waiter to call Henry back. The
                  child came in as quietly as he had gone out, and came up to his mother's side.</p>
               <p>"My dear," said Mrs. Noland, "this good lady here has made room for you by her
                  side. You can go and sit by her."</p>
               <p>The child's face brightened. He went quickly and took the offered seat. By the
                  time tea was over, Henry had fallen asleep in his chair. Mrs. Noland, when all
                  arose from the table, took Henry in her arms, and went with him, accompanied by
                  Mrs. Stanley, to her chamber, where she undressed him, and kissing fondly his
                  bright young cheek, laid him in his little bed.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Stanley stood for some moments over the sleeping child, and looked down upon
                  his calm face. As she did so, she remembered her own little Charley, and under
                  what different circumstances and feelings he had been put to bed on the evening of
                  Mrs. Noland's visit to her.</p>
               <p>Whether the contrast did her any good, we have no means of knowing. We trust the
                  lesson was not without its good effect upon her.</p>

               <head>THE EVENING PRAYER.</head>
               <head type="sub">"Our Father."</head>
               <p>"OUR Father." The mother's voice was low, and tender, and solemn.</p>
               <p>"Our Father." On two sweet voices the words were borne upward. It was the
                  innocence of reverent childhood that gave them utterance.</p>
               <p>"Who art in the heavens."</p>
               <p>"Who art in the heavens," repeated the children, one with her eyes bent meekly
                  down, and the other looking upward, as if she would penetrate the heavens into
                  which her heart aspired.</p>
               <p>"Hallowed be Thy name."</p>
               <p>Lower fell the voices of the little ones. In a gentle murmur they said: "Hallowed
                  be Thy name."</p>
               <p>"Thy kingdom come."</p>
               <p>And the burden of the prayer was still taken up by the children—"Thy kingdom
                  come."</p>
               <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC5621-00000071"/>
               <p>"Thy will be done on earth, as it is done in heaven."</p>
               <p>Like a low, sweet echo from the land of angels—"Thy will be done on earth, as it
                  is done in heaven," filled the chamber.</p>
               <p>And the mother continued—"Give us this day our daily bread."</p>
               <p>"Our daily bread" lingered a moment on the air, as the mother's voice was hushed
                  into silence.</p>
               <p>"And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors."</p>
               <p>The eyes of the children had drooped for a moment. But they were uplifted again as
                  they prayed —"And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors."</p>
               <p>"And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the
                  kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen."</p>
               <p>All these holy words were said, piously and fervently, by the little ones, as they
                  knelt with clasped hands beside their mother. Then, as their thoughts, uplifted on
                  the wings of prayer to their heavenly Father, came back again and rested on their
                  earthly parents, a warmer love came gushing from their hearts.</p>
               <p>Pure kisses—tender embraces—the fond "good night." What a sweet agitation pervaded
                  all their feelings! Then two dear heads were placed side by side on the snowy
                  pillow, the mother's last kiss given, and the shadowy curtains drawn.</p>
               <p>What a pulseless stillness reigns throughout the chamber! Inwardly the parents'
                  listening ears are bent. They have given these innocent ones into the keeping of
                  God's angels, and they can almost hear the rustle of their garments as they gather
                  around their sleeping babes. A sigh, deep and tremulous, breaks on the air.
                  Quickly the mother turns to the father of her children, with a look of earnest
                  inquiry on her countenance. And he answers thus her silent question.</p>
               <p>"Far back, through many years, have my thoughts been wandering. At my mother's
                  knee thus said I nightly, in childhood, my evening prayer. It was that best and
                  holiest of all prayers, "Our Father," that she taught me. Childhood and my mother
                  passed away. I went forth as a man into the world, strong, confident, and
                  self-seeking. Once I came into great temptation. Had I fallen in that temptation,
                  I would have fallen, I sadly fear, never to have risen again. The struggle in my
                  mind went on for hours. I was about yielding. All the barriers I could oppose to
                  the in-rushing flood seemed just ready to give way, when, as I sat in my room one
                  evening, there came from an adjoining chamber, now first occupied for many weeks,
                  the murmur of low voices. I listened. At first, no articulate sound was heard, and
                  yet something in the tones stirred my heart with new and strange emotions. At
                  length, there came to my ears, in the earnest, loving voice of a woman, the
                  words—'Deliver us from evil.' For an instant, it seemed to me as if the voice were
                  that of my mother. Back, with a sudden bound through all the intervening years,
                  went my thoughts; and, a child in heart again, I was kneeling at my mother's knee.
                  Humbly and reverently I said over the words of the holy prayer she<pb n="142-143"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000072"/> had taught me, heart and eyes uplifted to heaven.
                  The hour and the power of darkness had passed. I was no longer standing in
                  slippery places, with a flood of waters ready to sweep me to destruction; but my
                  feet were on a rock. My mother's pious care had saved her son. In the holy words
                  she taught me in childhood, was a living power to resist evil through all my after
                  life. Ah! that unknown mother, as she taught her child to repeat his evening
                  prayer, how little dreamed she that the holy words were to reach a stranger's
                  ears, and save him through memories of his own childhood and his own mother! And
                  yet it was so. What a power there is in God's Word, as it flows into and rests in
                  the minds of innocent children!"</p>
               <p>Tears were in the eyes of the wife and mother as she lifted her face, and gazed
                  with a subdued tenderness upon the countenance of her husband. Her heart was too
                  full for utterance. A little while she thus gazed, and then, with a trembling joy,
                  laid her head upon his bosom. Angels were in the chamber where their dear ones
                  slept, and they felt their holy presence.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>A PEEVISH DAY, AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.</head>
               <p>"IT is too bad, Rachael, to put me to all this trouble; and you know I can hardly
                  hold up my head!"</p>
               <p>Thus spoke Mrs. Smith, in a peevish voice, to a quiet-looking domestic, who had
                  been called up from the kitchen to supply some unimportant omission in the
                  breakfast-table arrangement.</p>
               <p>Rachael looked hurt and rebuked, but made no reply.</p>
               <p>"How could you speak in that way to Rachael?" said Mr. Smith, as soon as the
                  domestic had withdrawn.</p>
               <p>"If you felt just as I do, Mr. Smith, you would speak cross too!" Mrs. Smith
                  replied a little warmly. "I feel just like a rag; and my head aches as if it would
                  burst."</p>
               <p>"I know you feel badly, and I am very sorry for you. But still, I suppose it is as
                  easy to speak kindly as harshly. Rachael is very obliging and attentive, and
                  should be borne with in occasional omissions, which you of course know are not
                  wilful."</p>
               <p>"It is easy enough to preach," retorted Mrs. Smith, whose temper, from bodily
                  lassitude and pain, was in quite an irritable state. The reader will understand at
                  least one of the reasons of this, when<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC5621-00000073"/>
                  he is told that the scene here presented occurred during the last oppressive week
                  in August.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith said no more. He saw that to do so would only be to provoke instead of
                  quieting his wife's ill-humour. The morning meal went by in silence, but little
                  food passing the lips of either. How could it, when the thermometer was
                  ninety-four at eight o'clock in the morning, and the leaves upon the trees were as
                  motionless as if suspended in a vacuum? Bodies and minds were relaxed—and the one
                  turned from food, as the other did from thought, with an instinctive aversion.</p>
               <p>After Mr. Smith had left his home for his place of business, Mrs. Smith went up
                  into her chamber, and threw herself upon the bed, her head still continuing to
                  ache with great violence. It so happened that a week before, the chambermaid had
                  gone away, sick, and all the duties of the household had in consequence devolved
                  upon Rachael, herself not very well. Cheerfully, however, had she endeavoured to
                  discharge these accumulated duties, and but for the unhappy, peevish state of mind
                  in which Mrs. Smith indulged, would have discharged them without a murmuring
                  thought. But, as she was a faithful, conscientious woman, and, withal, sensitive
                  in her feelings, to be found fault with worried her exceedingly. Of this Mrs.
                  Smith was well aware, and had, until the latter part of the trying month of
                  August, acted toward Rachael with consideration and forbearance. But the last week
                  of August was too much for her. The sickness of the chambermaid threw such heavy
                  duties upon Rachael, whose daily headaches and nervous relaxation of body were
                  borne without a complaint, that their perfect performance was almost impossible.
                  Slight omissions, which were next to unavoidable under the circumstances, became
                  so annoying to Mrs. Smith, herself, as it has been seen, labouring under great
                  bodily and mental prostration, that she could not bear them.</p>
               <p>"She knows better, and she could do better, if she chose," was her rather
                  uncharitable comment often inwardly made on the occurrence of some new
                  trouble.</p>
               <p>After Mr. Smith had taken his departure on the morning just referred to, Mrs.
                  Smith went up into her chamber, as has been seen, and threw herself languidly upon
                  a bed, pressing her hands to her throbbing temples, as she did so, and
                  murmuring,</p>
               <p>"I can't live at this rate!"</p>
               <p>At the same time, Rachael set down in the kitchen the large waiter upon which she
                  had arranged the dishes from the breakfast-table, and then sinking into a chair,
                  pressed one hand upon her forehead, and sat for more than a minute in troubled
                  silence. It had been three days since she had received from Mrs. Smith a pleasant
                  word; and the last remark, made to her a short time before, had been the unkindest
                  of all. At another time, even all this would not have moved her—she could have
                  perceived that Mrs. S. was not in a right state—that lassitude of body had
                  produced a temporary infirmity of mind. But, being herself affected by the
                  oppressive season almost as much as her mistress, she could not make these
                  allowances. While still seated, the chamber-bell was rung with a quick, startling
                  jerk.</p>
               <p>"What next?" peevishly ejaculated Rachael, and then slowly proceeded to obey the
                  summons.</p>
               <pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC5621-00000074"/>
               <p>"How could you leave my chamber in such a condition as this?" was the salutation
                  that met her ear, as she entered the presence of Mrs. Smith, who, half raised upon
                  the bed, and leaning upon her hand, looked the very personification of languor,
                  peevishness, and ill-humour. "You had plenty of time while we were eating
                  breakfast to have put things a little to rights!"</p>
               <p>To this Rachael made no reply, but turned away and went back into the kitchen. She
                  had scarcely reached that spot, before the bell rang again, louder and quicker
                  than before; but she did not answer it. In about three minutes it was jerked with
                  an energy that snapped the wire, but Rachael was immovable. Five minutes elapsed,
                  and then Mrs. Smith, fully aroused from the lethargy that had stolen over her,
                  came down with a quick, firm step.</p>
               <p>"What's the reason you didn't answer my bell? say!" she asked, in an excited
                  voice.</p>
               <p>Rachael did not reply.</p>
               <p>"Do you hear me?"</p>
               <p>Rachael had never been so treated before; she had lived with Mrs. Smith for three
                  years, and had rarely been found fault with. She had been too strict in regard to
                  the performance of her duty to leave much room for even a more exacting mistress
                  to find fault; but now, to be overtasked and sick, and to be chidden, rebuked, and
                  even angrily assailed, was more than she could well bear. She did not suffer
                  herself to speak for some moments, and then her voice trembled, and the tears came
                  out upon her cheeks.</p>
               <p>"I wish you to get another in my place. I find I don't suit you. My time will be
                  up day after tomorrow."</p>
               <p>"Very well," was Mrs. Smith's firm reply, as she turned away, and left the
                  kitchen.</p>
               <p>Here was trouble in good earnest. Often and often had Mrs. Smith said, during the
                  past two or three years—"What should I do without Rachael?" And now she had given
                  notice that she was going to leave her, and under circumstances which made pride
                  forbid a request to stay. Determined to act out her part of the business with
                  firmness and decision, she dressed herself and went out, hot and oppressive as it
                  was, and took her way to an intelligence office, where she paid the required fee
                  and directed a cook and chambermaid to be sent to her. On the next morning, about
                  ten o'clock, an Irish girl came and offered herself as a cook, and was, after
                  sundry questions and answers, engaged. So soon as this negotiation was settled,
                  Rachael retired from the kitchen, leaving the new-comer in full possession. In
                  half an hour after she received her wages, and left, in no very happy frame of
                  mind, a home that had been for three years, until within a few days, a pleasant
                  one. As for Mrs. Smith, she was ready to go to bed sick; but this was
                  impracticable. Nancy, the new cook, had expressly stipulated that she was to have
                  no duties unconnected with the kitchen. The consequence was, that notwithstanding
                  the thermometer ranged above ninety, and the atmosphere remained as sultry as air
                  from a heated oven, Mrs. Smith was compelled to arrange her chamber and parlours.
                  By the time this was done, she was in a condition to go to bed, and lie until
                     dinner-time.<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC5621-00000075"/> The arrival of this
                  important period brought new troubles and vexations. Dinner was late by forty
                  minutes, and then came on the table in a most abominable condition. A fine sirloin
                  was burnt to a crisp. The tomatoes were smoked, and the potatoes watery. As if
                  this was not enough to mar the pleasure of the dinner hour for a hungry husband,
                  Mrs. Smith added thereto a distressed countenance and discouraging complaints.
                  Nancy was grumbled at and scolded every time she had occasion to appear in the
                  room, and her single attempt to excuse herself on account of not understanding the
                  cook-stove, was met by, "Do hush, will you! I'm out of all patience!"</p>
               <p>As to the latter part of the sentence, that was a needless waste of words. The
                  condition of mind she described was fully apparent.</p>
               <p>About three o'clock in the afternoon, just as Mrs. Smith had found a temporary
                  relief from a troubled mind, and a most intolerable headache, in sleep, a tap on
                  the chamber-door awoke her, and there stood Nancy, all equipped for going out.</p>
               <p>"I find I won't suit you, ma'am," said Nancy, "and so you must look out for
                  another girl."</p>
               <p>Having said this, she turned away and took her departure, leaving Mrs. Smith in a
                  state of mind, as it is said, "more easily imagined than described."</p>
               <p>"Oh dear! what shall I do?" at length broke from her lips, as she burst into
                  tears, and burying her face in the pillow, sobbed aloud. Already she had repented
                  of her fretfulness and fault-finding temper, as displayed toward Rachael, and
                  could she have made a truce with pride, or silenced its whispers, would have sent
                  for her well-tried domestic, and endeavoured to make all fair with her again. But,
                  under the circumstances, this was now impossible. While yet undetermined how to
                  act, the street-bell rung, and she was compelled to attend the door, as she was
                  now alone in the house. She found, on opening it, a rough-looking country girl,
                  who asked if she were the lady who wanted a chambermaid. Any kind of help was
                  better than none at all, and so Mrs. Smith asked the young woman to walk in. In
                  treating with her in regard to her qualifications for the situation she applied
                  for, she discovered that she knew "almost nothing at all about any thing." The
                  stipulation that she was to be a doer-of-all-work-in-general, until a cook could
                  be obtained, was readily agreed to, and then she was shown to her room in the
                  attic, where she prepared herself for entering upon her duties.</p>
               <p>"Will you please, ma'am, show me what you want me to do?" asked the new help,
                  presenting herself before Mrs. Smith.</p>
               <p>"Go into the kitchen, Ellen, and see that the fire is made. I'll be down there
                  presently."</p>
               <p>To be compelled to see after a new and ignorant servant, and direct her in every
                  thing, just at so trying a season of the year, and while her mind was "all out of
                  sorts," was a severe task for poor Mrs. Smith. She found that Ellen, as she had
                  too good reason for believing, was totally unacquainted with kitchen-work. She did
                  not even know how to kindle a coal fire; nor could she manage the stove after Mrs.
                  Smith had made the fire for her. All this did not in any way tend to make her less
                  unhappy or more patient than before. On retiring for the night<pb n="150-151"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000076"/> she had a high fever, which continued unabated
                  until morning, when her husband found her really ill; so much so as to make the
                  attendance of a doctor necessary.</p>
               <p>A change in the air had taken place during the night, and the temperature had
                  fallen many degrees. This aided the efforts of the physician, and enabled him so
                  to adapt his remedies as to speedily break the fever. But the ignorance and
                  awkwardness of Ellen, apparent in her attempts to arrange her bed and chamber, so
                  worried her mind, that she was near relapsing into her former feverish and excited
                  state. The attendance of an elder maiden sister was just in time. All care was
                  taken from her thoughts, and she had a chance of recovering a more healthy tone of
                  mind and body. During the next week, she knew little or nothing of how matters
                  were progressing out of her own chamber. A new cook had been hired, of whom she
                  was pleased to hear good accounts, although she had not seen her; and Ellen, under
                  the mild and judicious instruction of her sister, had learned to make up a bed
                  neatly, to sweep, and dust in true style, and to perform all the little etceteras
                  of chamber-work, greatly to her satisfaction. She was, likewise, good-tempered,
                  willing, and to all appearance strictly trustworthy.</p>
               <p>One morning, about a week after she had become too ill to keep up, she found
                  herself so far recovered as to be able to go down stairs to breakfast. Every thing
                  upon the table she found arranged in the neatest style. The food was well cooked,
                  especially some tender rice cakes, of which she was very fond.</p>
               <p>"Really, these are delicious!" said she, as the finely flavoured cakes almost
                  melted in her mouth. "And this coffee is just the thing! How fortunate we have
                  been to obtain so good a cook! I was afraid we should never be able to replace
                  Rachael. But even she is equalled, if not surpassed."</p>
               <p>"Still she does not surpass Rachael," said Mr. Smith, a little gravely. "Rachael
                  was a treasure."</p>
               <p>"Indeed she was. And I have been sorry enough I ever let her go," returned Mrs.
                  Smith.</p>
               <p>At that moment the new cook entered with a plate of warm cakes.</p>
               <p>"Rachael!" ejaculated Mrs. Smith, letting her knife and fork fall. "How do you do?
                  I am glad to see you! Welcome home again!"</p>
               <p>As she spoke quickly and earnestly, she held out her hand, and grasped that of her
                  old domestic warmly. Rachael could not speak, but as she left the room she put her
                  apron to her eyes. Hers were not the only one's dim with rising moisture.</p>
               <p>For at least a year to come both Mrs. Smith and her excellent cook will have no
                  cause to complain of each other. How they will get along during the last week of
                  next August we cannot say, but hope the lesson they have both received will teach
                  them to bear and forbear.</p>

                  <ref target="#return_002">*</ref>[We make the following extract from one of our
                  books—"Advice to Young Men on their Duties and Conduct in Life."]</note>
               <p>IF you have younger sisters, who are just entering society, all your interest
                  should be awakened for them. You cannot but have seen some little below the
                  surface, and already made the discovery that too few of the young men who move
                  about in the various social circles to which you have admission, are fit
                  associates for a pure-minded woman. Their exterior, it is true, is very fair; they
                  sing well, they dance well, their persons are elegant, and their manners
                  attractive; but you have met them when they felt none of the restraints of female
                  society, and seen them unmask their real characters. You can remember the ribald
                  jest, the obscene allusion, the sneer at virtue, the unblushing acknowledgment of
                  licentiousness. You have heard them speak of this sweet girl, and that pure-minded
                  woman, in terms that would have roused your deepest indignation, had your own
                  sister been the subject of allusion.</p>
               <p>You may know all these things, but your innocent sisters at home cannot know them,
                  nor see reason for shunning the society of those whose real characters, if
                  revealed, would cause them to turn away in disgust and horror. From the dangers of
                  an acquaintanceship with such young men it is your duty to guard your sisters; and
                  you must do this more by warding off the evil than by warnings against it. In
                  order to this, you should make it a point of duty always to go with your sisters
                  into company, and to be their companion, if possible, on all public occasions. By
                  so doing, you can prevent the introduction of men whose principles are bad; or, if
                  such introductions are forced upon them in spite of you, can throw in a timely
                  word of caution. This latter it may be too late to do after an acquaintanceship is
                  formed with a man whose character is detestable in your eyes, provided he have a
                  fair exterior. Your sister will hardly be made to believe that one who is so
                  attractive in all respects, and who can converse of virtue and honour so
                  eloquently, can possibly have an impure or vicious mind. She will think you
                  prejudiced. The great thing is to guard, by every means in your power, these
                  innocent ones from the polluting presence of a bad man. You cannot tell how soon
                  he may win the affections of the most innocent, confiding, and loving of them all,
                  and draw her off from virtue. And even if his designs be honourable—if he win her
                  but to wed her—her lot will be by no means an enviable one; he cannot make her
                  happy; for happy no pure-minded woman ever has been, or ever can be made, by a
                  corrupt, evil-minded, and selfish man.</p>
               <p>You are a brother; your position is one of great responsibility; let this be ever
                  before your mind.<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC5621-00000078"/> On your faithfulness
                  to your duty, may depend a lifetime of happiness or misery for those who are, or
                  ought to be, very dear to you. But not only should you seek to guard them from the
                  danger just alluded to—your affection for them should lead you to enter into their
                  pleasures as far as in your power to do so; to give interest and variety to the
                  home circle; to afford them, at all times, the assistance of your judgment in
                  matters of trivial as well as grave importance. By this you will gain their
                  confidence and acquire an influence over them that may, at some later period,
                  enable you to serve them in a moment of impending danger.</p>
               <p>We very often—indeed, far too often—see young men with sisters who appear to be
                  entirely indifferent in regard to them. They rarely visit together; their
                  associates, male and female, are strangers to each other; they appear to have no
                  common interests. This state of things is the fault, nine times in ten, of the
                  young men. It is the result of their neglect and indifference. There are very few
                  sisters who do not love with a most tender and unselfish regard their brothers,
                  especially their elder brothers, and who would not feel happier in being their
                  companions than in the companionship of almost any one. Notwithstanding all this
                  neglect and indifference, how willingly is every little office performed that adds
                  to the brother's comfort! How much care is there for him who gives back so little
                  in return! The sister's love is as unselfish as it is unostentatious. It is shown
                  in acts, not in professions. How can any young man be indifferent to such love?
                  How can he fail in its full and free reciprocation?</p>
               <p>A regard for himself, as well as for his sisters, should lead a young man to be
                  much with them. Their influence in softening, polishing, and refining his
                  character, will be very great. They have perceptions of the propriety and fitness
                  of things far quicker than he has; and this he will soon see if he observe their
                  remarks upon the persons with whom they come in contact, and the circumstances
                  that transpire around them. While he is reasoning on the subject, and balancing
                  many things in his mind before coming to a satisfactory conclusion, they, by a
                  kind of intuition, have settled the whole matter, and settled it, he will find,
                  truly. In the graver things of life, a man's judgment is more to be relied upon
                  than a woman's, because here a regular course of reasoning from premises laid down
                  is required, and this a man is much more able to do than a woman; but in matters
                  of taste and propriety, and in the quick appreciation of character, a woman's
                  perceptions are worth far more than a man's judgment. And in the more weighty and
                  serious matters of life, a man will always find that he will receive aid, in
                  coming to a nice decision, from a wife or sister who loves him, if he will only
                  carefully lay the whole subject before her, with the reasons that appeal to his
                  judgment, and be guided in some measure by her perceptions of what is right. This
                  is because man is in the province of the understanding, which acts by thought, and
                  woman in the province of the affections, which act by perceptions; not that a man
                  does not have perceptions and a woman reason, but the leading characteristic
                  difference between the sexes is as stated, and each comes to conclusions<pb
                     n="156-157" xml:id="VAC5621-00000079"/> mainly by either the one or the other
                  of these two modes. This position, which we believe to be the true one in regard
                  to the difference between the sexes, demonstrates the great use of female society,
                  especially the society of those who feel some interest in and affection for us. In
                  such society, there is a reciprocation of benefits that is nearly, if not quite,
                  equal. And nowhere can this reciprocation be of greater utility than among
                  brothers and sisters, just entering upon life, with all their knowledge of human
                  character and human life to gain.</p>

                  duties of a sister to her brother, are taken from a volume by the Author of this
                  book, entitled, "Advice to Young Ladies on their Duties and Conduct in
                  Life."]</note>
               <p>OLDER brothers are not usually as attentive to their younger sisters as the latter
                  would feel to be agreeable. The little girls that were so long known as children,
                  with the foibles, faults, and caprices of children, although now grown up into
                  tall young ladies, who have left or are about leaving school, are still felt to be
                  children, or but a little advanced beyond childhood, by the young men who have had
                  some three or four years' experience in the world. With these older brothers,
                  there will not usually be, arising from this cause, much confidential and
                  unreserved intercourse; at least, not until the sisters have added two or three
                  years more to their ages, and assumed more of the quiet dignity of womanhood.</p>
               <p>Upon these older brothers, therefore, the conduct of sisters cannot, usually, have
                  much effect. They are removed to a point chiefly beyond the circle of their
                  influence. But upon brothers near about their own age, and younger than
                  themselves, the influence of sisters may be brought to bear with the most salutary
                  results.</p>
               <p>The temptations to which young men are exposed, when first they come in contact
                  with the world, are many, and full of the strongest allurements. Their virtuous
                  principles are assailed in a thousand ways; sometimes boldly, and sometimes by the
                  most insidious arts of the vicious and evil-minded. All, therefore, that can make
                  virtue lovely in their eyes, and vice hideous, they need to strengthen the good
                  principles stored up, from childhood, in their minds. For their sakes, home should
                  be made as attractive as possible, in order to induce them frequently to spend
                  their evenings in the place where, of all others, they will be safest. To do this,
                  a young lady must consult the tastes of her brothers, and endeavour to take
                  sufficient interest in the pursuits that interest them, as to make herself
                  companionable. If they are fond of music, one of the strongest incentives she can
                  have for attaining the highest possible skill in performing upon the piano, will
                  be the hope of making home, thereby, the most attractive place where they can
                  spend their evenings. If they are fond of<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC5621-00000080"
                  /> reading, let her read, as far as she can, the books that interest them, in
                  order that she may take part in their conversations; and let her, in every other
                  possible way, furnish herself with the means of making home agreeable.</p>
               <p>There is no surer way for a sister to gain an influence with her brother, than to
                  cultivate all exterior graces and accomplishments, and improve her mind by
                  reading, thinking, and observation. By these means she not only becomes his
                  intelligent companion, but inspires him with a feeling of generous pride toward
                  her, that, more than any thing else, impresses her image upon his mind, brings her
                  at all times nearer to him, and gives her a double power over him for good.</p>
               <p>The indifference felt by brothers toward their sisters, when it does exist, often
                  arises from the fact that their sisters are inferior, in almost every thing, to
                  the women they are in the habit of meeting abroad. Where this is the case, such
                  indifference is not so much to be wondered at.</p>
               <p>Sisters should always endeavour to gain, as much as possible, the confidence of
                  their brothers, and to give them their confidence in return. Mutual good offices
                  will result from this, and attachments that could only produce unhappiness may be
                  prevented. A man sees more of men than woman does, and the same is true in regard
                  to the other sex. This being so, a brother has it in his power at once to guard
                  his sister against the advances of an unprincipled man, or a man whose habits he
                  knows to be bad; and a sister has it in her power to reveal to her brother traits
                  of character in a woman, for whom he is about forming an attachment, that would
                  repel rather than attract him.</p>
               <p>Toward her younger brother a sister should be particularly considerate. In
                  allusion to this subject, Mrs. Farrar has written so well that we cannot repress
                  our wish to quote her. "If your brothers are younger than you, encourage them to
                  be perfectly confidential with you; win their friendship by your sympathy in all
                  their concerns, and let them see that their interests and their pleasures are
                  liberally provided for in the family arrangements. Never disclose their little
                  secrets, however unimportant they may seem to you; never pain them by an ill-timed
                  joke; never repress their feelings by ridicule; but be their tenderest friend, and
                  then you may become their ablest adviser. If separated from them by the course of
                  school and college education, make a point of keeping up your intimacy by full,
                  free, and affectionate correspondence; and when they return to the paternal roof,
                  at that awkward age between youth and manhood, when reserve creeps over the mind
                  like an impenetrable vail, suffer it not to interpose between you and your
                  brothers. Cultivate their friendship and intimacy with all the address and
                  tenderness you possess; for it is of unspeakable importance to them that their
                  sisters should be their confidential friends. Consider the loss of a ball or
                  party, for the sake of making the evening pass pleasantly to your brothers at
                  home, as a small sacrifice—one you should unhesitatingly make. If they go into
                  company with you, see that they are introduced to the most desirable
                  acquaintances, and show them<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC5621-00000081"/> that you
                  are interested in their acquitting themselves well."</p>
               <p>Having quoted thus much from the "Young Lady's Friend," we feel inclined to give a
                  few passages more from the author's admirable remarks on the relation of brother
                  and sister.</p>
               <p>"So many temptations beset young men, of which young women know nothing, that it
                  is of the utmost importance that your brothers' evenings should be happily passed
                  at home; that their friends should be your friends; that their engagements should
                  be the same as yours; and that various innocent amusements should be provided for
                  them in the family circle. Music is an accomplishment usually valuable as a home
                  enjoyment, as rallying round the piano the various members of a family, and
                  harmonizing their hearts, as well as their voices, particularly in devotional
                  strains. I know no more agreeable and interesting spectacle than that of brothers
                  and sisters playing and singing together those elevated compositions in music and
                  poetry which gratify the taste and purify the heart, while their parents sit
                  delighted by. I have seen and heard an elder sister thus leading the family choir,
                  who was the soul of harmony to the whole household, and whose life was a perfect
                  example of those virtues which I am here endeavouring to inculcate. Let no one
                  say, in reading this chapter, that too much is here required of sisters; that no
                  one can be expected to lead such a self-sacrificing life; for the sainted one to
                  whom I refer was all that I would ask my sister to be; and a happier person never
                  lived. 'To do good and make others happy,' was the rule of her life; and in this
                  she found the art of making herself so.</p>
               <p>"Brothers will generally be found strongly opposed to the slightest indecorum in
                  sisters.....Their intercourse with all sorts of men enables them to judge of the
                  construction put upon certain actions, and modes of dress and speech, much better
                  than women can; and you will do well to take their advice on all such points.</p>
               <p>"I have been told by men, who had passed unharmed through the temptations of
                  youth, that they owed their escape from many dangers to the intimate companionship
                  of affectionate and pure-minded sisters. They have been saved from a hazardous
                  meeting with idle company by some home engagement, of which their sisters were the
                  charm; they have refrained from mixing with the impure, because they would not
                  bring home thoughts and feelings which they could not share with those trusting
                  and loving friends; they have put aside the wine-cup, and abstained from stronger
                  potations, because they would not profane with their fumes the holy kiss, with
                  which they were accustomed to bid their sisters good-night."</p>

               <p>SOCIETY is marked by greater and smaller divisions, as into nations, communities,
                  and families. A man is a member of the commonwealth, a smaller community, as a
                  hamlet or city, and his family at the same time; and the more perfectly all his
                  duties to his family are discharged, the more fully does he discharge his duties
                  to the community and the nation; for a good member of a family cannot be a bad
                  member of the commonwealth, for he that is faithful in what is least, will also be
                  faithful in what is greater. Indeed, the more perfectly a man fulfils all his
                  domestic duties, the more perfectly, in that very act, has he discharged his duty
                  to the whole; for the whole is made up of parts, and its health depends entirely
                  upon the health of the various parts. There are, of course, general as well as
                  specific duties; but the more conscientious a man is in the discharge of specific
                  duties, the more ready will he be to perform those that are general; and we
                  believe that the converse of this will be found equally true, and that those who
                  have least regard for home—who have, indeed, no home, no domestic circle—are the
                  worst citizens. This they may not be apparently; they may not break the laws, nor
                  do any thing to call down upon them censure from the community, and yet, in the
                  secret and almost unconscious dissemination of demoralizing principles, may be
                  doing a work far more destructive of the public good than if they had committed a
                  robbery.</p>
               <p>We always feel pain when we hear a young man speak lightly of home, and talk
                  carelessly, or, it may be, with sportive ridicule, of the "old man" and the "old
                  woman," as if they were of but little consequence. We mark it as a bad indication,
                  and feel that the feet of that young man are treading upon dangerous ground. His
                  home education may not have been of the best kind, nor may home influences have
                  reached his higher and better feelings; but he is at least old enough now to
                  understand the causes, and to seek rather to bring into his home all that it needs
                  to render it more attractive, than to estrange himself from it and expose its
                  defects.</p>
               <p>Instances of this kind are not of very frequent occurrence. Home has its charms
                  for nearly all, and the very name comes with a blessing to the spirit. This,
                  however, is more the case with those who have been separated from it, than it is
                  with those who yet remain in the old homestead with parents, brothers, and
                  sisters, as their friends and companions.</p>
               <p>The earnest love of home, felt by nearly all who have been compelled to leave that
                  pleasant place, is a feeling that should be tenderly cherished: and this love
                  should be kept alive by associations that have in them as perfect a resemblance of
                  home as it is possible to obtain. It is for this reason that it is bad for a young
                  man to board in a large hotel, where there is nothing in which there is even an
                  image of the home-circle. Each has his separate chamber; but that is not home. All
                  meet together<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC5621-00000083"/> at the common table; but
                  there is no home feeling there, with its many sweet reciprocations. The meal
                  completed, all separate, each to his individual pursuit or pleasure. There is a
                  parlour, it is true; but there are no family gatherings there. One and another sit
                  there, as inclination prompts; but each sits alone, busy with his own thoughts.
                  All this is a poor substitute for home. And yet it offers its attractions to some.
                  A young man in a hotel has more freedom than in a family or private
                  boarding-house. He comes in and goes out unobserved; there is no one to say to
                  him, "why?" or "wherefore?" But this is a dangerous freedom, and one which no
                  young man should desire.</p>
               <p>But mere negative evils, so to speak, are not the worst that beset a young man who
                  unwisely chooses a public hotel as a place for boarding. He is much more exposed
                  to temptations there than in a private boarding-house, or at home. Men of
                  licentious habits, in most cases, select hotels as boarding-places; and such
                  rarely scruple to offer to the ardent minds of young men, with whom they happen to
                  fall in company, those allurements that are most likely to lead them away from
                  virtue. And, besides this, there being no evening home-circle in a hotel, a young
                  man who is not engaged earnestly in some pursuit that occupies his hours of
                  leisure from business has nothing to keep him there, but is forced to seek for
                  something to interest his mind elsewhere, and is, in consequence, more open to
                  temptation.</p>
               <p>Home is man's true place. Every man should have a home. Here his first duties lie,
                  and here he finds the strength by which he is able successfully to combat in
                  life's temptations. Happy is that young man who is still blessed with a home—who
                  has his mother's counsel and the pure love of sisters to strengthen and cheer him
                  amid life's opening combats.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>A GLEAM OF SUNSHINE ON THE PATH OF A MONEY-LENDER.</head>
               <p>MR. EDGAR was a money-lender, and scrupled not in exacting the highest "street
                  rates" of interest that could be obtained. If good paper were offered, and he
                  could buy it from the needy seeker of cash at two or even three per cent. a month,
                  he did not hesitate about the transaction on any scruples of justice between man
                  and man. Below one per cent. a month, he rarely made loans. He had nothing to do
                  with the question, as to whether the holder of bills could afford the sacrifice.
                  The circle of his thoughts went not beyond gain to himself.</p>
               <p>Few days closed with Mr. Edgar that he was not able to count up gains as high as
                  from thirty to one hundred dollars: not acquired in trade—not coming back to him
                  as the reward of productive industry —but the simple accumulation of large
                  clippings from the anticipated reward of others' industry. Always with a good
                  balance in bank, he had but to<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC5621-00000084"/> sign his
                  name to a check, and the slight effort was repaid by a gain of from ten to fifty
                  dollars, according to the size and time of the note he had agreed to discount. A
                  shrewd man, and well acquainted with the business standing of all around him, Mr.
                  Edgar rarely made mistakes in money transactions. There was always plenty of good
                  paper offering, and he never touched any thing regarded as doubtful.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Edgar a happy man? Ah! that is a home question. But we answer frankly, no.
                  During his office hours, while his love of gain was active—while good customers
                  were coming and going, and good operations being effected—his mind was in a
                  pleasurable glow. But, at other times, he suffered greatly from a pressure on his
                  feelings, the cause of which he did not clearly understand. Wealth he had always
                  regarded as the greatest good in life. And now he not only had wealth, but the
                  income therefrom was a great deal more than he had any desire to spend. And yet he
                  was not happy—no, not even in the thought of his large possessions. Only in the
                  mental activity through which more was obtained, did he really find satisfaction;
                  but this state was only of short duration.</p>
               <p>Positive unhappiness, Mr. Edgar often experienced. Occasional losses, careful and
                  shrewd as he always was, were inevitable. These fretted him greatly. To lose a
                  thousand dollars, instead of gaining, as was pleasantly believed, some sixty or
                  seventy, was a shower of cold water upon his ardent love of accumulation: and he
                  shivered painfully under the infliction. The importunities of friends who needed
                  money, and to whom it was unsafe to lend it, were also a source of no small
                  annoyance. And, moreover, there was little of the heart's warm sunshine at home.
                  As Mr. Edgar had thought more of laying up wealth for his children than giving
                  them the true riches of intellect and heart, ill weeds had sprung up in their
                  minds. He had not loved them with an unselfish love, and he received not a higher
                  affection than he had bestowed. Their prominent thought, in regard to him, seemed
                  ever to be the obtaining of some concession to their real or imaginary wants; and,
                  if denied these, they reacted upon him in anger, sullenness, or complaint.</p>
               <p>Oh, no! Mr. Edgar was not happy. Few gleams of sunshine lay across his path. Life
                  to him, in his own bitter words, uttered after some keen disappointment, had
                  "proved a failure." And yet he continued eager for gain; would cut as deep, exact
                  as much from those who had need of his money in their business, as ever. The
                  measure of per centage was the measure of his satisfaction.</p>
               <p>One day a gentleman said to him—</p>
               <p>"Mr. Edgar, I advised a young mechanic who has been in business for a short time,
                  and who has to take notes for his work, to call on you for the purpose of getting
                  them cashed. He has no credit in bank, and is, therefore, compelled to go upon the
                  street for money. Most of his work is taken by one of the safest houses in the
                  city; his paper is, therefore, as good as any in market. Deal as moderately with
                  him as you can. He knows little about these matters, or where to go for the
                  accommodation he needs."</p>
               <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC5621-00000085"/>
               <p>"Is he an industrious and prudent young man?" inquired Mr. Edgar, caution and
                  cupidity at once excited.</p>
               <p>"He is."</p>
               <p>"What's his name?"</p>
               <p>"Blakewell."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I know him. Very well; send him along, and if his paper is good, I'll
                  discount it."</p>
               <p>"You'll find it first-rate," said the gentleman.</p>
               <p>"How much shall I charge him?" This was Mr. Edgar's first thought, so soon as he
                  was alone. Even as he asked himself the question, the young mechanic entered.</p>
               <p>"You take good paper, sometimes?" said the latter, in a hesitating manner.</p>
               <p>The countenance of Mr. Edgar became, instantly, very grave.</p>
               <p>"Sometimes I do," he answered, with assumed indifference.</p>
               <p>"I have a note of Leyden &amp; Co.'s that I wish discounted," said Blakewell.</p>
               <p>"For how much?"</p>
               <p>"Three hundred dollars—six months;" and he handed Mr. Edgar the note.</p>
               <p>"I don't like over four months' notes," remarked the money-lender, coldly. Then he
                  asked, "What rate of interest do you expect to pay?"</p>
               <p>"Whatever is usual. Of course, I wish to get it done as low as possible. My
                  profits are not large, and every dollar I pay in discounts is so much taken from
                  the growth of my business and the comfort of my family."</p>
               <p>"You have a family?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir. A wife and four children."</p>
               <p>Mr. Edgar mused for a moment or two. An unselfish thought was struggling to get
                  into his mind.</p>
               <p>"What have you usually paid on this paper?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"The last I had discounted cost me one and a half per cent. a month."</p>
               <p>"Notes of this kind are rarely marketable below that rate," said Mr. Edgar. He had
                  thought of exacting two per cent. "If you will leave the note, and call round in
                  half an hour, I will see what can be done."</p>
               <p>"Very well," returned the mechanic. "Be as moderate with me as you can."</p>
               <p>For the half hour that went by during the young man's absence, Mr. Edgar walked
                  the floor of his counting-room, trying to come to some decision in regard to the
                  note. Love of gain demanded two per cent. a month, while a feeble voice, scarcely
                  heard so far away did it seem, pleaded for a generous regard to the young man's
                  necessities. The conflict taking place in his mind was a new one for the
                  money-lender. In no instance before had he experienced any hesitation on the score
                  of a large discount. Love of gain continued clamorous for two per cent. on the
                  note; yet, ever and anon, the low voice stole, in pleading accents, to his
                  ears.</p>
               <p>"I'll do it for one and a half," said Mr. Edgar, yielding slightly to the claim of
                  humanity, urged by the voice, that seemed to be coming nearer.</p>
               <p>Love of gain, after slight opposition, was satisfied.<pb n="170-171"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000086"/> But the low, penetrating voice asked for something
                  better still.</p>
               <p>"Weakness! Folly!" exclaimed Mr. Edgar. "I'd better make him a present of the
                  money at once."</p>
               <p>It availed nothing. The voice could not be hushed.</p>
               <p>"One per cent! He couldn't get it done as low as that in the city."</p>
               <p>"He is a poor young man, and has a wife and four little children," said the voice.
                  "Even the abstraction of legal interest from his hard earnings is defect enough;
                  to lose twice that sum, will make a heavy draught on his profits, which, under the
                  present competition in trade, are not large. He is honest and industrious, and by
                  his useful labour is aiding the social well-being. Is it right for you to get his
                  reward?—to take his profits, and add them to your already rich accumulations?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Edgar did not like these home questions, and tried to stop his ears, so that
                  the voice could not find an entrance. But he tried in vain.</p>
               <p>"Bank rates on this note," continued the inward voice, "would not much exceed nine
                  dollars. Even this is a large sum for a poor man to lose. Double the rate of
                  interest, and the loss becomes an injury to his business, or the cause of
                  seriously abridging his home comforts. And how much will nine dollars contribute
                  to your happiness? Not so much as a jot or a tittle. You are unable, now, to spend
                  your income."</p>
               <p>The young mechanic entered at this favourable moment. The money-lender pointed to
                  a chair; then turned to his desk, and filled up, hurriedly, a check. Blakewell
                  glanced at the amount thereof as it was handed to him, and an instant flush of
                  surprise came into his face.</p>
               <p>"Haven't you made a mistake, Mr. Edgar?" said he.</p>
               <p>"In what respect?"</p>
               <p>"The note was for three hundred dollars, six months; and you have given me a check
                  for two hundred and ninety dollars, forty-three cents."</p>
               <p>"I've charged you bank interest," said Mr. Edgar, with a feeling of pleasure at
                  his heart so new, that it sent a glow along every nerve and fibre of his
                  being.</p>
               <p>"Bank interest! I did not expect this, sir," replied the young man, visibly moved.
                  "For less than one and a half per cent. a month, I have not been able to obtain
                  money. One per cent, I would have paid you cheerfully. Eighteen dollars saved! How
                  much good that sum will do me! I could not have saved it—or, I might say, have
                  received it—more opportunely. This is a kindness for which I shall ever remember
                  you gratefully."</p>
               <p>Grasping the money-lender's hand, he shook it warmly; then turned and hurried
                  away.</p>
               <p>Only one previous transaction had that day been made by Mr. Edgar. In that
                  transaction, his gain was fifty dollars, and much pleasure had it given him. But
                  the delight experienced was not to be compared with what he now felt. It was to
                  him a new experience in life—a realization of that beautiful truth, "It is more
                  blessed to give than to receive."</p>
               <p>Once or twice during the day, as Mr. Edgar dwelt<pb n="172-173"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000087"/> on the little circumstance, his natural love of
                  gain caused regret for the loss of money involved in the transaction to enter his
                  mind. How cold, moody, and uncomfortable he instantly became! Self-love was
                  seeking to rob the money-lender of the just reward of a good deed. But the voice
                  which had prompted the generous act was heard, clear and sweet, and again his
                  heart beat to a gladder measure.</p>
               <p>Evening was closing in on the day following. It was late in December, and winter
                  had commenced in real earnest. Snow had fallen for some hours. Now, however, the
                  sky was clear, but the air keen and frosty. The day, to Mr. Edgar, was one in
                  which more than the usual number of "good transactions" had been made. On one
                  perfectly safe note he had been able to charge as high as three per cent. per
                  month. Full of pleasurable excitement had his mind been while thus gathering in
                  gain, but now, the excitement being over, he was oppressed. From whence the
                  pressure came, he did not know. A cloud usually fell upon his spirits with the
                  closing day; and there was not sunshine enough at home to chase it from his
                  sky.</p>
               <p>As Mr. Edgar walked along, with his eyes upon the pavement, his name was called.
                  Looking up, he saw, standing at the open door of a small house, the mechanic he
                  had befriended on the day before.</p>
               <p>"Step in here just one moment," said the young man. The request was made in a way
                  that left Mr. Edgar no alternative but compliance. So he entered the humble
                  dwelling. He found himself in a small, unlighted room, adjoining one in which a
                  lamp was burning, and in which was a young woman, plainly but neatly dressed, and
                  four children, the youngest lying in a cradle. The woman held in her hand a warm
                  Bay State shawl, which, after examining a few moments, with a pleased expression
                  of countenance, she threw over her shoulders, and glanced at herself in a
                  looking-glass. The oldest of the children, a boy, was trying on a new overcoat;
                  and his sister, two years younger, had a white muff and a warm woollen shawl, in
                  which her attention was completely absorbed. A smaller child had a new cap, and he
                  was the most pleased of any.</p>
               <p>"Oh, isn't father good to buy us all these? and we wanted them so much," said the
                  oldest of the children. "Yesterday morning, when I told him how cold I was going
                  to school, he said he was sorry, but that I must try and do without a coat this
                  winter, for he hadn't money enough to get us all we wanted. How did he get more
                  money, mother?"</p>
               <p>"To a kind gentleman, who helped your father, we are indebted for these needed
                  comforts," replied the mother.</p>
               <p>"He must be a good man," said the boy. "What's his name?"</p>
               <p>"His name is Mr. Edgar."</p>
               <p>"I will ask God to bless him to-night when I say my prayers," innocently spoke out
                  the youngest of the three children.</p>
               <p>"What does all this mean?" asked the money-lender, as he hastily retired from the
                  room he had entered.</p>
               <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC5621-00000088"/>
               <p>"If you had charged me one per cent. on my note, this scene would never have
                  occurred," answered the mechanic. "With the sum you generously saved me, I was
                  able to buy these comforts. My heart blesses you for the deed; and if the good
                  wishes of my happy family can throw sunshine across your path, it will be full of
                  brightness."</p>
               <p>Too much affected to reply, Mr. Edgar returned the warm pressure of the hand which
                  had grasped his, and glided away.</p>
               <p>A gleam of sunshine had indeed fallen along the pathway of the money-lender. Home
                  had a brighter look as he passed his own threshold. He felt kinder and more
                  cheerful; and kindness and cheerfulness flowed back to him from all the inmates of
                  his dwelling. He half wondered at the changed aspect worn by every thing. His
                  dreams that night were not of losses, fires, and the wreck of dearly-cherished
                  hopes, but of the humble home made glad by his generous kindness. Again the happy
                  mother, the pleased children, and the grateful father, were before him, and his
                  own heart leaped with a new delight.</p>
               <p>"It was a small act—a very light sacrifice on my part," said Mr. Edgar to himself,
                  as he walked, in a musing mood, toward his office on the next morning. "And yet of
                  how much real happiness has it been the occasion! So much that a portion thereof
                  has flowed back upon my own heart."</p>
               <p>"A good act is twice blessed." It seemed as if the words were spoken aloud, so
                  distinctly and so suddenly were they presented to the mind of Mr. Edgar.</p>
               <p>Ah, if he will only heed that suggestion, made by some pure spirit, brought near
                  to him by the stirring of good affections in his mind! In it lies the secret of
                  true happiness. Let him but act therefrom, and the sunshine will never be absent
                  from his pathway.</p>

               <head>ENGAGED AT SIXTEEN.</head>
               <p>"MRS. LEE is quite fortunate with her daughters," remarked a visitor to Mrs.
                  Wyman, whose oldest child, a well grown girl of fifteen, was sitting by.</p>
               <p>"Yes; Kate and Harriet went off in good time. She has only Fanny left."</p>
               <p>"Who is to be married this winter."</p>
               <p>"Fanny?"</p>
               <p>"She is engaged to Henry Florence."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! And she is only just turned of sixteen. How fortunate, truly! Some people
                  have their daughters on their hands until they are two or three-and-twenty, when
                  the chances for good matches are very low. <emph>I</emph> was only sixteen when
                     <emph>I</emph> was married."</p>
               <p>"Certainly; and then I had rejected two or three young men. There is nothing like
                  early marriages, depend upon it, Mrs. Clayton. They always turn out the best. The
                  most desirable young men take<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC5621-00000089"/> their
                  pick of the youngest girls, and leave the older ones for second-rate
                  claimants."</p>
               <p>"Do you hear that, Anna?" Mrs. Clayton said, laughing, as she turned to Mrs.
                  Wyman's daughter. "I hope you will not remain a moment later than your mother did
                  upon the maiden list."</p>
               <p>Anna blushed slightly, but did not reply. What had been said, however, made its
                  impression on her mind. She felt that to be engaged early was a matter greatly to
                  be desired.</p>
               <p>"My mother was married at sixteen, and here am I fifteen, and without a lover." So
                  thought Anna, as she paused over the page of a new novel, some hours after she had
                  listened to the conversation that passed between her mother and Mrs. Clayton, and
                  mused of love and matrimony.</p>
               <p>From that time, Anna Wyman was another girl. The sweet simplicity of manner, the
                  unconscious innocence peculiar to her age, gradually vanished. Her eye, that was
                  so clear and soft with the light of girlhood's pleasant fancies, grew earnest and
                  restless, and, at times, intensely bright. The whole expression of her countenance
                  was new. It was no longer a placid sky, with scarce a cloud floating in its quiet
                  depths, but changeful as April, with its tears and smiles blending in strange
                  beauty. Her heart, that had long beat tranquilly, would now bound at a thought,
                  and send the bright crimson to her cheek—would flutter at the sight of the very
                  individual whom she, a short time before, <unclear>would</unclear> meet without a
                  single wave ruffling the surface of her feelings. The woman had suddenly displaced
                  the girl; a sisterly regard, that pure affection which an innocent cent maiden's
                  heart has for all around her had expired on the altar where was kindling up the
                  deep passion called <emph>love</emph>. And yet Anna Wyman had not reached her
                  sixteenth year.</p>
               <p>All at once, she became restless, capricious, unhappy. She had been at school up
                  to this period, but now insisted that she was too old for that; her mother
                  seconded this view of the matter, and her father, a man of pretty good sense, had
                  to yield.</p>
               <p>"We must give Anna a party now," said Mrs. Wyman, after their daughter had left
                  school.</p>
               <p>"Why so?" asked the father.</p>
               <p>"Oh—because it is time that she was beginning to come out."</p>
               <p>"Come out, how?"</p>
               <p>"You are stupid, man. Come out in the list of young ladies. Go into company."</p>
               <p>"But she is a mere child, yet—not sixteen."</p>
               <p>"Not sixteen! And how old was <emph>I</emph>, pray, when you married me?"</p>
               <p>The husband did not reply.</p>
               <p>"How old was I, Mr. Wyman?"</p>
               <p>"About sixteen, I believe."</p>
               <p>"Well; and was I a mere child?"</p>
               <p>"You were rather young to marry, at least," Mr. Wyman ventured to say. This remark
                  was made rather too feelingly.</p>
               <p>"Too young to marry!" ejaculated the wife, in a tone of surprise and
                  indignation—"too young to marry; and my husband to say so, too! Mr. Wyman, do you
                  mean to intimate—do you mean to say?—Mr. Wyman, what do you mean by that
                  remark?"</p>
               <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC5621-00000090"/>
               <p>"Oh, nothing at all," soothingly replied the husband; "only that I"—</p>
               <p>"What?"</p>
               <p>"That I don't, as a general thing, approve of very early marriages. The character
                  of a young lady is not formed before twenty-one or two; nor has she gained that
                  experience and knowledge of the world that will enable her to choose with
                  wisdom."</p>
               <p>"You don't pretend to say that my character was not formed at sixteen?" This was
                  accompanied by a threatening look.</p>
               <p>Whatever his thoughts were, Mr. Wyman took good care not to express them. He
                  merely said—</p>
               <p>"I believe, Margaret, that I haven't volunteered any allusion to you."</p>
               <p>"Yes, but you don't approve of early marriages."</p>
               <p>"True."</p>
               <p>"Well, didn't I marry at sixteen? And isn't your opinion a reflection upon your
                  wife?"</p>
               <p>"Circumstances alter cases," smilingly returned Mr. Wyman. "Few women at sixteen
                  were like you. Very certainly your daughter is not."</p>
               <p>"There I differ with you, Mr. Wyman. I believe our Anna would make as good a wife
                  now as I did at sixteen. She is as much of a woman in appearance; her mind is more
                  matured, and her education advanced far beyond what mine was. She deserves a good
                  husband, and must have one before the lapse of another year."</p>
               <p>"How can you talk so, Margaret? For my part, I do not wish to see her married for
                  at least five years."</p>
               <p>"Preposterous! I wouldn't give a cent for a marriage that takes place after
                  seventeen or eighteen. They are always indifferent affairs, and rarely ever turn
                  out well. The earlier the better, depend upon it. First love and first lover, is
                  my motto."</p>
               <p>"Well, Margaret, I suppose you will have these matters your own way; but I don't
                  agree with you for all."</p>
               <p>"Anna must have a party."</p>
               <p>"You can do as you like."</p>
               <p>"But you must assent to it."</p>
               <p>"How can I do that, if I don't approve?"</p>
               <p>"But you must approve."</p>
               <p>And Mrs. Wyman persevered until she made him approve—at least do so apparently.
                  And so a party was given to Anna, at which she was introduced to several dashing
                  young men, whose attentions almost turned her young head. In two weeks she had a
                  confidante, a young lady named Clara Spenser, not much older than herself. The
                  progress already made by Anna in love matters will appear in the following
                  conversation held in secret with Clara.</p>
               <p>"Did you say Mr. Carpenter had been to see you since the party?" asked Clara.</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed," was the animated reply.</p>
               <p>"He's a love of a man!—the very one of all others that I would set my cap for, if
                  there was any hope. But you will, no doubt, carry him off."</p>
               <p>Anna coloured to the temples, half with confusion and half with delight.</p>
               <p>"He used to pay attention to Jane Sherman, I'm told."</p>
               <p>"Yes; but you've cut her out entirely. Didn't<pb n="180-181"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000091"/> you notice how unhappy she seemed at the party
                  whenever he was with you?"</p>
               <p>"No; was she?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes; everybody noticed it. But you can carry off all of her beaux; she's a
                  mere drab of a girl. And, besides, she's getting on the old maids' list; I'm told
                  she's more than twenty."</p>
               <p>"She is?"</p>
               <p>"It's true."</p>
               <p>"Oh, dear; there's no fear of her then. If I were to go over sixteen before I
                  married, I should be frightened to death."</p>
               <p>"Suppose Carpenter offers himself?"</p>
               <p>"I hope he won't just yet."</p>
               <p>"Why?"</p>
               <p>"I want two or three strings to my bow. It would be dangerous to reject one unless
                  I had another in my eye."</p>
               <p>"Reject? Nonsense! Why should you reject an offer?"</p>
               <p>"My mother had three offers before she was sixteen, and rejected two of them."</p>
               <p>"Was she married so early?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes; she was a wife at sixteen, and I'm not going to be a day later, if
                  possible. I'd like to decline <emph>three</emph> offers and get married into the
                  bargain before a year passes. Wouldn't that be admirable? It would be something to
                  boast of all my life."</p>
               <p>Pretty well advanced!—the reader no doubt exclaims; and so our young lady
                  certainly was. When a very young girl gets into love matters, she "does them up,"
                  as the saying is, quite fast; she doesn't mince matters at all. A maiden of twenty
                  is cooler, more thoughtful, and more cautious. She thinks a good deal, and is very
                  careful how she lets any one —even her confidante, if she should happen to have
                  one, (which is doubtful)—know much beyond her mere external thoughts. Four or five
                  years make a good deal of difference in these things. But this need hardly have
                  been said.</p>
               <p>"You are going to Mrs. Ashton's on Wednesday evening, of course?" said Clara
                  Spenser to Anna, on visiting her one morning, some weeks after the introduction to
                  Carpenter had taken place.</p>
               <p>"Oh, certainly; their soirées, I'm told, are elegant affairs."</p>
               <p>"Indeed they are; I've been to two of them. Fine music, pleasant company, and so
                  much freedom of intercourse—oh, they are delightful!"</p>
               <p>"Did you ever see Mr. Carpenter there?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes; he always attends."</p>
               <p>"I shall enjoy myself highly."</p>
               <p>"That you will—the young men are so attentive."</p>
               <p>Wednesday night soon came round, and Anna was permitted to go, unattended by
                  either of her parents, to the so-called soirée at Mrs. Ashton's. As she had hoped
                  and believed, Carpenter was there. His attentions to her were constant and
                  flattering; he poured many compliments into her ears, talking to her all the time
                  in a low, musical tone. Anna's heart fluttered in her bosom with pleasure; she
                  felt that she had made a conquest. But the fact of bringing so charming a young
                  man to her feet, and that so speedily, quickened her pride, and made it seem the
                  easiest thing in the world to be able to reject three<pb n="182-183"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000092"/> lovers and yet be engaged, or even married, at
                  sixteen.</p>
               <p>Besides Carpenter, there was another present who saw attractions about Anna Wyman.
                  He wore a moustache, and made quite a dashing appearance. In the language of many
                  young ladies, who admired him, he was an elegant-looking young man—just the one to
                  be proud of as a beau. His name was Elliott.</p>
               <p>As soon as he could get access to the ear of the young and inexperienced girl, he
                  charmed it with a deeper charm than Carpenter had been able to impart. She felt
                  almost like one within a magic circle. His eye fascinated her, and his voice
                  murmured in her ear like low, sweet music.</p>
               <p>A short time before parting from her, he said—</p>
               <p>"Miss Wyman, may I have the pleasure of calling upon you at your father's
                  house?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, sir; I shall be most happy to see you." She spoke with feeling.</p>
               <p>"Then I shall visit you frequently. In your society I promise myself much
                  happiness."</p>
               <p>Anna's eyes fell to the floor, and the colour deepened on her cheeks. When she
                  looked up, Elliott was gazing steadily in her face, with an expression of
                  admiration and love.</p>
               <p>Her heart was lost. Carpenter, that love of a man, was not thought of—or, only as
                  one of her rejected lovers.</p>
               <p>When Anna laid her head upon her pillow that night, it was not to sleep. Her mind
                  was too full of pleasant images, central to all of which was the elegant,
                  accomplished, handsome Mr. Elliott. He had, she conceived, as good as offered
                  himself, and she, much as she wished to reject three lovers before she accepted
                  one, felt strongly inclined to accept him, and so end the matter.</p>
               <p>Now, who was Mr. Thomas Elliott? A few words will portray him. Mr. Elliott was
                  twenty-six; he kept a store in the city; had been in business for some years, but
                  was not very successful. His habits of life were not good; his principles had no
                  sound, moral basis. He was, in fact, just the man to make a silly child like Anna
                  Wyman wretched for life. But why did he seek for one like her? That is easily
                  explained. Mr. Wyman was reputed to be pretty well off in the world, and Mr.
                  Elliott's affairs were in rather a precarious condition; but he managed to keep so
                  good a face upon the matter, that none suspected his real condition.</p>
               <p>After visiting Anna for a short time, he offered his hand. If it had not been that
                  her sixteenth birthday was so near, Anna would have declined the offer, for Thomas
                  Elliott did not grow dearer to her every day. There were young men whom she liked
                  much better; and if they had only come forward and presented their claims to
                  favour, she would have declined the offer. But time was rapidly passing away. Anna
                  was ambitious of being engaged before she was sixteen, and married, if possible.
                  Her mother had rejected two offers, and she was anxious to do as much. Here was a
                  chance for one rejection—but was she sure of another offer in time? No! There was
                  the difficulty. For some days she debated the question, and then laid it before
                  her mother. Mrs. Wyman consulted her husband, who did not much like Elliott; but
                  the mother felt the necessity of an<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC5621-00000093"/>
                  early marriage, and overruled all objections. Her advice to Anna was to accept the
                  offer, and it was accepted, accordingly.</p>
               <p>A fond, wayward child of sixteen may chance to marry and do well, spite of all the
                  drawbacks she will meet; but this is only in case she happen to marry a man of
                  good sense, warm affections, and great kindness, who can bear with her as a father
                  bears with a capricious child; can forgive much and love much. But give the
                  happiness of such a creature into the keeping of a cold, narrow-minded, selfish,
                  petulant man, and her cup will soon run over. Bitter, indeed, will be her lot in
                  life.</p>
               <p>Just such a man was Thomas Elliott. He had sought only his own pleasures, and had
                  owned no law but his own will. For more than ten years he had been living without
                  other external restraints than those social laws that all must observe who desire
                  to keep a fair reputation. He came in when he pleased and went out when he
                  pleased. He required service from all, and gave it to none—that is, so far as he
                  needed service, he exacted it from those under him, but was not in the habit of
                  making personal sacrifices for the sake of others. Thus, his natural selfishness
                  was confirmed. When he married, it was with an end to the good he should derive
                  from the union—not from a generous desire to make another happy in himself. Anna
                  was young, vivacious, and more than ordinarily intelligent and pretty. There was
                  much about her that was attractive, and Elliott really imagined that he loved her;
                  but it was himself that he loved in her fascinating qualities. These were all to
                  minister to his pleasure. He never once thought of devoting himself to her
                  happiness.</p>
               <p>On the night of the wedding, which took place soon after Anna's sixteenth
                  birthday, the bride was in that bewildered state of mind which destroys all the
                  rational perceptions of the mind. Her whole soul was in a pleasing tumult, and yet
                  she did not feel happy; and why? Spite of the solemn promise she had made to love
                  and honour her husband above all men, she felt that there were others whom she
                  could have loved and honoured more than him, were they in his place. But this,
                  reason told her, was folly. They had not presented themselves, and he had. They
                  could be nothing to her—he must be every thing. To secure a husband early was the
                  great point, and that had been gained. This thought, whenever it crossed her mind,
                  would cause her to look around upon her maiden companions with proud
                  self-complacency, They were still upon the shores of expectancy. She had launched
                  her boat upon the sunny sea of matrimony, and was already moving steadily away
                  under a pleasant breeze.</p>
               <p>Alas! young bride, thy hymeneal altar is an altar of sacrifice. Love is not the
                  deity who is presiding there. Little do they dream who have led thee, poor lamb!
                  garlanded with flowers, to that altar, how innocent, how true, how good a heart
                  they were offering up upon its strange fires. But they will know in time, and thou
                  wilt know when it is too late.</p>
               <p>Two years from the period of their marriage, Elliott and his wife were seated in a
                  small room moderately well furnished. He was leaning back in<pb n="186-187"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000094"/> a chair, with arms folded, and his chin resting on
                  his bosom. His face was contracted into a gloomy scowl. Anna, who looked pale and
                  troubled, was sewing and touching with her foot a cradle, in which was a babe. The
                  little one seemed restless. Every now and then it would start and moan, or cry
                  out. After a time it awoke and commenced screaming. The mother lifted it from the
                  cradle and tried to hush it upon her bosom, but the babe still cried on. It was
                  evidently in pain.</p>
               <p>"Confound you! why don't you keep that child quiet?" exclaimed the husband,
                  impatiently casting at the same time an angry look upon his wife.</p>
               <p>Anna made no reply, but turned half away from him, evidently to conceal the tears
                  that suddenly started from her eyes, and strove more earnestly to quiet the child.
                  In this she soon succeeded.</p>
               <p>"I believe you let her cry on purpose, whenever I am in the house, just to annoy
                  me," her husband resumed in an ill-natured tone.</p>
               <p>"No, Thomas, you know that I do not," Anna said.</p>
               <p>"Say I lie, why don't you?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Thomas, how can you speak so to me?" And his young wife turned toward him an
                  earnest, tearful look.</p>
               <p>"Pah! don't try to melt me with your crying. I never believed in it. Women can cry
                  at any moment."</p>
               <p>There was a convulsive motion of Mrs. Elliott's head as she turned quickly away,
                  and a choking sound in her throat. She remained silent, ten minutes passed, when
                  her husband said in a firm voice,</p>
               <p>"Anna, I'm going to break up."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Elliott glanced around with a startled air.</p>
               <p>"It's true, just what I say—your father may think that I'm going to make a slave
                  of myself to support you, but he's mistaken. He's refused to help me in my
                  business one single copper, though he's able enough. And now I've taken my
                  resolution. You can go back to him as quick as you like."</p>
               <p>Before the brutal husband had half finished the sentence, his wife was on her
                  feet, with a cheek deadly pale, and eyes almost starting from her head. Thomas
                  Elliott was her husband and the father of her babe, and as such she had loved him
                  with a far deeper love than he had deserved. This had caused her to bear with
                  coldness and neglect, and even positive unkindness without a complaint. Sacredly
                  had she kept from her mother even a hint of the truth. Thus had she gone on almost
                  from the first; for only a few months elapsed before she discovered that her image
                  was dim on her husband's heart.</p>
               <p>"You needn't stand there staring at me like one moon-struck"—he said, with bitter
                  sarcasm and a curl of the lip. "What I say is the truth. I'm going to give up, and
                  you've got to go home to them that are more able to support you than I am; and who
                  have a better right, too, I'm thinking."</p>
               <p>There was something so heartless and chilling in the words and manner of her
                  husband, that Mrs. Elliott made no attempt to reply. Covering her face with her
                  hands, she sunk back into the chair from which she had risen, more deeply
                  miserable than she had ever been in her life. From this state she was aroused by
                  the imperative question,</p>
               <p>"Anna, what do you intend doing?"</p>
               <pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC5621-00000095"/>
               <p>"That is for you to say"—was her murmured reply.</p>
               <p>"Then, I say, go home to your father, and at once."</p>
               <p>Without a word the wife rose from her chair, with her infant in her arms, and
                  pausing only long enough to put on her shawl and bonnet, left the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Wyman were sitting alone late on the afternoon of the same day,
                  thinking about and conversing of their child. Neither of them felt too well
                  satisfied with the result of her marriage. It required not even the close
                  observation of a parent's eye, to discover that she was far from happy.</p>
               <p>"I wish she were only single"—Mr. Wyman at length said. "She married much too
                  young—only eighteen now, and with a cold-hearted and, I fear, unprincipled and
                  neglectful husband. It is sad to think of it."</p>
               <p>"But I was married as young as she was, Mr. Wyman?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; but I flatter myself you made a better choice. Your condition at eighteen
                  was very different from what hers is now. As I said before, I only wish she were
                  single, and then I wouldn't care to see her married for two or three years to
                  come."</p>
               <p>"I can't help wishing she had refused Mr. Elliott. If she had done so, she might
                  have been married to a much better man long before this. Mr. Carpenter is worth a
                  dozen of him. Oh dear! this marriage is all a lottery, after all. Few prizes and
                  many blanks. Poor Anna! she is not happy."</p>
               <p>At this moment the door opened, and the child of whom they were speaking, with her
                  infant in her arms, came hurriedly in. Her face was deadly pale, her lips tightly
                  compressed, and her eyes widely distended and fixed.</p>
               <p>"Anna!" exclaimed the mother, starting up quickly and springing toward her.</p>
               <p>"My child, what ails you?" was eagerly asked by the father, as he, too, rose up
                  hastily.</p>
               <p>But there was no reply. The heart of the child was too full. She could not utter
                  the truth. She had been sent back to her parents by her husband, but her tongue
                  could not declare that! Pride, shame, wounded affections, combined to hold back
                  her words. Her only reply was to lay her babe in her mother's arms, and then fling
                  herself upon the bosom of her father.</p>
               <p>All was mystery then, but time soon unveiled the cause of their daughter's strange
                  and sudden appearance, and her deep anguish. The truth gradually came out that she
                  had been deserted by her husband; or, what seemed to Mrs. Wyman more disgraceful
                  still, had been sent home by him. Bitterly did she execrate him, but it availed
                  nothing. Her ardent wish had been gratified. Anna was engaged at sixteen, and
                  married soon after; but at eighteen, alas! she had come home a deserted wife and
                  mother! And so she remained. Her husband never afterward came near her. And now,
                  at thirty, with a daughter well grown, she remains in her father's house, a quiet,
                  thoughtful, dreamy woman, who sees little in life that is attractive, and who
                  rarely stirs beyond the threshold of the house that shelters her. There are those
                  who will recognise this picture.</p>
               <p>So much for being engaged at sixteen!</p>

               <head>THE DAUGHTER.</head>
               <p>IT often happens that a daughter possesses greatly superior advantages to those
                  enjoyed, in early years, by either her father or mother. She is not compelled to
                  labour as hard as they were obliged to labour when young; and she is blessed with
                  the means of education far beyond what they had. Her associations, too, are of a
                  different order, all tending to elevate her views of life, to refine her tastes,
                  and to give her admission into a higher grade of society than they were fitted to
                  move in.</p>
               <p>Unless very watchful of herself and very thoughtful of her parents, a daughter so
                  situated will be led at times to draw comparisons between her own cultivated
                  intellect and taste and the want of such cultivation in her parents, and to think
                  indifferently of them, as really inferior, because not so well educated and
                  accomplished as she is. A distrust of their judgment and a disrespect of their
                  opinions will follow, as a natural consequence, if these thoughts and feelings be
                  indulged. This result often takes place with thoughtless, weak-minded girls; and
                  is followed by what is worse, a disregard to their feelings, wishes, and express
                  commands.</p>
               <p>A sensible daughter, who loves her parents, will hardly forget to whom she is
                  indebted for all the superior advantages she enjoys. She will also readily
                  perceive that the experience which her parents have acquired, and their natural
                  strength of mind, give them a real and great superiority over her, and make their
                  judgment, in all matters of life, far more to be depended upon than hers could
                  possibly be. It may be that her mother has never learned to play upon the piano,
                  has never been to a dancing-school, has never had any thing beyond the merest
                  rudiments of an education; but she has good sense, prudence, industry, economy;
                  understands and practises all the virtues of domestic life; has a clear,
                  discriminating judgment; has been her husband's faithful friend and adviser for
                  some twenty or thirty years; and has safely guarded and guided her children up to
                  mature years. These evidences of a mother's title to her respect and fullest
                  confidence cannot long be absent from a daughter's mind, and will prevent her
                  acting in direct opposition to her judgment.</p>
               <p>Thoughtless indeed must be that child who can permit an emotion of disrespect
                  toward her parents to dwell in her bosom for more than a single moment!</p>
               <p>Respect and love toward parents are absolutely necessary to the proper formation
                  of the character upon that true basis which will bring into just order and
                  subordination all the powers of the mind. Without this order and subordination
                  there can be no true happiness. A child loves and respects his parents, because
                  from them he derived his being, and from them receives every blessing and comfort.
                  To them, and to them alone, does his mind turn as the authors of all the good
                  gifts he possessed. As a mere child, it is right for him thus to regard his
                  parents as the authors of his being and the originators of all his<pb n="192-193"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000097"/> blessings. But as reason gains strength, and he
                  sees more deeply into the nature and causes of things, which only takes place as
                  the child approaches the years of maturity, it is then seen that the parents were
                  only the agents through which life, and all the blessings accompanying it, came
                  from God, the great Father of all. If the parents have been loved with a truly
                  filial love, then the mind has been suitably opened and prepared for love toward
                  God, and an obedience to his divine laws, without which there can be no true
                  happiness. When this new and higher truth takes possession of the child's mind, it
                  in no way diminishes his respect for his earthly parents, but increases it. He no
                  longer obeys them because they command obedience, but he regards the truth of
                  their precepts, and in that truth hears the voice of God speaking to him. More
                  than ever is he now careful to listen to their wise counsels, because he perceives
                  in them the authority of reason, which is the authority of God.</p>
               <p>Most young ladies, on attaining the age of responsibility, will perceive a
                  difference in the manner of their parents. Instead of opposing them, as
                  heretofore, with authority, they will oppose them with reason, where opposition is
                  deemed necessary. The mother, instead of saying, when she disapproves any thing,
                  "No, my child, you cannot do it;" or, "No you must not go, dear;" will say, "I
                  would rather not have you do so;" or, "I do not approve of your going." If you ask
                  her reasons, she will state them, and endeavour to make you comprehend their
                  force. It is far too often the case, that the daughter's desire to do what her
                  mother disapproves is so active, that neither her mother's objections nor reasons
                  are strong enough to counteract her wishes, and she follows her own inclinations
                  instead of being guided by her mother's better judgment. In these instances, she
                  almost always does wrong, and suffers therefore either bodily or mental pain.</p>
               <p>Obedience in childhood is that by which we are led and guided into right actions.
                  When we become men and women, reason takes the place of obedience; but, like a
                  young bird just fluttering from its nest, reason at first has not much strength of
                  wing; and we should therefore suffer the reason of those who love us, like the
                  mother-bird, to stoop under and bear us up in our earlier efforts, lest we fall
                  bruised and wounded to the ground. To whose reason should a young girl look to
                  strengthen her own, so soon as to her mother's, guided as it is by love? But it
                  too often happens that, under the first impulses of conscious freedom, no voice is
                  regarded but the voice of inclination and passion. The mother may oppose, and
                  warn, and urge the most serious considerations, but the daughter turns a deaf ear
                  to all. She thinks that she knows best.</p>
               <p>"You are not going to-night, Mary?" said a mother, coming into her daughter's
                  room, and finding her dressing for a ball. She had been rather seriously
                  indisposed for some days, with a cold that had fallen upon her throat and chest,
                  which was weak, but was now something better.</p>
               <p>"I think I will, mother, for I am much better than I was yesterday, and have
                  improved since morning. I have promised myself so much pleasure at this ball, that
                  I cannot think of being disappointed."</p>
               <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC5621-00000098"/>
               <p>The mother shook her head.</p>
               <p>"Mary," she replied, "you are not well enough to go out. The air is damp, and you
                  will inevitably take more cold. Think how badly your throat has been
                  inflamed."</p>
               <p>"I don't think it has been so <emph>very</emph> bad, mother."</p>
               <p>"The doctor told me it was badly inflamed, and said you would have to be very
                  careful of yourself, or it might prove serious."</p>
               <p>"That was some days ago. It is a great deal better now."</p>
               <p>"But the least exposure may cause it to return."</p>
               <p>"I will be very careful not to expose myself. I will wrap up warm and go in a
                  carriage. I am sure there is not the least danger, mother."</p>
               <p>"While I am sure that there is very great danger. You cannot pass from the door to
                  the carriage, without the damp air striking upon your face, and pressing into your
                  lungs."</p>
               <p>"But I must not always exclude myself from the air, mother. Air and exercise, you
                  know, the doctor says, are indispensable to health."</p>
               <p>"Dry, not damp air. This makes the difference. But you must act for yourself,
                  Mary. You are now a woman, and must freely act in the light of that reason which
                  God has given you. Because I love you, and desire your welfare, I thus seek to
                  convince you that it is wrong to expose your health to-night. Your great desire to
                  go blinds you to the real danger, which I can fully see."</p>
               <p>"You are over-anxious, mother," urged Mary. "I know how I feel much better than
                  you possibly can, and I know I am well enough to go."</p>
               <p>"I have nothing more to say, my child," returned the mother. "I wish you to act
                  freely, but wisely. Wisely I am sure you will not act if you go to-night. A
                  temporary illness may not alone be the consequence; your health may receive a
                  shock from which it will never recover."</p>
               <p>"Mother wishes to frighten me," said Mary to herself, after her mother had left
                  the room. "But I am not to be so easily frightened. I am sorry she makes such a
                  serious matter about my going, for I never like to do any thing that is not
                  agreeable to her feelings. But I must go to this ball. William is to call for me
                  at eight, and he would be as much disappointed as myself if I were not to go. As
                  to making more cold, what of that? I would willingly pay the penalty of a pretty
                  severe cold rather than miss the ball."</p>
               <p>Against all her mother's earnestly urged objections, Mary went with her lover to
                  the ball. She came home, at one o'clock, with a sharp pain through her breast, red
                  spots on her cheeks, oppression of the chest, and considerable fever. On the next
                  morning she was unable to rise from her bed. When the doctor, who was sent for,
                  came in, he looked grave, and asked if there had been any exposure by which a
                  fresh cold could be taken.</p>
               <p>"She was at the ball last night," replied the mother.</p>
               <p>"Not with your approval, madam?" he said quickly, looking with a stern expression
                  into the mother's face.</p>
               <p>"No, doctor. I urged her not to go; but Mary thought she knew best. She did not
                  believe there was any danger."</p>
               <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC5621-00000099"/>
               <p>A strong expression rose to the doctor's lips, but he repressed it, lest he should
                  needlessly alarm the patient. On retiring from her chamber, he declared the case
                  to be a very critical one; and so it proved to be. Mary did not leave her room for
                  some months; and when she did, it was with a constitution so impaired that she
                  could not endure the slightest fatigue, nor bear the least exposure. Neither
                  change of climate nor medicine availed any thing toward restoring her to health.
                  In this feeble state she married, about twelve months afterward, the young man who
                  had accompanied her to the ball. One year from the period at which that happy
                  event took place, she died, leaving to stranger hands a babe that needed all her
                  tenderest care, and a husband almost broken-hearted at his loss.</p>
               <p>This is not merely a picture from the imagination, and highly coloured. It is from
                  nature, and every line is drawn with the pencil of truth. Hundreds of young women
                  yearly sink into the grave, whose friends can trace to some similar act of
                  imprudence, committed in direct opposition to the earnest persuasions of parents
                  or friends, the cause of their premature decay and death. And too often other, and
                  sometimes even worse, consequences than death, follow a disregard of the mother's
                  voice of warning.</p>

               <p>IN the very springtime of young womanhood, the destroyer had come; and though he
                  laid his hand upon her gently at first, yet the touch was none the less fatal.
                  But, while her frail body wasted, her spirit remained peaceful. As the sun of her
                  natural life sunk low in the sky, the bright auroral precursor of another day
                  smiled along the eastern verge of her spiritual horizon. There was in her heart
                  neither doubt, nor fear, nor shrinking.</p>
               <p>"Dear Marion!" said Anna, dropping a tear upon her white transparent hand, as she
                  pressed it to her lips, a few weeks after the alarming hemorrhage just mentioned;
                  "how can you look at this event so calmly?"</p>
               <p>They had been speaking of death, and Marion had alluded to its approach to Anna,
                  with a strange cheerfulness, as if she felt it to be nothing more than a journey
                  to another and far pleasanter land than that wherein she now dwelt.</p>
               <p>"Why should I look upon this change with other than tranquil feelings?" she
                  asked.</p>
               <p>"Why? How can you ask such a question, sister?" returned Anna. "To me, there has
                     been<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC5621-00000100"/> always something in the thought
                  of death that made the blood run cold about my heart."</p>
               <p>"This," replied Marion, with one of her sweet smiles, "is because your ideas of
                  death have been, from the first, confused and erroneous. You thought of the cold
                  and pulseless body; the pale winding-sheet; the narrow coffin, and the deep, dark
                  grave. But, I do not let my thoughts rest on these. To me, death involves the idea
                  of eternal life. I cannot think of the one without the other. Should the chrysalis
                  tremble at the coming change?—the dull worm in its cerements shrink from the
                  moment when, ordained by nature, it must rise into a new life, and expand its
                  wings in the sunny air? How much less cause have I to tremble and shrink back as
                  the hour approaches when this mortal is to put on immortality?"</p>
               <p>"Yours is a beautiful faith," said Anna. "And its effects, as seen now that the
                  hour from which all shrink approaches, are strongly corroborative of its
                  truth."</p>
               <p>"It is beautiful because it is true," replied Marion. "There is no real beauty
                  that is not the form of something good and true."</p>
               <p>"If I were as good as you, I might not shrink from death," remarked Anna, with a
                  transient sigh.</p>
               <p>"I hope you are better than I am, dear; and think you are," said Marion.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no!" quickly returned Anna.</p>
               <p>"Do you purpose evil in your heart?" asked Marion, seriously.</p>
               <p>Anna seemed half surprised at the question.</p>
               <p>"Evil! Evil! I hope not," she replied, as a shadow came over her face.</p>
               <p>"It is an evil purpose only that should make us fear death, Anna; for therein lies
                  the only cause of fear. Death, to those who love themselves and the world above
                  every thing else, is a sad event; but to those who love God and their neighbour
                  supremely, it is a happy change."</p>
               <p>"That is all true," said Anna. "My reason assents to it. But, in the act of
                  dissolution—in that mortal strife, when the soul separates itself from the
                  body—there is something from which my heart shrinks and trembles down fainting in
                  my bosom. Ah! In the crossing of that bourne from which no traveller has returned
                  to tell us of what is beyond, there is something that more than half appals
                  me."</p>
               <p>"There is much that takes away the fear you have mentioned," replied Marion. "It
                  is the uncertain that causes us to tremble and shrink back. But, when we know what
                  is before us, we prepare ourselves to meet it. Attendant upon every one who dies,
                  says a certain writer, are two angels, who keep his mind entirely above the
                  thought of death, and in the idea of eternal life. They remain with him through
                  the whole process—protecting him from evil spirits—and receive him into the world
                  of spirits after his soul has fully withdrawn itself from the interior of the
                  body. The last idea, active in the mind of the person before death, is the first
                  idea in his mind after death, when his consciousness of life is restored; and it
                  is some time after this conscious life returns before he is aware that he is dead.
                  Around him he sees objects similar to those seen in the natural<pb n="200-201"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000101"/> world. There are houses and trees, streams of water
                  and gardens. Men and women dressed in variously fashioned garments. They walk and
                  converse together, as we do upon earth. When, at length, he is told that he has
                  died, and is now in a world that is spiritual instead of natural—that the body in
                  which he is, is a body formed of spiritual instead of natural substances, he is in
                  a measure affected with surprise, and for the most part a pleasing surprise. He
                  wonders at the grossness of his previous ideas, which limited form and substances
                  to material things; and now, unless he had been instructed during his life in the
                  world, begins to comprehend the truth that man is a man from the spirit, not from
                  the body."</p>
               <p>Anna, who had been listening intently, drew a long breath, as Marion paused.</p>
               <p>"Dead, and yet not know the fact!" said she, with an expression of wonder. "It
                  seems incredible. And all this you fully believe?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Anna; as entirely as I believe in the existence of the sun in the
                  firmament."</p>
               <p>"If these doctrines can take away the fear of death, which so haunts the mind of
                  even those who are striving to live pure lives, they are indeed a legacy of good
                  to the world. Oh, Marion, how much I have suffered, ever since the days of my
                  childhood, from this dreadful fear!"</p>
               <p>"They do take away the fear of death," returned Marion; "because they remove the
                  uncertainty which has heretofore gathered like a gloomy pall over the last hours
                  of mortality. When the soul of lover or friend passed from this world, it seemed
                  to plunge into a dark profound, and there came not back an echo to tell of his
                  fate. 'The bourne from which no traveller returns!' Oh! the painful eloquence of
                  that single line. But, now, we who receive the doctrine of which I speak, can look
                  beyond this bourne; and though the traveller returns not, yet we know something of
                  how he fared on his entrance into the new country."</p>
               <p>"Then we need not fear for you," said Anna, tenderly, "when you are called to pass
                  this bourne?"</p>
               <p>"No, sister," replied Marion, "I know in whom I have believed, and I feel sure
                  that it will be well with me, so far as I have shunned what is evil and sought to
                  do good. Do not think of me as sinking into some gloomy profound; or awakening
                  from my sleep of death, startled, amazed, or shocked by the sudden transition.
                  Loving angels will be my companions as I descend into the valley and the shadow of
                  death; and I will fear no evil. Upon the other side I will be received among those
                  who have gone before, and I will scarcely feel that there has been a change. A
                  little while I will remain there, and then pass upward to my place in heaven."</p>
               <p>The mother of Marion entered her room at this moment, and the conversation was
                  suspended. But it was renewed again soon after, and the gentle-hearted,
                  spiritual-minded girl continued to talk of the other world as one preparing for a
                  journey talks about the new country into which he is about going, and of whose
                  geography, and the manners and customs of whose people, he has made himself
                  conversant from books.</p>
               <p>Not long did she remain on this side of the dark valley, through which she was to
                  pass. A few months<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC5621-00000102"/> wound up the story
                  of her earthly life, and she went peacefully and confidently on her way to her
                  eternal dwelling-place. It was a sweet, sad time, when the parting hour came, and
                  the mother, brother, and dearly loved adopted sister, gathered around Marion's bed
                  to see her die. That angels were present, each one felt; for the sphere of
                  tranquillity that pervaded the hearts of all was the sphere of heaven.</p>
               <p>"God is love," said Marion, a short time before she passed away. She was holding
                  the hand of her mother, and looking tenderly in her face. "How exquisite is my
                  perception of this truth? It comes upon me with a power that subdues my spirit,
                  yet fills it with ineffable peace. With what a wondrous love has he regarded us! I
                  never had had so intense a perception of this as now."</p>
               <p>Marion closed her eyes, and for some time lay silent, while a heavenly smile
                  irradiated her features. Then looking up, she said, and as she spoke she took the
                  hand of Anna and placed it within that of her mother—</p>
               <p>"When I am gone, let the earthly love you bore me, mother, be added to that
                  already felt for our dear Anna. Think of me as an angel, and of her as your
                  child."</p>
               <p>In spite of her effort to restrain them, tears gushed from the eyes of Mrs. Lee,
                  and fell like rain over her cheeks. For a short time she bent to her dying one,
                  and clasped her wildly to her bosom. But the calmness of a deeply laid trust in
                  Providence was soon restored to her spirit, and she said, speaking of Anna—</p>
               <p>"Without her, how could we part with you? I do not think I could bear it."</p>
               <p>"I shall go before you only a little while," returned Marion, "only a very little
                  while. A few years—how quickly they will hurry by! A few more days of labour, and
                  your earthly tasks will be done. Then we shall meet again. And even in the days of
                  our separation we shall not be far removed from each other. Thought will bring us
                  spiritually near, and affection conjoin us, even though no sense of the body give
                  token of proximity. And who knows but to me will be assigned the guardianship of
                  the dear babe given to us by Anna? Oh! if love will secure that holy duty, then it
                  will be mine!"</p>
               <p>A light, as if reflected from the sun of heaven, beamed from the countenance of
                  Marion, who closed her eyes, and, in a little while, fell off into a gentle sleep.
                  Silently did those who loved her with more than human tenderness—for there was in
                  their affection a love of goodness for its own sake—bend over and watch the face
                  of the sweet sleeper, even until there came stealing upon them the fear that she
                  would not waken again in this world. And the fear was not groundless; for thus she
                  passed away. To her death came as a gentle messenger, to bid her go up higher. And
                  she obeyed the summons without a mortal fear.</p>
               <p>No passionate grief at their loss raged wildly in the bosoms of those who suffered
                  this great bereavement. For years, the mother and son had daily striven against
                  selfish feelings as evil; and now, comprehending with the utmost clearness that
                  Marion's removal was, for her, a blessed change, their<pb n="204-205"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000103"/> hearts were thankful, even while tears wet their
                  cheeks. They mourned for her departure, because they were human; they suffered
                  pain, for ties of love the most tender had been snapped asunder; they wept,
                  because in weeping nature found relief. Yet, in all, peace brooded over their
                  spirits.</p>
               <p>When the fading, wasting form of earth which Marion's pure spirit had worn, as a
                  garment, but now laid aside forever, was borne out, and consigned to its kindred
                  clay, those who remained behind experienced no new emotions of grief. To them
                  Marion still lived. This was the old mortal body, that vailed, rather than made
                  visible, her real beauty. Now she was clothed in a spiritual body, that was
                  transcendently beautiful, because it was the very form of good affections. To lay
                  the useless garment aside was not, therefore, a painful task. This done, each
                  member of the bereaved family returned to his and her life-tasks, and, in the
                  faithful discharge of daily duties, found a sustaining power. But Marion was not
                  lost to them. Ever present was she in their thought and affection, and often, in
                  dreams, she was with them,—yet, never as the suffering mortal; but as the happy,
                  glorified immortal. Beautiful was the faith upon which they leaned. To them the
                  spiritual was not a something vague and undeterminate; but a real entity. They
                  looked beyond the grave, into the spiritual world, as into a better country, where
                  life was continued in higher perfection, and where were spiritual ultimates, as
                  perfectly adapted to spiritual sense as are the ultimates of creation to the
                  senses of the natural body.</p>

               <head>THE LOVE SECRET.</head>
               <p>"EDWARD is to be in London next week," said Mrs. Ravensworth; "and I trust, Edith,
                  that you will meet him with the frankness he is entitled to receive."</p>
               <p>Edith Hamilton, who stood behind the chair of her aunt, did not make any
                  answer.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ravensworth continued—"Edward's father was your father's own brother. A man
                  of nobler spirit never moved on English soil; and I hear that Edward is the worthy
                  son of a worthy sire."</p>
               <p>"If he were as pure and perfect as an angel, aunt," replied Edith, "it would be
                  all the same to me. I have never seen him, and cannot, therefore, meet him as one
                  who has a right to claim my hand."</p>
               <p>"Your father gave you away when you were a child, Edith; and Edward comes now to
                  claim you by virtue of this betrothal."</p>
               <p>"While I love the memory of my father, and honour him as a child should honour a
                  parent," said Edith, with much seriousness, "I do not admit his right to give me
                  away in marriage while I was yet a child. And, moreover, I do not think the man
                  who would seek to consummate such a marriage contract worthy of any maiden's love.
                  Only the heart that yields a free consent is worth having, and the man who would
                  take any other is utterly unworthy of<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC5621-00000104"/>
                  any woman's regard. By this rule I judge Edward to be unworthy, no matter what his
                  father may have been."</p>
               <p>"Then you mean," said Mrs. Ravensworth, "deliberately to violate the solemn
                  contract made by your father with the father of Edward?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot receive Edward as anything but a stranger," replied Edith. "It will not
                  mend the error of my father for me to commit a still greater one."</p>
               <p>"How commit a still greater one?" inquired Mrs. Ravensworth.</p>
               <p>"Destroy the very foundation of a true marriage —freedom of choice and consent.
                  There would be no freedom of choice on his part, and no privilege of consent on
                  mine. Happiness could not follow such a union, and to enter into it would be doing
                  a great wrong. No, aunt, I cannot receive Edward in any other way than as a
                  stranger—for such he is."</p>
               <p>"There is a clause in your father's will that you may have forgotten, Edith," said
                  her aunt.</p>
               <p>"That which makes me penniless if I do not marry Edward Hamden?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"No—I have not forgotten it, aunt."</p>
               <p>"And you mean to brave that consequence?"</p>
               <p>"In a choice of evils we always take the least." Edith's voice trembled.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ravensworth did not reply for some moments. While she sat silent, the
                  half-closed door near which Edith stood, and toward which her aunt's back was
                  turned, softly opened, and a handsome youth, between whom and Edith glances of
                  intelligence gence instantly passed, presented the startled maiden with a
                  beautiful white rose, and then noiselessly retired.</p>
               <p>It was nearly a minute before Mrs. Ravensworth resumed the light employment in
                  which she was engaged, and as she did so, she said—</p>
               <p>"Many a foolish young girl gets her head turned with those gay gallants at our
                  fashionable watering-places, and imagines that she has won a heart when the object
                  of her vain regard never felt the throb of a truly unselfish and noble
                  impulse."</p>
               <p>The crimson deepened on Edith's cheeks and brow, and as she lifted her eyes, she
                  saw herself in a large mirror opposite, with her aunt's calm eyes steadily fixed
                  upon her. To turn her face partly away, so that it could no longer be reflected
                  from the mirror, was the work of an instant. In a few moments she said—</p>
               <p>"Let young and foolish girls get their heads turned if they will. But I trust I am
                  in no danger."</p>
               <p>"I am not so sure of that. Those who think themselves most secure are generally in
                  the greatest danger. Who is the youth with whom you danced last evening? I don't
                  remember to have seen him here before."</p>
               <p>"His name is Evelyn." There was a slight tremor in Edith's voice.</p>
               <p>"How came you to know him?"</p>
               <p>"I met him here last season."</p>
               <p>"You did?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, ma'am. And I danced with him last night. Was there any harm in that?" The
                  maiden's voice had regained its firmness.</p>
               <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC5621-00000105"/>
               <p>"I didn't say there was," returned Mrs. Ravensworth, who again relapsed into
                  silence. Not long after, she said—"I think we will return to London on
                  Thursday."</p>
               <p>"So soon!" Edith spoke in a disappointed voice.</p>
               <p>"Do you find it so very pleasant here?" said the aunt, a little ironically.</p>
               <p>"I have not complained of its being dull, aunt," replied Edith. "But if you wish
                  to return on Thursday, I will be ready to accompany you."</p>
               <p>Soon after this, Edith Hamilton left her aunt's room, and went to one of the
                  drawing-rooms of the hotel at which they were staying, where she sat down near a
                  recess window that overlooked a beautiful promenade. She had been here only a few
                  minutes, when she was joined by a handsome youth, to whom Edith said—</p>
               <p>"How could you venture to the door of my aunt's parlour? I'm half afraid she
                  detected your presence, for she said, immediately afterward, that we would return
                  to London on the day after to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"So soon? Well, I'll be there next week, and it will be strange if, with your
                  consent, we don't meet often."</p>
               <p>"Edward Hamden is expected in a few days," replied Edith, her voice slightly
                  faltering.</p>
               <p>Her companion looked at her searchingly for a few moments, and then said—</p>
               <p>"You have never met him?"</p>
               <p>"Never."</p>
               <p>"But when you do meet him, the repugnance you now feel may instantly vanish."</p>
               <p>A shadow passed over Edith's face, and she answered in a voice that showed the
                  remark—the tone of which conveyed more than the words themselves—to have been felt
                  as a question of her constancy.</p>
               <p>"Can one whose heart is all unknown to me, one who must think of me with a feeling
                  of dislike because of bonds and pledges, prove a nearer or a dearer friend
                  than—"</p>
               <p>Edith did not finish the sentence. But that was not needed. The glance of rebuking
                  tenderness cast upon her companion expressed all that her lips had failed to
                  utter.</p>
               <p>"But you do not know me, Edith," said the young man.</p>
               <p>"My heart says differently," was Edith's lowly spoken reply.</p>
               <p>Evelyn pressed the maiden's hand, and looked into her face with an earnest, loving
                  expression.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ravensworth, to whose care Edith had been consigned on the death of her
                  father, had never been pleased with the unwise contract made by the parents of her
                  niece and Edward Hamden. The latter had been for ten years in Paris and Italy,
                  travelling and pursuing his studies. These being completed, in obedience to the
                  will of a deceased parent, he was about returning to London to meet his future
                  wife. No correspondence had taken place between the parties to this unnatural
                  contract; and, from the time of Edward's letter, when he announced to Mrs.
                  Ravensworth his proposed visit, it was plain that his feelings were as little
                  interested in his future partner as were hers in him.</p>
               <p>During the two or three days that Mrs. Ravensworth<pb n="210-211"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000106"/> worth and her niece remained at the watering-place,
                  Edith and young Evelyn met frequently; but, as far as possible, at times when they
                  supposed the particular attention of the aunt would not be drawn toward them in
                  such a manner as to penetrate their love secret. When, at length, they parted, it
                  was with an understanding that they were to meet in London.</p>
               <p>On returning to the city, the thoughts of Edith reverted more directly to the fact
                  of Edward Hamden's approaching visit; and, in spite of all her efforts to remain
                  undisturbed in her feelings, the near approach of this event agitated her. Mrs.
                  Ravensworth frequently alluded to the subject, and earnestly pressed upon Edith
                  the consideration of her duty to her parent, as well as the consequences that must
                  follow her disregard of the contract which had been made. But the more she talked
                  on this subject, the more firm was Edith in expressing her determination not to do
                  violence to her feelings in a matter so vital to her happiness.</p>
               <p>The day at length came upon which Edward Hamden was to arrive. Edith appeared, in
                  the morning, with a disturbed air. It was plain to the closely observing eyes of
                  her aunt, that she had not passed a night of refreshing sleep.</p>
               <p>"I trust, my dear niece," she said, after they had retired from the breakfast
                  table, where but little food had been taken, "that you will not exhibit toward
                  Edward, on meeting him, any of the preconceived and unjust antipathy you
                  entertain. Let our feelings, at least, remain uncommitted for or against him."</p>
               <p>"Aunt Helen, it is useless to talk to me in this way," Edith replied, with more
                  than her usual warmth. "The simple fact of an obligation to love puts a gulf
                  between us. My heart turns from him as from an enemy. I will meet him with
                  politeness; but it must be cold and formal. To ask of me more, is to ask what I
                  cannot give. I only wish that he possessed the manliness I would have had if
                  similarly situated. Were this so, I would now be free by his act, not my own."</p>
               <p>Seeing that all she urged but made the feelings of Edith oppose themselves more
                  strongly to the young man, Mrs. Ravensworth ceased to speak upon the subject, and
                  the former was left to brood with a deeply disturbed heart over the approaching
                  interview with one who had come to claim a hand that she resolutely determined not
                  to yield.</p>
               <p>About twelve o'clock, Mrs. Ravensworth came to Edith's room and announced the
                  arrival of Edward Hamden. The maiden's face became pale, and her lips
                  quivered.</p>
               <p>"If I could but be spared an interview," she murmured. "But that is more than I
                  can ask."</p>
               <p>"How weak you are, Edith," replied her aunt, in a tone of reproof.</p>
               <p>"I will join you in the drawing-room in half an hour," said Edith, speaking more
                  calmly.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ravensworth retired, and left Edith again to her own thoughts. She sat for
                  nearly the whole of the time she had mentioned. Then rising hurriedly, she made a
                  few changes in her attire; after which she descended to the drawing-room with a
                  step that was far from being firm.</p>
               <p>So noiselessly did she enter the apartment where<pb n="212-213"
                     xml:id="VAC5621-00000107"/> Hamden awaited her, that neither her aunt nor the
                  young man perceived her presence for some moments, and she had time to examine his
                  appearance, and to read the lineaments of his half-averted face. While she stood
                  thus observing him, her countenance suddenly flushed, and she bent forward with a
                  look of surprise and eagerness. At this moment the young man became aware that she
                  had entered, and rising up quickly, advanced to meet her.</p>
               <p>"Evelyn!" exclaimed Edith, striking her hands together, the moment he turned
                  toward her.</p>
               <p>"Edith! my own Edith! returned the young man, as he grasped her hand, and ventured
                  a warm kiss on her beautiful lips. "Not Evelyn, but Hamden. Our parents betrothed
                  us while we were yet too young to give or withhold consent. Both, as we grew
                  older, felt this pledge as a heart-sickening constraint. But we met as strangers,
                  and I saw that you were all my soul could desire. I sought your regard and won it.
                  No obligation but love now binds us."</p>
               <p>The young man then turned to Mrs. Ravensworth, and said—</p>
               <p>"You see, madam, that we are not strangers."</p>
               <p>Instead of looking surprised, Mrs. Ravensworth smiled calmly, and answered—</p>
               <p>"No—it would be singular if you were. Love-tokens don't generally pass, nor
                  familiar meetings take place between strangers."</p>
               <p>"Love-tokens, Aunt Helen?" fell from the lips of Edith, as she turned partly away
                  from Hamden, and looked inquiringly at her relative.</p>
               <p>"Yes, dear," returned Mrs. Ravensworth. "White roses, for instance. You saw your
                  own blushing face. in the mirror, did you not?"</p>
               <p>"The mirror! Then you saw Edward present the rose?"</p>
               <p>"And did you know me?" inquired the young man.</p>
               <p>"One who knew your rather as well as I did could not fail to know the son. I
                  penetrated your love secret as soon as it was known to yourselves."</p>
               <p>"Aunt Helen!" exclaimed Edith, hiding her face on the neck of her kind relative,
                  "how have I been deceived!"</p>
               <p>"Happily, I trust, love," returned Mrs. Ravensworth, tenderly.</p>
               <p>"Most happily! My heart swells with gladness almost to bursting," came murmuring
                  from the lips of the joyful maiden.</p>
