HE   couldn't help it! Nor could II It rained  all day, all night, all the next day, and all the day be- fore--three days!  I was wallking from planta- tion to town, near Macon, District of Loyalty. I think it rained, as usual. I saw her gliding from cabin to cabin, from  negro house to abode of negro, like a baby duck, much on the waddle. She carried a little cadias in her one hand, and in her other she held high toward the cerulean her skirts, and all sich. She was tall--loveli- ness on stilts! -I saw her from the afterwards-  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7467-00000013"/> 24   "Briclk"' and hAil Peninah! A she haa black stockings, wide, blue garters, and  moved lik a doctor on a visit to his first patient. I hastened to overtake her. I slid my um-  brella over her head. I asked her to excuse me,  which she did,^nd we hitched crooks at once. I was in my element and mud. The woman was white. She was a blushing daughter of New England. She was a gay damsel of many sea- sons. She was a polisher of Hams. She knew much about Iams.  She was a sylph-like edu- cator of niggeroons. She taught education to the ivoryites. She had left the white regions and friends of New England, to come South and tickle the tams-the little Fams by day and the big Hams by night, as' she continued her teaching by light-wood fires in dark wood- cabins. I went home with her. She told me all. I could no more. She was a feminine Yankee. She wanted stamps. Home was nothing; she was on the make. She had not character suffi-              ir   "Brick" and his Peninnah    25 cient to teach school in New England. She was not handsome enough to go to New Orleans by sea, and ride to happiness on an Evening Star, so she became a negro schoolist. As a beauty, she was not above par, nor much else. As a scholarist, she was not brilliant. Smoked glass was not needed. As a lover of j  she was not severe; but when it came to stamps, she wore her prettys all the time. She told-me that her father's name was Stone. Her name was Penin- nah-Peninnah Stone. It was a Bible name; it meant precious Stone. Being from home, I was not accountable, so I made love to her, and went with her to school. She moved among the Hams like a silver thimble in a dripping-pan full of breeches-buttons. She wasn't much of a catch, but better than no catch. She was one of the stout-minded. Her early years were spent in chewing gum, weeding onions, pounding stone, and such little amuse- ments, incidental to New England, coupled with 2 2  ' *'      &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7467-00000014"/> 20  'BriCk -and his Peninnah!A psalm-singing and praying for damnation to rest upon all who were sinners. Peninnah was a sprightly sylph. She could harness an ox, split rails, stick a hog, and do all manner of such music, We loved. It was a matter of profit. [Being a New E  er, she had no heart. Simply a Stone. Harder than a Brick. We walled about among the cabins of her lambs. She was chief engineer of a nigger-teaching shop, and boss of a mammoth carpet-bag. We meandered under the black-jacks and honeysuckles. First she'd sling her arms about my neck and kiss me, then she'd kiss t;he little lambs-dear little Hams! Said I: "Peninnah, sweet one, why kissest thou the little he-thopians?" Then she bent her eyes into me, and said: "The more we kiss 'em, the more hair-oil, brass rings, photographs, and playthings we sell 'em! ' Alh, I see, charming Peninnah! lSiss 'em- kiss 'em all around, from cabin to cabin, from   "Bric=" and Ahi Peninnah!    27 Hlam to Ham, from infancy to old age, and sell 'em gewgaws-for of such is the kingdom of New England, and he-thopians are the profit. And we sat on a mossy bank, watching the lit- tle Hams basking in the sun as they wallowed in the warmth, and thus braided our love together. Said my sweet Peninnah: "Oh, Brick, it's nice! Let us wed and be happy. I'll support you. I'm a Yankee school- ist, not handsome enough to be ornamental, or I'd gone farther South. But I'm several on the make. I'll make mutton of these lambs, in time. There is no need of us at home, so I came here to makle money. I kiss the little Hams; I pets 'em  and I caress 'em; I tell "em that the good Abrum was their saviour; that he sent me here on purpose; that I love 'em so dearly; that they are--oh! so sweet to me, and  that, in a few years, each of 'em, male and female, shall be int Congress from  Massachusetts.

Show us any infernal machine constructed through the ingenuity of man for the' breaking of bones, ripping open of cuticle, damage of eyes, warping of backbones, perpetrating of contusions on head, or anything of that sort, that we have not been-on or dare not - try. Velocipede is a good thing, if you don't have too much- of it; and you can't have too much of it; unless you get more than you want. Everybody rides velocipedes nowadays. The ladies ride them.

Andc the confoundedest, stand- /up-fall-down-ingest thing a man, woman, or child ever saw, is a velocipede. They are erected on two wheels; one wheel being immediately in front of the other wheel, and the other wheel being immediately behind t'other wheel. This makes it more binding on the part of the operator. There are no axle-trees, no yard-arms, bolster, lobster, or other parapher- nalia pertaining to ox-carts, wAtgons, bob-sleds, railroad cars, steamboats, balloons, or any other inventions for locomotion yet discovered. There is a little thing runs through one wheel on which it revolves. It comes straight. up like the na- tional tax, then slants back four perches, five links, and six degrees; then jabs downward to\ the little thing in the hind wheel, and thus ends the first chapter, and likewise the next. At the front end, when it is not going backward, there is a contrivance resembling an auger, by which the ambitious goest turns, returns, upturns, over-   Riding a Velocpped       35 turns, and turns out of the way. Because of the auger in froiit, no one should consider the veloci- pede a perfect bore. Instead, it is a perfect goer; for many a man, in learning to go on it, has start- ed his gore in more places than lightning ever struck a one-eyed pilot. The concern has a spine, or backbone, which is used as a roof for the two wheels. The wheels are three-quarters of an inch wide. The backbone, or roof, is an inch and a quarter wide. On this backbone is affixed a cast- iron pad resembling in shape the frontispiece of some Dutch target company's parade-cap, except that the points of the pad are so arranged as to hurt you while mounted on this aforesaid inven- tion of agony. As a horsebackist, we have been called a success. Once we rode a mule. On another occasion we rode a brindle cow home from the fair -not to add to our comfort, but to pay the aforesaid bovine for not drawing the premium. On another occasion we undertook to ride a speckled steer, but for some reason or r   * "   '*         .  &#xD;<pb n="36" xml:id="VAC7467-00000019"/> 36     Ridicng a eloopede. other his finis department had a sudden inclina- tion to elevate itself -into the air, and we dis- mounted over his head, simply because 'the mane of the beast did not amount to much for hanging- on purposes. On another occasion we rode a saw-mill saw for half an hour, but we never tried it again. But we did try the velocipede. We got astride of it and started. Immediately after, a gentle- man was discovered lying on the ground, to the merriment of lookers-on. Once more we mounted the breach, if by these words a cast-iron pad may be called, and undertook to propel the invention. Just then a gentleman struck his head with e-x- treme violence against the curb-stone. More merriment. Another attempt, and just then a gentleman was discovered sprawling upon the ground, with his left ear full of mud. More merriment, but not on the part of the victim.

Riding a two-story Indiana hog just turned loose to fat on beach-nuts, would be sweet cream in comparison with this invention. Sliding down- hill on a hand-saw tooth-side up, would be two degrees more comfortable than experimenting on one of these contrivances; but then, it is fashion- able! If any of our readers have a suit of clothes they wish to spoil, seven or eight pair of legs they would lame for seven weeks, a high-finished and moral back they don't care for, fifteen or sixteen yards of court-plaster, a dozen or more new hats, several pairs of boots, and the Lord only knows how many coat-tails to spoil, let them buy a ve- locipede, and commence practice at once. To purchase one of the confounded things requires but a small fortune--say twice as much as is necessary to purchase a hand-cart, which is by far the most comfortable to ride on; while a few dollars extra would last about four hours for in- surance against accidents.

SAILORS? DANCE-HOIOUSE. F a man has the blues and is dissatis- fied with life, let him come with us to-night and to-morrow night, then let him go with us the next day afternoon on a visit to the poor of New York. Out on God's green fields, surrounded with the free air and growing vegetation, beneath the crimson sunsets of the West, we know not what it is to half live, or how our fellows do. And 'tis well we do not from experience. Down on Water street, in the great city of New York, and on other streets also, are to be found sailors' boarding-houses, sailors' homes, :      :   Samilors' Da nce-lIouse.   41 sailors' clothing-stores, and sailors' dancing-rooms. The latter we have visited, and there learned a lesson.     I At twelve o'clock we passed along the street, east from the Battery. Over the open door of a two-story wooden building hung a glass gas-lamp, on which was painted an anchor and two danc- ing-girls. Passing in at the door, we were in a small bar-room, the floor neatly sanded, a few lithographs on the walls, a few chairs standing around, a round table on which was a baclkgam- mon-board and some well-fumbled newspapers; some tissue-paper cut in fancy shapes and pat- terns ornamented the ceiling; 'screen, or sta- tionary blind, stood in one corner of the room; a bar well filled with nicely-polished, partly-filled glass decanters, presided over by a hawk-eyed man, and, with the exception of two strangers sipping a claret punch, the room is inventoried. \ Bowing to the bar-tender, who winks in return, we pass behind the screen, open a still-shutting  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7467-00000023"/> 42     Sailors' Dance-House. door, and the bright gas-light shows the way down a flight of stairs. At the top of the stairs, inside the door, sits a man who takes from you two shillings, and in return gives back a dirty card. At the foot of the stairs you find another man, who tales the card and admits you into a room, in which, if you choose, you may safely leave your hat or coat, receiving therefor a check till you see fit to return. Then through a side- door, down a second flight of stairs, and into a well-lighted but not well-ventilated room about fifty feet by seventy. This is the place; let us look around a wee bit. At the right is a bar extending clear across the room. In front is a narrow but high stage, on which are five musicians. Hard seats are ranged around all sides of the room, on which are sit- ting men, principally sailors, eager for fun, and women who could gain admittance here without exhibiting a marriage certificate. There are one or two black women and a few black men, but   Sailors' Dance-jouse a    43 they do not seem to confine their attention to those of their own color. Fashion had little to do with dress here- tawdry finery, draggled silk dresses full short above, gay tinselled head-dresses, cheap jewelry, and paint. Wrecks of humanity I Forms once loved, oh, how well! Hopes once so brig ow turned to ashes. God pity them! Here they can drown their sorrow, and nightly reach an- other mile-stone on the road to hell. In they came till the room was full, and soon the danc- ing began. No one waited for an introduction, but each one sailed in on his own hook, dancing and drinking, joking and laughing. The room was close and hot. Two stories under ground, it could not well be otherwise, when a hundred half-intoxicated men and women, both black and white, were singing and dancing and sweating down there like crazy devils. The plain but heavy oak bar across the far end of the room was covered with slops and  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7467-00000024"/> "    Sailors' Dance-touse. thick, heavy glasses, which would serve as slung- shots for a week without being broken or cracked. By one o'clock the fun was lively. The space in front of the bar was crowded, and a constant stream of c" blue ruin" went sizzling down the throats of the sailors and their partners. The six bar-tenders, with short hair, round heads, thick, short lips, red shirts, and armns bared, sweat like a man cradling, as they flew around from bottle to bottle, making change for this party, swearing at that one, and ordering back those who had just drank. The music struck up for a waltz. A tall, cor- pulent sailor, who would weigh at least two hun- dred and thirty pounds, with a half-drunken woman nearly his equal in size, jumped for the lead, and away they went-around and around! In twenty seconds fifty couple were whirling and twirling, till it seemed to us as if the room was a large chur, and the inmates were so many sticks rattling and jolting together as it went flying f        *    Salors8' Dance-House.

Away they .went circling around, black and white; here a big black fellow hugging a once beautiful white girl in close embrace; there a red-nosed American, two-thirds drunk, with the head of a black, greasy-looking wench lovingly reclining on his shoulder, his coarse, meaty hand half-imbedded in the thick fat of her sides; yon- der a short-legged German and a slim-waisted girl whirling like .a top, till it made one .dizzy to look at them. In five minutes all were tired out, and had marched to the bar, except the big couple and the American with the fat wench. Around the large room they went, keeping step to the music. Others turned to watch them, when one fellow with a sailor-jacket on sang out: "Heave ahead, old merchantman!" And he did "heave ahead," the little chap close behind.   ' "I'll go the grog on the slaver!" sang out a 4  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7467-00000025"/> 46     Satilos' Danee-House. jolly-looklin- chap who was fanning himself with his tarpaulin. "Ole Y'ginny neber tiah!" lisped the wench, as she passed the corner where our party stood, her black, greasy face looking with Ethiopian fondness into the face of her partner, and her musk-ular bosom heaving and tossing like a bum- boat at anchor in a storm! "U-o-r-e i-n!" sang out old corpulence, as he whirled past, panting for breath. The crowd was excited, and even forgot to drink, so anxious were they to see who would tire out first; and their remarks were in earnest, if not fashionably expressed: "Heave up, my hearty!" "Go in, little 'uns-a black sky and a white I " "Two to one on the whales!" "That's a go for the grog!  "Rip! my sweet Creole! If you beats 'Top- light Mill,' I wants a piece of you!"   Sailors' lDwcnce-House.   47 On they went, panting, sweating, and waltzing, with "Toplight Bill " and the "Creole " ahead. , The big couple were good dancers, but in a strife of this kind the lighter couple had the ad- vantage, and in ten minutes from the time the trial began, "Toplight Bill" and his sunburnt partner had the floor! Twice around the room they went, after the other couple had given out, then marched to the bar, blowing and puffing like a horse with the heaves. Drinking over for a few moments, and -while the crowd were waiting for the music to wet up. "Give us a song, Shorty!" sang out a very fiee-and-easy sailor, who evidently did not care whether school kept or not. "A song-a song-a song-yes, a song-a jolly good 'un!" sang out a score of voices, when a fancy-looking little fellow, about five feet no inches, in sailor-dress, stepped out on the floor, and ini fine alto voice began:  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7467-00000026"/> 48       SSailors' Dance-Iouse.

He was dressed in style, with check pants, square-toed boots for kicking, red under and white over shirt, both unbuttoned at the col- lar, sleeves rolled up, and hat removed from a close-cropped head. He was about fivefeet eight inches high, square frame, looking like a tough nut to crack, as he was. His eye was all over the room, and we noticed that, whenever he went up to a noisy fellow and told him lindly to " go slow," the noisy individual thought it good ad- vice, and gave heed. We never saw the sailors' hornpipe danced till we saw it here, and the exhibition of agility was worth a day's journey. One might as well try to keep track of a flea by moonlight, as to try to tell whose bodies the hundred legs on the floor be- longed to.

While the crowd was surging up toward the bar, we stood and carefully scanned the motley assemblage.  Most of them  were from  twenty- one to middle age, although among the men were a few old salts whose hair was turning gray. Most of them  were sailors, intent on fun and spending their hard-earned money; and, what   Sailors' Dance-Houtse.      51 between poor whiskey and other pleasures, they wsre in a fair way to soon be ready for another cruise. With a few exceptions, there was noth- ing ugly about the countenances of the motley crowd assembled there. Good nature, careless- ness, love of fun, and a sort of jolly indepen- dence, were the chief traits discernible. They-- the sailors--had long been absent from shore- scenes and pleasures, and were evidently bound to have a good time; and their partners, who fre- quent such places, and literally " freeze " to the poor tar soon as he returns from a cruise, till his money be spent, were as attentive and loving as a poor sailor could wish.

The keepers of these places make money, and not a few of them are owned by up-town mer- chants, who employ a trusty man as overseer. The small admittance-fee of twenty-fivc cents more than pays the music and rent; while the profits from the sale of doctored liquors and vile cigars cannot be short of a hundred dollars a night.

And, in less time than we have con- sumed in writing the two preceding paragraphs, the rival train is half a mile ahead of us, flying like a devil-kite over the flat-land. Smile?  Not a bit. We looked at the engi- neer, who seemed to know his business!  He looked at us once; there was a nod:-it; was enough. Then he looked at our young friend, master of transportation, with us on the engine. Another answering nod. Business, now!

The engineer pulled that skull-cap a little closer over his eyes, and opened the window before him; then his left .foot reached down to the brace, as if to say some- thinl to the network of mechanism! Then he leaned forward just a little, like a jockey win- ning the Derby, took hold of the lever, and pulled so slowly and firmly that it seemed as if he was in love with his engine. Thank you!

And then, as speed was slackened, our engineer says, with a smile: "Good nornoing /" And the two trains went on their way as if nothing had happened-as there had not-only a race-a going a little faster than usual rate of speed, out of compliment to a perfect track and the perfection of machinery.

And the engineer looked so lovingly and ap- provingly on the beauty on which we rode--the strength, the polish, the perfection of ingenuity. The fireman opened the door so we could hear the little devils in the hot throat and livid fur- m nace laugh and chuckle over the work so well done under the guiding hand of a brave man, who could tame the elements to annihilate space. And we looked at the country-at the beauti- ful engine-at the long stretch of railroad-at the work men had done for such great purpose. Then we sat on the cushioned seat so kindly given up to us by the fireman, who soon will be an engineer, and thought of the earnest workers of the lapd-of the braw-armed mechanics, whose muscle we almost envy-of their clink- clank on anvils-of their work over hot fires- of their daily, daily, daily work--of their wives and their little ones of their sweethearts and   Race orn the Prcarie.     67 their hopes for the future-of the earnest life they are living-of the work they are doing for the benefit of our country.

Then, we thought, as the train flew on, as the engineer managed the beautiful machinery made by other workingmen, as the fireman threw in the wood cut by other workingmen, as we rode over the-roads laid by still other workingmoen, as we dashed by the homes of yet other working- men, as we hastened on to help our worizngmen, how glorious it is to live and be of some use in this world, whicht is one of the little machine- shops of the universe.

IREMNISCENCE OF ROXELIA. OU never saw Roxelia Powlowker,- the crimson-haired daughter of Gen- eral Washington Powlowker, of Bos- ton, did you? If not, I'll tell you about her. She is married, now-has been for years. But she was not then. I was a boy--a pale-eyed songling of some note, but not possessed of much wealth. My parents were honest people. General Powlowker lived in a stone house-a large edifice, with not less than nineteen rooms inside, and room for more outside. Mrs. Powlowker called it a stun house; but she was always so facetious.  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7467-00000037"/> 70    Reminiscence of Roxelia. Mrs. Powlowker was General Powlowker's wife-lawfully wedded unto him  a long time previous. IIis father was one of them as fit into the Revolution. lie, too, had a contract-took his pay in Continental money, bought land4 loaned it out in corner-lots with mortgage secur- ity, and took on style. He must have been pos- sessed of at least several thousand dollars, if not more. Hie was a respectable man. He never drank out of a bottle. He lnever swore before the preacher, or other company. But sometimes, in the barn, or when a wasp whuld sting into him he .would converse in dialect most sulphurious. He had five children-three boys, and two who were pretty near boys. Roxelia was one of the latter.  I was one of the boys she used to be pretty near, only when the old gent would catch us at , it! Then he objected. Once or twice he object- ed with a boot. But did true love ever run smooth?   Reminiseencee of Roxetla.    71 I heart-hankered for Roxelia. She was fair to look upon. She had health-about one hundred and eighty pounds of it. And her face! It was all there. And her feet! What sighs!-as I think of those. And her hair! Like her heart --to love her Markuel, decidedly ready. She was to have property some day. We all desire property. As a nation of accumulators, we are a general success.  I was not rich, but was willing to be.   And I did love eoxelia. She was the first girl I ever saw so much of. There was not so much of any other girl as of her. How I courted that girl! The first eggs of spring I found in her father's barnary and laid in her lap. The early birch-bark and the pris- tine juvenile wintergreen, with an occasional slip of prince's pine, would I besiege her with. The language of the latter--I pine for thee, 0 Roxelia. I desired to become wedlockically acquainted  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7467-00000038"/> 72    Renminiscence of Roxelia. with her. I0 visited her Saturday nights, and stayed till Morpheusly sleepy. But not when the old man was there. I looked with luscious eye on the time when I could be son-in-law to the General. But I was poor. My home was in a blacksmith-shop-part of the time. Because I at times was caught at a vise, the old man had no use for me. He asked if I had money. "No, no, old man," I said. But PEoxelia did not detest me. Oft have I sat on the fence and looked in at her window. Often did I stand and see her father walk by. But he never noticed me. But I did his girl. IvWe planned elopements. We sat, and sighed, and squeezed each other's hands. It is justly sup- posed to be fun. Indeed it is. So we liked it. Roxelia liked it, too. We made affection to each other. We met by moonlight. Once she moved forth from her chamber-window and sat on the wood-shed roof.

But she went not into the chamber that night, like a turtle in his pal- ace, till we had plighted. When should come the spring-time, we were to wed. This contract was negotiated in the gentle autumn, when the moon was in its mooniest glory, and chickens had not read of Thanksgiving terrors. Then I was very happy. I slid off that roof as easy!

The next night, like a dutiful girl, she told her paternal that she had chosen and had promised to wed with the object of her father's cholorousness. He was angry--perhaps more. Iie took hold of her ear with vehemence. He wafted her from him. He said she was no daughter of his- which was a rough joke on her'mother, to say the least. But the General was angry. He threat- ened convent for the girl and double-barrelled shot-gun for the boy. But she was firmness. Then I loved Roxelia none the less. Quite to' the very contrary. So we sat in meditation and apprehension. And alas! One day a man came there, who was a scion of wealth, who boasted of pedigree, who wore oil on --c   Remizscence of Boxelia.    75 his mustache, who carried a cane, and wore cream-colored kids. He spake French, and Greek, and Russian, and other oddities, to me. He was the Count Somebody. He talked with the General. He played sweet on the fair Rox- elia. He minced his language He boasted of his paternity, and of his beautiful home by the sea. As a talker, he was a success. Good-by, boy in a blacksmith-shop! When the vernal season came, there was a wed- ding. The Count and  Poxelia were the ones. She turned up her nose at me. Old Powlowker wanted me to come and black boots for the Count the night he was to be married. He said it was an honor he would confer upon me. I went-not much!  Time has been flying a few years. I saw Roxelia to-day. .Her CoLut was also a banker-a large dealer. But he dealt fair-O! he did. Old Powlowker thought he was a catch. So did Roxelia. So it was-for Roxelia.

My name, which it is Wandering V. A. Bond. My father made basswood hams, and that was the cause of it. The amateur part of my varie-, gated life-was spent in New Hampshire. Edu- cated on two catechisms -one Kittychism and baked beans on Sunday, I skinned cats on Mon- day for worrying rats on the.

The song of praise in the morn, and the flipping of coppers for the con- tents of the contribution-plate, were heard each Sabbath, while the sisters of the flock poured molasses and the rum of New England together for evening devotions and ornamenting of puri- tanical noses. This, by way of prelude. When the war came I was at home, busy at my avocation. I heard the harsh tocsin of fight. It wakened me from my afternoon nap on a bench in the corner grocery, and kindled a new impulse into me. It filled me with martial de- sire. I sold my clam-cart, and laid my all on the altar of Government. I was commissioned by the best President- of the best Government the best people in the best world ever saw, to arm and go forth as a Chaplain, to fight the enemies of Gog and Magog, Shadrach, Abraham, and Belial. ?   Ku-Klux.        79 In two days I fitted myself for the ministry; in one day fitted for war--a cerulean uniform and an empty trunk. At the expense of our good Government I rode forth by sea and by land, on foot and on horseback; going up and down the earth, preaching currant-jelly for the stomach, plunder for the body, and loyalty for effect. Therefore hear me, ye President and other Reprobates of the upper and nether mill- stones, whose business which is to grind with steady continuality those who are guilty of mis- fortune. So'give ear, you who have ears in abundance, to this my loyal complaint. I have been out- raged - victimized - destroyed. Warped in my liberties and demoralized in my pursuits, I now demand the protection of Congress. One summer day I left the grottos of New Hampshire, to travel South. Two hundred men who wanted to get rid of me signed a paper as to my worth, and, with the proceeds of the contri-  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7467-00000042"/> o80       Xn-Klux. bution-plate one Sabbath, I lit out. Miles I wan- dered, by sea and land, till I pierced the heart and borders beyond the rebellious, land in the South!  One day I was walking along the road in Texas, when I saw a man in a field, with a mule and a plow and a tattered suit of gray, making believe he was at work. When I saw him in those whipped garments, my hair clove to the roof of my mouth, and my tongue got upon its end like squills in fretful turpentine. I thought of the way he had murdered our innocents, pro- longed the war, starved us at Andersonville, cheated Banks on Red River, and sold cotton to oar Northern Generals! My poor heart did seethe and bile, like soap in a new kettle. "At last I got over the apologyfor a fence, and ap- proached the villain, and said unto him in a loudT loyal tone of voice, so his mule could hear me:  "Plowin', are Aye? Why ain't ye in a grocery, hunrrahin' for Grant Is this the way you spit   lZu-Klux.       81 upon your benefactors? Plowin', are ye? Why don't you leave this work for the poor blacks?" "Nothing to pay them with! said he. Then I said, says I: e "You are a liar and a rebel! That old coat was not made in New England!" He looked at me and to his mule, and said: "Whoa, Butler!" He had but one arm; then I lmew he was a rebel, and I thought proper to subdue his re- bellion. I engaged him, but alas! he bounced me! He thrust his one fist into my left eye; he punched me on the end of my nostril, and he ldcksed at me with the ungodly vehemence of a jackass. So I was compelled to move on in sor- row and suffering. He is not whipped yet! A kind negro lady kept me all night, and, because I was sore, torn, bruised, and battered, put me ir her little bed. In the language of Absalom when he hung himself by the hair up to dry, I groaned: '  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7467-00000043"/> 82         u--,KIx.

Walldng one day in Louisiana, I saw a horse lack a gen- tleman of color-of- Baez complexion.   Of course, the gentleman was loyal; the horse was not. So I went up to him, and said to him: "Wounded and outraoged brother, who owns that horse?" "Marsa lobert." "Was that horse in the Southern army?" "Yes, marsa." "Go home, mutilated citizen; I will punish this noble brute!          . To punish him for kicking my brother, I en- ticed him under and between me, and, with a stout switch, so warmed the steed that he ran fifteen miles before I could stop him. I pulled   Kuiltzux.        83 up at a grocery, and who should come out from that 'ere sinful place but the man who owned the horse! Instead of staying at home and doing his work, he had left it to niggers, and a horse to abuse them. I told him of it--told how it was my duty to protect the down-trodden and punish their oppressors. The man was a rebel; I know it, for his hair was' gray! He' seized the horse, hove me from its back, and, with the aid of some ungodly ones, so set upon me that I was bounced again! I Ru-Klux!  Will Congress not interfere, or will it not a Hear me again, most noble President. Not liling, the rebellious atmosphere of Louisiana, I sought the everglades of Florida; and here again my loyalty caused me much s uffering. On a circus-day, while the tent was going up, I saw many contrabands seated in shady places, playing Old Sledge, Penny-Ante, and such wcik-  &#xD;<pb n="84 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7467-00000044"/> 84       IzKu-Klux. ed games. Procuring a box, I mounted myself thereon, and said unto these innocent men and brothers: "Come here, sable objects of our Government, and give heed unto my advice. Behold in me a loyal man from New England! During the war I wept for you often and often. During the war I fought copperheads and butternuts, traitors and Democrats in the North, oftentimes in one day slaying ten thousand or more with my good right arm.

In the crowd I saw t white man loading a shot-gtn. The man was seventeen feet high, and I knmow it, and his gun was eighty-six feet long!. While he was putting seven or eight pounds of buck-shot in the left-hand barrel, I noticed a reliable contraband making haste through the crowd; coming with vigilance toward my platform. He approached, lifted his lips to my ear, and whispered: "You'd- better git; dat ar man am  a Ku- Klux!   &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7467-00000046"/> 86        Eu-K lux.

They were children ranging from seven to twelve years of age. I looked, Mr. President and Members of Congress, upon their faces, but there was no sadness there! The little rebels were lautghing and playing just like other children--and the American flag floating only thirty miles away! Great God! Mr. President, can such things be, and be tolerated in this free country  My spirit again rose within me, and my blood took unto itself feelings of vengeance. When this regiment of young rebels came along, I rose in my -dignity, pulled my hat well down upon my head, stretched forth my right hand, and proclaimed:   ZKu-Klux         87 "Oil, ye little whelps of ungodly peoplehood I Your: fathers were rebels, and ye deserve death.

We've heard just such talk before. Let's bounce him 1"-) And, Mr. President, they proceeded at once to carry their infernal threat into execution. They attacked me in front and rear with stones. They called me vile names. They wrenched from me my carpet-bag, and divided my plunder among them. They said I was a thief. They advised me to get to my home. I called upon several intelligent contrabands who were near to come to my relief, but so terror-stricken were they that they dare not.  Dear creatures  they did not wish to plunge the country into another war! cThey were afraid of these young rebels,; and for the sake of appearances, and to cultivate the friendship of those they feared, they stood /afar   off, and laughed -and clapped their hands, and the urchins continually assailed me. They parted my coat-tails from the upper portion of the gar- ment. They rolled me in the mud, and sifted sand in ay hair! They put a split stick upon my nose, and turpentine-wax in- my ears. But, thank God! Mdr. President, they could not seal my mouth that it should not cry out against the horrible outrages inflicted- upon the loyal people of the South by the Ku-Klux! Is there- no redress for patriotism ? Are loyal men to be thus outraged a If so, it were better for-this Government that a mill-stone were tied in its coat-tail pocket, and it be sunk in a tan- vat!

She was very muscular about the-the-the-the chest, and we thought some of turningo back, but she asked: "Did yer knock 2 " "To be s-s-s-sertainly! Is ]Madame Ray in?" "She is. Walk in." We entered.

On the wall hung   a large printed and colored chart some three feet square; on this chart were innumer- able figures of all colors, circles, triangles, signs, cosines, hieroglyphics, &amp;c.  On a dressing-case stood perfumery of several kinds; while a gam- mon-board, a set of chess-men, and   a pack-of  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7467-00000051"/> 96     Among the Astrologists. cards on a stand, showed that the occupant was evidently game. On a well-worn mohair-covered sofa sat, as we entered, Madame Ray, who arose very gracefully to receive us. She: was about forty-five years of 'age, red-faced, red-necked as far as we could see--and that was far enough She had brown hair, fat fingers, fat face, and fat sides.' Her dress was a morning-gown of red silk, and we set her down as the worst old talker in the business. "Good morning, fair stranger!" "Good momring, Madame!  "What is the object of your visit this- morn- inga " "We came, Madame, to gconsult you as to the past, the present, and the future. Having doubts in our mind as to what course to pursue, we come to you for advice and counsel." "Have you faith?" "Exceeding great of it!" "Stranger, you have done well to consult me.

Look out, or sharpers will put bad money on you; and that Ziat-an-yan Bank is Western, and is not worth much here!" We looked at the "gay deceiver," folded it carefully, and laid it away, first thanking the Madame.   As she knew worthless money, our faith in her power increased! "In what year was ydct born, sir?" "Don't know-am an orphan who never knew nothing much I' "What is your birthday?"

We did as directed, when she said: "Nine times two are eighteen; eight times four are thirty-two. The year you were born was 1832, and it was in the eleventh month, or December. You first put your finger on 2, then on 11, which makes your birthday -the 13th."' As this was our birthday in reality, we felt a little curious to have her go on. She continued: "You don't look so old, but you be! I can tell everything. Cut those cards. (We cut at the queen of diamonds.)  You first loved a woman who was rich.

She continued, as she looked them over one by one: "You have had much trouble in business, but you will come out all right before long. You are in business somewhere now, and making money. In a short time you will mnake more. You face up a long journey, but no danger. You are very lucky and independent. You cut the queen of hearts; you will soon meet the one you love best of all.

We opened the book as directed, when she continued: "aYou will be an old man, and have many friends when you die, and you will die in your own house. You will die in the parlor, on a bed so you can see the sun go down. You will have friends by you, and will die very easy--just like going to sleep. You will leave property to your family.

Modesty wanted a depot, and used me! But I loved the fair sex, and thought to marry, in time. Funny acknowledgments to make; but, as gray hairs have bivouacked all over my head, it makes no difference if I do own up. I tried sparking, once; it came nigh bursting me, and that idea was abandoned. Two years my lass-orated heart was like Mrs. Rachel's babies-without comforters. Then I grew lonesome. The sun didn't look        The Result of my Courtship.   103 so bright as it was; The moon looked- speckled- like, as does a fellow's black pants after milling! The grass wa'n't as green. The trees waln't as straight. The roosters, geese, turkeys, ducks, and other C" feathered songsters of the glen, did not warble as sweetly as once! My hair grew long, and it was because I was lonesome. I was like a tree in the woods. I had been blown over by my feelings, and if I didn't " lodge," I'd fall, sure pop! Salina Jane tookl my eye. She was tall as the daughters of Nathal, and more beautiful. tHer father had been a rich man, and Salina Jane had a good figure-nigh onto $30,000, or less. Not being a slubberdegullion, the filthy dross had no charms, for me. Salina Jane had. We looked at each other a few times. Miutuality-was in the glances of each. I loved the fair Salina Jane. Salina Jane loved me, and I loved Salina Jane. Says I, "May I? . Says she, "To be sure-and come early!"  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7467-00000055"/> 104   The Result of my Courtsip. I went, and she was there. It was night. The pale moon was up and doing. The little cross-eyed stars were laughing at each other, and SalinaJane and I were in the parlor. It had a stove-and a lounge-and a -clock-and a table-and a yellow dog under it -and a picture of Noah and his relatives mov- ing into their new boarding-house! And it had a carpet-and lots of chairs-and an oil lamp- and a picture of General Putnam backing his horse up a ledge of rocks.  And it had in it Salina Jane and I! Often went I  there, and often was Salina Jane made happy by my com- ing. It was years ago, but I remember well. We   got to liking  each other. Then it took deeper root, and we loved. We didn't do nothing-Salina Jane and I lidn't-only court each other. We  used, to sit and hold on to each other's hands as though we vere afraid of falling out! Then we'd look at ;ach other and smile a sweet little laugh, just as   t The Result of my Courtshp.   105 easy like! Then we'd move around on our seats, and lean on to each othler, and say nothing. When we said nothing, the folks in the louse wouldn't hear us, and we didn't have anything to take back. Then the oil would give out, and it would be dark. Once I went to whisper in her ear, and she turned her head around, so that, by mistake, I whispered in her pretty mouth. This proved to be a good way to whisper, and we done it that way quite often! Then we'd talk. I don't know what we talked about, but we tallked. I didn't say much, nor, Salina Jane didn't, but we said a little something every time!  All winter I courted her. I thought of marrying her, but couldn't get to the sticking point no-way. Dear me, I was too bash- fll! One night Salina Jane was cutting rags for a carpet. I helped her rip up a pair of her dad's old trousers, and we courted while she cut.

I put my head in her lap. Salina Jafie kept on cutting. I didn't know what to dlo, so I laid still, and she kept on cutting ragg. I lay there and went to sleep. When I wo04  up, she had cut half my hair off by carelessness.- I could stand that; she was such a sweet girl, my Salina Jane was, so it didn't make me mad.   She wasn't as sweet as some girls, but she -was good enough for a bright, intelligent boy as I was. Over a year we did thusly. Three nights in the week beside Sunday, till day broke, would we sit and court. It was sweet. Never knew of anything like it. Never courted before. Sorry we hadn't. It was so nice to hitch up to Salina Jane, and at last jist touch her store-clothes! IIow  it made our back-bones jingle when our hands met! Never would have done so, if court- ing wasn't nice.

We'd go out by the gate, and spend an hour there. Then I would leave for my humble roof. I used to buy nice tilings for her-molasses candy, little candy hearts, peppermint-drops, and such good stuff; apples, two for a cent apiece, and oranges without a speck of rotten in 'em! They were all for Salina Jane, and I didn't care for the expense. Then I used to dream of her. I'd think my- self a fish, and Saline Jane and I would sport among the waters, and she'd chase me around by the stones and old roots, and under the soddy banks of the creek where I ithought we were. Then I'd dream we were little warbling birds, and sitting on a high limb of a tall tree together, sweetly singing! Then I'd dream I was a horse, drawing a nice carriage in which was Salina Jane!

If I hadn't loved that girl, she'd never laid so heavy on my heart! Over two years I courted and she courted. It was my first real experience. I always wanted to marry Salina Jane, but dare not ask her for fear she'd say No. Over two years I lavished on that gushing girl sweetmeats, new  raisins, the first green apples of the season, and young win- tergreens, with a prodigal hand. One day a platter-headed lawyer came along. He was just sweet flag, done up in sugar-coated cakes! lHe saw Salina Jane afar off, and made for her. He was a gay and festered chap. He knew more than he'd forgot-a heap more. He wore store-clothes on week-days! I didn't. He had the  advantage of me there.  He hadn't brains enough to keep his hair straight, so it curled. Salina Jane liked curly hair! He  carried a watch-an Egyptian bull's-eye, \   TAle Result of my Courtship.  109 plated with gold! It was a big thing. I had no watch I Salina Jane went back on me, and made for the watch. He had a roll of counter- feit money, and he showed her the end of it. She thought he was hefty about the purse, but he wasn't-nor about the head either! He called with  a carriage-livery carriage-and they went out riding. It was the night I was to sit up with Salina Jane. I went there to her domi-, cile, but she had gone. "O Salina Jane, Don't do it again " I wrote in a bold hand on the 10x12 mirror which hung in the parlor, with a piece of' tallow, and left the house. I went off to weep, and for two hours my affections oozed out of my eyes as water would ooze out of a wet sponge with a big man sitting on it  She read the poetry, but didn't give no heed!

Gradually, as sparks fly upward, she left me to mourn, and I done it.

Whenever she'd sit on the fence, as she used to at times, after driving the pigs out of her folks' cornfield, I used to watch her.

But she got thicker and thicker with her new lover, and, after a while, sitting on the fence failed to relieve me I Well, matters grew worse.

He was older than H-was born first -but I spoke to him about it just as though we were of the same age.  Anger abided in my heart when I spoke to him. I demanded satis- faction -not the satisfaction I had looked for with Salina Jane as Mrs. "B." P., but the satis faction a gentleman should expect.

I  think I know who stole it, but I ean't tell, for I couldn't find him. A man saw me buy a ticket, and he came and sat in the seat with me.

We have known Clorinda long. She was a tall girl, and meant it. All tall girls mean it. They mean to be long for this world. So did Clorinda. Years ago we loved her. Twenty years ago we climbed up about her neck and hung a few lusciousary kisses on her triumphant lips. And when her eyes beheld the sweet glory of oatr coming down past the barn where the O .

She was a healthy kissist, full of gentle and stimulating vigor. Did you ever kiss a girl and fairly hanker for more? We loved her, and she loved back. We planted kisses, and love sprouted till the branches thereof made a grove under which we took refuge. Clorinda heard of the Peace Banjoree in Bos- ton. She wanted to go.  We took her there. Went on an excursion tour.  Weather hotter than making tomato pickles. We rode in the cars and on a boat, then went on foot. Clorinada wears Nio. 7s, small.

"Tavern's all full," said the clerkist, as he looked at Clorinda.   She was a tower-that is, we looked up to her. She said, "Move on." We walked to another hotel, aslked'the same question, and the same clerk said they was all full. Then he told us to go to the "Tremont.", There we went. Walked afoot. Wqnt straight ahead on a curve. Came to the "Tremont."  The same clerk was there. Said he was full. And he looked at Clorinda. Then he told- us to go to the "American."  So we patted it around there. Saw the same clerk. He said they was all full. Told us to go to the "Parker House,"- and we started to find it, but couldn't do it.

Clorinda and I moved on. We walked all over the city, on the same street. We aslked a policeman where was a hotel, did he know-? And he said there wa'n't none, for it was Banjoree week. He asked if we had heard the big organ, or seen Gil- more . We said No. We went to find 0. and G., the twin celebrities of Boston. We went up to Bunker Hill Monument. Didn't lnow but Clorinda and us could bunk there. But the Monument was all taken up. Somebody told us that Warren fell over there., We went to see, but he had got up and gone! Then we went to Breed's Hill. We wanted to see Grant, and, knowing his love for dogs, thought to find him at Breed's! But he wa'n't there; a Boston Peace Banjoree Yankee had hired him for a tobacco-sign! So we didn't know which one was Grant, they were so plenty I   In Boston at the Peace Banjoree. 125 Tramping around, Clorinda blistered her feet. She was not used to walking. She was brought up in Rhode Island, and hadn't room to turn her feet. We couldn't walk, so we stood still till the Coliseum came around. It was a big thing. Clorinda got all jammed up. She was made thinner nor a lath. When I hugged her, it seemed like squeezing a paper- folder. But she was good! We heard the big organ. We saw Gilmore counting his money. Hotel. accommodations being out of the question, we anchored under a tree.  Country taverns doi't contain too- much! After Clorinda had her head blowed full of sweet discordancies and St. Vitus' melodies, I took her -down on the Common, and paid five dollars for an hour in the arms of Morpheus. Clorinda was there too. We had a fine supper-two peanuts and a boiled bean split. Only a dollar And then we had refreshments-two pints of water, with yel. i  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7467-00000067"/> 126   In Boston at the Peace Banjoree. low paper in for lemonade, at two shillings a glass. And such a breakfast-soup made from the back of .a postage-stamp! I had to take Clorin- da off that diet; she was getting fat.

I filled her full of molasses-candy and gingerbread the first day, but the stamps gave out. They called it a Peace Jubilee, and took the last piece I had- except Clorinda. But we saw the Banjoree, and shall die happy, if not sooner. Clorinda was de- moralized. Some wretch sat down on her band-, box. It caved in, and up went her bonnet. But we saw the Peace Banjoree, and Gilmore, and the big organ. Clorinda had her feet trod on in the crowd more nor a thousand times. I thought they were her tally-books. And she lost her trail. I'm sorry about that I But I didn't     3In Boston at the Peace BanYjoree. 127 lose Clorinda. I looked up to her so much, it was no trouble to look her up! Clorinda never was so badly jammed up. I t think she was hugged by three thousand men whose habits were good, and by seventeen thou- sand whose habits were t'otherwise. She was squeezened out flat one way, and squeezened up flat t'other way. And she never would have been so long in the first place, if it had not been for the huggings I had given her when she was little. When you see a little short, fat girl, it is a sign sle has not been properly higg ed. If she had, it would have squeezed her up taller! But then, we saw the, Peace Jamboree, and we heard the music. And such music! It seemed as if all the fiddlers, and feline-intestine scrapers, and mashers of base drums, and blowers through brass instruments, had all the blacksmith-shops, tin horns, dogs with kettles tied to their tails, children who had partaken of too much small- beer, men with the toothache, cats on wood sheds,      .

Clorinda had so much in her ear, that I could not whisper love in it in a fortnight. I bought a tin horn and whispered through that. But it was no use. The only way I could bring her to her senses, or tone her auricular appurtenances down to their original condition, was to seat her on a rail- road engine and let her whistle it six hours a day until she recovered. But she has not been good- natured a day since. That bran-new frock with streaks up and down it, is all skurypt, till the continuation of her trail resembles a garbage-cart struck by lightning while blessed with a full load. And that little bonnet she had-a hundred and sixteen dollars' worth of style and ten cents' worth of fabric! Oh, I guess not!

IClorinda says- Peace Jamborees are a humbug We reached her home, the Lord only knows how. The Banjoree busted my cash, exhausted my pa- tience, destroyed my raiment, upset my health, deprived me of rest. During all the time it con- tinued, Clorinda and I got no sleep except when I took her down on the Common, where we re- posed like two doves with but a single stamp, two sweethearts piled as one, under the shadow of a 6* e       a .,  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7467-00000069"/> 130   In, Boston at the Peace Banjoree. tree which loomed up against the State House. I wanted them to let me rock Clorinda to sleep in the cradle of liberty, but they said the cradle was full. I don't want her photograph taken now. It ain't purty. She don't look good-natured. I don't believe her picture would call sweetness back to sour milk. I felt very sad about it. The juice of gladness doth not abound in my heart. The permeating sap of contentment rangeth not around my gizzard, as was its wont. I left Clorinda at the house of her paternal de- rivative, and returned, put on my good clothes, and went to see her. But she was not seeable. She was getting fixed. So I sat myself down under her window, and plaintively I sighed out: "Oh, Clorinda, 'Rinda, 'Rinda, draw nigh- do!" But she wouldn't. :And then the pale moon scooted along, and I said:   In Boston at the Peace Banjoree.   131 "Oh, mooni oohie, moonie, pity my woe-do, just once i" IBut he wouldn't. And a little star followed the moon like a poodle-dog follows a little girl, and I said: "Oh, star, starie, starie, twinkle me one-do come and pin my love onto 'Rinda's heart!" But nary a twinkle. And a cloud hegiraed overhead, seeming not to care a dym for my trouble; and in the agony of my bitterness I sank back upon the grass, and said: "Oh, cloud, cloudie, flying cloldie, cloud me no more, for my heart can't stand it!" And I called again to Clorinda, and she would not come. And it is all on account of the Peace Jamboree. She was the best-natured girl on the --0 creek till this transpired. She was sweeter than shrimps, or a free ride to a picnic. But, alas I her sweetness is departed.

She says, No more excursion for her! She did not like the Hub. She prefers to remain in v the dignity of her own domicile, to take care of the little doings thereof; so she goeth not to Boston for another spree, not even to see the Coliseum, or the big ,organ, or' the crooked streets, or -Gilmore, or any of them things; but she goeth to bed in madness and in sadness, but not in any gladness. Such is Clorinda; while I am disconsolate, used up, out of cash. But, thank the Lord, I have helped Gilmore, have an interest in the Coliseum, heard the big organ, and have been to Boston!

At the right hand of the dealer, on the table, is a box filled with stacks of ivory checks, piled up in stacks like little plates. They are about the size of a silver dollar, if our readers can remember what size that is. They are white, red, blue, each color denoting different value.

The keen-eyed dealer opposite the table in front of us takes a full packl of cards, puts them in a silver box with an open top, so we can all see what card is first. The cards cannot fall out of the top, for there is a rim which holds them. They are kept up to the top 7*  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7467-00000082"/> 156   .

The cards are drawn out one at a time, and laid in two piles regularly. The first card (under the one which is visible) is the dealer's. All money bet on that, he takes. The second card belongs to us. All can see what cards are drawn.  All the little piles of ivory checks standing on the first card, of the two drawn, are picked up by the dealer and set back where they belong in the box. All the little piles of ivory on the next card drawn call for the dealer to set beside them a pile of corre- sponding size and value. We bet on the cing.

This appears to be the only percentage the game has over those who play against it; and in large games, such as are played here, the half which the house wins on splits often amounts to a thousand or more dol- lars a night. Again, men come in, lose a hun- dred or two dollars, and quit. The bank is gen- erally this much the gainer. Sometimes a man will lose a thousand, or twenty thousand dollars, a night, here. Sometimes a man will win as   "Paris. Club Roors."     159 much; though few men have the nerve to play their " luck,' as it is called, as high when win- ning as when losing. There is a percentage in favor of the bank-at least, a faro-bank generally wins, and they who play against it generally lose. We started in with fifty dollars.  It is now fifteen minutes of three.  In fifteen minutes a carriage will be at the door.  'We have been lucky; in the place of fifty dollars, we have now nearly four hundred. We pile up our chips and pass them in to the dealer.

It is nearly three o'clock; still the games go on. Here is a table where five men are playing poker for large stakes. Here sit two men and two of our handsome ladies at euchre, for fifty dollars a corner.  This is a gambling-house. It will be kept open till six in the morning. The crowd is not as when we entered.  Some have gone home broke! Some have won enough to do them, and left. The balance are here. Some are in the little rooms about here, having a social chat over a glass of wine or a cigar. The ladies, who were so smiling five hours since, look war-worn and petulant. The waiters look somewhat sleepy. Still the game goes on. The dealer has been \ rested by his "partner," and another keen-eyed nman draws the cards, takes, and pays. Men come here and lose in a night more than they made in a year. They use the funds of others.

At the iron door stands the keeper of this institution. We drop a check into his hand; the doors open silently as before, and with a shiver we are outside, hastening into the car- riage there in waiting, and down the almost deserted streets are rumbling along to our hotel, to sleep away the balance of the night, or morn- ing, while our friends with us are satisfied with the adventures of the evening. *  CHAPTEK   (I XIX.

She had a brother. He was older than either of us. Hank was his name, and he worked the farm. But I got to loving Eliza, if he did.

That little boy wore a frock, and looked sort of funny to me. I showed him  the grindstone, kittens, bee-hive, pigs, and all the little doings. Then I took him to the houre.  We were about eight years old apiece. The little boy was in bad humor, and cried. His mother, being sort of chivalrous, placed him on her two knees, and applied the flat of her hand-not to his head nor heels, nor to my head, but somewhere, and I believe I've forgot- -ten. I witnessed the performance. This was my first knowledge of   capital punishment.  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7467-00000093"/> 176  Struck by the Divine Afatus. Mother told me, when I asked her about it the nexst day, that the little boy was a girl, and. H  wondered if all girls were cross. Then I forsook their company, and swore a life of celibacy. For years I was, so far as love wasg concerned, a hermit. My fancy fell on bread and butter with sugar onto it; mush and milk, with an occasional apple-dumpling. I roamed with the pigs, the cows, the horses, and the hens. I made voyages for eggs, and raised trouble with the cats who came with friendly intent to mow away the new-mown hay of their feline love. H was happy, except when compelled to ride a thin horse all day to plough corn, and no saddle;. My soul soared above such doings, and my eager spirits chafed to be free, like the turkey pullet that bounds over the plain like a base-ball after chased grasshoppers.

But I lived to see that mus. tache sprout and come down, so to speak. Amid this glory, I blush to own the strength of my weakness. Old Keyser lived two ,miles below our house. He was a shoemaker, and kept a peach-orchard.- One day I wanted a waxed end to make a cracker for a whip. I went to his shoe-shop, and he said "Yea." Then I meandered into his orchard, and Congressionally appropriated a few of his best. He saw me, and advanced upon my unprotected rear with a raw-hide. I discovered his approach after my doom was sealed. I went to old Key- ser's after a waxed end. Success came and dwelt with me. I got it-he gave-it to me! It is safe to say I was mad--moderately so, at least. I swore revenge.  One night I went down to old Keysers to rob his orchard.  I wanted more of his fruit. I saw his daughter, Kusku- relia, and she sympathized with me. She gave 8*  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7467-00000094"/> 178  Struck by the Divine Afflatus. me peaches, and told me to come often. She went a little way home with me.  She was pretty. She was plump as a dumpling, and her lips seemed like two happy days telling pretty stories to each other.  k When we parted, she handed me the last peach. It was luscious. We stood under a grape-vine by the road. As I took the peach, her forefinger and thumb touched mine. How my hand felt! It seemed as if nine hundred humming-birds had met in the palm of my hand to hold' a sorosis meeting. I felt queer all over! Right back of- my left ear I thought a full band was playing Come where my Love lies dream- ing." May Mars forgive me, but I couldn't help it  I scorn to utter a lie. I am no politician, nor President. I can't lie, and, what is more, I won't. I dropped that peach, put one arm around her neck, one around her elbow, swooned   Struc k by the Dinee Afflatus. 179 down upon her lips like a twelve-pound baby in a new pillow just shook up.

I stood guard about those lips till the moon came out. Then we walked a little way up the road. Our pace was slower than the return of the Bull Run excursionists to Washington. 3 Yes, indeed! Her hand was in mine. It seemed as if Cupid was ramming my left arm full of ten-thousand- pound cartridges, and forcing them into my heart a mile a second. , My hair felt large and airy, like a bamboo fish-pole. Pretty soon we stopped by the corner of a fence. I slid my left arm around Kuskurelia's waist, dropped my right f   &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7467-00000095"/> 180   Struck by the Divine Afflatus. down on her left wrist and into her trembling: palm; her head floated sidewise to my left shoul- der-shift; my eyes went shut like an eclipse; her lips opened like an over-ripe nutmeg-melon; her breath came sweeter than the Songs of Solomon; there was a collision of two fond souls; Cupid moved in upon my heart as Forrest did at Fort Pillow, and I felt as if my backbone had been rented for an artillery-park, or Boston Peace Jubilee Coliseum. Git eout!  Move on!  Don't stand on the corners! If you never went in love; do so quick. The little stars winked, as if they knew all about it. Nature sent about ninety-seven little breezes to fan our cheeks and flap the little wings of Cupid. Gently I sat Kuskurelia down on a rock, and twined myself confidingly close to her. We spoke of peaches, but there was no lustre in their stems. And the cool winds sighed about our flowing curls, till it seemed that the red head of -Kuskurelia was a ten-mile torchght procession   Gs   v Str,uc7 by the -Divine Afflatus. 181 leading a gallopade up and down the chambers of my heart.

And so we walked all night. And from that day to this the taste of a peach v has been full of strange melancholy, and the touch of a pretty girl's hand has consternated my existence; and the memory of that night with Kuskurelia lingers on the fond organ of my being like a wad of shoemaker's wax in your top- Imot.

There- were two nines.   These nines were antagonists. The ball is a pretty little drop of softness the size of a goose-egg, and five degrees harder than a brick. The two nines play against each other. It is a quiet game, much like chess, only a little more chase than chess. There was an umpire. His position is a hard one. He sits on a box and yells "Fowl!" His duty is severe. I -took the bat. It is a murderous plaything, descended from Pocahontas to the head of John Smith. The man in front of me was a pitcher He was a nice pitcher, but he sent the balls hot. The mnan behind me was a catcher. He caught it,-too! The umpire said, "Play!" It is the most rad- ical play I know of, this base ball. Sawing cord-   As a Base Balllst.      185 wood is moonlight rambles beside base-ball. So the pitcher sent a ball toward me.  It looked pretty cowning, so I let it come. Then he sent another. I hit it with the club, and hove it gently upward. Then I started to walk to the first lase. The ball lit in the pitcher, or his hands, and somebody said he caught a fly. Alas, poor fly!   I walked leisurely toward the base. Another man took the bat. I turned to see how he was making it, and a mule kicked me on the cheek.  The man said it was the ball. It felt like mule, and I reposed on the grass. The ball went on! Pretty soon  there were two more flies, and three of us flew out. Then the other nine came in, and  we nine went out. .This was better. Just as I was standing on my dignity in the left field, a hot ball, as they called it, came sky- rocketing toward me.  My captain yelled, 'Take it!hastened"  tly forward to where the ball I hastened gently forward to where the ball  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7467-00000098"/> 186     As a Base Ballist. was aiming to descend. I have a good eye to measure distances, and saw at a glance where the little aerolitq was to light. I put up my hands. How sweetly the ball descended! Everybody looked. I felt something warm in my eye. "Muffin!" yelled ninety fellers. "Muffin, be d  ! It's a cannon-ball!'" For three days I've had two pounds of raw beef on that eye, and yet it paineth! Then I wanted-to go home, but my gentle cap- tain said 1"Nay."  So I nayed, and- stayed. Pretty soon it was my strike. "Brick to bat!" yelled the umpire. I went, but not all serene, as was my wont. The pitcher sent in one hip-high. I missed it. He sent in another neck-high. It struck me in the gullet. "Fowl!" yelled the umpire. He sent in the ball again. This time I took it square, and sent it down the right field, through a parlor window, a kerosene lamp, and rip up against the head of an infant who was, quietly taking its nap in its mother's arms.   As a Base BaEist.      187 Then I slung the bat, and meandered forth to the first base. I heard high words, and looked. When I slung the bat, I had with it broken the jaw of the umpire, and was fined ten cents. The game went on. I liked it. It is so much fun to run from base to base just in time to be put out, or to chase a ball three-fourths of a mile down-hill, while all the spectators yell "Muffin!," "Go it!"-"Home run!"-", Go round again!" --or, "Go round a dozen times!"   Base-ball is a sweet little game. When it came ny turn to bat again, I noticed everybody moved back -about ten rods! The new   umpire retreated twelve rods. He was timid! The pitcher sent 'em   in hot. Hot balls in time of war are good; but I don't like 'em  too hot for fun. After a while I got a fair clip at it, and you bet it went! cutting the daisies down the right field. A fat man and his dog sat in the shade of an oak, enjoying the game. The ball broke one leg of the dog, and  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7467-00000099"/> 188     As a Base Ballist. landed like a runaway engine in the corporositg of the fat man. He was taken home to die. Then I went on a double-qulick to the field, and tried to stop a hot ball. It came towards me from the bat at the rate of nine miles a minute. X I put up my hands. The ball went sweetly sing- ing on its way, with all the skin from my palms with it. More raw beef I That was an eventful chap who first invented base ball. It's such fun!

A sore jaw. One thumb dislocated. Three sprained ankles.   As a Base Ballist.      89 Five swelled legs. One dislocated shoulder, from trying to throw a ball a thousand yards.

I have played two weeks, and don't think I like the game.  There is not a square inch on, in, or under me, but aches. I sleep nights dreaming of hot balls, "flys," "fouls, and descending "sky-rockets." But I am proud of my proficiency in the game.

The touching beauty of the scene filled me with novel awe. I   blew my nose, and gently lingered. The daughter's name was Tibelius. And this 9  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7467-00000102"/> 194    The Toiler by the Sea. was the prayer she was listening to! I winked majestically at Tibelius, and drew nigh. Her paternal had been engaged a full hour when I arrove. He had visited the heathen of the dis- tant lands, and was gently on. his way home. And thus prayed he: "And now, Lord of love and peace, wilt Thou not confuse Thine enemies, and bow tihnecks of all who live in wealth and pride, and are far removed from Marblehlead and Thee!

He used to send his daughter out to kindle a fire on the rock when the storm was howling. And the next day, when the beach would be strewn with spoons, watches, pianos, books, furniture, bales of cotton, Bibles, mules, and wounded men who had been driven ashore on an inhospitable coast by following the light there kindled to blind them, with what ten- derness would he move around among them! How sweetly he would gather up their valuables and tote them to a place of safety! And he would so kindly drop a box, or an anvil, or a chunk of iron, on the heads of the wounded ones, to put them out of misery! He was very kind! He carried strychnine to give those in agony, and removed their money and jewelry in order to prepare their souls for heaven! And to each one he thus relieved he would give a tract, or have Tibelius sit by their side and read the ser- mon of Christ on the Mount. It looked so sweet to see that good saint of Marblehead bearing the ,      S   lThe Toiler by t/e Sea.    197 burdens of the day, growing crooked under the loads of plunder he carried away to remove all thoughts of wealth from the hearts of the poor ones he was caring for so kindly!

WE had a high old time in Puritanville, or Purmiville, as we call it. The win- ter's snows all ran down the creek. Our New England hills sang with joy as the ice ripped and the rwater rippled on its grapevine-way to the deep blue sea. In all our settlement lives not a single, mar- ried, or double Democrat.

Every Sunday our dear, pious divine, Rev. Hezerky Dropchin, preaches such soothing ser- mons at us! He tells us that h-e and two ells is paved ninety feet deep with skulls of infants cemented in with the curses of the d-a-m-ned ones-and that the Lord loveth a cheerful giver -and that giving to the poor is investing with the Lord. And he says we-mustlove our ene- mies-or we can't make a cent out tof seventeen of them. He is a good man, is Rev. Hezerky Dropchin, and preaches with most unctuous eclat. And we do just as he tells us to; for why doctor yourself, when you buy his doctorin's? One day, while the sprouts were sprouting, the buds were budding, the leaves leaving, and the grass grassing all. over things generally, the bell rang a loud -Christian-like rangle, calling us all to worship. Ours is a nice bell-it was conquered   Puriville ,Benevolence.   231 from a church-tower when our troops were on their Southern "tower," and now rings "Glory hallelujah" in the hands of a Northern jerkist. It is wicked to be proud, and: God loves us in Puriville for confiscating all such articles of "bigotry and virtue " from the South, and recon- structing them Via the plan of roundhead salva- tion. And we have such nice carpets, and hymn- books, and a- Bible, and that aristocratic solid silver communion service, all taken from the proud people of the South, who would have ended their days in much continuous torment had we not taken their idols fixom them, and directed their eyes to the true and revealed Power.    It is so sweet to save souls this way. And it's cheaper for us. And'then, our churches will seem so homelike when visiting brethren and sisters visit us in our own prayer-warmed homes, to attend divine service with us!

And such destitution he never saw. He went down with two thousand cheap pictures to sell to the innocent contrabandboxes of the South, but they had been supplied, and he only sold seven dam- aged " views" in all his trip! And he had two thousand dollars' worth of brass jewelry, but the white men of the South had so outraged, robbed, and impoverished the negroes, that they--poor innocent architects of national cemeteries!-had no spelter to shell out;- and so his jewelry gan- grened, and he returned with it in verdigris. Then, .fter a prayer and two songs, our be- loved pastor said we must do something for the poor people of the South, to let them know that we forgave them for their wickedness, and to win them back to a love for--their benefactors. He said they needed school-books, and old clothes, and reading-matter, and money, and encourage- ment. We all felt it our duty to aid in restoring theso   Purzivlle Benevolence.    233 poor disfreckled sinners to their rights and re- ligion.

Our committee did first-rate. In two days we raised twelve big boxesful of things for them, and sent them off. Deacon Gunner had them stored in his barn, four miles from the depot, and his son John hauled them to the cars for four dollars a box, advance charges paid, and forwarded for collection! Then we had them repacked in new boxes- thirty-seven dollars, advance charges, forwarded for collection.

WHAT I KNOW ABOUT FARMING. I a pharmer. One of the olden kind I About ninety-five year olden kind. When younger than now, I had much to do with Weeds! This fact makes me a pharmer. There is nothing about the science of pharming, from sitting of a hot day under a rail-fence in company with a jug, to picking geese, that I do not feel justified in knowing. Picking geese is good. I have helped pluck many a goose-from the black Michi-ganders to the last Republican candidate for Governor in the State of New York. Observe the following rules about pharming   What I Knqow About Farming.     237 the result of sixty years' subsoil ploughing to find the floor of the philosolpher's office.

In selecting land, great care should be taken to get bottom-lands--that is, lands with a bcttom to them. 'It is just as easy to enter them, without the danger of going clear through. Hill-lands are apt to make pharming a one-sided affair, the price paid for such property, as a general thing, being a little steep. Stones and stumps are not essential to good farms, unless you have plenty of dogs, or intend to make speeches as the men are mowing and  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7467-00000125"/> 238 W/  at I Kfnow, About Farming. maids a-milking wlhile the dew is on their eye!  But to resume. Pharming is one of the fine arts discovered by the ancients of Ireland, under the greenl old/ sod. To be a p)harmer, a man must be a pharmer whole or in part. The less he knows about it, the more he can write about it. Having a few spare moments, I bought of Carleton, the great book-maker of New York, ten copies of Greeley's "What is It?" on farming, and opened-,up shop. I have read that book through nine times--twice backward, and once standing on my ]lead! Have mastered it at last, and condense in milder shape what I kmow about running the thing into the ground. Young man, be a farmer! Young womap, be a farmer! Buy a billiard-talble, dust your clothes on the top of it, sprinkle on a little dandruff, and go to work.  Never think of beginning with less than a field of green at least   What 1  zfnow About Farminig. '239 6x10. Spread your earth all over the billiard. table evenly, to the depth of one-sixteenth of an inch, irrigate with a sponge, and subsoil to the depth of ten feet. If you have no billiard-table, buy a piece of land, if you can't get a whole one, and go to work. The best way is to stand about in the shade, or hire out to hold a chair down in a saloon while the old man does the work. If your farm is stony, pick out the stones be- fore they are ripe and throw them in the road. This will cause others to cA-Dam-ize your street. Never think of ploughing less than nine feet, if your mule will pull it. If you have no team; wait till winter; then drill and blast. This will pulverize the earth, elevate your land warm  it, and you will be able to report before your slow neighbors. Run your creeks up-hill, and wash sheep only in warm water.

In turning grind-stone to educate scythes, never turn the handle baclkward, or the early grass will wilt before the color comes to it. Put a left-handed swivel in your scythe, so it will cut both ways. In selecting gooseberries, pick out the crook- neck variety and put them in the nest under the best goose in the drove by the middle of Octo- ber, that the goslings may be naturalized by the time for spring elections. In harvesting strawherries, be careful not to ru -the thresher too fast, or the straw will be spoilt for juleps, and only fit for beds. To cook string-beans, it is not necessary to par- boil the string in more than one suds. The best way to raise calves is to sit in a cane- seat chair and put your heels on the mantel-piece or a high table. When washing sheep, it is best to shear them ,-   What I Know  About Farming.   241 first-less soap  and fewer towels will be wanted.

She smiled over her fan. She scooched her head gently, thus. She gently bit her upper lip, and prayed-that is, prayed me to be seated. I was fresh from the districts of ruralism. I had hoed the calves, milked the bees, fed the growing pota- toes, built sweet cider, and quenched my thirst with ail-fences, and was just the canarv for the blooming widow's perch. I sat -in the spontaneous deliciousness of the affectionate intercourse of that enthusiastic ex- plorer of masculine hearts five hours that night. I was like a humming-bird in a faunning-mill. I squozed the widow; the widow   squizzened me. I leaned my thinking-box against her maternal mstincts, and looked into her eyes as a buglar looks around a corner. And all I saw was love.

I was a icicle, wait- ing for the- sun of love to thaw me out. She thawed me! We began to live. I tried to im- prove the widow. I spent all my evenings in improving her. She improved. We were wed- dened in April-April the onest. With the vigor of a Spring chronticleer did I prove my devotion. Like the first violet of vernal did I watch our &amp;c. increase. One day, when I came home to our cot in the mill, I saw spread out on the floor a fourteen-year-old lump of ragged boy. 'Twas ragged Pete, of the Newsboy Brigade. He was on a lark. He'd been sloshing about, and had become hilarious. He showed surface indications of being drunk.  I wanted to know why  he camest thus upon us. He said he wanted the old woman to give him half a horse. That was Pete's idea of a $5 bill! The cherubim was the child of my adored I gave him the lucre. He went.

She said I made her forget it. Pretty compliment, wasn't it? I told her that her Peter mustn't be a re-peter, or I'd peter. She said five dollars a week would keep him away. I told her I was just in from the country, &amp;c., etc.; but she did five-dollars me, and I saw no more of Peter. She said she had atoned for all that. Who could doubt her? We went on smoothly. One day, when I came home, two half-breeds were on the family bed, playing with a shaggy- eyed dog. The half-breeds were brothers. They were twins. They were of eleven years' dura- tion so far. They were in the boot-black busi- ness at Washington Market, and lived in a dry- goods box there. They had dark features, and a peculiar kink to their capillary. They called my consort "Mother." She had bore them. They bored me. Words failed to relieve- me. I spoke of Pete. She said these were her other heavenly blessings! I asked if these had been atoned for. She said No. I felt better, for, if they had, I should have looked for four of an age, and all   A Jersey Atonenent.      253 four clear black!
