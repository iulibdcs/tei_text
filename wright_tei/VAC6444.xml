                  <p>IT lay down in a sort of hollow, the hillside sloping up behind, crowned with
                     dark pine woods, shut in by four grim wooden walls, two dark windows, like
                     scowling eyes, to be seen from the path, and was known to all as "THE HOUSE
                     THAT WOULDN'T LET."</p>
                  <p>It stood neither on street nor high road. You left the town behind you—the
                     queer, fortified, Frenchified town of Quebec; you passed through St. John's
                     Gate, through St. John's street-outside-the-gate, to the open country, and, a
                     mile on, you came upon a narrow, winding path, that seemed straggling out of
                     sight, and trying to hide itself among the dwarf cedars and spruces. Following
                     this for a quarter of a mile, passing one or two small stone cabins, you came
                     full upon Saltmarsh—this house that wouldn't let.</p>
                  <p>It was an ugly place—a ramshackle place, the lonesomest place you could see,
                     but still <emph>why</emph> it wouldn't let was not so clear.</p>
                  <p>The rent was merely nominal. Mr. Barteaux, its owner, kept it in very good
                     repair. There was a large vegetable garden attached, where, if you were of an
                     agricultural turn, you might have made your rent twice over. There was game in
                     the woods; trout in the ice-cold brooks; but no<pb n="10-11"

                     Saltmarsh. It wasn't even haunted; it looked rather like that sort of thing,
                     but nobody ever went exactly so far as to affirm that it <emph>was</emph>. No
                     ghastly corpse-lights ever glimmered from those dull upper windows, no piercing
                     shrieks ever rent the midnight silence, no spectre lady, white and tall, ever
                     flitted through the desolate rooms of Saltmarsh. No murder had ever been done
                     there; no legend of any kind was connected with the place, its history was
                     prosy and commonplace to a degree. Yet still, year in, year out, the
                     inscription remained up over the dingy wooden gateway, THIS HOUSE TO BE LET;
                     and no tenant ever came.</p>
                  <p>"Tom Grimshaw must have been mad when he built the beastly old barn," the
                     present proprietor would growl; "what with taxes, and repairs, and insurance,
                     there it stands, eating its own head off, and there it may stand, for what I
                     see, to the crack of doom. One would think the very trees that surround it say,
                     in their warning dreariness, as the sentinels of Helheim used in Northern
                     mythology:</p>
                  <p>"'Who passes here is damned.'"</p>
                  <p>If this strong language rouses your curiosity, and you asked the proprietor the
                     history of the house, you got it terse and lucid, thus:</p>
                  <p>"Old Tom Grimshaw built it, sir. Old Tom Grimshaw was my maternal uncle, rest
                     his soul; it is to be hoped he has more sense in the other world than he ever
                     had in this. He was a misogynist, sir, of the rabidest sort, hating a petticoat
                     as you and I hate the devil. Don't know what infernal mischief the women had
                     ever done him—plenty, no doubt; it is what they were created for. The fact
                     remains—the sight of one had much the same effect upon him as a red scarf on a
                     mad bull. He bought this marshy spot for a song, built that disgustingly ugly
                     house, barricaded himself with that timber wall, and lived and died there, like
                     Diogenes, or Robinson Crusoe, or any other old bloke you like. As heir-at-law,
                     the old rattle-trap fell to me, and a precious legacy it has been, I can tell
                     you. It <emph>won't</emph> rent, and it <emph>has</emph> to be kept in repair,
                     and I wish to Heaven old Tom Grimshaw had taken it with him, wherever he
                     is!"</p>
                  <p>That was the history of Saltmarsh. For eight years it was to be let, and hadn't
                     let, and that is where the matter began and ended.</p>
                  <p>Gray, lonely, weather-beaten, so I had seen the forlorn house any time these
                     twenty years; so this evening of which I am to write I saw it again, with the
                     mysterious shadow of desolation brooding over it, those two upper windows
                     frowning down—sullen eyes set in its sullen, silent face. From childhood it had
                     had its fascination for me—it had been my Bluebeard's castle, my dread, my
                     delight. As I grew older, this fascinating horror grew with my growth, and at
                     seven-and-twenty it held me with as powerful a spell as it had done at
                     seven.</p>
                  <p>It was a cold and overcast February afternoon. An icy blast swept up from the
                     great frozen gulf, over the heights of Quebec, over the bleak, treeless road,
                     along which I hurried in the teeth of the wind. In the west a stormy and lurid
                     sunset was fading out—fierce reds and brazen yellows paling into sullen gray.
                     One long fiery lance of that wrathful sunset, slanting down the pines, struck
                     those upper windows of Saltmarsh, and lit them into sheets of copper gold.</p>
                  <p>I was in a hurry—I was the bearer of ill news—and ill news travels apace. It
                     was bitterly cold, as I have said, and snow was falling. I had still half a
                     mile of lonesome high road to travel, and night was at hand; but the spell of
                     Saltmarsh, that had never failed to hold me yet, held me again. I stood still
                     and looked at it; at those two red cyclopean eyes, those black stacks of
                     chimneys, its whole forbidding, scowling front.</p>
                  <p>"It is like a house under a curse," I thought; "a dozen murders might be done
                     inside those wooden walls, and no one be the wiser. Will any human being ever
                     call Saltmarsh home again, I wonder?"</p>
                  <p>"This house is to let?"</p>
                  <p>I am not nervous as a rule, but as a soft voice spoke these words at my elbow,
                     I jumped. I had heard no sound, yet now a woman stood at my side, on the
                     snow-beaten path.</p>
                  <p>"I beg your pardon; I have startled you, I am afraid.<pb n="12-13"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000005"/> I have been here for some time looking at this
                     house. I see it is to let."</p>
                  <p>I stepped back and looked at her, too much surprised for a moment to speak. To
                     meet a stranger at Saltmarsh, in the twilight of a bitter February day, was a
                     marvel indeed.</p>
                  <p>I stood and looked at her; and I thought then, as I think now, as I will think
                     to the last day of my life, that I saw one of the most beautiful faces on which
                     the sun ever shone.</p>
                  <p>I have said she was a woman—a girl would have been the fitter word; whatever
                     her age might have been, she did not look a day over seventeen. She was not
                     tall, and she was very slender; that may have given her that peculiarly
                     childish look—I am a tall young woman, and she would not have reached my
                     shoulder. A dress of black silk trailed the ground, a short jacket of finest
                     seal wrapped her, a muff of seal held her hands. A hood of black velvet was on
                     her head, and out of this rich hood her richer beauty shone upon me, a new
                     revelation of how lovely it is possible for a woman to be. Years have come and
                     gone since that evening, but the wonderful face that looked at me that February
                     twilight, for the first time, is before me at this moment, as vividly as then.
                     Two great, tawny eyes, with a certain wildness in their light, a skin of pearl,
                     a red mouth like a child's, a low forehead, a straight nose, a cleft chin, the
                     gleam of small, white teeth, rise before me like a vision, and I understand how
                     men, from the days of Samson the Strong, have lain down life and honor, and
                     their soul's salvation, for just such women as this. Surely a strange visitant
                     to the house that wouldn't let, and in the last hour of the day.</p>
                  <p>All this in a moment of time, while we stand and face each other. Then the soft
                     voice speaks again, with a touch of impatient annoyance in its tone:</p>
                  <p>"I <emph>beg</emph> your pardon. You heard me? This house is to let?"</p>
                  <p>I point to the sign, to the legend and inscription affixed to the gate, and
                     read it stoically aloud: "This house to be let."</p>
                  <p>"Evidently my lady is not used to being kept waiting," I think, "whoever she
                     is."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes, I see that," she says, still impatiently; "there is no one living in
                     it at present, is there?"</p>
                  <p>"Madame," I say, briefly, "no one has lived there for eight years."</p>
                  <p>The wonderful tawny black eyes, almost orange in some lights, and whose like I
                     have never seen but in one other face, dilate a little as they turn from me to
                     the dead, silent house.</p>
                  <p>"Why?" she asks.</p>
                  <p>I shrugged my shoulders.</p>
                  <p>"Need one ask that question, madame, after looking at the house? Who would care
                     to live in so lonely, so lost a place as that?"</p>
                  <p>"<emph>I</emph> would. No one would ever think of coming here."</p>
                  <p>She made the answer almost under her breath, more to herself than to me, her
                     pale face turned toward the house.</p>
                  <p>Its pallor struck me now, not the pallor of ill health, or of natural
                     complexion, but such fixed whiteness, as some extraordinary terror may once in
                     a lifetime blanch a human face.</p>
                  <p>"No one would ever think of coming here," I repeated, inwardly. "I should think
                     not indeed. Are you in hiding then, my beautiful young lady, and afraid of
                     being found out? You are lovelier than anything out of a frame. You are one of
                     the rich and elect of the earth, or you would not be dressed like that, but
                        <emph>who</emph> are you, and what are you doing here alone and at this
                     hour?"</p>
                  <p>The last red light of the sunset had entirely faded away. Cold, gray, and
                     overcast the wintry sky spread above us like a pall, and over Cape Diamond,
                     with its citadel crown, swept the icy wind from the frozen St. Lawrence. One or
                     two white flakes came sifting down from the fast drifting sky—night and storm
                     were falling together, and it was still half a mile to my home.</p>
                  <p>"If you desire any information about this place, madame," I said, "you had
                     better apply to Mr. Barteaux, No.— St. Louis Street, Quebec; he is the present
                     owner. It is to let, and he will be very glad of a tenant. Good-evening."</p>
                  <p>She made no reply, she did not even seem to have heard. She stood, her hands in
                     her muff, her eyes fixed with a<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6444-00000006"/>
                     strangely sombre intensity on the blank wooden wall, her profile gleaming cold
                     and white in the steely twilight. I know little of passion or despair, but
                     surely it was most passionate despair I read in those fixed, sightless
                     eyes.</p>
                  <p>I turned and left her. I was interested of course, but it would not do, to
                     stand mooning here and let night overtake me. Once, as I hurried along the
                     deserted road, I looked back. The small lonely figure still stood as I had left
                     it, motionless, a black speck against the chill darkness of the wintry sky.</p>
                  <p>"Something wrong there," I thought; "I wonder who she is and what has brought
                     her here. None of the officers' wives or daughters—I have seen all of them at
                     the major's. One thing is certain, Mr. Barteaux will never rent Saltmarsh to a
                     slip of a girl like that."</p>
                  <p>And then the mysterious young lady and all connected with her slipped from my
                     mind, for the red light from my mother's cottage streamed far afield, and the
                     ill tidings I was bringing home filled my whole thoughts.</p>
                  <p>In this strange record which it becomes my duty to write, a few words of myself
                     must be said, and may as well be said here and done with. I was Joan Kennedy
                     then, and am Joan Kennedy still. I was seven-and-twenty years of age, and the
                     sole support of a feeble old mother and a sister of twelve. My mother who had
                     been a governess in her youth, and in her native city of Glasgow, had educated
                     me considerably above the station I filled, giving me a very thorough English
                     education, and teaching me to speak French with a fine Scottish accent. At my
                     father's death, ten years before, I went out to service, and in service I had
                     remained ever since. This night, as I hastened homeward through the snowy
                     darkness, my errand was to tell my mother and sister that I had lost my place,
                     and had no present prospect of being able to get another. That is Joan
                     Kennedy's whole past and present history, so far as <emph>you</emph> need know
                     it.</p>
                  <p>The darkness was all white with whirling snow as I opened the cottage door and
                     entered. All was bright and cosy here. A large red fire burned on the hearth,
                     the tea table was spread, a little snub-nosed teapot wafted its incense alow
                     and aloft, my mother sat knitting in the ingle nook, and my pretty sister
                     Jessie sang, as she stitched away, at the table. At sight of their
                     snow-powdered visitor both dropped their work in amaze.</p>
                  <p>"Joan!" Then Jessie's arms were around my neck, and my mother's poor old face
                     lit up with delight; "Joan! in this storm, and at this time of night and alone!
                        <emph>Are</emph> you alone, Joan?"</p>
                  <p>"Who is likely to be with me, little Jess? Yes, I am alone; and you are likely
                     to have more of my delectable society than perhaps may prove pleasant or
                     profitable. Mother dear, I have lost my place."</p>
                  <p>"Joan!"</p>
                  <p>"I am not to blame, mother, believe that. Only (it is not a pleasant thing to
                     tell) Mrs. Englehart has taken it into that supremely foolish head of hers to
                     be jealous of me—of poor, plain Joan Kennedy! The major, a kind old soul, has
                     spoken a friendly word or two in passing and—behold the result! Don't let us
                     talk about it. I'll start out tomorrow morning and search all Quebec, and get a
                     situation or perish in the attempt. And now, Mistress Jessie, I'll take a cup
                     of tea."</p>
                  <p>I threw off my shawl and bonnet, laughing for fear I should break down and cry,
                     and took my seat. As I did so, there came a loud knock at the door.
                        <emph>So</emph> loud, that Jessie nearly dropped the snub-nosed teapot.</p>
                  <p>"Good gracious, Joan! who is this?"</p>
                  <p>I walked to the door and opened it—then fell back aghast. For firelight and
                     candlelight streamed full across the face of the lady I had seen at the House
                     to Let.</p>
                  <p>"May I come in?"</p>
                  <p>She did not wait for permission. She walked in past me, straight to the fire,
                     and stood before it. Furs and silks were coated with the fast-falling snow. She
                     drew her hands out of her muff, tossed it aside, drew off her gloves, and held
                     to the blaze two small white hands, all twinkling with rings. Mother sat
                     speechlessly gazing at this dazzling apparition. Jessie stood with eyes and
                     mouth agape, and my own heart, I must confess, fluttered nervously as I looked.
                     Who was<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6444-00000007"/> she, and what did she want?
                     For fully a minute she stood staring at the fire, then feeling that some one
                     must say something, I took heart of grace, and said it.</p>
                  <p>"You have been caught in the snow-storm," I ventured, drawing near. "I was
                     afraid you would. Will you please to sit down?"</p>
                  <p>She took no notice of the proffered politeness. The tawny eyes turned from the
                     fire to my face.</p>
                  <p>"Will you tell me your name?" was the strange young lady's abrupt question.</p>
                  <p>"Joan Kennedy."</p>
                  <p>"You are a single woman?"</p>
                  <p>"I am, madame."</p>
                  <p>"You live here—in this house, with——" a pause and a stare at mother and
                     Jessie.</p>
                  <p>"With my mother and sister—yes, at present. As a rule I live at service in
                     Quebec."</p>
                  <p>"In service?" Another pause and a stare at me. "Joan Kennedy, would you live
                     with <emph>me?</emph>"</p>
                  <p>This was a leading question with a vengeance. "With you, madame?" I gasped.</p>
                  <p>"With me. I want a maid, a companion, what you will. Wages are no object—to a
                     trustworthy person. I will give anything she asks. I am all alone—all alone—"
                     her lips trembled, her voice died away; "all alone in the world. I have had
                     great trouble and I want some quiet place to live—some quiet person to live
                     with me, for awhile. I am going to take that house to let. I was overtaken by
                     the storm, just now, and followed you here, instead of going back to the hotel.
                     I like your face—you look as though you may have had trouble yourself, and so
                     could feel for others. I wish you would come and live with me. I have told you
                     I am in dreadful trouble—" she paused, a sort of anguish coming over her face:
                     "I have lost my husband," she said with a great gasp, and covering her face
                     with both hands broke out into such a dreadful crying as I never heard or saw
                     before.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, poor dear!" said my mother. For me, I stood still and looked at her. What
                     could I say—what could I do? Great sobs shook her from head to foot. A widow! I
                     glanced at her left hand. Yes, there among the diamonds gleamed that plain band
                     of gold that has brought infinite bliss or misery to millions of women—a
                     wedding ring. It lasted not two minutes. Almost fiercely she dashed away her
                     tears and looked up.</p>
                  <p>"My name is Mrs. Gordon," she said; "as I tell you, I am all alone. I came to
                     Quebec yesterday, I saw that house advertised, and so came to see it. It suits
                     me, and I will take it for the next six months at least. Some one must live
                     with me there. I like your looks. Will you come?"</p>
                  <p>Would I come? would I live in the House to Let? I stood gasping—the proposal
                     was like a cold douche—it took my breath away.</p>
                  <p>"I will pay any wages to a suitable person—<emph>any wages</emph>,"
                     emphatically this; "and in advance. It is a lonely place, it suits me the
                     better for that, and you don't look like a young woman afraid of bogies. If you
                     won't come," haughtily, "of course I shall find some one else."</p>
                  <p>"I—I have not refused," I gasped; "—it's all so sudden. You must let me think
                     it over. I will tell you to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>Her mood changed—she lifted a face to mine that was like the helpless,
                     appealing face of a child—she held up two clasped hands.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Do</emph> come," she said piteously; "I will pay you anything—anything!
                     I only want to be quiet for awhile, and away from everybody. I am all alone in
                     the world. I have lost my husband—lost him—lost him—"</p>
                  <p>"The lady is going to faint!" screamed Jessie.</p>
                  <p>Sure enough! whether the heat of the fire had overcome her, or the "dreadful
                     trouble" of which she spoke had broken her down, she swayed unsteadily to and
                     fro, the words dying on her lips, and I caught her as she fell.</p>
                  <p>So it was that the first tenant of the House to Let came into my home, and into
                     my life, to change it utterly from that hour.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <head type="sub">A WOMAN WITH A SECRET.</head>
                  <p>MRS. GORDON did not leave our cottage that night—did not leave it for two whole
                     weeks, and then the house that wouldn't let was let at last, and Saltmarsh had
                     a tenant.</p>
                  <p>It would be of little use at this late day to detail all the arguments she used
                     to win me for her attendant and companion—the most irresistible argument of all
                     was wages, treble, fourfold what I had ever earned before, and paid in advance.
                     Of her and her story I had very serious doubts, but beggars must not be
                     choosers. I took her money and became her paid companion.</p>
                  <p>For hours that night, after mother and Jessie were in bed, I sat beside Mrs.
                     Gordon, listening to the story she told of herself. Brief, vague, and
                     unsatisfactory to a degree, that story was. She had been an orphan from
                     childhood. She was not wealthy, but she had sufficient; great trouble had
                     suddenly come upon her, and she had lost her husband after four months of
                     wedded life. That was all.</p>
                  <p>"Lost your husband!" I repeated, curiously, looking at her. "Do you mean that
                     your husband is dead?"</p>
                  <p>A simple and natural question, surely; but her face, pale before, turned of a
                     dead whiteness from brow to chin.</p>
                  <p>"Dead of course," she answered, huskily; "for pity's sake, don't ask me
                     questions. It is only a week ago, and I cannot bear it. Only a week, and it
                     seems like a century. And to think—to think of all the long, lonely, empty
                     years that are to come! Never to hear his voice, never to see his face
                     more!"</p>
                  <p>And then she broke down again and wept—oh, how she wept! My heart was full of
                     compassion, and yet—only dead one week, and running away like this, not in
                     mourning, not a friend in the world, rich, young and beautiful. A queer story
                     on the face of it—a very queer story indeed.</p>
                  <p>Who is to gauge the power of woman's beauty? If she had been a plain young
                     person, I believe ten pounds a week would not have tempted me to take up with
                     her and bury myself alive at Saltmarsh. But her wonderful beauty fairly
                     fascinated me, her lovely face won me, even against my better judgment.</p>
                  <p>"And if that face can make a fool of you, Joan, my dear," I said to myself, as
                     I went to bed, "what awful havoc it must make among mankind! How very
                     unpleasant for poor Mr. Gordon to die and leave it, and how desperately fond
                     she must have been of him, to be sure!"</p>
                  <p>"You will let me stay here until the house yonder is ready," she said next
                     morning, with the air of one not used to being refused. "I dislike
                     hotels—people stare so. I will make you no trouble, and I want to be perfectly
                     quiet, and quite alone."</p>
                  <p>It was curious to see her with her lovely face, her elegant dress, her diamond
                     rings, and her dark flowing hair, so strangely out of place in our small, bare,
                     homely house. I hardly know whether she should have stayed or not, but our
                     poverty pleaded for her, and I consented to all she proposed. To take the house
                     for her, to see it furnished, to attend to everything, while she herself kept
                     absolutely out of sight.</p>
                  <p>My new duties began at once. I went to Mr. Barteaux, and abruptly informed him
                     I had a tenant for the House to Let.</p>
                  <p>"A widow lady, sir," I said; "a Mrs. Gordon. Any reasonable rent she is willing
                     to pay, and I am engaged to live with her."</p>
                  <p>"Bless my soul!" said Mr. Barteaux. "You don't say so! A tenant at last. A
                     widow lady, eh? How many in family, Joan?"</p>
                  <p>I knew the vision before Mr. Barteaux's mind's eye. A florid matron of fifty,
                     with half-a-dozen strapping boys and girls.</p>
                  <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6444-00000009"/>
                  <p>"No family, sir. Quite a young widow. You must close the bargain with me, Mr.
                     Barteaux; her loss is recent, she is in trouble, and doesn't feel like
                     transacting business herself. There are no references; instead, she will pay in
                     advance if you choose."</p>
                  <p>We closed the bargain there and then; and that very day Saltmarsh was thrown
                     open to the sunshine and free winds of Heaven. What an odd, awesome feeling it
                     gave me to go with my mysterious new mistress through the gruesome apartments,
                     silent and forsaken so long. Four, out of the ten rooms the house contained,
                     were chosen to be furnished and fitted up, papered, painted, whitewashed,
                     carpeted, curtained. All fell to me, and all was done in two brief weeks, and
                     well done, though I say it, and Mrs. Gordon and Joan Kennedy, it was known to
                     all Quebec, were domesticated at Saltmarsh.</p>
                  <p>I wonder now, as I sit here and look back at that strange time, that even
                     poverty could have tempted me to endure the life I led all those dreary months.
                     The listless, lonely days spent in reading or rambling through the empty,
                     echoing rooms, the long awesome nights when the winds held high carnival
                     without and the rats high jinks within. No one ever came to the house, except a
                     stout Frenchwoman, who did our washing and general drudgery, coming every
                     morning and going every night. For me, my position was a sinecure, nothing to
                     do, and treble wages for doing it, but the hardest work for all, that I ever
                     did in my life.</p>
                  <p>And my mistress! Well, the days, and the weeks, and the months went by, and she
                     was as great a mystery as ever. Where she had come from, how long she meant to
                     remain, whither she intended going, were all sealed secrets to me. She never
                     wrote letters, she never received any. She could not have been much more dead
                     to all the world outside our wooden walls if she had been in her shroud and
                     coffin.</p>
                  <p>She spent the heavy, aimless days sitting mostly at her chamber window—a
                     dark-draped, slender figure, a dreary, lovely face, two great, hopeless eyes, a
                     total wreck of life. The story of her life, whatever it had been, no common one
                     be sure, was ended for the time; the play was over, the lights out, and nothing
                     left but to sit and look at the curtain. A woman young as she was, of the wrong
                     sort, of the silent, secret-sort, a woman with something on her mind, a woman
                     with a secret.</p>
                  <p>Two things I discovered—only two. One, that her husband was not dead, but
                     deserted; that she had run away from him and was hiding here, in horrible dread
                     of his ever finding her out. Secondly, that in spite of this running away and
                     this constant terror, she still loved him, with a passionate and most
                     despairing love.</p>
                  <p>I had gone into her room one night, and found her sitting holding a picture
                     before her, and gazing on it as if entranced. It was her principal occupation.
                     I had often found her so before, but the picture itself I had never seen.
                     To-night, however, she called me to her in her abrupt way.</p>
                  <p>"Joan," she said, "come here."</p>
                  <p>She had been crying, I could see—silently and miserably. I went and looked over
                     her shoulder at the picture.</p>
                  <p>Photography was in its infancy in those days—every family had not its picture
                     gallery. This was a daguerreotype—the portrait of a young, dashing-looking and
                     rather handsome man. A beardless and boyish face, yet a very manly one, looking
                     up at you with frankly smiling eyes.</p>
                  <p>"It is all I have left," she said, with tremulous lips. "I will never see him
                     again. I loved him and I have spoiled his whole life. It would have been better
                     for him he had died than ever looked in my face."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed," was my rather stupid answer. But I was used to her extravagant talk
                     and not much affected by it. "He is a friend of yours, madame?"</p>
                  <p>She looked at her picture, and over her face there dawned a light that made her
                     beauty radiant.</p>
                  <p>"He is my husband!" she answered.</p>
                  <p>I drew back and looked at her—aghast, I must confess.</p>
                  <p>"Your husband!" I repeated. "Oh—<emph>was</emph> your husband, you mean? You
                     told me he was dead."</p>
                  <p>"Dead to me. Oh, Joan! dead to me, but alive and well. Alive and well; and
                     though I should live to be a hundred, I may never see his face again. Never
                     again; and<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6444-00000010"/> there are times when I
                     would lay down my very life only to look upon him once more."</p>
                  <p>"You love him and—he has left you?" I ventured.</p>
                  <p>"I love him—and I left <emph>him</emph>. I love him with all my heart, and I
                     have fled from him, and buried myself here for fear of him. I wonder I don't go
                     mad, or die. Once I thought I would without him; but somehow life drags on and
                     on, and one is a coward, and afraid to end it one's self. He loved me once,
                     Joan—ah, dear Heaven, yes! he loved me and made me his wife; and now, and now,
                     Joan, if ever he finds me, I believe he will take my life."</p>
                  <p>I looked back at the frank, fair, boyish face.</p>
                  <p>"He take your life!" I said; "that bright-faced boy! No, Mrs. Gordon, murderers
                     don't look like that."</p>
                  <p>"He is the truest, the noblest, the bravest of <unclear>Men</unclear>, a loyal
                     friend and a gallant gentleman."</p>
                  <p>"And yet his wife runs away from him, and says if ever they meet he will take
                     her life."</p>
                  <p>She scarcely seemed to heed me. She laid her head on her folded arms as though
                     she never cared to lift it again.</p>
                  <p>"Ah! let me alone," she said. "<emph>You</emph> know nothing about it. If I
                     could but die and make an end of it all! Only this, Joan," she looked up
                     suddenly, swift, dark terror in her eyes; "I dreamed last night he was
                     searching for me—that he was here. He came and stood before me, stern and
                     terrible, holding my death-warrant in his hand! Don't let him come! don't let
                     any one come! If ever we meet, I believe in my soul he will kill me."</p>
                  <p>Was Mrs. Gordon going mad? that was the very serious question uppermost in my
                     thoughts when I went to bed that night, and for many nights after. It was a
                     very queer and uncomfortable affair altogether, and the sooner I got out of it
                     the better; and just as I was beginning to think of tendering my resignation,
                     behold the climax all at once came of itself.</p>
                  <p>March, April and May had passed—it was the close of June. I had gone into the
                     city one afternoon for our weekly store of groceries, finished my purchases,
                     and, basket on arm, was going home. My way led up St. Louis Street; and passing
                     the office of Mr. Barteaux, I saw him in his own doorway, deep in conversation
                     with a stranger. A look at that stranger, and with one great jump my heart was
                     in my mouth. For it was the original of the picture—it was Mrs. Gordon's
                     husband. "The hour and the man were come!"</p>
                  <p>Neither saw me. I paused a second and looked again. The same, beyond doubt; the
                     same, with a difference—worn and haggard, set and stern—the same, yet
                        <emph>that</emph> was the face of a frank, happy boy, this of a reckless,
                     desperate man. A straw hat was pulled over his eyes, a gray summer overcoat was
                     buttoned up—a soldier and a gentleman, that was evident at a glance.</p>
                  <p>I turned up a side street and hastened breathlessly on. My first duty was to my
                     mistress. I must tell her that what she dreaded had come—that the husband from
                     whom she had fled, was here. I walked at my utmost speed, and in half an hour
                     was at Saltmarsh.</p>
                  <p>"She said he would kill her!" I thought, turning hot and cold; "and who knows
                     that he will not? He would not be the first husband that has killed a runaway
                     wife."</p>
                  <p>I ran through the rooms, all flurried and breathless, calling out her name.</p>
                  <p>She was not in any of them. Of late, since June had come, the fine weather at
                     times had tempted her out. This, most unfortunately, was one of the times. I
                     knew pretty well where to find her—on the river bank below there was a strip of
                     yellow sand, where she was fond of walking up and down in the sunshine. She was
                     sure to be there now.</p>
                  <p>I rushed out, looking wildly around. Yes, there was the tall, soldierly figure
                     in the straw hat and summery overcoat, coming rapidly toward me at a swinging
                     pace.</p>
                  <p>I declare I almost screamed, so nervous and overwrought had I become.</p>
                  <p>If he was before me—if he came upon her suddenly, the shock alone might kill
                     her, for she was far from strong of late. I turned and fled headlong down the
                     steep hillside path, still calling her name. Yes, there, quite alone, pacing
                     slowly up and down the sandy riverside path, looking at the fast-flowing water,
                     Mrs. Gordon walked.</p>
                  <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6444-00000011"/>
                  <p>She paused in her slow walk, and turned to me in wonder at my break-neck
                     descent.</p>
                  <p>How beautiful she was! even in that supreme moment, I remember that was my
                     first thought.</p>
                  <p>"For pity's sake, fly!" I cried out; "fly at once. He is here!"</p>
                  <p>She laid both her hands suddenly over her heart. Across her face there flashed
                     the electric light of a great and sudden joy.</p>
                  <p>"Who?" she said, almost in a whisper.</p>
                  <p>"Your husband, the man whose picture you showed me. Fly at once if you are
                     afraid of him. I saw him, I tell you he is coming. Oh, Heaven!—he is
                        <emph>here!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>I fell back in consternation. Yes, he had followed me; he was coming down the
                     path, he was here.</p>
                  <p>I turned to my mistress. Would she faint? would she fly? Neither.</p>
                  <p>Who is to understand men's wives! Terror was there, in that wild, white face,
                     it is true, but over and above it all, such rapture as I never before saw in
                     the face of man or woman. She loved him and she saw him again—all was said in
                     that.</p>
                  <p>He walked down the path. She came a step forward, with that transfigured face,
                     and held out to him both arms with an eloquent cry:</p>
                  <p>"Gordon! Gordon!"</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE DECREE OF DIVORCE.</head>
                  <p>IT had come. I could do no more. Nothing remained for me but to retreat into
                     the background, and wait with bated breath and beating heart for this play of
                     "powerful domestic interest" to play itself out.</p>
                  <p>He had descended the steep, hillside path and stood on the strip of yellow
                     sand, face to face with the wife who had deserted him. The full light of the
                     June afternoon fell upon his face as he stood there before her, a face more
                     hollow-eyed and haggard, more worn, than it had even looked to me first. A face
                     set and stern, with little of mercy or pity in it.</p>
                  <p>He waved her back. Only the slightest motion of his hand, but she shrank and
                     shivered like a child who has got a blow.</p>
                  <p>"No nearer," he said in a voice as cold and steady as the chill gray eyes that
                     looked upon her. "Unless your sense of hearing has become dulled since the
                     night of Lovell's death, when you played eavesdropper so well, you will be able
                     to hear all I have to say, where you stand. I will not detain you long, and you
                     need not wear that frightened face. I am not going to kill you—the time for all
                     that is passed. But let me tell you this: If you had <emph>not</emph> played
                     eavesdropper that memorable night five months ago, if you had not fled as you
                     did, if I had found you before me when I returned, you would never have lived
                     to see the morning. The greatest fool that ever walked the earth I had been—if
                     you and I had met that night I would have been a murderer as well."</p>
                  <p>All this he said in a slow, self-repressed sort of tone, but the deep gray eyes
                     that watched her were full of such hatred as no words of mine can tell.</p>
                  <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6444-00000012"/>
                  <p>"Spare me, Gordon," she answered, with a sobbing cry.</p>
                  <p>"Spare you?" he repeated, with cold scorn; "have I not said so? I would not
                     lift a finger to harm a hair of your head, or to save your life if I saw you
                     drowning in the river yonder. You are as dead to me as though I had gone home
                     and strangled you that eventful night. The madness of love and rage, alike, are
                     past forever. I have cut you off utterly and absolutely from my life. You have
                     been in hiding here, they tell me, in daily dread of your life no doubt. Let us
                     end all that. You are free to come and go where and how you will. After to-day
                     I will never look upon your face again of my own free will, alive or dead."</p>
                  <p>She gave a shrill cry, like a culprit under the lash, her hands still held out
                     to him in dumb agony.</p>
                  <p>"I have not even come to Quebec now in search of you," the cold, pitiless voice
                     went on; "don't think it. I came to visit General Forrester, stationed yonder
                     at the Citadel, before leaving this accursed Canada forever—accursed since in
                     it I met <emph>you</emph>."</p>
                  <p>Her outstretched hands went up, with a dull moaning sound, and covered her
                     face.</p>
                  <p>"Would you care to know how I found you out, and why I came?" he slowly went
                     on. "Listen: Last night at mess the fellows were speaking of a widow lady, a
                     most mysterious widow lady, young and beautiful, so rumor said, who had taken a
                     desolate old house in a marsh, and there shut herself up, hidden from mortal
                     man and light of day. Her name was <emph>Mrs. Gordon</emph>. Where she came
                     from, who she was, why she had come, no man could tell. Before the name was
                     uttered I knew it was you. Knew that when you fled from Toronto you fled here;
                     knew that the lost woman who had been my wife was found."</p>
                  <p>Her hands dropped. For the first time she stood upright before him and looked
                     him full in the face, stung, it would seem, into turning at bay by these last
                     words.</p>
                  <p>"Who had been your wife!" she cried, passionately; "who <emph>is</emph> your
                     wife, Gordon Caryll! Nothing," a sort of exultation lit her face as she said
                     it, "nothing but death can ever alter that!"</p>
                  <p>For fully a minute he stood silently looking at her, a smile on his lips, a
                     pitiless triumph in his eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Nothing can change that?" he repeated; "nothing but death? Well, I will answer
                     that before we part. Let me go on. I knew it was you, this woman they talked
                     of, and I said to myself: 'I will find her to-morrow; I will look upon her face
                     once more, for the last time, and I will see <emph>what</emph> there was, if I
                     can, in its wax-doll beauty, its yellow-black eyes, its straight nose and
                     silken hair, to turn men into blind, besotted fools.' Take down your hands,
                     Rosamond, and let me look at you."</p>
                  <p>She had shrank from him, from his smile, in some nameless, dreadful fear, that
                     made her cover her white face once more. She dropped her hands now, at his
                     bidding, looking up with dilated eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Gordon, have mercy on me. I love you!"</p>
                  <p>Again she stretched forth her hands to him with that piteous cry. Again he
                     motioned her imperiously back, his lips set, his eyes pitiless, his face like
                     stone.</p>
                  <p>"Stand still!" he ordered.</p>
                  <p>She obeyed.</p>
                  <p>For fully two minutes this strange tableau was before me, and all unseen, in my
                     obscure nook, I stood gazing with an interest that held me rapt and
                     spell-bound. He, drawn up to his full height, his face like white stone, so
                     hard, so cold, that chill, half smile still on his lips. She, half cowering
                     before him, her lovely, colorless face uplifted, her eyes full of dreadful
                     terror, her loose, feathery hair blowing in the wind,—young, fair, innocent to
                        <emph>see</emph>, at least. So they stood—stern young judge, quivering
                     little criminal, until it grew almost too much even for my nerves to
                     endure.</p>
                  <p>"You are a beautiful little woman, Rosamond," he said, at length; "one of those
                     exceptional women, who, like Ninon de L'Enclos, will be beautiful at eighty.
                     And that fair face of yours will do its devil's work, I don't doubt, to the end
                     of the chapter. To possess that face for four short months I have lost all that
                     man holds dear—name, honor, home, friends, fortune—all. For the name that
                        <emph>you</emph> have borne and disgraced, I will bear no longer. I have
                     sold out<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6444-00000013"/> —do you know it? my father
                     has disinherited me—I am the laughingstock of all who ever knew me. I look back
                     and wonder at my own infatuation. I loved you—I trusted you. Oh, God!" he cried
                     out, a spasm of anguish distorting his face; "I <emph>married</emph> you—you!
                     You played your game well, you and Lovell. It was your trade; and with such a
                     fool as I, it was an easy game enough. But you had cause to fear, and you knew
                     it—I say again you did well to fly. I went out from Lovell's death-bed a
                     madman—if I had found you on my return, by the light above us, I would have
                     murdered you!"</p>
                  <p>She shrank back from him, trembling with pure physical terror now, from head to
                     foot.</p>
                  <p>"No need to tremble—no need to fear <emph>now</emph>," he went on, his voice
                     losing its sudden fury, and sinking to its former cold monotone; "I have told
                     you all that is past and done with. But before we part, I should like to hear
                     once from your own lips, just once (not that I doubt) that Major Lovell's story
                     was true."</p>
                  <p>Her only answer was to cower still farther away, and with a great, heart-wrung
                     sob, to bury her face once again in her hands.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, hide it," he said bitterly; "hide it forever from the sight of man—the
                     fairest, falsest face ever made. But speak—if such lips as yours can speak
                     truth, and tell me that Lovell's story was true."</p>
                  <p>"Gordon! have mercy."</p>
                  <p>"Was it true?"</p>
                  <p>"I loved you, Gordon! As there is a heaven above us, I loved you with all my
                     heart."</p>
                  <p>He half laughed—even in that moment.</p>
                  <p>"Your heart—<emph>yours!</emph> What witty things are said by accident! Never
                     mind your heart or your love. I know what both are worth. Answer my question.
                     Was Lovell's story true. One word—yes or no."</p>
                  <p>"Gordon, I was faithful. Oh! <emph>what</emph> shall I say to him to—"</p>
                  <p>"Was it true? Yes or no?"</p>
                  <p>"Gordon, I swear—"</p>
                  <p>"Was it true?" he cried, his eyes flashing fire; "no more words! Yes or
                     no."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, but—"</p>
                  <p>"That will do. We won't waste words about it. You would swear black was white,
                     I daresay, but keep your histrionic talents for the New York stage again—you
                     may need them before long. Let us get back to what you said a moment ago. 'You
                     are my wife—nothing but death can change that.' Do me the favor to look at
                     this."</p>
                  <p>He drew a newspaper from his pocket and handed it to her. Something in his face
                     as he did so frightened her as nothing had frightened yet. Her hands shook—she
                     strove to open the paper and failed. She looked at him with piteous eyes and
                     trembling lips.</p>
                  <p>"I can't," she faltered; "Gordon, what is it?"</p>
                  <p>"It is a decree of divorce," he answered, in his cold, sombre voice. "One week
                     after Lovell's death and your flight, I instituted a suit for divorce, and
                     obtained it. You can read the details in that paper, at your leisure—it may
                     help while away an hour. This is what has kept me in Canada so long. In two
                     days I leave it forever. Chance has brought us together this once, for the last
                     time."</p>
                  <p>He paused, half turned away, then suddenly stopped. She had made some kind of
                     gesture, but it was not for that; she had said "<emph>wait!</emph>" in a hoarse
                     whisper; but it was not that. It was the ghastly change that had come over her
                     face as he struck his last merciless blow. For a moment, I think, it startled
                     even him.</p>
                  <p>"This is true—this that you tell me—this—divorce?"</p>
                  <p>She spoke the words in a husky, breathless sort of voice, her face all
                     distorted, clutching the paper hard.</p>
                  <p>"It is perfectly true," his chill voice answered. "Read and see."</p>
                  <p>"I am no longer your wife?"</p>
                  <p>"You are no longer my wife—thank Heaven and the merciful law of the land."</p>
                  <p>"After this day, you never mean to see or know me again?"</p>
                  <p>"I never mean to see you again if it be in my power, alive or dead."</p>
                  <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6444-00000014"/>
                  <p>"Then hear <emph>me!</emph>" She drew herself upright, her small figure seeming
                     to dilate and grow tall. "Lovell's story was true—true I tell you in every
                     particular except this: that I married you for your rank, and your name, and
                     your wealth. I married you for these, it is true; but beyond these, because I
                     loved you with all my heart. Oh, yes, Gordon Caryll! even such women as I am
                     can love; and in deed, and thought, from the hour you placed this ring on my
                     finger, I was your true and loyal wife. I would have gone with you to beggary—I
                     would have died, if need were, for your sake. Now I am divorced and cast off
                     forever, you say. Well, then we <emph>shall</emph> meet again one day, so
                     surely as we both live. This cold-blooded divorce I will never forgive. Go,
                     Gordon Caryll! but remember this, one day or other, so surely as we both stand
                     here, I will make you suffer for this!"</p>
                  <p>He laughed as he listened—a low, contemptuous laugh, that would have goaded any
                     infuriated woman to madness.</p>
                  <p>"You do it very well, Rosamond," he said; "but so many years' hard practice on
                     the stage of the Bowery Theatre could hardly fail to tell. For the rest, it is
                     rather wasted on an unappreciative audience at present. If I should be so
                     unfortunate as ever to meet you again, I trust, even then, to be able to take
                     care of myself."</p>
                  <p>He turned without another word and left her, striding up the steep path, and
                     never once looking back.</p>
                  <p>She stood where he left her, watching him out of sight, the color fading from
                     her face, the life from her eyes. So, standing motionless there, she saw him
                     pass from view, heard the last echo of his footsteps die away. Then I came
                     forward, for the look on her face frightened me. She turned to me slowly, the
                     fatal paper held in her hand.</p>
                  <p>"I dreamed he came with my death-warrant," she said; "here it is."</p>
                  <p>And then without word or cry to warn me, she went down in a dead faint on the
                     sands.</p>
                  <p>How I brought her to, how I got her home, I can never tell. I did it somehow,
                     and laid her on her bed as the June moon rose and the stars came out. Old
                     Bettine, the French charwoman, was still pottering about the kitchen. In her
                     charge I left my mistress, and fled into town for a doctor. For she was very
                     ill—so ill that it seemed doubtful whether she would ever live to see day
                     dawn.</p>
                  <p>The clocks of Quebec, high up in steeples, silvered by the quiet summer
                     moonlight, were chiming eleven as our first visitor entered Saltmarsh—the
                     doctor.</p>
                  <p>And when the lovely June morning dawned, and the swallows twittered in the
                     eaves, Gordon Caryll's child lay in my arms, and Gordon Caryll's divorced wife
                     lay white and still, with Life and Death fighting their sharp battle above her
                     pillow.</p>

                  <head type="sub">A STRANGE ENDING.</head>
                  <p>LIFE won. Days passed, two weeks went by, and the struggle was at an end. Pale
                     and shadowy that marvellously fair face lay among the pillows, but all doubt
                     was at an end. Mrs. Gordon would live.</p>
                  <p>Saltmarsh was a deserted house no longer. A ponderous nurse had come from
                     Quebec, the doctor was a daily visitor, and old Bettine spent her nights as
                     well as her days with us. There was nothing to fear any more; the man she had
                     longed for and feared had come and gone, to come no more forever. The baby fell
                     almost entirely to me—a charge as pleasant as novel, for I must own, spinster
                     that I am, to a tender weakness for babies. It lay in my arms all day; it slept
                     in its crib by my bedside at night.</p>
                  <p>"The smallest mite of a baby <emph>I</emph> ever see," observed Mrs. Watters,
                     the fat nurse; "and I've seen a regiment of 'em, little and big, in my day. I
                     should say now it wouldn't weigh five pounds."</p>
                  <p>It <emph>was</emph> small. A tiny, black-haired, black-eyed speck, its pink dot
                     of a face looking weird, lit by those black, blinking eyes.</p>
                  <p>One thing was strange—was unnatural. From its birth its mother had never seen
                     it, never asked to see it. One evening, when Bettine had called nurse down to
                     supper, and I sat watching in her room, she spoke of it for the first time.</p>
                  <p>It was a lovely July night, under the brilliant summer moon, the St. Lawrence
                     ran between its green slopes like a belt of silver light. The white, misty
                     moonlight filled the chamber, the lamp had not yet been lit, and the pale glory
                     illumined the face, whiter than the lace and linen against which it lay. She
                     sat partly up in bed, propped by pillows, gazing with dark, sombre eyes out at
                     that radiance in Heaven and on earth—that glory from the skies upon river and
                     shore. For more than an hour she had been sitting motionless, her dark,
                     brooding eyes never leaving the fairy scene, as though she saw her own future
                     life over there beyond that shining river. In the dim distance, baby lay in its
                     crib fast asleep; deepest silence reigned within and without. That silence was
                     suddenly and sharply broken by the shrilly, feeble wail of the child as it
                     awoke. As I rose and crossed the room to take it, she spoke: "Joan, bring it
                     here."</p>
                  <p>"H'm! high time for you to say it," I thought, but in silence I obeyed. There
                     had been something revolting to me in her utter want of mother-love; in her
                     unnatural indifference; I carried it to the bedside and stooped to place it
                     beside her.</p>
                  <p>"No, no," she said with a quick, petulant gesture of repulsion; "not there; I
                     don't want it. I always hated babies. I only want to look at it."</p>
                  <p>"Shall I bring in the lamp?" I asked.</p>
                  <p>"No; the moonlight will do. What a dot of a baby! Joan, who is it like?"</p>
                  <p>"It has your eyes," I answered; "beyond that it is impossible to tell. Mrs.
                     Watters says, though, it is your very 'moral.' It is certainly the tiniest baby
                     that ever was born."</p>
                  <p>"My very moral," she repeated, with a feeble laugh. "I hope so! I hope it may
                     be like me. I hope it may never resemble <emph>him</emph>, in any way. I hope
                     it may live to help avenge its mother yet!"</p>
                  <p>I was silent—shocked and scandalized beyond power of replying. Here was a
                     Christian woman and mother, just saved from death, talking like some heathen,
                     of revenge!</p>
                  <p>"Is it a girl or a boy?" she inquired next, after a pause.</p>
                  <p>"Girl," I answered, shortly. "It is time you asked."</p>
                  <p>She glanced at me in surprise, but in no displeasure.</p>
                  <p>"Why should I ask? It didn't matter much. A girl! If it had only been a boy;
                     and yet, who can tell, if she is like me, and is pretty, she may do great
                     things yet. She may help <emph>me</emph>. That will do, Joan. Take it
                     away."</p>
                  <p>She turned her face from the light, and lay for a long<pb n="34-35"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000016"/> time still, brooding over her own thoughts—dark
                     and wicked thoughts I well knew. Whoever or whatever this Mrs. Gordon might be,
                     she was not a proper or virtuous woman, that seemed pretty clear—a wife whose
                     husband had been forced to put her away—a mother who only looked forward to the
                     future of her child as an instrument of vengeance on its father. There are some
                     services that no wages can repay—to my mind this was one. The moment Mrs.
                     Gordon was well enough to be left, that moment I would leave her.</p>
                  <p>"And what will become of you with such a mother, Providence only knows," I
                     apostrophized the little one on my lap. "You poor, little, spectral, black-eyed
                     mite! I wish you belonged to me altogether."</p>
                  <p>From that evening Mrs. Gordon rallied, and asserted her power once more as
                     mistress of the house. Her first act of sovereignty was to dismiss the
                     nurse.</p>
                  <p>"All danger is over, the doctor tells me," she said to Mrs. Watters a few days
                     after. "Joan Kennedy can take care of me now. I shall not require you any more.
                     Joan, pay Mrs. Watters her due. She leaves to-night."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Watters left. Next morning Mrs. Gordon asserted herself still further—she
                     insisted upon being dressed and allowed to sit up. She had her way, of course,
                     and I wish I could tell you how fair and youthful and lovely she looked.
                     Youthful! I declare, whatever her age really was, she did not look a day over
                     sixteen. But there was that in her quick, black eyes, in her colorless face, in
                     those latter days, not pleasant to see—something I could not define, and that
                     confirmed me in my resolution to leave her very soon. Of her child, from the
                     evening of which I have spoken, she took not the slightest notice. I truly
                     believe she never once looked at it again; when it cried she had it impatiently
                     removed out of hearing. She sat thinking—thinking steadfastly, with bent brows
                     and compressed lips, of what—who could tell?</p>
                  <p>"I'll give her warning to-morrow," I said resolutely to myself; "my month is up
                     in a week. I'll never live another with you, my pretty, mysterious little
                     mistress."</p>
                  <p>Her eyes lifted suddenly, and fixed themselves on my face as I thought it. Did
                     she divine my very thoughts? The faint smile that was on her lips almost made
                     me think so.</p>
                  <p>"Joan," she said, in her pretty, imperious way, "come here, child; I want to
                     talk to you. You have been a good and faithful companion in all these dreary,
                     miserable months, to a most miserable and lonely woman. Let me thank you now
                     while I think of it, and before we say good-by."</p>
                  <p>"Good-by!" I repeated, completely taken aback. "Then you are going away?"</p>
                  <p>"Going away, Joan; high time, is it not? All is over now—there is nothing to
                     fear or hope any more. One chapter of my life is read and done with forever.
                     The day after to-morrow I go out into the world once more, to begin all over
                     again. Up to the present my life has been a most miserable failure—all but four
                     short months." She paused suddenly; the dreary, lovely face lit up with a sort
                     of rapture. "All but four short months—oh, let me always except that—when he
                     made me his wife, and I was happy, happy, happy! Joan, if I had died three
                     weeks ago when <emph>that</emph> was born, you might have had engraven on my
                     tombstone the epitaph that was once inscribed over another lost woman; 'I have
                     been most happy—and most miserable.'"</p>
                  <p>I listened silently, touched, in spite of myself, by the unspeakable pathos of
                     her look and tone.</p>
                  <p>"All that is over and done with," she said, after a little. "I am not to die,
                     it seems. I am going to begin my life, as I say, all over again. Nothing that
                     befalls me in the future can be any worse than what lies behind. It does not
                     fall to the lot of all women to be divorced wives at the age of eighteen."</p>
                  <p>She laughed drearily. She sat by the window in her favorite easy-chair, looking
                     out while she talked, with the rosy after glow of the sunset fading away beyond
                     the feathery tamarac trees and the low Canadian hills.</p>
                  <p>"I feel something as a felon must," she dreamily went on, half to herself, half
                     to me, "who has served out his sentence and whose order of release has come,
                     almost afraid to face the world I have left so long. I did not come to this<pb
                        n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6444-00000017"/> house a very good woman, Joan—that, I
                     suppose, you know; but I quit it a thousand times worse. I came here with a
                     human heart, at least, a heart that could love and feel remorse; but love and
                     remorse are at an end. I told him I loved him and had been faithful to him, and
                     he laughed in my face. Women can forgive a great deal, but they do not forgive
                     that. If he had only left me—if he had not got that divorce, I would never have
                     troubled him—never, I swear. I would have gone away and loved him, and been
                     faithful to him to the end. Now—now—" she paused, her hands clenched, her
                     yellow eyes gleaming catlike in the dusk. "Now, I will pay him back, sooner or
                     later, if I lose my life for it. I will be revenged—that I swear."</p>
                  <p>I shrank away from her, from the sight of her wicked face, from the hearing of
                     her wicked words,—the horror I felt, showing, I suppose, in my face.</p>
                  <p>"It all sounds very horrible, very shocking, does it not?" she asked, bitterly.
                     "You are one of the pious and proper sort, my good Joan, who walk stiffly along
                     the smooth-beaten path of propriety, from your cradle to your grave. Well, I
                     won't shock you much longer, let that be your comfort. The day after to-morrow
                     I go, and as a souvenir I mean to leave <emph>that</emph> behind me."</p>
                  <p>She pointed coolly to the crib in the corner.</p>
                  <p>"You—you mean to leave the baby?" I gasped.</p>
                  <p>"I—I mean to leave the baby," she answered, with a half laugh, parodying my
                     tone of consternation; "you didn't suppose I meant to take it with me, did you?
                     I start in two days to begin a new life, as a perfectly proper young lady—young
                     lady, you understand, Joan? and you may be very sure I shall carry no such
                     land-mark with me as that of the old one. Yes, Joan, I shall leave the baby
                     with you, if you will keep it, with Mrs. Waters if you will not."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, I will keep the baby and welcome," I said; "poor little soul!" and as it
                     lay in its sleep, so small and helpless, so worse than orphaned at its very
                     birth, I stooped and kissed it, with tears in my eyes.</p>
                  <p>"You are a good woman, Joan," she said, more softly; "I wish—yes, with all my
                     soul, I wish I were like you. But it is late in the day for wishing—what is
                     done is done. You will keep the child?"</p>
                  <p>"I will keep the child."</p>
                  <p>"I am glad of that. It will be well with you. One day or other I will come and
                     claim it. Don't let it die, Joan; it has its work to do in the world, and must
                     do it. I will pay you, of course, and well. The money I had with me when I came
                     here is almost gone, but out yonder, beyond your Canadian woods and river,
                     there is always more for busy brains and hands. The furniture of these rooms I
                     leave with you to sell or keep, as you see fit. Wherever I may be, I will give
                     you an address, whence letters will reach me."</p>
                  <p>"And you will never return—never come to see your child?" I asked.</p>
                  <p>"Never, Joan,—until I come to claim it for good. Why should I? I don't care for
                     it—not a straw—in the way you mean. One day, if we both live, I will claim it;
                     one day its father shall learn, to his cost and his sorrow, that he has a
                     child."</p>
                  <p>That evil light flashed up into her great eyes for an instant, then slowly died
                     out: but she spoke no more—her folded hands lay idly on her lap, her moody gaze
                     turned upon the rapidly darkening river and hills. The rose light had all faded
                     away—the gray, creeping, July twilight was shrouding all things in a sombre
                     haze. The baby awoke and cried; I had its bottle ready—I lit the lamp and
                     lifted it. As it lay in my lap, placidly pulling at its feeding-bottle, its big
                     black eyes fixed vacantly upon the ceiling, its mother turned from the window
                     and stared at it silently.</p>
                  <p>With its little white face, and large black eyes, and profusion of long black
                     hair, it looked more like some elfish changeling in a fairy tale than a healthy
                     human child.</p>
                  <p>"It's a hideous little object," was Mrs. Gordon's motherly remark, after that
                     prolonged stare; "but ugly babies they say sometimes grow up pretty. I want it
                     to be pretty—<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6444-00000018"/> It must be pretty. Will
                     it, do you think, Joan? Will it really look like me?"</p>
                  <p>"I think so, madame—very like you. More's the pity," I added, under my
                     breath.</p>
                  <p>"Ah!" still thoughtfully staring at it, "is there any birthmark? The proverbial
                     strawberry on the arm, or mole on the neck, you know? that sort of thing?"</p>
                  <p>"It has no mark of any kind, from head to foot."</p>
                  <p>"What a pity; we must give it one, then. Art must supply the deficiencies of
                     nature. It shall be done to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>"<emph>What</emph> must be done? Mrs. Gordon, you don't surely mean—"</p>
                  <p>"I mean to mark that child so that I shall know it again, fifty years from now,
                     if need be. Don't look so horrified, Joan,—I won't do anything very dreadful.
                     One marks one's pocket-handkerchiefs—why not one's babies? You may die; she may
                     grow up and run away—oh, yes, she may! If she takes after her mother, you won't
                     find it a bed of roses bringing her up. We may cross paths and never know each
                     other. I want to guard against that possibility. I want to know my daughter
                     when we meet."</p>
                  <p>"For pity's sake, madame, what is it you intend to do?"</p>
                  <p>"You have seen tattooing, Joan, done in India ink? Yes. Well, that is what I
                     mean. I shall mark her initials on her arm to-morrow, exactly as I mark them on
                     my handkerchief, and you shall help me."</p>
                  <p>"No, madame," I cried out in horror, "I will not. Oh, you poor little helpless
                     babe! Madame! I beg of you—don't do this cruel thing."</p>
                  <p>"Cruel? Silly girl! I shall give it a sleeping cordial, and it will feel
                     nothing. So you will not help me?"</p>
                  <p>"Most assuredly I will not."</p>
                  <p>"Very well—Bettine will. And lest your tender feelings should be lacerated by
                     being in the house, you may go and pay your mother and sister a visit. By the
                     by, you don't ask me what its name is to be, Joan."</p>
                  <p>"As I am to keep it, though, supposing you don't kill it to-morrow, I shall be
                     glad to know, Mrs. Gordon."</p>
                  <p>"I don't mean to kill it—never fear; I don't want it to die. If it had been a
                     boy, I always meant—in the days that are gone, mind you—to have called it for
                     its father."</p>
                  <p>She paused a moment, and turned her face far away. On <emph>this</emph> point,
                     even she could feel yet.</p>
                  <p>"It is a girl, unluckily," she went on again, steadily, "but I will still call
                     it for him. Gordon Caryll—a pretty name, is it not, Joan? an odd one too, for a
                     girl. Until I claim it, however, and the proper time comes, we will sink the
                     Caryll, and call it Kennedy. Kennedy's a good old Scotch, respectable
                     name—Gordon Kennedy will do. As I said, to-morrow I will mark the initials 'G.
                     C.' upon its arm; and whatever happens, years and years from now, if my
                     daughter and I ever meet, I shall know her always, and in all places, by the
                     mark on her arm."</p>
                  <p>I could do nothing. My heart sickened and revolted against this cruelty, but
                     she was mother and mistress, and could do as she pleased. I would not stay to
                     see the torture; Bettine might help her or not, as she pleased; I would go.</p>
                  <p>Next morning, immediately after breakfast, I quitted the house, and spent the
                     day at mother's. In the gray of the summer evening I returned, to find the deed
                     done, the babe drugged and still asleep, lying in its crib, the arm bound up,
                     Bettine excited, Mrs. Gordon composed and cool.</p>
                  <p>"Did it cry?" I asked, kissing the pale little face.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, but yes, mademoiselle!" Bettine cried, in her shrill, high French voice;
                     "cried fit to break the heart, until madame double drugged it, and it lay
                     still. The arm—the poor infant—will be sore and inflamed for many a day to
                     come. It is a heart of stone. Mam'selle Jeanne—the pretty little madame."</p>
                  <p>That was our last evening in Saltmarsh—a long, quiet, lonesome evening enough.
                     I distrusted her—in some way I feared and disliked her; and yet I felt a
                     strange sort of compassion for the quiet little creature, sitting there so
                     utterly desolated in her youth and beauty—wrecked and adrift on the world at
                     eighteen.</p>
                  <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6444-00000019"/>
                  <p>She sat in her old place by the window so still—so still—the fair face gleaming
                     like marble in the dusk, the dark, mournful eyes fixed on the creeping darkness
                     shrouding the fair Canadian river and landscape. It all ended to-night—the
                     peace, the safety, dreary though it may have been—and to-morrow she must go
                     forth out into the great, pitiless world, with only her beautiful face and her
                     wicked heart to make her way. What dark story lay behind her? I wondered; and
                     was this fair, forsaken wife most to be pitied or blamed?</p>
                  <p>The hours of the evening crept on—ten, eleven; she never stirred. And when,
                     sometime before midnight, I crept away with my baby to my room, the motionless
                     little figure was there at the window still.</p>
                  <p>Next morning dawned cloudless and fair. Bettine was up betimes to prepare
                     breakfast—for the last time I served my little mistress. She was dead silent
                     through it all, and ate it in her travelling suit of dark gray, all ready to
                     depart. There was a train at nine; it was half-past eight now, and the
                     cabriolet ordered from Quebec was at the door. She stooped for a moment over
                     her babe; but even in this parting hour she never kissed it, and my heart
                     hardened against her once more.</p>
                  <p>"It is as Bettine says," I thought; "she has the face of an angel and the heart
                     of a stone."</p>
                  <p>Even as I thought it, she arose and looked at me—that charming smile upon her
                     charming face, that had bewitched me against my will the very first time we
                     met, that bewitched me out of my hot anger once again. She held out her
                     hand.</p>
                  <p>"Good-by, my solemn Joan. Don't think too badly of me when I am gone—a poor
                     little woman with whom life has gone hard. You are a good girl, and I shall
                     always keep a grateful remembrance of you in my none too tender heart. Take
                     good care of my baby—you shall be amply rewarded. I <emph>may</emph> come back
                     years from now to look at it—who knows? At all events you will hear from me
                     monthly. And, if we never meet again, let me thank you once more for your
                     faithful and patient companionship all these months."</p>
                  <p>They were the last words she ever spoke in Saltmarsh. In the yellow sunshine of
                     the soft summer day Mrs. Gordon passed out of the House to Let, and out of my
                     life forever. I watched her enter the cab, caught one last glimpse of a pale,
                     lovely face, of a little gloved hand waving from the window, then the driver
                     cracked his whip, and they were whirling away in a cloud of dust to where
                     quaint, gray, silent old Quebec slept in morning quiet, the golden sunshine
                     flooding its steep streets, its tin roofs, its lofty spires, its high stone
                     walls. Mrs. Gordon was gone.</p>
                  <p>Before nightfall I had taken the baby home and dismissed Bettine. Part of the
                     furniture I kept, part I sent into Quebec and sold. Late in the evening I
                     carried the key to Mr. Barteaux, with his rent, and on my return my own hands
                     replaced the placard over the gate. Saltmarsh was once more a "House to
                     Let."</p>
                  <p>She had come among us a mystery—she left us a greater mystery still. I write
                     this record for the child's sake—one day it may need it. I feel that the story
                     I have told does not end here, that it is but the prelude to what is to come.
                     So surely as that woman and this child live and meet, trouble—sad and deep
                     trouble to that man Gordon Caryll—will come of it. I say again I write this for
                     the child's sake. One day, even what I have set down here may be of use to her.
                     If I die I will place it in safe hands, to be given to her, and so I sign
                     myself</p>

                  <head type="sub">AT CARYLLYNNE.</head>
                  <p>MANY miles away, many miles of land, many leagues of sea, far beyond that "city
                     set on the hill," Quebec, far away in fair England, lay the broad domain of
                     Caryllynne, Gordon Caryll's ancestral home.</p>
                  <p>It lay in one of the brightest, sunniest of the sunny seaside shires, a fair
                     and stately inheritance, stretching away for miles of woodland and meadowland,
                     to the wide sea, sparkling in the late August sunshine, as if sown with
                     stars.</p>
                  <p>Under a massive Norman arch, between lofty iron gates, you went up a sweep of
                     broad drive, with a waving sea of many-colored foliage on either hand, slim,
                     silver-stemmed birches, copper beeches with leaves like blood-red rubies,
                     sombre pines, hoary oaks, graceful elms, and whole rows of prim poplars, those
                     "old maids of the wood." Far away this brilliant forest of Caryllynne stretched
                     to the emerald cliffs above the bright summer sea, to the little village
                     nestling between those green cliffs, a village which for two centuries had
                     called the Squire of Caryllynne, lord.</p>
                  <p>You went up this noble avenue for a mile or more past the picturesque Swiss
                     cottage that did duty as a gate lodge, past green and golden slopes of sward,
                     past parterres bright with gorgeous autumnal flowers, to the Manor house
                     itself, an irregular structure of gray stone, turreted and many-gabled and much
                     ivy-grown. There was a stately portico entrance, a flight of shallow stone
                     steps, and two couchant stone dogs, with the ancient motto, "<foreign
                        xml:lang="LAT">Cave canim</foreign>." It was a very old house, one portion
                     as old as the reign of the greatly-married-man, Henry the Eighth. A gift,
                     indeed, from his Most Christian Majesty to Sir Jasper Caryll, Knight, and
                     cousin of Katherine Parr, on the happy occasion of his last marriage.</p>
                  <p>Sir Jasper Caryll, Kt., had been sleeping beneath the chancel of Roxhaven
                     Church for three hundred odd years, with a brass tablet above him recording his
                     virtues; and many Carylls had been born and married, and had died, within those
                     gray stone walls since. The old, old business of life, "Hatching, Matching, and
                     Dispatching," had gone on and on within those antique chambers; and Mistress
                     Marian Caryll, widow of the late Godfrey Caryll, reigned now in the Manor
                     alone.</p>
                  <p>The old house had been modernized. Plate-glass windows, a tessellated hall,
                     velvet-carpeted stairways, conservatories gay with flowers, these made the
                     ancient dwelling bright. Flowers, indeed, were everywhere, in gilded vases in
                     half a hundred nooks, in swinging baskets from the ceilings, and over all the
                     amber August sunshine slanting like golden rain.</p>
                  <p>The last light of the brilliant autumn day was falling softly over sea and
                     woodland, meadow and copse; the western windows of the Manor, facing seaward,
                     glinted through the trees like sparks of fire. The sweet, tremulous hush of
                     eventide lay over the land, as through the park gates a pony phaeton dashed up
                     the long, tree-shaded drive. Two black high-steppers, a dainty little basket
                     carriage, and a lady sitting very erect and upright, driving with a strong,
                     firm hand—a lady in sweeping crapes and sables—in widow's weeds—the mistress of
                     this fair domain.</p>
                  <p>A groom came forward to hold the horses. As she flung him the reins and stepped
                     out you saw that Mrs. Caryll was a very tall and stately lady, bearing her
                     forty years of life well. A tall, pale, rather cold, rather stern, rather
                     haughty lady, handsomer perhaps in her stately middle age than she could ever
                     have been in youth.</p>
                  <p>"I have driven the ponies very fast from Dynely Abbey, Morgan," she said to the
                     groom; "see that they are slowly exercised and well rubbed down. Has the post
                     arrived?"</p>
                  <p>The man made a sort of half military salute, as to his commanding officer.</p>
                  <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6444-00000021"/>
                  <p>"Post came 'alf an hour ago, ma'am. I'll attend to the ponies, ma'am, all
                     right."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Caryll passed on with a slow and measured sort of tread up the stone
                     steps, past the great couchant dogs, along the vast domed hall, hung with suits
                     of mail and antlered heads, up the wide stairway and into her own rooms. The
                     rose light of the sunset filled those elegantly appointed apartments, and lying
                     upon an inlaid table the mistress of the Manor saw what she looked for—a sealed
                     letter. Her heart gave a bound, cold and well disciplined as it was, but (it
                     was characteristic of the woman) before taking it up, she slowly laid aside her
                     bonnet and veil, drew off her gloves, and then deliberately lifted it. A moment
                     she paused to glance at the free flowing writing she knew so well, then she
                     opened and read:</p>

                              <p>MY DEAREST MOTHER:—I have arrived but this moment. By the first
                                 train I leave for home. I write this simply to announce my coming.
                                 I will be with you almost as soon as my note. I know that in spite
                                 of all you will grant me this last interview at least.</p>
                              <p>Your affectionate son,</p>
                              <closer>

                  </q>
                  <p>She crushed the brief letter in her strong white hand. Her fixedly pale face,
                     even in the glow of the sunset, seemed to grow paler, her firm lips set
                     themselves in one tight unpleasant line.</p>
                  <p>"'My dearest mother!' 'Your affectionate son,'" she said, bitterly, looking at
                     the letter. "Yes, I will see him—he is right—for the last time. After to-night
                     I shall be as though I never had a child."</p>
                  <p>She folded the letter, laid it aside methodically in a drawer with many others.
                     Slow, methodical habits had become second nature to Mrs. Caryll. "Yes," she
                     thought, "I will see him once more—once more. Whatever he may have to say in
                     his own defence I will hear. To him and to all mankind I trust I shall always
                     do my duty. But come what may, after to-night I will never see him again."</p>
                  <p>She looked at her watch—the train that would possibly bring him was due even
                     now. In a little time he would be with her. For two years she had not seen
                     him—he had been her darling, the treasure of her heart, the apple of her eye,
                     the "only son of his mother, and she was a widow." Her whole soul cried out for
                     him, and she stood here, and crushed down every voice of nature, and calmly
                     resolved after this once to see him no more forever.</p>
                  <p>She walked across the room, and paused before the chimney-piece. Two pictures
                     hung above it—the only two this room contained—two portraits. One, the one at
                     which she looked, was the portrait of her husband, painted twenty years ago, in
                     the gallant and golden days of his youth, a present to his bride. A handsome
                     face; the Carylls had ever been handsome men; and this proud, self-contained
                     woman had loved her husband with a great and deathless love. Now, he too lay in
                     Roxhaven church; only a month ago they had laid him there, glad to escape by
                     death the shame brought upon him by an only son.</p>
                  <p>"There are some things that Heaven itself will not ask us to forgive," was her
                     thought—"this is one of them."</p>
                  <p>Beneath this portrait hung the other, a smaller one, of her son. Two years ago
                     that had been painted, on the eve of his departure for Canada with his
                     regiment. The frank fair face of the lad of twenty, gray-eyed and
                     yellow-haired, smiled at her from the canvas. With a resolute hand she took it
                     down, and turned it with the face to the wall. A little thing again, but it
                     told how small the mercy Gordon Caryll might expect when he stood before his
                     mother.</p>
                  <p>It had grown dark—the pale August moon rose up the misty sky. The trees, waving
                     faintly in the salt sea wind, cast long, slanting shadows across the dusty
                     whiteness of the high road, as from the town beyond, from the brightly lit
                     station, a fly from the railway drove through the gates and up the moonlit
                     avenue to the house. A young man sprang out, paid and dismissed the man, and
                     paused a moment in the pallid light to look about him. Only two years since he
                     had stood here last—two years. Nothing had changed—nothing but his life, and
                     the hot fever of his own youthful fancy—<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6444-00000022"
                     /> the fair, treacherous face of a woman had spoiled that forever.</p>
                  <p>He lifted the heavy bronze knocker and sent the echoes ringing dully down the
                     great hall. The man who opened the door, an old family servant, started back
                     with a cry of surprise and delight.</p>
                  <p>"Sure to goodness, if it isn't Mr. Gordon come back!"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Gordon come back—bad shillings always come back, don't they? How are you,
                     Norton? Is my mother in?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Mr. Gordon. In her own rooms. You know the way—"</p>
                  <p>"Go and tell her I am here, Norton, and be quick about it, will you? I'll
                     wait."</p>
                  <p>The man stared, but obeyed. Gordon Caryll stood in the long, echoing, deserted
                     hall, staring moodily out at the moonlight, and not at all sure, in spite of
                     his letter, whether his mother would deign to see him or not. But his doubts
                     were speedily set at rest. Norton reappeared.</p>
                  <p>"My mistress will see you, Mr. Gordon, sir. She bids you come to her at once in
                     her morning room."</p>
                  <p>He waited for no more; she would see him; he had hardly dared hope it; she
                        <emph>might</emph> forgive him—who knew? He ran lightly up the stairs and
                     tapped at the familiar door.</p>
                  <p>"Come in," his mother's calm voice said, and, hat in hand, he entered.</p>
                  <p>Mother and son stood face to face. A cluster of wax-lights lit the room
                     brilliantly. In their full glow Mrs, Caryll stood, her tall figure upheld at
                     its tallest, her widow's weeds trailing the carpet, her widow's cap on her
                     dark, unsilvered hair, her face like a face cut in white stone. In that moment,
                     if he could have but seen it, she bore a curious, passing likeness to himself
                     as he had stood, pale and relentless, before the girl who had been his
                     wife.</p>
                  <p>"Mother!"</p>
                  <p>She made a sudden, hasty motion for him to stand still and back, a motion again
                     like his own as he had repelled his most miserable wife. He obeyed, closing the
                     door, and knowing his whole fate in that second of time.</p>
                  <p>She stood for fully a minute, silently looking at him, never softening one
                     whit. She saw the cruel changes those two years had made plainly enough, the
                     youthful face grown grave and worn, the hollow eyes, the colorless cheeks. He
                     had sinned, but he had also suffered. Well, it was right; here and hereafter is
                     not suffering the inevitable penalty of sin?</p>
                  <p>"Mother," he said, "forgive me."</p>
                  <p>She made a motion of her hand toward the picture above the mantel.</p>
                  <p>"You know that he is dead?" were her first words.</p>
                  <p>"I know it. Oh, mother, I acknowledge all my wrong-doing, my shame, my sin, if
                     you will call it so. I was mad. All I could do to atone, I have done. Mother,
                     forgive me, if you can!"</p>
                  <p>"Forgive you!" Her eyes blazed out upon him for one moment with a lurid fire.
                     "I will never forgive you so long as we both live!"</p>
                  <p>He walked over to the low mantel, laid his arm upon it, and his bowed face on
                     his arm. She stood and looked at him, her breast heaving with strong, repressed
                     emotion, her eyes glowing like fire in her pale face.</p>
                  <p>"For three hundred years," she said, in that tense tone of suppressed passion,
                     "the Carylls have been born, have lived and died beneath this roof, brave men,
                     noble gentlemen always. It was left for my son to bring shame and dishonor at
                     last. The name was never approached by disgrace until you bore it. Your
                     grandfather married a duke's daughter; you, the last of your name, take a wife
                     from the sweepings of New York city—an actress—a street-walker—a creature whose
                     vile, painted face was displayed nightly in the-lowest theatre of the worst of
                     American cities. <emph>My</emph> son, did I call you? I take it back. After
                     to-night I have no son!"</p>
                  <p>He never moved; he never spoke. His hidden face she could not see. That very
                     silence was as oil to fire.</p>
                  <p>"One month ago your father died—died of your shame. You stand there as much his
                     murderer as though you had stabbed him to the heart. He died unforgiving
                     you—every rood of land, every shilling of fortune left away from you.<pb
                        n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6444-00000023"/> Not an-inch of Caryllynne is
                     entailed—that you know—not one farthing of the noble inheritance that was your
                     birthright shall you ever possess. The name you dishonor is yours beyond power
                     to recall; but that alone—not one thing more. And after to-night you never
                     cross this thresh-old again."</p>
                  <p>Still no reply—still he stood like a figure of stone.</p>
                  <p>"You say you have atoned," his mother went on, in that low, passionate voice.
                     "Atoned! That means you have dragged the name of Caryll through the mire and
                     filth of a divorce court—that your story and hers, that lost wretch, is in the
                     mouths of all men in Canada and England. Your atonement is worse than your
                     crime. Your atonement shall last your life long. Now go! All I wish to say, I
                     have said—I will never forgive you—I will never look upon your face again!"</p>
                  <p>The very words he had spoken to his divorced wife! What fatality was at work
                     here? She ceased speaking, and Gordon Caryll lifted his haggard face and looked
                     at her—to the day of her death a look to haunt her with a pain sharper than
                     death itself.</p>
                  <p>"It shall be as you say," he answered, very quietly. "I don't think I expected
                     anything else—I suppose I deserve nothing better. I will not trouble you again.
                     For the name I have dishonored, have no fear—it shall be dishonored by my
                     bearing it no more. I leave it behind with all the rest. Good-night, mother,
                     and good-by."</p>
                  <p>And then he was gone. The door closed gently behind him, and she was alone.
                     Alone! she would be alone her life-long now.</p>
                  <p>She was ghastly white—ashen white to the lips. But—she had done her duty! That
                     thought must console her in all the long, lonely years to come. She stood for
                     nearly half an hour in the spot where he had left her, stock-still. Then she
                     slowly turned, walked across the room, lifted a velvet curtain, and entered
                     what seemed an oratory. Over a sort of altar, a painting of the Madonna di San
                     Sisto hung—an exquisite copy; and the heavenly mother, with the serene,
                     uplifted face, holding the child-Christ in her arms, was there before the
                     earthly mother, who for one rash act, had cast her only son off forever.</p>
                  <p>On a prayer-desk, before this altar, a Bible lay. At random she opened it—in a
                     blind sort of way seeking for comfort. And this is what she read:</p>
                  <p>"Behold the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom. And the victory that day was
                     turned into mourning unto all the people, for the people heard say that day how
                     the king was grieved for his son. But the king covered his face, and the king
                     cried with a loud voice, 'Oh, my son Absalom! Oh, Absalom, my son, my
                     son!'"</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                  <head type="sub">GORDON CARYLL'S STORY.</head>
                  <p>HIS trial was over, his sentence was passed, and Gordon Caryll went out from
                     his mother's presence an outcast and banished man.</p>
                  <p>"All for love, and the world well lost," he said to himself, with something
                     that was almost a smile. "Ah, well! Come what will, I have been blessed. For
                     four months I had my fool's paradise—let that thought console me, in all the
                     years of outlawry that are to come."</p>
                  <p>He did not leave the house directly. On the landing he paused a moment
                     irresolute, then turned, ran up another stairway, opened one of the many doors
                     that flanked the long corridor, and entered the rooms that had been his own.
                     Only the moonlight lit them, but that was brilliant almost as day. With that
                     slight, sad smile on his lips he walked through them. Everywhere traces of his
                     dead father's pride in him, his mother's love for him, were scattered with
                     lavish hand. More luxurious almost were those rooms than his mother's own.</p>
                  <p>"They will serve for my mother's heir," the young soldier thought—"whoever that
                     may be. Lucia Dynely's little son Eric, very likely. She was always fond of
                     Lucia; so, for that matter, was I. My pretty cousin! It is but seven miles
                     distant, and there is time and to spare. Suppose I look her up for the last
                     time before I go forth into the outer darkness, and be heard of no more?"</p>
                  <p>He selected a few trifles, a picture of this mother, another of this "Cousin
                     Lucia" of his thoughts, a gold-mounted meerschaum pipe—then with a last
                     backward glance of farewell at the pretty moonlit rooms, he ran down the
                     stairs, out of the silent house, the great door closed with a clang behind him,
                     and all was over.</p>
                  <p>He made his way to the stables, startling grooms and stable boys as though he
                     had been a ghost.</p>
                  <p>"Saddle Dark Diamond, Morris," he ordered; "I'm going to Dynely Abbey, and will
                     leave him there behind me. You can go over for him to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>He vaulted lightly into the saddle, cantered down the avenue, out of the great
                     gates, and beyond the far-stretching park that was never to call
                     him-master.</p>
                  <p>As he stopped for one last look, never, it seemed to him, had the old ancestral
                     home looked so noble and desirable as on this August night, under the yellow
                     light of the summer moon.</p>
                  <p>"A fair and stately heritage to yield for a girl's face," he thought, bitterly.
                     "May my successor be wiser than I, and be kept from that maddest of all man's
                     madness—loving a woman!"</p>
                  <p>His horse was a fleet one—he spurred him on to a gallop. For miles, as he rode,
                     the woods of Caryllynne stretched, on the other hand the cottage lights
                     twinkled, the village forge flamed forth lurid red, old familiar landmarks met
                     him everywhere, and far beyond the broad sweep of the silver-lighted sea.</p>
                  <p>Less than half an hour brought him to his destination, Dynely Abbey, the seat
                     of Viscount Dynely—a huge historic pile, that long centuries ago had been a
                     Cistercian monastery, in the days when the "Keys and Cross and Triple Crown"
                     held mighty sway through all broad England. As he rode at a gallop up the
                     entrance avenue, in view of the great gray Abbey, pearly white in the
                     moonlight, his horse shied at some white object, so suddenly and violently as
                     almost to unseat his rider. Gordon Caryll laughed as he leaped off and patted
                     him soothingly on the head.</p>
                  <p>"So ho, Diamond! Easy, old fellow. Does the sight of my pretty Cousin Lucia, in
                     her white dress and shawl, upset your nervous system like this?"</p>
                  <p>He threw the bridle over a tree, and advanced to where a lady, in a silk dinner
                     dress, and wrapped in a white fleecy shawl, stood.</p>
                  <p>"Lady Dynely," he said, lifting his hat, "good-evening."</p>
                  <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6444-00000025"/>
                  <p>She had been slowly pacing, as though for an evening constitutional, round and
                     round a great ornamental fishpond. As horse and rider appeared she had paused
                     in some alarm—then, as the unexpected visitor approached, and the bright light
                     of the moon fell on his face, she had uttered a low cry of great surprise and
                     delight, and held out to him both hands.</p>
                  <p>"Gordon!" she cried. "Oh, Gordon! Can it be you?"</p>
                  <p>She was a pretty woman—three-and-twenty, perhaps, with a fair blonde face, a
                     profusion of pale blonde hair, a tall, willowy, fragile figure. The fair face,
                     the pale blue eyes, lit up now with genuine delight.</p>
                  <p>"I, Lady Dynely. You hardly looked for me to-night, did you? And yet, you must
                     have known I would come."</p>
                  <p>Her color rose. She withdrew the hand he held still.</p>
                  <p>"I did not know it. How could I tell? Your mother was here to-day—she said
                     nothing about it. When did you come?"</p>
                  <p>"Two hours ago. And as to-morrow morning, by the first train, I leave again for
                     good, I ran the risk of not finding you at home, and rode over to say good-by.
                     By the way, it's rather a coincidence, but one August night two years ago, you
                     and I shook hands and parted on this very spot. You were dressed in white that
                     night, too, I remember, and looked as you always do look, <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">belle cousine</foreign>, fair and sweet, and pale as a
                     lily."</p>
                  <p>Again her color rose, but the blue, startled eyes fixed themselves on his
                     face.</p>
                  <p>"Say good-by—leave for good!" she repeated. "What is it you mean? Gordon, have
                     you seen your mother?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Lucia, I have seen my mother. I have just come from Caryllynne. I have
                     bidden farewell to it and to my mother forever."</p>
                  <p>She stood looking at him in painful silence—that sensitive rose-pink color
                     coming and going in her cheeks. In the crystal moonlight she could see the
                     great and saddening change in him. She clasped both hands around his arm, and
                     looked up at him with soft, pitiful eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Gordon—cousin," she said, gently, "is it true, this story they tell, that is
                     in the papers, that all London rang with before we left? It must be true, and
                     yet—oh, Gordon! unless you tell me with your own lips I <emph>cannot</emph>
                     believe."</p>
                  <p>"Then I tell you," he moodily answered, "it is true."</p>
                  <p>"That you married an actress—an—oh, Gordon!" she said passionately, "I would
                     rather see you dead!"</p>
                  <p>"You are not alone in that, I fancy," he said, with a drearily reckless laugh.
                     "All the same, I have done it. All the same, too, I have had enough of reproach
                     and bitterness for one night—it is my last, remember—don't you take up the cry
                     against me. Those gentle lips of yours, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ma
                        belle</foreign>, were never made to say cruel things. We have been good
                     friends always—let us so part."</p>
                  <p>She sighed wearily, her hands still loosely clasped his arm, her blue, pitying
                     eyes still fixed on his face. His gloomy gaze was bent on the water-lilies in
                     the pond, whose pale heads he was mercilessly switching off with his riding
                     whip.</p>
                  <p>"I am sorry—I am sorry. But your mother, Gordon, surely she pities you and
                     forgives you. I know how stern and resolute she can be where she thinks her
                     duty is concerned; but you, her only son, whom she loves so dearly—"</p>
                  <p>"She has disinherited and cast me off forever. It is all right, Lucia. I don't
                     deny the justice of my sentence, only you see one looks rather for mercy than
                     for justice from one's mother."</p>
                  <p>"But she does not mean it—she speaks in anger. She will repent and call you
                     back."</p>
                  <p>He smiled—a slow, hard, inexorable smile.</p>
                  <p>"It is a little late for all that. What is done is done. I will never go back.
                     She says truly, I have disgraced the name—the only atonement I can make is to
                     renounce it. She has ordered me from her sight and her home forever—one does
                     not wait to be told that twice."</p>
                  <p>"How could she—how could she!" his cousin murmured, the soft blue eyes filling
                     and brimming over; "you, her only son—all she has left—whom she loved so
                        dearly.<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6444-00000026"/> Oh! how could she do it!
                     Gordon, I, too, have a son, my little Eric, and I love him so devotedly, so
                     entirely, that I feel, I know, no crime he could commit, though it were murder
                     itself, could ever for one second change that love. Do what he might—yes, the
                     very worst man can do, I would still love him and take him to my heart."</p>
                  <p>Her pale face glowed, her pale eyes lit, her voice arose. Her cousin looked at
                     her tenderly.</p>
                  <p>"I can believe that," he said; "but you see, Lucia, there are mothers and
                     mothers—and Viscountess Dynely and Mrs. Caryll are of two very different
                     orders. I never did prefer the Spartan sort myself, ready to run the knife
                     through their nearest and dearest at a moment's notice. Still, I repeat, my
                     sentence has been deserved, and is just."</p>
                  <p>"Gordon, tell me all about it, will you? I know so little, I read the papers,
                     of course, but still—"</p>
                  <p>"Is it worth while, Lucia? It is not a pleasant or profitable story. Do you
                     really care to know?"</p>
                  <p>"Gordon!"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, I know all your affectionate interest in me and my concerns, fairest
                     cousin, and I don't mind boring you with the details of a young fool's folly.
                     Folly! good heaven above! What a fool I was! What a gullible, wooden-headed,
                     imbecile idiot I must have been!"</p>
                  <p>"You—you loved her, Gordon?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, yes, I suppose it was love, that blind and besotted fever her beauty and
                     her witcheries threw me into. She was a sorceress whose accursed spells sent
                     every man she met under sixty straightway out of his senses. Why she threw the
                     rest over for me (she had half the battalion at her feet) was clear enough. I
                     was the youngest, the richest, and the greatest ass in Toronto. She turned
                     scores of other heads, but not to that pitch of idiocy which proffers wedding
                     rings. I had only seen her six times when I asked her to marry me—you may
                     faintly guess the depth and breadth of my imbecility when I tell you that."</p>
                  <p>"She was handsome, Gordon?"</p>
                  <p>"She was more than handsome, Lucia. She had a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">beauté du
                        diable</foreign> whose like I have never seen—that no man could resist—a
                     dark, richly-colored, Southern sort of beauty, of the earth earthy. She was
                     small and slender, with a waist you could snap like a pipe-stem, two large
                     black eyes, like a panther's, precisely, and a smile that sent you straight out
                     of your senses. All the fellows in Toronto raved of her—she was the toast of
                     the mess, the talk of the town. Only the women fought shy of her—they took her
                     gauge by intuition, I suppose. Before she had been a week in Toronto, Major
                     Lovell and his daughter were <emph>the</emph> topic, in ball-room, and boudoir,
                     and barracks."</p>
                  <p>"She was a Miss Lovell?" Lady Dynely asked, in a constrained sort of tone. One
                     hand still rested on his arm, and as they talked they walked slowly round and
                     round the fishpond. In the days that were gone she had been very fond of her
                     dashing boy cousin and playmate—very fond—with sisterly fondness she told
                     herself—nothing more.</p>
                  <p>"You will hear. I had been a year in Toronto before she came, a dull and dreary
                     year enough, with nothing but the daily drill, the parade, the routine of
                     military life, the provincial balls and dinner parties, the provincial
                     flirtations with dark Canadian belles to break the monotony. All at once she
                     came, and everything changed. Major Lovell brought his daughter among us—and it
                     seemed to me my life began. He was a disreputable old duffer enough, this
                     Lovell, a drunkard, a sharper at cards, a rooker at billiards, living on his
                     half-pay and his whole wits. He was a widower, with a daughter out in Bermuda
                     with her mother's friends, who declined to live with her rascally old father.
                     He was in the habit of disappearing and reappearing in Toronto at odd
                     times—this time, after a longer absence than usual, he reappeared with his
                     daughter.</p>
                  <p>"He met me one bleak autumn night lounging aimlessly down one of the principal
                     streets, dressed for a heavy sacrificial dinner party, yawning at the boredom
                     in prospective, wishing all civilian dinner-givers at the deuce, and,
                     willy-nilly, he linked his seedy old arm in mine.</p>
                  <p>"'En route for Rogers', dear boy?' he said, with a grin, 'and looking ennuied
                     to death even at the thought of what is in store for you. Why make a martyr of
                     yourself, Gordon<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6444-00000027"/> don, my lad—why
                     sacrifice yourself on the altar of acquaintanceship? Throw over the bloated
                     timber merchant, come to my lowly wigwam, and let's have a friendly game at
                     ecarte, I'll give you a deviled kidney, and a glass of sherry—you can drop in
                     at Rogers' when the heavy feeding's over. Besides,'—after a pause, this, and
                     with a sideling glance—'I want to show you my little girl—bless her! She's come
                     to keep house for her old dad at last.'</p>
                  <p>"I made some faint resistance—only faint, and yielded. I had a weakness for
                     ecarte; the major was past-master of the game, although he made his lessons
                     rather expensive to youngsters like myself.</p>
                  <p>"'Neville and Dalton and two or three more of Yours are coming,' he said, as he
                     inserted his latch key. 'Rosie will give you a bit of supper by and by, and
                     sing you a song, if you like that sort of thing. Come in, Gordon—come in, my
                     boy, and thrice welcome to the old man's modest mansion.'</p>
                  <p>"And then I was in, out of the cold, dark Canadian night, in a fire-lit,
                     lamp-lit parlor, looking with dazzled eyes down upon the loveliest face, I
                     thought, that firelight or sunlight ever shone on.</p>
                  <p>"She had sprung up at our entrance—she had been crouched in kittenish fashion
                     on the hearth rug, and two big, wonderful eyes, of tawny blackness, were
                     looking up at me. I thought of Balzac's 'Girl with the Golden Eyes'—these were
                     black or yellow, just as the shifting firelight rose or fell. As I stood
                     staring in a stupefied trance of wonder and admiration, the major's fat,
                     unctuous old voice droned in my ear.</p>
                  <p>"'Rosamond, my child—my young friend, Mr. Caryll, of Caryllynne, Devon,
                     England, and Her Majesty's—the Royal Rifles, Toronto, Canada. Gordon, my boy—my
                     little daughter Rosie.'</p>
                  <p>"Then a little brown hand slipped out to me, the dark luminous eyes and the red
                     dimpling lips smiled together.</p>
                  <p>"'I am very pleased to meet Mr. Gordon Caryll of—what's all the rest, papa?
                     Very pleased to meet anybody, I'm sure, in this cold, nasty, dreary
                     Canada.'</p>
                  <p>"'You don't like Canada then, Miss Lovell?' I managed to stammer. 'I am sorry
                     for that. We must try and change your opinion of it before long. What with
                     skating and sleighing, it isn't half a bad place.'</p>
                  <p>"She pouted and laughed like a child. She was singularly childish in form and
                     face, hardly looking sixteen.</p>
                  <p>"'Not half a bad place! Where you grill alive three summer months and shiver to
                     death nine winter ones. Oh, my dear Bermuda! Where the hearts were as warm as
                     the climate, and the faces as sunny as the skies. No fear of being lonely, or
                     miserable, or neglected there. If papa would let me, I would go back
                     to-morrow.'</p>
                  <p>"'But papa won't,' the major put in with a chuckle; 'papa can't spare his one
                     ewe lamb yet. Mr. Caryll here, I am sure, will do his best to make time pass,
                     little one. Hark! I hear a knocking in the south entry—the other fellows at
                     last.'</p>
                  <p>"Then with much laughter, and stamping and noise, three or four military men
                     came clattering in out of the cold and damp darkness, and were presented to 'My
                     daughter, Rosamond.'</p>
                  <p>"I don't know how it was with them; I can answer for myself—from the first
                     moment I looked on Rosamond Lovell's face I lost my head. You know me well
                     enough, Lucia," the speaker broke off with a half laugh, "to know I never do
                     that sort of thing by halves. But this was different from anything that had
                     gone before. I looked on those wonderful dusky eyes only once, and said to
                     myself, 'I will win Rosamond Lovell for my wife, if it be in the power of
                     mortal man to win her.'</p>
                  <p>"I lost no time in setting about my wooing. No wonder the other fellows
                     laughed. They admired old Lovell's daughter, too, no doubt—that was a matter of
                     course—but not to the depth of lunacy. They left that for me. I declined
                     ecarte, I declined deviled kidney, declined the doubtful sherry—I was
                     sufficiently intoxicated already. The peerless Rosamond smiled upon me but
                     shyly; she was not accustomed to such sudden and overpowering devotion—timid
                     angel! Still, she did smile, and let me accompany<pb n="58-59"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000028"/> her to the distant corner where the piano stood,
                     while the other men played for ponies in the distance, and the major with great
                     impartiality fleeced all alike. She played for me on the jingly piano; she sang
                     for me in a rich contralto.</p>
                  <p>"I can see her now as she sat there that first fatal night, in a pink dress,
                     white roses in her belt and in her bosom, the lamplight streaming across her
                     rich, dusk loveliness. Paugh! the smell of white roses will turn me sick all my
                     life.</p>
                  <p>"It was late when we broke up, and Miss Lovell, shrinking pettishly from the
                     other men, held out her hand with a soft good-night to me. I went out from the
                     warm, bright room, into the black, rain-beaten midnight, with head and heart in
                     a whirl. The others, not too pensive over their losses at first, chaffed me
                     clumsily, but the hospitable major had bled them all so freely at ecarte, that
                     their deadly, lively jokes soon lapsed into moody silence. To-morrow evening,
                     they were to go back for their revenge, and the friendly major had asked me
                     too.</p>
                  <p>"'Though you <emph>did</emph> throw us over, Caryll, my boy,' he said in his
                     big debonnaire voice, 'you'll keep little Rosie from moping herself to death.
                     Yes, yes, come to-morrow and fetch her the new songs. She has a passion for
                     music, my little one, and a voice that would make Lind look to her laurels if
                     the poor old dad could afford to cultivate it.'</p>
                  <p>"I tossed feverishly through the dark morning hours. 'Rosamond! Rosamond!' I
                     kept repeating; 'there is music in the very name, music in her voice when she
                     speaks, music celestial in her tones when she sings. And to think that my
                     little white "Rose of the World" should be daughter to such a confounded old
                     cad as that. But I will marry her and take her home to Caryllynne and my
                     mother,' I thought; and I could picture to myself my mother's whole heart going
                     out in love and welcome, to her son's fair young bride. I didn't much fear a
                     rejection—I was constitutionally sanguine, and she had been as kind as heart
                     could desire. Unless—and I grew cold and hot at the mere fancy—unless she had
                     left a lover behind in Bermuda.</p>
                  <p>'At the very earliest possible hour next morning, I made an elaborate toilet
                     and sallied forth for conquest. I purchased an armful of music, and presented
                     myself at Major Lovell's dingy little cottage. The major was out—Miss Rosamond
                     was in—that was what the grimy maid-of-all-work told me. I entered the parlor,
                     and Rosamond was there to meet and welcome me, more fresh, and youthful, and
                     lovely in the broad, bright sunshine, than even under the lamplight last
                     night.</p>
                  <p>"'Oh, what quantities of music! Oh, how kind of me! All the songs she liked
                     best. Oh, how could she ever thank me enough!'</p>
                  <p>"'By letting me come to—to see you every day. By—caring for me a little. By
                     letting me say how happy it will make me to be welcomed here by you.'</p>
                  <p>"Stammering over this speech, blushing and floundering like any other
                     hobbledehoy in the agonies of calf-love, I lifted her hand to my lips, <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">à la</foreign> Sir Charles Grandison, and kissed it.</p>
                  <p>"I can imagine now how she must have been laughing inwardly at the green young
                     fool she had hooked. But private theatricals were in her line, her maidenly
                     confusion and embarrassment were done to the life.</p>
                  <p>"I lingered for hours, while she tried over the songs, and dimly realized two
                     facts: that her knowledge of piano-forte music was but meagre after all, and
                     that she had really very little to say for herself. Only dimly; I was much too
                     far gone to realize anything very clearly, except that she was the loveliest
                     little creature the Canadian sun shone on.</p>
                  <p>"That evening I was back. Again Rosamond and I had our corner, our singing and
                     our <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tête-à-tête;</foreign> again that old wolf, Lovell,
                     fleeced those big innocent military lambs—as a shearer his sheep. That was the
                     story over and over for a week—at the end of that time, I walked up to Major
                     Lovell one forenoon, and demanded the priceless boon of his daughter's hand.
                     The old rascal's start of amazement and consternation was capital.</p>
                  <p>"'His daughter! his Rosie! his little girl! And only a week since we had met!
                     The difference in our positions, too! <emph>What</emph> did I mean!' Here the
                     major inflated himself<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6444-00000029"/> like an enraged
                     turkey-cock, and glared fiercely out of his fiery little eyes. 'Not to insult
                     him, surely! A poor man he might be—alas! was, but always an officer and a
                     gentleman.'</p>
                  <p>"Here he stopped sonorously to blow his nose. 'Very little of a gentleman,' I
                     remember thinking, even then.</p>
                  <p>"'Have I taken a viper into the bosom of my family?' pursued the old humbug,
                     melodramatically. 'You, Mr. Gordon Caryll, sir, are heir to a large estate and
                     fortune—the last of an ancient and distinguished line; it is also true that I
                     am but one remove from a pauper, still—'</p>
                  <p>"'Good Heaven, Lovell!' I cried out, impetuously cutting short this
                     rhodomontade. 'What bosh are you talking? I mean what I say, I mean it more
                     than I ever meant anything in my life. Insult—nonsense! I love your daughter,
                     and I ask you to give her to me for my wife. We have known each other but a
                     week, it is true. What of that? Love is not a plant of slow growth—it can
                     spring up like the gourd of Jonas, fully grown in a night.'</p>
                  <p>"I think I must have read that somewhere. It struck me even at the time as
                     sounding rather absurd, and I looked to see if the major was laughing. No doubt
                     the old villain was, for he had turned away to the window, and was elaborately
                     wiping his eyes.</p>
                  <p>"'And she—my Rosamond,' he said, at length, in a voice husky with emotion and
                     much whiskey-punch—'my little one, who, only a year ago, it seems to me, played
                     with her dolls, and—and marbles, and—er—that sort of thing, can it be that she
                     is indeed a woman, and returns your—er—'pon my life, very flattering
                     passion?'</p>
                  <p>"I smiled exultantly as I recalled a little scene of last night, in that
                     musical nook of ours, the lamp turned low, the music at a stand-still, and 'I
                     mark the king, and play,' 'Your deal, Deverell,' 'Five to one on Innes,' coming
                     from the unromantic ecarte players at the other end—a scene where I, holding
                     Miss Rosamond Lovell's two hands in mine, had poured forth a rhapsodical story
                     of consuming passion. And the hands had not been drawn away, and, as the
                     exquisite face <unclear>dropped</unclear> in the dim light, she had whispered
                     that which had made me the happiest man on earth.</p>
                  <p>"'Yes,' I told the major, 'that was all right; she had consented to be my
                     wife—nothing was needed but his sanction. And I hoped he would agree to the
                     marriage being at once. What need was there of delay? I was of age, and two
                     months over—what need of waiting? I wanted to make sure of my prize.'</p>
                  <p>"It was the most out-and-out case of insanity on record. I was mad—sheer mad. I
                     cannot account for my besotted folly in any other way. The old fox made a feint
                     of not consenting at first. She was too young—our acquaintance was so
                     scandalously short—what would Toronto say? What would my father and mother say?
                     The thing was not to be thought of.</p>
                  <p>"But I would listen to nothing. What did it matter <emph>what</emph> Toronto
                     said? Toronto might go hang! My father and mother had no thought but for my
                     happiness; their ultimate consent was all right. For the rest, if he dreaded
                     the world's tongue, let the marriage be private, just as private as he pleased,
                     and in a month, or two months, or whenever I could get leave of absence, I and
                     my wife would sail for England. When the thing was inevitable, talk would die
                     out. Marry my darling I must; life without her was insupportable, etc., etc.,
                     etc.</p>
                  <p>"I grow sick at heart, Lucia, when I recall that time. And yet I was blindly,
                     insanely happy—with that utter bliss that in the days of our first youth and
                     grossest folly we can only know. We were married. Rosamond had but one female
                     acquaintance, a young lady music-teacher—she, of course, was bridesmaid, and
                     Singleton, of Ours, was best man. We were married in the cottage parlor, one
                     dark autumnal morning, all on the quiet. Clergyman, groomsman, bridesmaid, all
                     promised secrecy. Rosamond remained at the cottage with her father as before. I
                     kept my rooms in the town. I did not write to announce my marriage—time enough
                     for all that, I thought. I would get leave of absence and take Rosamond
                     home—they would have to look in<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6444-00000030"/> her
                     face but once, to forget my rash haste, her poverty and obscurity, and take her
                     to their hearts forever.</p>
                  <p>"But days and weeks and months slipped away—four passed; and leave had not yet
                     been obtained. As might be expected, our secret had leaked out, and was our
                     secret no longer. The story of my mad marriage was whispered throughout the
                     town, and only my blindness was upon me still, I must have seen the looks of
                     pity that met me at every turn—pity blended with amusement and contempt. But I
                     saw nothing, suspected nothing, and when the blow came, it fell like a
                     thunderbolt, indeed.</p>
                  <p>"I have said this girl I had married was a perfect actress—I say it again. Love
                     itself she could counterfeit to the life; she fooled me to the top of my bent;
                     she made me believe her whole heart was mine. Her face lighted when I came,
                     saddened when I went, ay, after four months of matrimony she held her dupe as
                     thoroughly duped as on the first day. Something preyed on her mind,
                        <emph>that</emph>, at least, I saw. She looked at me at times as though she
                     feared me; she looked at the major as though she feared him. The old fellow had
                     taken to drinking harder than ever, had been at death's door with delirium
                     tremens more than once since my marriage, and in his cups (I learned after)
                     babbled of what he had done.</p>
                  <p>"'We hooked him, sir,' the tipsy major would hiccough, winking his bleary old
                     eyes, and tottering on his rickety old legs, 'hooked him like the gonest coon!
                     Oh, Lord! what fools young men are! a pretty girl can twist the biggest of you
                     gallant plungers around her little finger. I've known regiments of fools in my
                     lifetime, but that young ass, Caryll—oh, by Jupiter! <emph>he</emph> puts the
                     topper on the lot.'</p>
                  <p>"It was the major himself who threw up his hand, and showed me the game he had
                     played at last.</p>
                  <p>"He had caught cold after a horrible fit of D. T., and I suppose his devil's
                     race was run—typhoid fever supervened, and the gallant major was going to die.
                     Rosamond, with him still, nursed him faithfully and devotedly, and tried with
                     all her power to keep me from seeing him at all.</p>
                  <p>"'You can do no good, Gordon,' she would plead; 'keep away—don't go in. You may
                     catch the fever. He wants no one but me.'</p>
                  <p>"The bare thought of my entering the sick room seemed a perpetual terror to
                     her. She would have no nurse, she would wait upon him herself, she almost tried
                     by force to keep me from seeing him. Off and on he was delirious; as a rule he
                     had his wits about him though, and would grin like a satyr to the last.</p>
                  <p>"'She's afraid I'll peach, Caryll,' he whispered to me one day, with a wink.
                     'Blessed if I won't, though. <emph>I</emph> never cared about her, and it would
                     be a shame, a cursed shame, to go off hooks, you know, and not tell.'</p>
                  <p>"'Not tell what?' I asked, sternly.</p>
                  <p>"'Never you mind, Gordon, my boy, you'll hear it all fast enough. You ain't
                     half a bad sort, hanged if you are, and I'm sorry—yes, I'm sorry I did it. It
                     was a devilish unhandsome trick for one gentleman to play on another; but it
                     was good fun at the time, that you'll be forced to admit yourself. Hush-h! here
                     she comes, not a word to <emph>her</emph>. I'll tell you all by and by.'</p>
                  <p>"I was bewildered—half startled also; but I set it down to delirium. She came
                     in, looking with quick, apprehensive eyes from his face to mine.</p>
                  <p>"'Has he been talking?' she asked.</p>
                  <p>"'Nothing <emph>you</emph> would care to hear, Rosie, my girl,' he cut in, with
                     a feeble chuckle; 'not a word about you—ask him if you like.'</p>
                  <p>"I set it all down to delirium. 'Whom the gods wish to destroy they first make
                     mad.' My madness had lasted over four months—I was destined to become sane
                     again.</p>
                  <p>"The major sank lower and lower. His last hour was near. Rosamond never left
                     him when she could; she still strove with all her might to keep us apart. I
                     sometimes wonder now she did not hasten his end. She was quite capable of it, I
                     believe.</p>
                  <p>"One night I was to dine in the town. I had left the cottage and nearly reached
                     my destination. It was a stormy February night, the streets white with drifting
                     snow, a sleety wind blowing piercingly cold. Some unaccountable<pb n="64-65"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000031"/> able depression had weighed upon me all day; my
                     wife was strangely changed of late; I could not understand her. The major was
                     very low, almost at his last. What if he died while I was absent, Rosamond and
                     the servant-maid all alone. I turned hastily back; I would share my dear girl's
                     vigil, I thought—nay, I would compel her to go to bed and to sleep; she was
                     utterly worn out, and I would watch alone.</p>
                  <p>"I returned to the house, and entered softly. The maidservant was alone in the
                     sick room. Miss Rosamond had fallen asleep at her post from sheer weariness,
                     and had been persuaded to go to her own room and lie down.</p>
                  <p>"'You did quite right,' I said; 'I will share your watch. I don't think he will
                     last out the night.'</p>
                  <p>"The sick man's eyes opened—a cunning leer in them to the last.</p>
                  <p>"'Don't you, Gordon, my boy—don't you think I'll last out the night? Then, by
                     Jove! it's time to make a clean breast of it. Where's she? Your wife?'</p>
                  <p>"'Up-stairs in her own room, asleep.'</p>
                  <p>"'That's right. When the cat's away the mice can play. Send that woman back to
                     the kitchen—I've a word or two for your private ear.'</p>
                  <p>"I obeyed. The woman went.</p>
                  <p>"'Now lock the door, like a good fellow, and come here. Sit close, for my
                     wind's almost gone, and I can't jaw as I used. And I say! look here, Caryll! no
                     violence, you know. I'm an old man, and I'm dying, and I'm sorry—yes, blessed
                     if I ain't—that I ever fooled you as I did. All the reparation I can make, I
                     will make—that's fair, surely. Now, listen, here, Caryll; this has been a
                     put-up job from first to last. Rosamond's not my daughter!'</p>
                  <p>"'Not your—'</p>
                  <p>"I sat staring at him aghast.</p>
                  <p>"'Not my daughter—no, by George! My daughter, the one in Bermuda, you know, is
                     in Bermuda still, and a deuced hard-featured young woman—takes after her
                     mother, and wouldn't touch her disreputable old dad with a pair of tongs. No,
                     Gordon, lad, the girl you've married isn't my daughter. I don't know who's
                     daughter she is. She doesn't know herself. She's your wife—worse luck; but
                     she's nothing to me.'</p>
                  <p>"I sat stunned, dumb, listening. If my life had depended on it, I could not
                     have spoken a word.</p>
                  <p>"'I'll tell you how it was, Caryll,' the dying old reprobate went on. 'Give us
                     a drop of that catlap in the tumbler first. Thanks. It was in New York I met
                     her first—in New York, just a month before I brought her here. Strolling down
                     the Bowery one night I went into a concert-room, or music-hall, of the lowest
                     sort. Bowery roughs, with their hats on and cigars in their mouths, were lying
                     about the benches yelling for "Rosamond" to come out and give them a song.
                     Presently the wretched orchestra began, the green baize drew up, and, in a
                     gaudy, spangled dress, a banjo in her hand, tawdry flowers in her hair,
                     "Rosamond" came bounding forward, smiling and kissing hands to her vociferous
                     audience. So I saw her for the first time—I swear it, Caryll—the girl you have
                     made your wife!'</p>
                  <p>"'She sang song after song—you can imagine the highly-spiced sort of songs
                     likely to suit such an audience. They applauded her to the echo, stamping,
                     clapping, whistling, yelling with wild laughter and delight, and all the while
                     I sat, and stared, and wondered at her beauty. For tawdry, and painted, and
                     brazen as she was that night, her beauty, in all places and at all times, is a
                     thing beyond dispute. It was then, sitting there and looking at her, that the
                     plot came into my head, put there by <emph>her</emph> guardian angel, the
                     devil, no doubt. This is what it was:</p>
                  <p>"'Take that girl off the stage, clothe her decently, drill her in her part for
                     a week or two—she's a clever little baggage—take her back to Toronto, and pass
                     her off as your daughter. She's got the beauty and grace of a duchess, and
                     there's more than one soft-headed, soft-hearted fool among the fellows there,
                     who will go mad over her black eyes, and be ready to marry her out of hand
                     before she's a month among them. There's that young chap, Caryll, for
                     instance—oh, yes. Gordon, my boy, I pitched upon you<pb n="66-67"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000032"/> even then—he's the heir to one of the finest
                     fortunes in the kingdom, and the last man on earth likely to doubt or
                     investigate. The thing's worth trying. Of course, when the fish is hooked
                        <emph>I</emph> come in for the lion's share. Ecarte's not an unprofitable
                     amusement, but there may be better things in this wicked world even than
                     ecarte.</p>
                  <p>"'It was a brilliant idea—even you must own that. I lost no time in carrying it
                     out. I hunted up Rosamond behind the scenes. Good <choice>

                     </choice>! such scenes! and there and then had a long and fatherly talk with
                     her. She gave me her history frankly enough; she had no parents, no friends to
                     speak of, no relations. She never <emph>had</emph> had a father so far as she
                     knew, and her drunken drab of a mother had died two years before. She was
                     sixteen, and had made her debut a year before, under the friendly auspices of a
                     negro minstrel gentleman, who had taught her to strum the banjo and play upon
                     the piano.</p>
                  <p>"'I said nothing of my plan that night. I slept upon it, and found it rather
                     strengthened than otherwise by that process. I hunted up Mlle. Rosamond (in
                     private life they called her Sally) next morning, in her Bowery attic, and laid
                     my plan before her. Gad, Caryll, how she jumped at it! Her eyes glittered at
                     the mention of the fine dresses and gay jewelry—she had ambition beyond her
                     sphere, had devoured a great deal of unwholesome light literature, and was
                     equal to anything. I found her cleverer even than I had dared to hope—the girl
                     had been more or less educated at a public school, and could actually talk
                     well. The negro minstrel gentleman thrashed her when he got drunk; she was
                     tired of her life and Bohemian associates, to call them by no fouler name, of
                     this dirty Quartier Latin of New York, and eager and ready to go.</p>
                  <p>"'What need to waste words, Caryll—the thing was an accomplished fact in three
                     weeks. The rest you know—"we came, we saw, we conquered," more's the pity—for
                        <emph>you</emph>. The little Bowery actress played her part <foreign
                        xml:lang="ITA">con amore</foreign>—the pretty little yellow-eyed spider wove
                     her web, and the big, foolish fly walked headlong in at first sight. You
                     married her!'</p>
                  <p>"He paused a moment, and motioned me to give him his cordial. The clammy dew of
                     death was upon his face already, his voice was husky and gasping, but he was
                     game to the end and would finish. I held the drink to his lips in a stupid,
                     dazed sort of way, far too stunned to realize what I heard as yet.</p>
                  <p>"'You married her, Gordon,' he went on, 'and—give the devil his due—I believe
                     she's fond of you. That wasn't in the bond, but she is, and her efforts of late
                     days to have me die and "make no sign" were worthy a better cause. But I ain't
                     such an out-and out bad 'un as that, Caryll—'pon my word I ain't; and then,
                     money can't do a man any good when he's going to die. So I've made a clean
                     breast of it, my boy, and you can do as you please. You're awfully spoony on
                     her, I know, and if you like, why, say nothing about it; stick to her through
                     thick and thin. Other men have married girls like Rosie—and she's fond of you,
                     as I say, poor little beggar, and you can take her to England and no one will
                     be the wiser. The fellows here won't peach; they know it, Caryll; the thing's
                     leaked out somehow, and—'</p>
                  <p>"He stopped. I had risen to my feet. I don't know what he saw in my face, but
                     he held up both hands with a shrill cry of horror, not to kill him. The next I
                     remember, I was out in the black, storm-beaten street. It was close upon
                     midnight. At that hour and in that storm there was no one abroad in Toronto. A
                     wheel of fire seemed crashing through my brain, some nameless, awful horror had
                     fallen upon me. In a stupefied way I was conscious of that—of no more. And
                     then—all in an instant it seemed to me the night had passed and the morning had
                     broken: I had spent hours in the freezing streets. With the morning light the
                     mists of my brain seemed to clear, and the full horror of this most horrible
                     thing came upon me—this unheard-of, shameless deed.</p>
                  <p>"The girl I had loved, had trusted, had married, was the vile thing he made her
                     out—the offcast of the New York streets. And the man who had blindly loved her
                     she had fooled and laughed at from first to last! A very<pb n="68-69"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000033"/> demon of fury seemed to enter me then. I turned,
                     and went home—with but one resolve—to have her life, and then end my own.</p>
                  <p>"She was not there. She had seen my first entrance; she had stolen down,
                     listened, and heard all; she had gone back to her room, dressed herself for the
                     street, taken all her money and jewels, and fled. They told me all this—three
                     or four of our fellows were there, and a strange, gloomy hush lay over the
                     house. Major Lovell was dead.</p>
                  <p>"After that, for a week or two, all is chaotic. I did not end my life—I hardly
                     know how I was kept from that last coward's act—the fact remained. They buried
                     Lovell; and in a quiet way, the story of old Lovell's plot, and old Lovell's
                     daughter, was over the town.</p>
                  <p>"I made no attempt to follow her. The first paroxysm of fury passed, a sullen,
                     dull reaction set in. I filed a suit for divorce. A mere separation would not
                     do—every tie must be cut that bound me to her. I wrote home, telling my father
                     and mother all—all—hiding nothing. Then my leave came, and I quitted Toronto
                     forever. Months passed. I lived in hiding in Montreal; then the decree of
                     divorce was granted—I was free!</p>
                  <p>"I was going home. Before quitting Canada to return no more, I went to Quebec
                     to visit my mother's old friend and my godfather, General Forrester. My story
                     had rung through Quebec, of course—was it not ringing over the length and
                     breadth of the land? But the kind old general made no mention of it, and
                     insisted upon my joining them the day of my arrival at mess.</p>
                  <p>"I agreed. I had lived a hermit life for five months—I longed to see familiar
                     faces once more. At the mess dinner, while jokes and stories were being bandied
                     round, some one jovially proposed the health of the 'Sleeping Beauty of the
                     Enchanted Palace,' and it was drunk with laughing enthusiasm. I naturally made
                     inquiry concerning this celebrated lady, and learned, that in the present
                     instance, her mortal name was Mrs. Gordon, a youthful widow of fabulous beauty
                     and wealth, who had come to Quebec five months before, and had shut herself up
                     in a deserted old rookery, to weep in silence, no doubt, over the dear
                     departed. Like a flash the truth came upon me.</p>
                  <p>"'Most thrilling indeed, Ercildoun,' I said; 'here's towards her! Which are we
                     to drink—<foreign xml:lang="FRA">belle</foreign> blonde, or <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">jolie</foreign> brunette?'</p>
                  <p>"'Brunette, brunette! a picture by Titian. Eyes like sloes, and hair like that
                     what's-his-name's wing!' shouted Ercildoun.</p>
                  <p>"The toast was rapturously taken up. I was as hilarious as any of them. There
                     are times when thought <emph>must</emph> be drowned, no matter how.</p>
                  <p>"Next day I deliberately hunted her down. Her servant was pointed out to me on
                     the street; I followed her. And walking up and down by the river side, in the
                     summer sunset, I came full upon the girl who had been my wife.</p>
                  <p>"I believe at first she imagined I had come to kill her. I speedily reassured
                     her. What need, Lucia, to speak of that interview? It was brief, indeed. I have
                     looked my last, I hope, on the woman who was for four months my wife. I
                     hope—and yet, so surely as I stand here, I believe she will cross my path
                     again. She vowed it, as we parted that night, and for good or for evil she is
                     one to keep her word."</p>
                  <p>The story was told rapidly, at times almost incoherently, but told. He stood
                     beside her in the moonlight, with colorless face and eyes full of passionate
                     despair.</p>
                  <p>"The remainder you know," he said, after a pause; "the shame that broke my
                     father's heart and sent him to his grave—that has parted my mother and me
                     forever. For the rest, whatever fate befalls me in the time to come, it is a
                     fate richly earned. I blame my mother in no way. Your son Eric, or General
                     Forrester's baby daughter, will inherit Caryllynne in my stead. So let it be. I
                     go from here to-night, in all likelihood forever. Before the week is out I
                     shall have left England."</p>
                  <p>She had turned her face away from him, but he knew that her tears were
                     falling.</p>
                  <p>"Where do you go?" she asked.</p>
                  <p>"To India. I have exchanged into a regiment ordered<pb n="70-71"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000034"/> out at once. When one's life comes to an end at
                     home, it is well to be of some service abroad. And so, Lucia, my best cousin,
                     you at least will bid me good by and good speed before I go."</p>
                  <p>He took both her hands, looking down into the fair, drooping face.</p>
                  <p>"And you," he went on, "are <emph>you</emph> happy, Lucia? You are pale and
                     frail as a shadow. Tell me, does Dynely—," he paused. She drew her hands from
                     his clasp, her face still turned away.</p>
                  <p>"I made a mercenary marriage," she answered, sudden coldness and hardness in
                     her tone; "that you know. All the happiness such marriages bring, I have. While
                     I possess my boy, my Eric, I can never be utterly miserable, Gordon!" She
                     looked up suddenly, her fair face crimsoning. "You knew Lord Dynely before his
                     marriage—you were with him one autumn in Ireland, were you not? Tell me—" she
                     stopped.</p>
                  <p>"Well, Lucia? What?"</p>
                  <p>"It may be only fancy, but I <emph>have</emph> fancied there is some—some
                     secret connected with that Irish summer. It is seven years ago—you were only a
                     boy at the time. Still—" again she paused confusedly.</p>
                  <p>"Well?"</p>
                  <p>"There was no one, no girl, no peasant girl to whom Lord Dynely paid attention
                     that summer in Galway? I have heard a rumor—" for the third time she broke off,
                     afraid, it seemed, to go on.</p>
                  <p>Her cousin looked at her in some surprise.</p>
                  <p>"You know what Lord Dynely is—was, I mean, in his bachelor days," he said,
                     quietly, "an admirer of every pretty girl he met, whether peeress or peasant.
                     There were many handsome Spanish-looking women to be seen that long ago summer
                     we spent fishing at the Claddagh, on the Galway coast. His lordship admired
                     them all, I am bound to say; I am also bound to say, impartially, so far as I
                     could see. Don't take fancies into your head, Lucia—facts are enough. And now I
                     must go. By Jove! how the time has flown! I have kept you here an
                     unconscionable time in the falling dew. Good-by, Lucia, keep a green place in
                     your memory for the black sheep of the flock. Kiss little Eric for me. Once
                     more, good-by."</p>
                  <p>Holding her hands in his, he bent down and touched her cheek. She broke
                     suddenly into a passionate sob.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Gordon, cousin, it breaks my heart to see you go!"</p>
                  <p>He smiled.</p>
                  <p>"It is best so," he said.</p>
                  <p>He dropped her hands, turned with the words, walked rapidly away, and
                     disappeared.</p>

                  <head type="sub">HOW LORD VISCOUNT DYNELY DIED.</head>
                  <p>HALF an hour had passed away, and still Lady Dynely paced slowly where her
                     cousin had left her, heedless of falling dew, her thin dinner-dress damp and
                     heavy already in the night. In the days that were gone she had been very fond
                     of her boy cousin, three years her junior in actual years, twenty in worldly
                     wisdom and judgment. There had never been any thought of love or love-making,
                     marrying or giving in marriage, between these two; she had given Viscount
                     Dynely her hand of her own free will, and yet, the sharpest, keenest pang of
                     actual jealousy she had ever felt, she had felt when she first heard of Gordon
                     Caryll's marriage. Not a very fierce pang, though, after all—it might have been
                     said of her as of Lady Jane, in the poem: <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"Her pulse is calm, milk-white her skin;</l>
                           <l>She has not blood enough to sin."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q> It had been considered a very brilliant match, <emph>the</emph> match of
                     the season indeed, when Lucia Paget won Alexis, Viscount Dynely and twentieth
                     Baron Camperdown. She had been taken up to London at eighteen, and presented by
                     her kinswoman, the Countess of Haldane. She was tall, slim and white, fair and
                     fragile as a lily, "a penniless lass wi' a lang pedigree"—a trifle insipid to
                     some tastes, but she suited Lord Dynely. He came home from a yachting cruise
                     around Norway and the Hebrides, presented himself suddenly in Vanity Fair, the
                     most desirable prize of the mall, with mansions and estates in four counties, a
                     villa at Ryde, a shooting-box in the Highlands, and an income that flowed in
                     like a perennial golden river. He was a prize that had long been angled for
                     (his noble lordship was in his five-and-fortieth year), maids and matrons had
                     put on their war paint, and set their wigwams in order, long and many a day
                     ago, for him. But in vain; his scalp-lock hung at no belt. He admired all,
                     ballerinas, as a rule, more than baronesses, actresses more than duchesses. But
                     his day came at last; he saw Lucia Paget, by no means the beauty of the season,
                     and after his own impetuous fashion, where his own gratification was concerned,
                     threw up the sponge to Fate at once, and surrendered at discretion. He
                     proposed, was accepted, and the wedding-day named, before Vanity Fair could
                     recover its breath. It was the wonder of the day—that pale, insipid
                     nonentity—that blasé, fastidious, worn-out roué—<emph>What</emph> did he see in
                     her? <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"There were maidens in Scotland more lovely by far,</l>
                           <l>Who would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q> But he had passed them all by, and thrown the handkerchief at the
                     indifferent feet of this pale-haired lass. Before the end of the season they
                     were married.</p>
                  <p>He was very much enamored of his bride, there no was denying that. Fickle, in
                     his fancies, to a proverb, he was yet loyal here. He took her over the
                     Continent for a year, then returned to England, with them "little Eric;" and
                     Lord Viscount Dynely was the fondest of fathers as well as the most devoted of
                     husbands. But from the birth of his son a change came over him. He took a habit
                     of falling into moody, darksome reveries, he dropped mysterious and unpleasant
                     hints of some wrong-doing in the past, he spoke gloomily of his infant heir and
                     some sin, sinned against <emph>him</emph>. Lady Dynely grew pale as she
                     listened—it was no common wrong-doing of a man of the world of which he
                     hinted—it was something that might influence the future of his son, of
                     herself—some crime against them both. He spoke a woman's name in his disturbed,
                     remorse-haunted slumbers—"Maureen"—his wife could catch. What did it mean? She
                     had never loved her husband, she had always been a little afraid of him—she
                     grew more and more afraid of him<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6444-00000036"/> as
                     the years went on. Years did go on. Eric was five; the secret, whatever it
                     might be, was Lord Dynely's secret still. Only once he had said to her:</p>
                  <p>"Lucia, if I die before you, I have something to tell you that you won't like
                     to hear. People always make deathbed confessions, don't they? On the principle,
                     I suppose, that come what may, they are past hurting. I wonder if they sleep
                     any easier in their six feet of clay, for owning up? I'll write it down, and
                     leave it sealed with my will, and then if I'm cut off in a hurry (and it is an
                     interesting trait in the Dynely succession that we always <emph>are</emph> cut
                     off in a hurry), it will come to light all the same. There's one consolation,"
                     he said with a short, reckless laugh, "you never cared over and above for me—it
                     was the title you married and the settlements, and you'll have them, you know,
                     to the end of the chapter, so you won't break your heart."</p>
                  <p>He had whistled to his dogs and walked moodily off, saying no more; and his
                     wife, listening with pale cheeks and dilated eyes, asked no questions. She was
                     not strong, either mentally, morally, or physically; she shrank from pain of
                     all sorts, with almost cowardly fear. If Lord Dynely had wicked secrets, she
                     wanted to hear none of them—she desired no confessions—it was cruel of him to
                     talk of making them. As he had kept his dreadful masculine secrets in life, let
                     him keep them in death.</p>
                  <p>She stood vaguely thinking this where Gordon Caryll had left her, looking like
                     some spirit of the moonlight in her white robes, her light, floating hair, and
                     colorless face. And even while she thought it, the messenger was drawing near
                     to summon her to hear that secret told.</p>
                  <p>The stable clock chiming loudly eleven awoke her from her thoughtful trance.
                     She started. How late it was, how chilly it had grown! She shrank with the
                     first sensation she had felt of cold and damp, and turned to go. But she
                     stopped, for the sylvan silence of the summer night was loudly broken by the
                     ringing clatter of horses' hoofs dashing up the avenue. Was it Gordon coming
                     back? Little things disturbed her—her heart fluttered as she listened. Horse
                     and rider came in view; the man espied her and vaulted off. No, this small,
                     middle-aged man, was not her tall cousin, but Mr. Squills, the village
                     apothecary.</p>
                  <p>"My lady!"</p>
                  <p>He took off his hat and stood bowing before her. In the moonlight my lady could
                     see the frightened look the man's face wore.</p>
                  <p>"What is it?" she asked.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, my lady—I don't want to alarm you, I'm sure—they told me to break it to
                     you, but it's so hard to break things. There's been an accident, my lady. The
                     9.50 express from Plymouth, and don't let me frighten you, my lady—his lordship
                     was in it, and—"</p>
                  <p>She laid her hand over her heart, turning for a moment sick and faint. Then she
                     rallied.</p>
                  <p>"Lord Dynely was on that train? There was an accident, you say. Was he—"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, my lady, prepare yourself. It—it's a dreadful thing to break things
                     to—"</p>
                  <p>"Was Lord Dynely hurt?" she asked.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, my lady, very badly hurt, I'm sorry to say."</p>
                  <p>"Dangerously?"</p>
                  <p>"We're afraid so, my lady. Mr. Glauber is with him, and they've telegraphed to
                     London for Doctor—"</p>
                  <p>"He is alive?" she interrupted, her voice sharp with horror and pain.</p>
                  <p>"Alive, my lady, but—it is best you should know the truth—he won't be alive by
                     morning. The clergyman is with him, but he calls, my lady, continually for
                     you."</p>
                  <p>"Where is he?"</p>
                  <p>"At the inn, in the village—the 'Kiddle-a-wink.' And, my lady, there is not a
                     moment to lose."</p>
                  <p>She turned from him and ran to the house. On the way she met one of the grooms,
                     and ordered the carriage at once. She fled up to her room, threw a dark mantle
                     over her white evening-dress, put on her bonnet with trembling fingers, and
                     turned to depart. A sudden thought came to her—she turned into an adjoining
                     room—the nursery, where her boy lay asleep.</p>
                  <p>The night-light burns low; he lies in his downy, lace-draped<pb n="76-77"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000037"/> draped bed, a lovely baby-vision of health and
                     beauty. Flushed, dimpled, his golden curls falling over the pillow, a smile on
                     the rosy lips—he is a sight to make any mother's heart leap. She stoops and
                     kisses him with passionate love. "Oh, my baby, my angel!" she whispers, "you
                     are all I have on earth. While I live, no harm, that I can avert, will ever
                     come to you."</p>
                  <p>Then she flits out of the room—out of the house. The carriage is waiting, and
                     in a moment more she is rapidly whirling through the still, white midnight to
                     the village inn where her husband lies dying.</p>
                  <p>They lead her to the room. Physician and priest fall back, and give way to the
                     wife. The wounded man lies propped by pillows, his head bandaged, his face
                     awfully bloodless and ghastly in the wan light. She has heard no details of the
                     accident, she has asked none. He is dying—all is said in that.</p>
                  <p>His eyes light as they turn on her, but his brow is frowning.</p>
                  <p>"Send them all away," are his first words.</p>
                  <p>She motions them out of the room. She sinks on her knees by the bedside. Her
                     dark drapery slips off; her white dress, her soft laces, her fair, floating
                     hair, seem strangely to contradict the idea of death. She is trembling from
                     head to foot—her teeth chatter with nervous horror, her eyes fix themselves,
                     all wild and dilated, upon his face. She never speaks a word.</p>
                  <p>He lies and looks at her—a long, steadfast, frowning gaze.</p>
                  <p>"I am dying," he says; "you know it. You never cared for me—no, never—not even
                     in your wedding hour. You never cared for me—why should I care for
                        <emph>you?</emph> Why should I hesitate to tell you the truth?"</p>
                  <p>It has been the thorn in his rose-crowned life—this fact, that the portionless
                     girl he married, never gave him her heart.</p>
                  <p>"Tell me now," he says, still with that dull, frowning gaze, "I was too great a
                     coward ever to ask you before—tell me now—you married the rank and the
                     rent-roll, not the man?"</p>
                  <p>"I did wrong," she says, huskily, "but I have tried to do my duty as your wife.
                     Forgive me, Alexis."</p>
                  <p>"Ah!" he answers bitterly, "we have both something to forgive—it makes us
                     quits. I have been a coward, a coward to you, a coward to <emph>her</emph>. It
                     is hard to say which has been wronged most. But you shall hear the truth now,
                     and you shall do as you see fit after. Draw near."</p>
                  <p>She bends closer above him. He takes her hand in his cold fingers, and
                     whispers, hoarsely and brokenly, his deathbed confession.</p>
                  <p>Half an hour passes, an hour, another, and still from that closed room there is
                     no sound. It is very strange. Mr. Glauber, the doctor, and Mr. Texton, the
                     rector, think uneasily, looking at their watches, outside. It is quite
                     impossible Lord Dynely, in his fast-sinking state, can be talking all this
                     time—impossible, also, that he can have fallen asleep. Presently Mr. Texton
                     takes heart of grace, and taps at the door. There is no reply. He taps again.
                     Still silence. He opens the door and goes in. Lord Dynely has fallen back among
                     his pillows, dead, that frown forever frozen on his face; my lady still kneels
                     by the bedside—as rigid, as upright, as white, as cold, as though turned to
                     stone.</p>
                  <p>"My lady!" She does not speak or stir. "My dear Lady Dynely," the rector says,
                     in an unutterably shocked tone.</p>
                  <p>She moves for the first time, and lifts two sightless eyes to his face. He
                     holds out his arms, for she sways unsteadily, and catches her, as without word
                     or sound she slips heavily back, and faints away.</p>

                  <head type="sub">IN THE ROYAL ACADEMY.</head>
                  <p>THE brilliant noontide of a brilliant May day was passed—all London looked
                     bustling and bright under a sky as cloudless as that of Italy. In Trafalgar
                     Square there was a mighty gathering of carriages, an army of coachmen and
                     footmen in liveries, of all sorts and colors, for it was the opening day of the
                     Royal Academy.</p>
                  <p>The rooms were full—full to repletion, filled with a jostling crowd of
                     well-dressed ladies and gentlemen, but then "a mob is a mob though composed of
                     bishops." Languid, dilettante-looking swells, with eye-glasses; painters with
                     long hair, and picturesque faces; art critics, book and pencil in hand;
                     academicians, receiving congratulations; picture dealers, marking the quarry on
                     which they meant presently to swoop; stately dowagers, sweeping their silken
                     trains over the crimson drugget; slim, young English girls, with milk-and-rose
                     complexions and gilded hair.</p>
                  <p>The clock of St. Martin's-in-the-fields was striking four as there entered two
                     ladies and a gentleman, who moved slowly through the swaying throng, and who,
                     even there, attracted considerable attention. One of the ladies was approaching
                     middle age, a fair, pale, pensive, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">passée</foreign>
                     looking woman, with a stamp of high rank on every faded feature, in every
                     careless gesture. <emph>She</emph> was not the attraction. The escort was a
                     very tall, very broad-shouldered, very powerful-looking looking young man,
                     muscular Christianity personified, with a certain military air, that bespoke
                     his calling, a thick, reddish beard and mustache, reddish, close-cropped hair,
                     and two light, good-humored eyes. <emph>He</emph> was not the attraction. Terry
                     Dennison's face was as well known about town as Landseer's couchant lions
                     around Nelson's pillar, in the square beyond. It was the third of the trio, a
                     girl, tall and slender, and very graceful, with a figure that was rarely
                     perfect, and a way of carrying herself that was altogether imperial. A dark
                     beauty, with a warm, creamy, colorless skin, two vivid, hazel eyes, a profusion
                     of hazel hair, arranged <foreign xml:lang="FRA">à la mode</foreign>, a
                     handsome, decided, square-cut mouth, and a general air of imperious command
                     that said to all <q>

                     with a careless simplicity that was the perfection of high art. An Indian
                     muslin robe, a scarf of black lace, caught up on one shoulder with a knot of
                     yellow roses—on her head a touch of point-lace, with just one yellow rose over
                     the ear, and in her pearl-kidded hand a bunch of the same scented yellow
                     roses.</p>
                  <p>A covey of idle, elegant dandies of the Foreign Office, and guardsmen, lounging
                     in one of the door-ways, put up their glasses and turned to look again, roused
                     for the moment almost to interest.</p>
                  <p>"Something new in Vanity Fair," one said, "and the best thing I've seen this
                     season. Know who she is, any one?"</p>
                  <p>No one knew.</p>
                  <p>"Altogether new, as you say, Danby. Jove! what a regal air! There is nothing on
                     the walls—not a nymph or goddess of them all, with a lovelier face.
                        <emph>Who</emph> is she?"</p>
                  <p>"Her companion is Lady Dynely," remarked a third.</p>
                  <p>"And her escort is Terry Dennison. He has placed them before <emph>the</emph>
                     picture of the year, that thing by Locksley, and has left them. Here he comes.
                     I say, Dennison! who is she?"</p>
                  <p>"Who is who? asked Mr. Dennison, the sandy-haired and whiskered young man,
                     approaching. "'Who is she?' isn't<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6444-00000039"/> that
                     the question the cynical old French party always asked, when any fellow he knew
                     came to grief?"</p>
                  <p>"Don't be analytical, Terry, it isn't your <foreign xml:lang="FRA"

                     out."</p>
                  <p>"That," answered Terry, thoughtfully stroking his beard, "is my Lady Dynely;
                     and where have you kept your eyes all these years not to know it—"</p>
                  <p>"That will do. We don't want chaff. Who is that girl?"</p>
                  <p>"All yellow roses and black lace, like a picture by Titian," another
                     murmured.</p>
                  <p>"Who is she, Terry?" chorus all.</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" said Terry, opening his light blue eyes with an innocent air, "that's
                     what you mean, is it? That girl is France Forrester."</p>
                  <p>"France? Named after the dominion of his Imperial Majesty, Nap the Third?"</p>
                  <p>"Her name is France—Frances, if you like it better," answered calmly Mr.
                     Dennison.</p>
                  <p>"But who is she? <emph>Who</emph> is she, Terry? She's new to all of us, and
                     the handsomest debutante of the season. Open the mysteries a little, old man;
                     and end our agonizing suspense."</p>
                  <p>"There's nothing mysterious about it," responded Terry Dennison with a
                     suppressed yawn; "she is France Forrester, as I say, only child and heiress of
                     the late General Forrester, distant connection of Lady Dynely, and adopted
                     daughter and heiress of Mrs. Caryll, of Caryllynne. 'To her that hath shall be
                     given.' I have spoken!"</p>
                  <p>"Like an oracle. Go on—tell us more."</p>
                  <p>"There's no more. Her mother a French Canadian, from whom mademoiselle inherits
                     her gypsy skin and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">beaux yeux</foreign>, died when she
                     was six. Her father placed her in a Montreal convent, and there she lived until
                     she was fifteen. Then <emph>he</emph> died, left her a fortune, and made Mrs.
                     Caryll her. guardian. That was three years ago; and if your limited knowledge
                     of arithmetic will permit you to add three to fifteen you will come at Miss
                     Forrester's age. Mrs. Caryll, then and at present in Rome, had her ward
                     conveyed to the Eternal City. Until two months ago she moved and had her being
                     there—now she has come over, to come out under the auspices of Lady Dynely. I
                     wish you fellows wouldn't make me talk so much," says Terry, with a sudden
                     sense of injury, "the thermometer is high, and I ain't used to it."</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. Dennison strolls away, and the four men from the F. O. stand and gaze
                     with languid interest at the Canadian-Roman beauty and heiress.</p>
                  <p>"Safe to make a hit," one said; "haven't seen anything so thoroughbred for
                     three seasons. What with mademoiselle's beauty and grace, and <emph>that</emph>
                     poise of the head, and two fortunes tacked to her train, and her twenty
                     quarterings (they're an awfully old family, the Forresters), she ought to make
                     a brilliant match before the season ends."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! I don't know," another responded, "it doesn't always follow. The favorite
                     doesn't always win the Derby. Mrs. Caryll's heiress—him-m! I say, Castlemain!
                     You ought to know—wasn't there a son in that family once?"</p>
                  <p>"Gordon Caryll—very fine fellow—knew him at Oxford," Castlemain answered,
                     "commission in the Rifles—old story that—sixteen years ago—all over and
                     forgotten for centuries."</p>
                  <p>"Dead?"</p>
                  <p>"Don't know—all the same—extinct. Made a horrible mesalliance out there in
                     Canada—scandal—divorce—exchanged—went to India—never heard of more. <foreign
                        xml:lang="LAT">Sic transit</foreign>—fate of all of us by and by. Deuced
                     slow this," struggling with a yawn; "I say—let's hook it."</p>
                  <p>The quartette move on, others take their place, and the men, one and all, turn
                     for a second look at the fair, proud-looking beauty. With Lady Dynely, she
                     still stands where Mr. Dennison has left them, gazing at the picture that has
                     made the hit of the year. It is by an artist unknown to fame and Trafalgar
                     Square—it is marked in the catalogue "No. 556—<title>How The Night
                     Fell</title>."</p>
                  <p>It is not an English scene. Tall, dark hills in the background lift
                     pine-crowned heads to the sky, clumps of cedar, and tamarac, and spruce,
                     painted with pre-Raphaelite fidelity, dot these dark hill-sides. A broad river,
                     with the last red<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6444-00000040"/> light of dying day
                     glinting along the water, and over hill-side and tree-top and flowing river,
                     the gray darkness of coming night shutting down. On the river-side two figures
                     stand, a man and a woman. One red gleam from the western sky falls full upon
                     the woman's face, a face darkly beautiful, but all white and drawn with woman's
                     utmost woe. Passionate despair looks out of her wild eyes at the man who stands
                     before her. Her hands are outstretched in agonized appeal. For the man, he
                     stands and looks at her, one hand slightly upraised as if waving her off. His
                     face is partly averted, but you can guess the hatred that face shows. You see
                     that her doom is sealed beyond redemption. Over all, the creeping night is
                     darkening land, and river, and sky.</p>
                  <p>The two ladies gaze in silence for a time—Lady Dynely looking weary and rather
                     bored—Miss Forrester's fine eyes bright with admiration. She is new to general
                     society as yet, and when eye, or ear, or heart are delighted, the expressive
                     face shows it.</p>
                  <p>"It is beautiful," she says in a low voice; "there is nothing like it in the
                     rooms. Look at that wonderful effect of light on the woman's face, and slanting
                     along the river, and the gray darkness that you can almost <emph>feel</emph>
                     there beyond. Those trees are tamarac—can it be a Canadian scene. 'How The
                     Night Fell,'" she reads from her catalogue. "Lady Dynely, I must know the
                     painter of that picture."</p>
                  <p>"My dear France!"</p>
                  <p>"'G. Locksley.' H-m-m—a new candidate, probably. Certainly I must know him. In
                     Rome, we—Mrs. Caryll and I—made a point of taking up every young artist who
                     appeared. She was known as the patroness of art. Our rooms on our art-reception
                     nights used to be crowded. The man who painted that is a genius."</p>
                  <p>"Mrs. Caryll was the patroness of struggling artists for this reason, I
                     fancy—her son was a devotee of art once himself, and studied for a year in Rome
                     before entering the army."</p>
                  <p>"Her son," Miss Forrester repeated dreamily, "Gordon Caryll. Perhaps so, she
                     very seldom spoke of him, poor fellow. What a very striking scene it is!"
                     looking again at the picture through her closed hand; "there is a fascination
                     for me in the anguish and despair of that woman's face. A beautiful face, too.
                     I wonder if the artist painted his picture from life?"</p>
                  <p>"My dear France, no. They are all imaginary, are they not—suggested by books,
                     or something of that kind?"</p>
                  <p>"Ah, I don't know. Artists, and poets, and novelists, all turn their sorrows to
                     account in these latter days," says Miss Forrester cynically; "they paint their
                     woes in oil and water colors, write them in hexameters, and make money of them.
                     Like Lord Byron, if they weep in private, they certainly wipe their eyes on the
                     public."</p>
                  <p>"My dear child," says Lady Dynely, looking shocked, "where have you learned
                     your cynicisms so young?"</p>
                  <p>Miss Forrester laughed.</p>
                  <p>"I am but a debutante," she answered gayly, "not come out yet before the
                     foot-lights; but I have seen a deal of life, I assure you, behind the scenes.
                     Here comes Terry." She glances over her shoulder. "If the artist of 'How the
                     Night Fell,' be present, Terry shall fetch him up and introduce him."</p>
                  <p>"But, France—"</p>
                  <p>Miss Forrester laughs again—a very sweet, low laugh. She is unlike most English
                     girls—in fact, she is <emph>not</emph> an English girl. She has her French
                     mother's blood and vivacity, as well as her dark complexion, and dark eyes,
                     with something of the frank-spirited independence of an American girl. With
                     these and her late Roman experiences, she is a bundle of contradictions, and a
                     bewilderingly charming whole.</p>
                  <p>"But, Lady Dynely," she repeats, "I warned you fairly in Rome what you might
                     expect when you consented to become a martyr, and bring me out. I have had my
                     own way ever since I was born, and always mean to—if I can. I have lived in a
                     perpetual atmosphere of artists for the past three years—the long-haired
                     Brotherhood of the Brush have been 'the playmates of my youth—the friends of my
                     bosom.'" Here, catching sight of Lady Dynely's horrified face, Miss Forrester
                     breaks off and laughs again, the sweetest, frankest, merriest laugh, that ever
                     came from rosy lips.</p>
                  <p>"What's the joke?" asks Mr. Dennison, sauntering up;<pb n="84-85"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000041"/> "I don't see anything in that black, glowering
                     man, and that woman of the woful countenance to excite your ill-timed
                     merriment, Miss Forrester."</p>
                  <p>"Terry," says Miss Forrester, "do you know the artist?"</p>
                  <p>"Miss Forrester, it is the proud boast of my life that I know every one.
                     Locksley? Yes, I know him—he's in the rooms now, by the same token. Look
                     yonder—talking to Sir Hugh Lankraik, the great academician—very tall, very fair
                     man. Crops his hair, and doesn't look like an artist—more of the heavy-dragoon
                     cut than anything else. See him?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," the young lady answered. She saw, as Terry Dennison said, a very tall,
                     very fair man, with blonde hair and beard, a complexion fair once, tanned to
                     golden brown, two grave, gray eyes, and a thoughtful, rather worn, face—a man
                     looking every day of his seven-and-thirty years. Not a particularly handsome
                     face, perhaps, but a face most women liked. Whether Miss Forrester liked it or
                     not, who was to tell?</p>
                  <p>"Not bad looking?" commented Terry interrogatively. Mr. Dennison belonged to
                     that large <foreign xml:lang="LAT">nil admirari</foreign> class to whom the
                     acme of all praise of mortal beauty is "not bad looking."</p>
                  <p>"Women admire him, I believe," pursues Dennison, "but he rather cuts the sex. I
                     give you my word, he might be the pet of the petticoats all this season after
                     that picture, but he won't. Lives for his art—capital fellow, you know, but
                     doesn't care for women."</p>
                  <p>"Interesting misogynist! Bring him up here, Terry, and introduce him."</p>
                  <p>"France!"</p>
                  <p>"Is your hearing deficient, Mr. Dennison? I said, bring him up here and
                     introduce him."</p>
                  <p>"Now, France, what has that poor fellow ever done to you? He cuts the fair sex,
                     and is a happy and successful man! Do let him be. I know the havoc you made
                     among those painting fellows in Rome, but you can't expect to do in London as
                     the Romans do. She made it a point—I give you my word, Lady Dynely—of breaking
                     the heart of every young artist in the Eternal City, and now she wants to add
                     poor Locksley, as harmless a fellow as ever breathed, to her 'noble army of
                     martyrs!'"</p>
                  <p>"Little Terry Dennison! will you hold your tongue and fetch Mr. Locksley
                     here?"</p>
                  <p>Miss Forrester lifts her gold-mounted eye-glass and looks at him. Miss
                     Forrester's brilliant, hazel eyes are not, in the slightest degree,
                     short-sighted; she merely wears this eye-glass as a warrior his sword. When she
                     particularly wishes to annihilate any one, she lifts it, stares speechlessly
                     for five seconds, and the deed is done. Mr. Dennison knows the gesture of old,
                     and shows the white-feather at once.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Locksley's picture pleases me. I wish to know Mr. Locksley."</p>
                  <p>"Yes'm, please'm," says Terry, meekly; "hanything else?"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Locksley has ceased talking to Sir Hugh. Lady Dynely admires 'How The
                     Night Fell,' and does him the honor of permitting him to be presented. You
                     understand, little Terry?"</p>
                  <p>Terry Dennison, from the altitude of his six feet, looks down upon his dashing
                     little superior officer, with a comical light in his blue eyes, laughs under
                     his orange beard, and turns to obey.</p>
                  <p>"As the queen wills," he says; "but, alas! poor Yorick! He never did me any
                     harm—Locksley, I mean, not Yorick. It is rather hard <emph>I</emph> should be
                     chosen, as the enemy to lead him to his doom." He makes his way to where the
                     painter of the popular picture stands, and taps him on the shoulder. "If you
                     are not done to death with congratulations already, Mr. Locksley, permit me to
                     add mine. There is nothing else on the walls half-a-quarter so good. Lady
                     Dynely is positively entranced, has been standing there for the last half hour.
                     Will you do her the pleasure of coming and being presented?"</p>
                  <p>"Lady Dynely!" The artist paused for a moment with an irresolute look, and
                     glanced doubtfully to where her lady ship stood.</p>
                  <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6444-00000042"/>
                  <p>"My dear fellow," Terry cut in in some alarm, "don't refuse. I know you give
                     'em all the cold shoulder, but you will really be conferring a favor in this
                     instance. She—Lady Dynely I mean of course—is quite wild on the subject of art
                     and artists. Never heard her so exercised as on the subject of that picture of
                     yours."</p>
                  <p>"Lady Dynely does me too much honor," said the artist smiling gravely, and
                     Dennison linked his arm in his own, and bore him off in triumph.</p>
                  <p>"Lady Dynely, permit me—the artist whose picture you so greatly admire, Mr.
                     Locksley. Mr. Locksley—Miss Forrester."</p>
                  <p>Both ladies bowed graciously. Lady Dynely addressed him.</p>
                  <p>"It is the gem of the collection—but Mr. Locksley must be weary of hearing
                     that," she said.</p>
                  <p>"An artist never wearies of such pleasant flattery," Mr. Locksley smilingly
                     answered; "and whether false or true, the flattery is equally sweet."</p>
                  <p>"And like all sweets unwholesome," said Miss Forrester with her frank laugh,
                     "so we will spare you. But it is wonderful—wonderful—that woman's face. Where
                     did you find your model, Mr. Locksley?"</p>
                  <p>"The face—the whole picture—is painted from memory," was his answer, very
                     gravely made.</p>
                  <p>The moment he had spoken first, Lady Dynely had turned, and looked him full in
                     the face. What was there in his voice and face so oddly familiar? That face,
                     bronzed and bearded, was not like any face she knew, yet still—. He stood
                     talking to France Forrester, while she thoughtfully gazed, striving in vain to
                     place him.</p>
                  <p>"How goes the enemy?" Terry cried, pulling out his watch; "ten minutes of five.
                     Lady Dynely, there was talk of a Keswick flower show—"</p>
                  <p>"And we are overdue—we must go instantly, France. Mr. Locksley, let me
                     congratulate you once more on your success—I am sure it is but the forerunner
                     of even greater things. I have some examples of the old Italian school, which I
                     shall be very happy to show you, if you care to see them. I am at home every
                     Thursday evening to receive my friends." She gave him her card, and took Mr.
                     Dennison's arm. Miss Forrester murmured some last, gracious words, bowed with
                     easy grace, and moved away with her friends.</p>
                  <p>"How your ladyship stared," was her remark, as they entered the barouche and
                     were whirled away; "have you ever met this Mr. Locksley before?"</p>
                  <p>"I have never met Mr. Locksley before, I am quite sure," her ladyship answered;
                     "it is not a face to be easily forgotten. It is a striking face."</p>
                  <p>"A very striking face," Miss Forrester agrees decidedly. "He reminds you of
                     some one, possibly?"</p>
                  <p>She hesitates a moment—then answers:</p>
                  <p>"Of one who must have died, in exile, years ago. When he spoke first, it was
                     the very voice of Gordon Caryll."</p>

                  <head type="sub">TERRY.</head>
                  <p>AT the window of one of her private rooms, Lucia, Lady Dynely, sits in deep and
                     painful thought. The fair, smooth brow is knit, the delicate lips are
                     compressed, an anxious worried light is in her pale-blue eyes. It is Thursday
                     evening; she is dressed early for her reception, and in her flowing silks and
                     soft, rich laces, looks a very fair patrician picture. But the slender, ringed
                     hands are closely locked, as in physical pain; mentally or bodily, you can see,
                     she suffers as she sits here.</p>
                  <p>The twilight of the May day is closing—a soft primrose light fills the western
                     sky—a faint young moon lifts its slender sickle and pearly light over the
                     Belgravian chimney-pots—a few stars cluster in the blue. A silvery haze hangs
                     over the streets—the "pea-soup" atmosphere of dingy London is softly clear for
                     once, and the gloomy grandeur of these West End stuccoed palaces is tenderly
                     toned down. The room in which Lady Dynely sits is her sleeping room, an
                     apartment as beautiful and elegant as wealth and taste can make a room. About
                     it, however, there is this noticeable—there is but one picture. That picture is
                     a portrait, painted <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en buste</foreign>—it is as though
                     that portrait were held so dear no other picture must be its companion. It is a
                     portrait of Eric Alexis Albert, Lord Viscount Dynely, and twenty-first Baron
                     Camperdown.</p>
                  <p>You pause involuntarily and look at his pictured face; it is one that at any
                     time or in any place must strike the most casual observer, if only for its
                     beauty. Either the artist has most grossly flattered his subject, or Eric,
                     Viscount Dynely, is an uncommonly handsome man. The face is beautiful—with the
                     beauty of a woman—its great drawback that very womanliness. The curling hair is
                     golden, the eyes sapphire blue to their deepest depths, the features faultless,
                     the smiling mouth sweet and <emph>weak</emph> as a girl's. There in its nook of
                     honor this portrait hangs by night and day in Lady Dynely's room, the last
                     object her eyes look on at night, the first that greets them when they open to
                     the new day. He is her idol—it is not too much to say that—her hope—the very
                     life of her life. At present he is abroad, has been for over a year, and is
                     expected home now daily. His majority comes in August, and it is to be
                     celebrated down at Dynely with feasting and rejoicing, with the slaying of huge
                     bullocks, and the broaching of mighty vats of ale.</p>
                  <p>But to night in the misty May gloaming it is not altogether of her darling and
                     her idol my lady sits thinking. Surely all thoughts of him should be bright and
                     pleasant—is not his majority at hand—is he not to marry her pet, France
                     Forrester, and live happy ever after? But the thoughts she thinks as she muses
                     here are neither pleasant nor bright.</p>
                  <p>All her life long, Lady Dynely has been a weak woman, timid and vacillating,
                     good, gentle, charitable, but wanting "back bone." Her son inherits that want.
                     You may see it in his smiling, painted face. Her mind drifts about irresolutely
                     now. She thinks, first of all, of the grave, bearded artist, met yesterday in
                     the Royal Academy.</p>
                  <p>How like these deep grave eyes to other eyes, passed forever out of her
                     world—how like and yet how unlike. How like the voice—deeper, graver in its
                     timbre, and still the same. Even a slight trick of manner, characteristic of
                     Gordon Caryll, in shaking impatiently back his fair hair, this artist had. It
                     was odd, it was almost painful, this passing likeness, and yet it made her well
                     disposed toward this Mr. Locksley, made her absolutely anxious lest he should
                     fail to put in an appearance at her reception to-night.</p>
                  <p>Gordon Caryll! all at once as she sits here, that long ago moonlight night is
                     before her again. She sees the huge fish-pond, a sheet of silver light at their
                     feet; she sees his tall figure casting its long shadow on the velvet sward,
                     sees herself<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6444-00000044"/> self, pale and shivering,
                     clinging to his arm, as she listens to that sombre story of man's reckless
                     passion and woman's shameful deceit. Again his hands clasp her own, again his
                     farewell sounds in her ears.</p>
                  <p>"I will take nothing—not even my name. I leave it behind with all the rest when
                     I sail for India next week."</p>
                  <p>He had gone; and far away under the burning Indian sky, six feet of ground held
                     perhaps what had once been the cousin she loved.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, poor Gordon!" she sighs, and then for a while her train of thought breaks,
                     and there is a blank.</p>
                  <p>It is taken up again; that same night and her husband's death-bed is before
                     her. The dimly-lighted chamber of the inn, the man wounded unto death, and she
                     kneeling beside him, listening to his dying words. Dying words so dreadful to
                     hear, that, in the soft warmth of her room now, she shivers from head to foot
                     as she recalls them. That terrible night has stamped its impress upon all her
                     after life.</p>
                  <p>Slowly and wearily her mind goes over all that came after. The solemn and
                     stately funeral, the sad droning service, the bare bowed heads of the mourners,
                     and she herself in her widow's weeds, white and shuddering, but weeping not at
                     all, her little azure-eyed golden-haired boy by her side. He is dressed in
                     black velvet. but not a shred of crape, and people wonder a little at this
                     strange neglect. His mother would have it so—almost passionately she had torn
                     off the band and shoulder-knot of crape they had placed upon the baby viscount,
                     and had caught him to her breast, crying wildly:</p>
                  <p>"Oh, my Eric! my baby! my baby!"</p>
                  <p>They buried the dead lord of Dynely Abbey—laid him beneath the chancel of
                     Roxhaven Church, where scores of dead-and-gone Dynelys lay. There was a tablet
                     of wonderful beauty and cost erected above him, with a long inscription,
                     setting forth his virtues as a man, a magistrate, a husband, a father. "And his
                     works do follow him," said the glowing record. Was it in bitter satire they had
                     added <emph>that</emph>, she wondered, or was it ominously prophetic?</p>
                  <p>All was over, and then into Lady Dynely's life came a weary gap—a blank of
                     months. Months when she sat alone in the grand, luxurious, lonely rooms, white
                     and still, never crying, never complaining, borne down by the weight of some
                     great and hidden trouble. Her health failed under it. By spring she was the
                     veriest shadow, and the family physician shook his professional head, and
                     ordered immediate change; Italy, the south of France, a milder climate,
                     cheerful society, change, etc., etc. She refused at first peremptorily, then
                     all in a moment changed her mind, left little Eric in charge of his governess
                     and the housekeeper, and started upon her travels. Not to Italy or France,
                     though; but, to the intense disgust of her maid, to Ireland. Ireland, of all
                     places in the world, and to the wildest of all wild Ireland—Galway.</p>
                  <p>She had some object in view—Hortense, the maid, could see that; some object
                     that lent a glow to her pallid cheeks, a light to her dim eyes, an energy to
                     her listless movements, that marvellously astonished that handmaiden. In the
                        <foreign xml:lang="GAI">claddagh</foreign> on the Galway coast her Irish
                     journey came to an end.</p>
                  <p>She left her maid behind her the day of her arrival in the town, and went on
                     alone to this wild village of Galway fishermen. She made her way to the cabin
                     of one Mickey Gannon, and came among them, in their squalor and their poverty,
                     almost as a visitant from another world. Her apology for entering came to hand
                     readily enough.</p>
                  <p>"It had begun to rain"—her seal jacket was drenched; "might she seek shelter
                     here for a few minutes, until the storm abated? She was a tourist exploring the
                     west." That was her faltered excuse.</p>
                  <p>They gave her the best seat and the cordial welcome for which the Irish heart
                     is famous, and which bursts out even in their national motto, <foreign
                        xml:lang="GAI">Cead mille failthe</foreign>. They gave her the place by the
                     fire, and drew back in respectful silence to gaze at the pale, fair English
                     lady.</p>
                  <p>There seemed to be a dozen children, more or less, swarming about the cabin.
                     With keen anxiety in her eyes, Lady Dynely looked from face to face, and
                     finally her gaze lighted and lingered on one. It was a little-lad of seven,
                     rather more of a tatterdemalion, if possible, than even the<pb n="92-93"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000045"/> rest, with a shaggy crop of red, unkempt hair,
                     and two big blue eyes, round with wonder as midnight moons.</p>
                  <p>"Are all these children yours?" she asked the matron of the house; but that
                     lady shook her head; she could not speak a word of the Sassanach tongue.</p>
                  <p>"But, sure Biddy can spake the English illegant," suggested the father of the
                     family; and Biddy was summoned—a strapping lass with rose-red cheeks, gray
                     eyes, jet-black hair, and a musical brogue—a very siren of western Ireland.
                     Biddy came, made a bashful courtesy to the quality, and stood waiting to be
                     questioned. My lady repeated her query.</p>
                  <p>"Are all these your brothers and sisters, my good girl?" with a smile; "so many
                     of them there are."</p>
                  <p>"All but one, yer ladyship—the red-headed gossoon beyant in the corner. He's me
                     sisther's chile," responded bashful Biddy.</p>
                  <p>"Oh—you have a married sister then?" Lady Dynely said.</p>
                  <p>"Not now, yer ladyship—sure she's dead, God be good to her, an' it's poor
                     Terry's an orphan this many a day."</p>
                  <p>"An orphan?" her ladyship repeated, still gazing very earnestly at Terry, who,
                     quite overcome with bashfulness, put one grimy finger in his mouth and turned a
                     very dirty little face to the wall. "It is rather hard upon your father, having
                     to provide for his grandchildren, isn't it? Is—" Lady Dynely paused, and over
                     her pale face there flushed a crimson light,—"is the lad's father dead?"</p>
                  <p>Biddy shook her head, and her blue, handsome eyes flashed angrily.</p>
                  <p>"I don't know, yer ladyship, an', savin' yer presence, I don't care. Oh! but it
                     was the misfortinit day for this house whin that black-hearted villain iver set
                     fut in it!"</p>
                  <p>"Did he—" again she faltered—"surely he did not deceive your sister?"</p>
                  <p>Biddy looked at her, and drew her fine figure—a figure that had been left, like
                     Nora Crena's, to "shrink or swell as Heaven pleases"—to its full height.</p>
                  <p>"Desave her, is it? He was her husband, if that's what yer ladyship manes,
                     married by Father O'Gorman, himself, in the parish chapel beyant. Oh, faith! he
                     knew betther than to come palaverin' here widout the ring. He was an
                     Englishman—bad cess to him wheriver he is—kem here for the fishin' one summer,
                     an' met Maureen on a summer evenin', comin' home from a fair. Oh, wirra! that
                     he iver laid eyes on her! sure from that day he was at her heels like her very
                     shadda."</p>
                  <p>"Was she handsome, this sister of yours?" Lady Dynely asked, with curious
                     interest in this lowly romance.</p>
                  <p>"The purtiest girl in Galway, an' that's a big word. Och! but wasn't he afther
                     her hot fut, mornin's, noon, an' night, an' niver a day's pace wud he give her,
                     till she said the word, an' they wint up to Father O'Gorman, an' were
                     married."</p>
                  <p>"And then?"</p>
                  <p>"An' thin he tuk her away wid him, an' for a year or more we seen nor heerd
                     nothin' av aither av thim. Sure poor Maureen cud naither read nor write. An'
                     thin all at wance she kem back one fine mornin' wid Terry there, a weeny baby
                     in her arrums, an' from that day to this we niver seen hilt nor hair av her
                     fine English husband. The curse o' the crows an him this day!"</p>
                  <p>"He deserted her?"</p>
                  <p>"Sure he did. What else cud ye expect, a fine illegant gentleman like that, as
                     bould as brass an' as rich as a lord, an' herself wid nothin' at all but two
                     blue eyes an' a purty face."</p>
                  <p>"A lord, did you say?" Lady Dynely repeated. "Surely he was not—"</p>
                  <p>"I don't know what he was," said Biddy, shortly; "no more did Maureen. He
                     called himself Dennison, an' was married by that name. But, maybe it
                     wasn't—sure the divil himself cudn't be up to the desate av him. Och! Father
                     O'Gorman warned her, but she wudn't be warned. An' that day six months, afther
                     she kem back, she died here wid Terry in her arrums, an' a prayer for
                        <emph>him</emph>, the villain av the world, on her lips."</p>
                  <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6444-00000046"/>
                  <p>"And the child remains here since? A fine boy, too. Come here, Terry—here's a
                     shilling for you."</p>
                  <p>But Terry, altogether aghast at such a proposal, shrank away into his corner
                     and glued his grimy countenance to the wall.</p>
                  <p>"Arrah! Come here, Terry, come here, avic, an' spake to the lady," said Biddy,
                     in persuasive accents. Then, as the dulcet tones produced no effect, she
                     whipped him up bodily with one strong, round arm, and bore him over to be
                     inspected.</p>
                  <p>"Sure, thin, he's dirtier than a little baste," said Biddy, with considerable
                     truth. "It's himself does be rowlin' undher the bed wid the pig from mornin'
                     till night."</p>
                  <p>Lady Dynley smiled in spite of herself. Terry's face was really picturesque,
                     frescoed so to speak, with dirt. She held out a handful of loose silver, which
                     Terry grabbed with ravenous eagerness.</p>
                  <p>"Would you part with the child?" she asked, after a pause, and Biddy regarded
                     her with silent wonder. "I may as well acknowledge it," her ladyship went on,
                     her delicate face crimsoning painfully. "I once knew this—this child's father.
                     He has spoken of him to me, recommended him to my care. Hush!" she said
                     authoritatively as she saw Biddy about to flame forth; "not a word. He is dead.
                     In the grave let his sins rest with him. Suffice it to say, I will take this
                     boy and do better by him than you can ever do. In fact—so far as I may,"—she
                     paused, and grew very white—"so far as I may," she repeated, steadfastly, "I
                     will atone for his father's wrong. If you decline to let him go—well and good—I
                     shall trouble you no more. If you consent, you shall be amply repaid for all
                     the trouble and expense of the past. I will take him, educate him, and treat
                     him in all respects as my own—yes, as my own son. Now, tell your parents, and
                     bring me word this evening. Go to the inn in the village and ask for Lady
                     Dynely."</p>
                  <p>She arose and left the cabin. The rain had ceased, and with the look of one who
                     had done a hard and humiliating duty, Lady Dynely went back.</p>
                  <p>That evening Biddy came. Her ladyship was very good, and they would humbly
                     accept her offer. It had been a hard season in the Claddagh—only for that they
                     would never have let Terry go. There was but one stipulation—Terry must be
                     brought up in the faith of his mother.</p>
                  <p>Next day Lady Dynely started on her return journey, with Terry washed and
                     clothed, and looking a new little being, in her train. She went to Dublin, and
                     there for good and all dismissed the maid who had accompanied her. All clew to
                     Terry's antecedents must be lost. In the Irish capital she engaged another who
                     would act as nurse to Master Terence, and maid to herself for the present, and
                     pursued her journey to England.</p>
                  <p>She went to Lincolnshire, and there left her charge. It was her native place,
                     and the Vicar of Starling was an old friend. With the vicar and his family the
                     lad was placed. The vicarage lay down in the dreary fen country, with flat,
                     dank marshes all about it—the flat sea, lying gray and gloomy beyond the sandy
                     coast. He was a poor man, rich only in many daughters, and Lady Dynely's
                     proposal that they should bring up Terry was gladly accepted. Her account of
                     him was brief. He was Terence Dennison, the orphan son of a distant cousin of
                     her late husband. An Irish cousin—a very distant cousin—still a cousin, and as
                     such, with a claim upon Lord Dynely's widow. He was poor and utterly alone in
                     the world. Would Mr. Higgins take him as one of his family, let him grow up
                     among them, educate him and accept in return—</p>
                  <p>The offer was munificent in Mr. Higgins' eyes—the bargain was closed there and
                     then, and little Terry Dennison's life began anew.</p>
                  <p>He could not tell these good people much about his early life—he was a slow
                     child, but they could easily see he had been brought up among the very poor.
                     Until he was fifteen he remained at the vicarage—then he went to Eton with
                     little Eric, Lord Dynely, and the two lads got acquainted. That Christmas for
                     the first time he spent the vacation at Dynely Abbey, and thenceforth
                     alternately passed his holidays at the vicarage and the Abbey. It would be hard
                     to say which the boy liked best. At the vicarage, Mr. and<pb n="96-97"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000047"/> Mrs. Higgins had been as father and mother to
                     him, and there was little Crystal, his baby sweetheart, the prettiest fairy in
                     all Lincolnshire. But at the old ancestral Abbey dwelt the angel of his life,
                     Lady Dynely. It was wonderful—it was pathetic, the admiring love and veneration
                     Terry Dennison had for this lady. Of all women she was the most beautiful, of
                     all women the best. He could now realize all she had done for him, and it
                     filled his slow soul with wonder, the greatness of her goodness. From the
                     depths of poverty and misery she had descended like an angel of light to rescue
                     him.</p>
                  <p>All that she did for her own son she did for him; he had even more pocket money
                     than Eric. This Christmas she gave him a gold watch, the next a pony—she loaded
                     him with costly presents and kindly words always. Costly presents and kindly
                     words, but never once—no, not once, one caress. Instinctively she shrank from
                     this boy she had adopted with a look absolutely of repulsion—absolutely of
                     terror at times. This Terry did not notice. I have said he was slow, but his
                     heart yearned vaguely sometimes for just one touch of her white, slim hand on
                     his shaggy, tawny head—for just one of the kisses she lavished on her son. He
                     envied Eric—thrice happy Eric—not his beauty, not his title, not his wealth;
                     ah, no! but one of these motherly embraces showered on him like rain. Eric
                     shook her off, impatient, boy-like, of kisses and fondling, and then Lady
                     Dynely would see Terry's round, Celtic eyes lifted wistfully to her face with
                     the longing, pathetic patience you see in the eyes of a dog. This love, little
                     short of worship, grew with his growth—to him she was the perfection of all
                     that was purest, fairest, sweetest, noblest, among women. He never put in
                     words—most likely he could not—one half the veneration with which she inspired
                     him. And partly for her sake and partly for his own, for the gallant and golden
                     beauty that charmed all hearts, he loved Eric, as once upon a time Jonathan
                     loved splendid young David—"With a love surpassing that of women."</p>
                  <p>Terry grew to manhood, went up to Oxford, reached his majority, and then his
                     benefactress bestowed upon him the crown of his life, the desire of his heart,
                     a commission in a crack regiment. He could have cast himself at her feet and
                     kissed the hem of her garment, so grateful was he, but he only turned very red
                     indeed, and looked foolish and awkward, after the fashion of your big-hearted
                     men when they feel most, and stammered incoherently two or three stupid phrases
                     of thanks.</p>
                  <p>"No, don't thank me, please," Lady Dynely said hurriedly. "I can't do too much
                     for you, Terry. You—you are a relative of my late husband's, you know. In doing
                     this I am only doing my duty."</p>
                  <p>"Only her duty." Ah, she made him feel that, feel it ever. Always duty, never
                     love.</p>
                  <p>"Five hundred a year has been settled upon you, also," her ladyship went on;
                     "this, in addition to your pay, will probably suffice for you. Your habits are
                     not expensive, Terry," with a smile; "not like Eric's for instance, who spends
                     more in a month for bouquets and kid gloves than you do in a year. But if it
                     should <emph>not</emph> suffice, never hesitate to draw upon me freely, and at
                     all times. My purse is open to you as to my own son."</p>
                  <p>"Madame, your goodness overpowers me," is all poor Terry can answer, and there
                     is a choking sensation in his throat, and tears, actual tears, in the boy's
                     foolish blue eyes.</p>
                  <p>She sits and looks at him as he stands before her, big, broad-shoulders,
                     sunburned, healthy, not in the least handsome, not in the least graceful or
                     refined, with the grace and refinement that is her darling Eric's birthright,
                     but a gentleman from head to foot. She takes his hand and looks at him with
                     wistful eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Terry," she says, "I have done my best for you, have I not? I have tried—yes,
                     Heaven knows I have—to make you happy! And you are happy, are you not?"</p>
                  <p>Happy! he—Terry! A curiously sentimental question, surely, to ask this big
                     dragoon, with his hearty face and muscular six feet of manhood. It strikes
                     Terry in that light, and he laughs.</p>
                  <p>"Happy!" he repeats. "The happiest and luckiest fellow in England. Haven't a
                     wish unsatisfied—give you my honor, wouldn't change places with a duke. Happy!
                        by<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6444-00000048"/> Jove, you know I should think
                     so, with a commission and five hundred a year, and the pot I made on Derby,
                        and—er—<emph>your</emph> regard, you know, my lady. Because," says honest
                     Terry, turning very red again and floundering after the fashion of his kind in
                     the quagmire of his feelings, "your regard is worth more to me than the whole
                     world beside. I ain't the sort of a fellow to speak out—er—um—what I feel, but
                     by Jove! I <emph>do</emph> feel you know, and I'm awfully grateful and all that
                     sort of thing, you know. And," says Terry, with a great burst, "I'd lay down my
                     life for you willingly any day!"</p>
                  <p>And then he pulls himself up, and shifts uneasily from one foot to the other,
                     and looks and feels thoroughly ashamed of himself for what he has said.</p>
                  <p>"I know that, Terry," her ladyship answers, more touched than she cares to
                     show. "I believe it, indeed. You are of the sort who will go to death itself
                     for their friends. The motto of our house suits you—'<foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >Loyal au mort</foreign>.' One day I may call upon that loyalty, not for
                     myself but for Eric. One day, Terry, I may remind you of your own words, and
                     call upon you to redeem them."</p>
                  <p>"When that day comes, my lady," he answers, quietly, "you will find me
                     ready."</p>
                  <p>"Yes," she went on, not heeding him, "one day I may call upon you to make a
                     sacrifice, a great sacrifice, for Eric and for me. One day I shall tell you—"
                     She paused abruptly, and looked at him, and clasped her hands. "Oh, Terry! be a
                     friend, a brother to my boy! He is not like you—he is reckless, extravagant,
                     easily led, self-willed, wild. He will go wrong—I fear it—I fear it—and you
                     must be his protector whenever you can. Let nothing he ever does, nothing he
                     ever says to you, tempt you to anger against him—tempt you to desert him.
                     Promise me that!"</p>
                  <p>He knelt down before her, and with the grace a Chevalier Bayard might have
                     envied, the grace that comes from a true heart, lifted her hand to his
                     lips.</p>
                  <p>"Nothing that Eric can ever do, can ever say, will tempt me to anger—that I
                     swear. For his sake, and for yours, I will do all man can do. You have been the
                     good angel of my life. I would be less than man if I ever forgot your
                     goodness."</p>
                  <p>She drew her hands suddenly from his clasp, and bowed her face upon them.</p>
                  <p>"The good angel of your life!" she repeated, brokenly. "Oh! you don't know—you
                     don't know!" Then as suddenly, she lifted her face, took Terry's between her
                     two hands, and, for the first time in her life, kissed him.</p>
                  <p>He bowed his head as to a benediction; and a compact was sealed that not death
                     itself could break.</p>
                  <milestone n="* * * * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>With a start Lady Dynely awakes from her dream. The soft darkness of the spring
                     night has fallen over the great city; its million gas-lights gleam through the
                     gray gloom; carriages are rolling up to the door, and Terry Dennison goes down
                     the passage outside, whistling an Irish jig. She rises. As she does so, her
                     eyes fall upon her son's picture. The light of a street lamp falls full upon
                     it, and lights it up in its smiling beauty.</p>
                  <p>"My darling!" she whispers, passionately, "my treasure! what will you say to
                     your mother on the day when you learn the truth? It is due to you, and ah! dear
                     Heaven! it is due to <emph>him</emph>. Poor Terry! poor, foolish, generous
                     Terry!—who holds me little lower than the angels—who loves me as you, my
                     heart's dearest, never will—what will he think of me when he learns the
                     truth?"</p>

                  <head type="sub">MADAME FELICIA.</head>
                  <p>A WAY beyond the stately and stuccoed palaces of Belgravia, beyond the noise
                     and bustle of the city, the fashion and gayety of the West End, Mr. Locksley,
                     the artist, stands watching the afternoon sun drop out of sight beyond the
                     green lanes, and quaint, pretty gardens of old Brompton. His lodgings are here
                     in a quiet, gray cottage, all overgrown with sweetbrier, climbing roses, and
                     honeysuckle. It is here he has painted the picture that is to be his
                     stepping-stone to fame and fortune, "How the Night Fell."</p>
                  <p>He stands leaning with folded arms upon the low wicket-gate, among the lilac
                     trees and rose-bushes in the old-fashioned, sweet-smelling, neglected garden,
                     smoking a little black meerschaum, his friend and solace for the past sixteen
                     years. Profound stillness reigns. In the west the sunset sky is all rose and
                     gold light; above him, pale primrose, eastward, opal gray. A thrush sings, its
                     sweet pathetic song in an elm-tree near, and artist eye and ear and soul drink
                     in all the tender hush and loveliness of the May eventide—unconsciously,
                     though, for his thoughts are far afield.</p>
                  <p>Two years have passed since this man's return to England from foreign lands,
                     and during these two years he has looked forward to one thing, half in hope,
                     half in dread, half in longing. That thing has come to pass. It is yesterday's
                     rencounter with Lucia, Lady Dynely. She is of his kin, and he has yearned to
                     look once more upon a kindred face, to hear once more a familiar voice—yearned
                     yet dreaded it too; for recognition is the one thing he most wishes to avoid.
                     The past is dead and buried, and he with it. The world that knew him once,
                     knows him no more. It is a past of shame and pain, of sorrow and disgrace. It
                     is all over and done with—buried in oblivion with the name he then bore. In
                     that world few things are remembered long; a nine days' wonder; then the waters
                     close over the drowning wretch's head, and all is at an end.</p>
                  <p>In the park, lying back listless and elegant in her silks and laces, he has
                     seen Lady Dynely often during the past season; face to face never before. He
                     stands thinking dreamily of yesterday's meeting, as he leans across the gate
                     and smokes, and of his invitation of to-night.</p>
                  <p>"She did not know me," he thinks; "and yet I could see it, something familiar
                     struck her, too. Sixteen years of exile—twelve of hard campaigning in India and
                     America—would change most men out of all knowledge. They think me dead
                     beside—so I have been told. Well, better so; and yet, dead in life—it is not a
                     pleasant thought."</p>
                  <p>The blue, perfumy smoke curls up in the evening air; the thrush pipes its
                     pensive lay. He pauses in his train of thought to listen and watch, with artist
                     eye for coloring, the gorgeous masses of painted cloud in the western sky.</p>
                  <p>"This Terry Dennison," he muses again, "who can <emph>he</emph> be, and how
                     came Lucia to adopt him? It was not her way to take odd philanthropic whims. A
                     distant connection of the late viscount's—humph! That is easily enough
                     believed, since he resembles sufficiently the late viscount, red hair and all,
                     to be his own son. His own son!" Mr. Locksley pauses suddenly; "his own son!
                     Well, why not?"</p>
                  <p>There is no answer to this. The serenade of the thrush grows fainter, the rosy
                     after-glow is fading out in pale blue gray, the moon shows its crystal crescent
                     over the elm-tree. His pipe goes out, and he puts it in his pocket.</p>
                  <p>"France Forrester, too," he says to himself; "the baby daughter of my old
                     Canadian friend, the general, grown to womanhood—Mrs. Caryll's adopted daughter
                     and heiress, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vice</foreign> Gordon Caryll, cashiered.
                     They will marry her to Eric Dynely, I suppose, and unite Caryllynne and the
                     Abbey. A handsome girl and a spirited—too good, by all odds, for that dandified
                     young Apollo, as I saw him last at Naples. A girl with brains in that handsome,
                     uplifted head, and a will of her<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6444-00000050"/>
                     own, or that square-cut mouth and resolute little chin belie her character.
                     Still, I suppose, a young fellow as faultlessly good-looking as Lord Eric needs
                     no additional virtues, and your women with brains are mostly the greatest fools
                     in matters matrimonial."</p>
                  <p>With which cynical wind-up Mr. Locksley pulls out his watch and glances at the
                     hour. Eight. If he means to attend my lady's "At Home" it is time to get into
                     regulation costume and start.</p>
                  <p>"I shall be an idiot for my pains," he growls, "running the chance of
                     recognition, and only invited as the newest lion in the Bohemian menagerie. And
                     yet it <emph>is</emph> pleasant to look in Lucia's familiar face once more—to
                     make one again in that half-forgotten world. Besides"—he adds this rather
                     irrelevantly as he starts up—"Miss Forrester interests me. What a face that
                     would be to paint!"</p>
                  <p>He turns to enter the house—then stops. A phaeton with two black, fiery-eyed
                     steeds, whirls up to where he stands, the reins are flung to the groom, and a
                     gentleman springs down, lifts his hat and accosts him.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Locksley!"</p>
                  <p>He is a small, elderly, yellow man, shrivelled and foreign-looking, with
                     glittering, beady-black eyes. Beneath the light summer overcoat he wears the
                     artist catches sight of a foreign order on the breast. He speaks the name, too,
                     with a marked accent, as he stands, and bows and smiles.</p>
                  <p>"My name is Locksley," the artist replies.</p>
                  <p>The small, yellow man hands him his card. "Prince Cæsare Di Venturini," Mr.
                     Locksley reads, and recognizes his interlocutor immediately. The prince is
                     perfectly familiar to him by sight, though for the moment he had been unable to
                     place him. He is a Neapolitan, the scion of an impoverished princely house, and
                     a political exile.</p>
                  <p>"At your excellency's service," Mr. Locksley says, looking up inquiringly; "in
                     what way can I have the pleasure of serving you?"</p>
                  <p>"That picture, 'How the Night Fell,' is yours, monsieur?"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Locksley bows.</p>
                  <p>"It is not sold?"</p>
                  <p>"It is not."</p>
                  <p>"It is for sale?"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Locksley bows again.</p>
                  <p>"It is not yet disposed of. Good! Then, monsieur, a lady friend of mine desires
                     to do herself the pleasure of becoming its purchaser, and I am commissioned as
                     her agent to treat with the artist. Its price?"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Locksley names the price, and inquires, rather surprised at the suddenness
                     and rapidity of this business transaction, if the Prince Di Venturini will not
                     come in.</p>
                  <p>"No, no—it is but the matter of a moment—he will not detain Mr. Locksley." He
                     produces a blank check and pen there and then, scrawls for a second upon it,
                     then with a low bow, a smile that shows a row of glittering teeth, passes it
                     across the little gate. The next instant he has leaped lightly into the
                     phaeton, and the fiery-eyed, coal-black horses, that look as though they had
                     but lately left the Plutonian stables, dash away through the dewy darkness.
                     Mr.Locksley stands with his breath nearly taken from him by the bewildering
                     swiftness of this unexpected barter, and looks at the check in his hand. It is
                     for the amount named—the signature is his excellency's own, but he had said the
                     picture was for a lady.</p>
                  <p>"Who can she be, I wonder?" thinks the artist, pocketing the check and going
                     into the house; "a personage of rank, or—stay! this popular danseuse from over
                     the water, whose name rings the changes through London, and whose beauty and
                     whose dancing are the talk of the town. The Prince is known to be the most
                     devoted of her devotees—some men lay heavy odds he'll marry her. I must drop
                     in, by the by, some night at the Bijou, and look at her. So, my picture is sold
                     at my own price. Lady Dynely's fashionable doors are thrown open to me—surely a
                     turn in fortune's wheel, this."</p>
                  <p>He laughs slightly. He is the possessor of more money this evening than he has
                     owned any time the past sixteen years. In the days that are gone he has known
                     poverty in<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6444-00000051"/> its bitterest shape, the
                     bitter poverty of a man born to the purple and fallen from his high estate.</p>
                  <p>He divested himself of his picturesque, paint-stained, velvet blouse, and got
                     himself into a dress-coat and tie. All the while he kept wondering vaguely who
                     had purchased his picture. "If by any chance the Prince is present at Lady
                     Dynely's, I will inquire," he thought, as he pocketed his latch-key and left
                     the house; "I really should like to know."</p>
                  <p>He really would, no doubt. Interested as he was in this unknown lady, he would
                     have been more interested probably had he been present in the academy that
                     afternoon.</p>
                  <p>The rooms, as usual, were filled; as usual, too, the centre of attraction was
                     "How the Night Fell." Very shortly after the doors were thrown open there had
                     entered a lady and gentleman—whose entrance created a sensation, and who
                     divided the interest with the pet picture of the year. The gentleman was the
                     Neapolitan Prince, the lady the most popular danseuse in London, Madame
                     Felicia.</p>
                  <p>She came moving slowly through the throng, seeing and enjoying the sensation
                     she created, a plump, rather petite beauty, her dark face lit by two wonderful
                     eyes, long, sleepy, yellow-black. She was of a beauty, in a dark way, simply
                     perfect, and she was dressed in the perfection of taste. A silver-gray silk,
                     with here and there vivid dashes of scarlet and touches of rare old lace, the
                     masterpiece of a masculine mantua maker of the Rue de la Paix. Every eye turned
                     to gaze after this lionne of Coulisses, the most perfect dancer they said that
                     ever bounded before the footlights since the days of Taglioni. The Prince hung
                     devotedly upon her lightest word, but she turned impatiently away from him,
                     glancing with a scornful little air of disdain along the walls.</p>
                  <p>"Always the same," she said, pettishly; "simpering women, glowering women,
                     wax-doll misses with yellow hair and china-blue eyes, insipid as their own
                     nursery bread and butter. Bah! why does one take the trouble to come at
                     all?"</p>
                  <p>"Will madame condescend to look at that?"</p>
                  <p>He led her before <emph>the</emph> picture—the group surrounding it fell back a
                     little. She lifted her eyes, bored, disdainful, then—a sudden stillness came
                     over her from head to foot. All languor, all ennui, fled from her face, its
                     rich coloring faded—she grew ashen gray to the very lips. So for the space of
                     fully five minutes she stood.</p>
                  <p>"How does madame find it?" the suave voice of the Italian asked.</p>
                  <p>She neither moved nor answered. She never took her eyes from the picture.
                     Slowly life and color returned to her face, slowly into the great topaz eyes,
                     sleepy and half-closed like a panther's, there came a vivid light. One small
                     gloved hand crushed her catalogue unconsciously—as if fascinated she stood
                     there and gazed.</p>
                  <p>"Thou art pleased with the picture then, madame?" Di Venturini said, softly, in
                     French.</p>
                  <p>"Pleased with it?" she repeated, a slow, curious smile dawning on her lips.
                     "Prince, I must have that picture!"</p>
                  <p>"But, if it is already sold? True, the star is not affixed, but—"</p>
                  <p>"I must have that picture!" madame repeated, with a flash of the black eyes;
                     "sold or not, I still must have it. How do they call the artist?" She looked at
                     the catalogue. "'G. Locksley.' The name is new—is it not, Prince?"</p>
                  <p>"Altogether new, madame. If you really wish it, I will discover this M.
                     Locksley and purchase the picture if still in the market."</p>
                  <p>"I do wish it, Monsieur Prince. That picture I must have though it cost half a
                     fortune. 'How the Night Fell!'"</p>
                  <p>She turned back to it, and looked and looked as though she could never look
                     enough.</p>
                  <p>"It is an odd fancy," said Prince Di Venturini, after a pause; "an absurd one,
                     you may think, madame, but the face of that woman in the picture is very like
                        <emph>yours</emph>. Not one half so lovely, but very like, nevertheless.
                     Does madame perceive it?"</p>
                  <p>"Does madame not?" madame responded, that slow, sleepy smile still on her lips.
                     "Who could fail? And yet, mon Prince, you cannot fancy me with
                        <emph>that</emph> expression, can<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6444-00000052"/>
                     you? He is leaving her—is it not? and her heart is breaking. Bah! it is like
                     the egotism of men, they-desert us and we die—or so they think! Prince, that
                     picture must be mine before I sleep. You hear?"</p>
                  <p>"And live but to obey!" with a most profound bow; "the picture shall be
                     yours!"</p>
                  <p>He escorted her to her carriage.</p>
                  <p>At sunset across the gate of the Brompton cottage the bargain was struck, and
                     "How the Night Fell" became the property of Madame Felicia, the actress.</p>

                  <head type="sub">LADY DYNELY'S THURSDAY.</head>
                  <p>BRILLIANTLY lit, brilliantly filled, Lady Dynely's elegant rooms were a study
                     of color in themselves for a painter when Mr. Locksley arrived. He was rather
                     late—dancing was going on, as he made his way to his hostess' side to pay his
                     respects.</p>
                  <p>In his ceremonial costume, the artist looked something more than well, and that
                     military air of his was more conspicuous than ever. <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"You may break, you may shatter the vase if you will,</l>
                           <l>But the scent of the roses will hang round it still,"</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q> quotes Miss France Forrester to Mr. Terence Dennison. "I would know the
                     stalk of a trooper (and have seen it more than once) under the cowl of a monk.
                     Your Mr. Locksley, Terry, is the most distinguished-looking man in the
                     rooms."</p>
                  <p>"I never said he was my Mr. Locksley. So you find the painter as attractive as
                     the painting, France, and you will be good to him, and smile upon him, and turn
                     his head, for the space of a week. The last victim was the popular new poet,
                     the Cheapside tailor's son. Ah! poor Locksley!"</p>
                  <p>"Terry," Miss Forrester says severely, "small boys should never attempt the
                     sarcastic—you least of all—for some years to come. I am interested in aspiring
                     geniuses—as a soldier's daughter, in all soldiers. Where did you say Mr.
                     Locksley had served?"</p>
                  <p>"India and America. Indian mutiny, and American civil war, with great
                     distinction in both. A professional free-lance, and, I have heard, brave as a
                     lion."</p>
                  <p>"He looks it," France said, dreamily. "He has the true <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >air noble</foreign>. Surely that man is well born, or else the<pb
                        n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6444-00000053"/> old adage, that blood tells, is
                     false. And Lady Dynely says he resembles Gordon Caryll."</p>
                  <p>"Never saw Gordon Caryll," Terry sleepily responds. "Heard of him though. Went
                     to perdition for a woman, didn't he? A common case enough. And you take him to
                     your heart of hearts for that resemblance, don't you, Miss Forrester? I know
                     you have set up this Gordon Caryll as a sort of demi-god, my hero-worshipping
                     young lady."</p>
                  <p>She smiled, then sighed. She was looking brilliantly handsome to-night in pink
                     silk, pink roses in her brown hair, caught back by gleaming diamonds. She had a
                     love for bright colors and rich gems, and looked with contempt on the white
                     tulle and pale pearls of her young lady friends.</p>
                  <p>"What clergyman was it said once when he introduced operatic airs into his
                     choir, that it was a pity the devil should have <emph>all</emph> the good
                     tunes. On the same principle, I say it is a pity your married women should
                     monopolize the brightest colors and richest jewels. The English Miss has been
                     trampled upon long enough—let me be the heroine to inaugurate a new era."</p>
                  <p>This is what Miss Forrester had said to Lady Dynely, this very evening, when
                     slightly remonstrated with on the subject of her magnificence. The vivid
                     colors, the vivid gems, the roses and laces, suited her dusk, warm loveliness,
                     and she knew it.</p>
                  <p>Terry had been her companion for the past hour. The Canadian heiress had a very
                     affectionate regard for Mr. Dennison, and made no secret of it.</p>
                  <p>"I am awfully fond of Terry," she was wont to say; "the best fellow alive and
                     the greatest simpleton ever created."</p>
                  <p>"She treats me like a small boy of ten, at home for the holidays," Mr. Dennison
                     would supplement with a groan.</p>
                  <p>They both pause for a moment while they discuss Mr. Locksley, and look at him.
                     Many others look, too. "How the Night Fell" has made a sensation; they feel a
                     languid interest in the painter.</p>
                  <p>"France," Mr. Dennison says, after that pause, "I have an idea."</p>
                  <p>"Have you, Terry? Cherish it then, my dear boy, for you are never likely to
                     have another."</p>
                  <p>"Madame," Terry responds, "your sex protects you! Here is my idea. What if that
                     fellow should be the long-lost heir of Caryllynne, returned to the halls of his
                     fathers, and all that sort of thing, once more, to cut you out of a fortune. It
                     would be uncommonly like a thing on the stage, now wouldn't it?"</p>
                  <p>"Certainly like a thing on the stage," Miss Forrester disdainfully replies;
                     "therefore very unlike anything in real life. Ah, no! that would be too good to
                     be true. Gordon Caryll, poor fellow, is dead. The likeness Lady Dynely sees, if
                     indeed she sees any, is but a coincidence. See, she is beckoning—let us go
                     over."</p>
                  <p>They cross the room. Miss Forrester, with a frank smile of welcome, and looking
                     very bright and lovely, gives the artist a most gracious greeting.</p>
                  <p>"I saw you were not dancing, France, and want you to do the honors of my
                     picture gallery. You could not have a better cicerone, Mr. Locksley. France has
                     lived as she says in an atmosphere of paintings all her life."</p>
                  <p>"And familiarity breeds contempt," murmurs Mr. Dennison.</p>
                  <p>"Only in the case of stupid dragoons," retorts Miss Forrester. "How often have
                     I tried to impress upon you, Terry, that sarcasm isn't your forte. I shall have
                     much pleasure in displaying our art treasures to your critical eyes, Mr.
                     Locksley. I always feel <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en rapport</foreign>
                     immediately with artists—they were the staple of my acquaintance in Rome. It is
                     the hot-bed of genius. You have studied there, I can see."</p>
                  <p>"For three years, Miss Forrester. And," he smiles as he says it, and Miss
                     Forrester marvels to see how that smile lights up his dark, grave face—"I have
                     seen <emph>you</emph> there many times."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed! But you must, of course; I spent half my life sketching in the
                     galleries. The very happiest days of my life were spent in Rome."</p>
                  <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6444-00000054"/>
                  <p>He looks down upon the dusk lovely face with gravely admiring eyes.</p>
                  <p>"But so little of your life has come," that gaze says to her, "you have not yet
                     begun to live."</p>
                  <p>"There is one thing about Rome which must strike the most casual observer,"
                     says Dennison, suddenly, seized with a second idea, "and that is, the
                     lamentable dearth of Roman noses! They were snubs, give you my word, when I was
                     there, one half. My own," says Terry, glancing complacently at an opposite
                     mirror, "was the noblest Roman of 'em all!"</p>
                  <p>Miss Forrester giving the prominent feature Terry admired a rebuking tap with
                     her fan, led the way into an anteroom, hung with crimson velvet, emblazoned
                     with the arms and motto of the Dynelys:</p>
                  <p>"Loyal au mort."</p>
                  <p>He glances at these emblazoned splendors as he passes, and follows his fair
                     leader into a long gallery, hung from floor to ceiling with pictures.</p>
                  <p>"Lady Dynely is a lover of art, and her collection is very fine. Here is a face
                     by Titian, one of the gems of the room."</p>
                  <p>"Doesn't look unlike you, France—'pon my word it doesn't—the eyes, the hair,
                     and the yellowish complexion—well, it isn't yellow, but you know what I mean.
                     One of his wives, isn't it? These old masters always had three or four, hadn't
                     they—one buried, 'tother come on. You ought to marry a man of genius, France;
                     you would make a capital wife for one, wouldn't you? a sort of moral spur in
                     his side, urging him on to perpetual efforts. If he were in Parliament you
                     would have him a premier, if he were an artist you would have him a Michael
                     Angelo, if musical, a Beethoven, eh? wouldn't you?"</p>
                  <p>"I have seen geniuses," Miss Forrester makes answer, "I have also seen their
                     wives. And, my dear Terry, the wife of a man of genius is a social martyr, who
                     carries the cross while her husband wears the crown."</p>
                  <p>"And <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vice versâ</foreign>," says Terry; "or, stay—is it
                        <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vice versâ?</foreign> The husband of a woman of
                     genius is a—"</p>
                  <p>"There are no women of genius," answers France, with a little sarcastic shrug.
                     "You monopolize all that. Women never write books, or paint pictures, or carve
                     statues. George Eliot, Rosa Bonheur, Miss Hosmer, etc., all are myths. Genius
                     is the prerogative of our lord and master—Man."</p>
                  <p>"You infringe on your master's prerogative then," says Mr. Locksley, smiling.
                     "How very cynical you are pleased to be, Miss Forrester."</p>
                  <p>"I have always thought it a thousand pities France wasn't born in New York,"
                     cuts in Mr. Dennison. "She could mount the rostrum, as they all seem to do
                     there, and spout until the welkin rang on the subject of down-trodden woman and
                     her natural enemy and tyrant—Man. She is fearfully and wonderfully
                     strong-minded, is Miss France Forrester. And now if you can possibly survive
                     half an hour without me, France, I'll tear myself from your side. I am engaged
                     for the next waltz, and I hear the opening bars afar off."</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. Dennison saunters leisurely away, and Miss Forrester and Mr. Locksley
                     are alone among the pictures. They linger long, criticising, admiring, talking
                     of Rome, of art and artists, and the picturesque, poetic life there. "I think I
                     was born to be a Bohemian," she says, with her frank laugh, "and have somehow
                     missed my destiny. It is such a free, bright, untrammelled sort of life, ever
                     new and full of variety. Here it seems to be over and over the same tiresome,
                     treadmill round. I haven't wearied of it yet in spite of my scepticism, the
                     bloom is not yet brushed off my peach, but I know that day will come. Mr.
                     Locksley," changing tone and subject, abruptly, "is your picture sold?"</p>
                  <p>"Sold two hours before I came here," he answers, and tells her of the hurried
                     transaction over the garden gate.</p>
                  <p>"The Prince Di Venturini," she repeats; "and for a lady. Who can she be? The
                     prince is here to-night—I shall ask him. I am sorry it is sold. Lady Dynely
                     wishes very much to add it to her collection. The face of that woman has
                     haunted me ever since."</p>
                  <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6444-00000055"/>
                  <p>His bronzed face pales a little, a troubled look comes into his eyes. She sees
                     it, and her girlish curiosity deepens. She cannot understand her interest in
                     this man, her interest in that picture, but both are there.</p>
                  <p>"Is she still alive?" she asks, carelessly—"your model?"</p>
                  <p>"Miss Forrester, I painted that picture from memory, as I think I have told
                     you."</p>
                  <p>"Then, your model was in your mind. But you have not answered my question. Is
                     the owner of that wonderful face still alive?"</p>
                  <p>"I beg your pardon. I believe not—I hope not."</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Locksley!"</p>
                  <p>"I hope not," he repeats, moodily. "A wicked wish, is it not, Miss Forrester?
                     But such women as that are better out of the world than in it."</p>
                  <p>"How very beautiful she must have been," France says, dreamily; "even with that
                     tortured look you give her, she is beautiful still."</p>
                  <p>"She was. The most beautiful woman I ever saw."</p>
                  <p>It is not a flattering answer, but France Forrester is not offended. A little
                     out of the line of demure young ladyhood, she certainly might be frank and
                     outspoken at times to a startling degree, but honest as a child and vain not at
                     all.</p>
                  <p>"I wonder if you are her judge and accuser in that picture?" she thinks, and
                     looks up at him. "I wonder in what way that woman ever wronged
                        <emph>you?</emph>"</p>
                  <p>He catches her glance and understands it. A smile breaks up the dark gravity of
                     his face as he looks down at her.</p>
                  <p>"You honor my poor painting too much, Miss Forrester, by your interest," he
                     says; "for the story it tells—that is over and done with many a long year ago.
                     The woman I have painted is one not worthy a second thought from you—a woman
                     who spoiled my whole life, whom I have reason to believe dead, and whom, were
                     she alive, I would go to the other end of the earth sooner than meet. Why I
                     painted that I hardly know—it was the whim of a moment—that it would have the
                     success it has met with I did not dream."</p>
                  <p>She colors slightly, he seems to have rebuked her irrespressible sible
                     curiosity. There is a romance then in this man's life—girl-like, that thought
                     deepens her interest in him. A gentleman born she instinctively feels he is,
                     this artist who paints for his daily bread, who has been a soldier of fortune
                     for twelve years. Miss Forrester is by nature a hero-worshipper, as Terry has
                     said. And Mr. G. Locksley, whoever he is, takes his place immediately on some
                     vacant pedestal in her mind, to be numbered among the heroes of her dreams
                     henceforth.</p>
                  <p>They say no more about "How the Night Fell." They linger, though, yet a little
                     longer among the immortals in the long gallery. Mr. Locksley seems in no haste,
                     and France feels an odd, altogether new pleasure, in lingering and listening to
                     his grave, quiet remarks, an odd distaste for returning to the perfumed warmth,
                     and glitter, and crush of the outer rooms. But they go there presently, for all
                     that, and at her suggestion. She will be missed, and she has a vague
                     recollection that she has promised the Prince Di Venturini a waltz.</p>
                  <p>"And I will find out who has purchased Mr. Locksley's picture," the little
                     diplomat says to herself; "it is evident he is as curious about it as I
                     am."</p>
                  <p>Prince Di Venturini is talking Italian politics eagerly to a knot of starred
                     and decorated gentlemen, but he breaks away, and comes up to France as their
                     waltz begins. As they float slowly away she plunges into her grievance at
                     once.</p>
                  <p>"It is unpardonable of you, prince, to have purchased the gem of the Academy. I
                     mean of course 'How the Night Fell.' I intended to have had it myself."</p>
                  <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Mais, Mon Dieu!</foreign>" cried the prince, in his
                     shrill Neapolitan French. "I did not purchase it. All the ladies fall in love
                     with it at sight, I believe. How fortunate are these artists."</p>
                  <p>"You did not purchase it!" France repeats in surprise. "Mr. Locksley told
                     me—"</p>
                  <p>"Ah, yes, Mr. Locksley told you, without doubt. Still, I did not buy the
                     picture for myself—I am not the pet of the public. I have not thousands to
                     throw away on a whim. It was Felicia."</p>
                  <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6444-00000056"/>
                  <p>"Felicia, the actress! the—"</p>
                  <p>"Star of the Royal Bijou Theatre. Yes, mademoiselle, and at a most fabulous
                     price. To wish and to have are synonyms with Felicia."</p>
                  <p>There is silence as they float around. Miss Forrester's dark, rose-crowned head
                     is lifted over the top of his small, yellow excellency's two good inches. She
                     feels it to be something more than annoying—a positive adding of insult to
                     injury, that this popular danseuse should have won what she has lost.</p>
                  <p>It wears late; the evening ends. One by one coroneted carriages roll away, and
                     Mr. Locksley comes after some lofty personage, with ribbons and orders, and
                     takes leave of Lady Dynely.</p>
                  <p>"We hope to see you every Thursday, Mr. Locksley," that lady says, very
                     graciously, and Mr. Locksley murmurs his acknowledgment, and pledges himself to
                     nothing.</p>
                  <p>"How do you like your genius, France?" inquires Terry Dennison. "Does he bear
                     the ordeal of close inspection, or does distance lend enchantment to the view,
                     as in the case of the Cheapside tailor's son?"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Locksley isn't a genius," Miss Forrester replies, trailing her silk
                     splendor up the stairs, "only a clever artist, who has painted one good
                     picture, and may never paint another. There are many such in all walks of life,
                     my dear child. Good-night, Terry—pleasant dreams."</p>
                  <p>"Good-night, France—morning rather; and my dreams will not be of you."</p>
                  <p>"Ingrate! Of whom then?"</p>
                  <p>"Of a little girl down in Lincolnshire. You don't know her, Miss Forrester, and
                     she would stand abashed in your regal presence. But, ah! there's nothing like
                     her under the London sun."</p>
                  <p>And Terry's blue eyes are absolutely luminous as he vanishes.</p>
                  <p>"Another heart gone!" reflects Miss Forrester, as she closes her door; "and so
                     it goes on. 'Men may come and men may go, but <emph>that</emph> goes on
                     forever!' Poor, good, honest Terry! I hope your course of true love will run
                     smooth at least. You are one of the exceptional men who do make the women you
                     marry happy."</p>
                  <p>Miss Forrester rings for her maid, and her mind goes off at another
                     tangent.</p>
                  <p>"So Felicia has purchased Mr. Locksley's picture! The dancer has taste. By the
                     bye, we're due at the Royal Bijou to-morrow night. She is very handsome; but
                     these people owe all their beauty, I suppose, to paint, and powder, and wigs.
                     She dances exceptionally well, too; but she need not have been in such haste
                     buying that picture."</p>
                  <p>She pauses in her wandering thoughts. Her eye falls upon a letter lying on her
                     dressing-table, under the clustering waxlights. It bears the Roman post-mark,
                     and, with a little exclamation of joy, Miss Forrester snatches it up.</p>
                  <p>"From grandmamma!" she says.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Caryll is in reality but her father's distant cousin, but so it pleases
                     France to call her. She breaks the seal and reads eagerly through. After a few
                     preliminary paragraphs, this is what the letter said:</p>
                  <p>"You say nothing, my dear France, of Eric's return. Has he <emph>not</emph>
                     returned then? It is really unpardonable of him to linger so long, knowing you
                     are in London. Oh, my daughter! I hope—I pray nothing may occur to break off
                     this alliance. I am fond of Eric—I love you. To see you his happy wife is the
                     desire of my heart. It is his mother's dearest wish also. In every respect it
                     is most suitable—both dowered with youth and wealth and beauty. He loves you I
                     am sure, France, and would have spoken before now had you let him. But you have
                     laughed at him and made light of his wishes hitherto. And you are of so
                     peculiar a nature, my dearest child, so unlike other girls of your age, so
                     self-willed, and radical in your opinions, that I fear for you. Not that you
                     would ever marry beneath you. I have no dread of that, you are far too proud;
                     but you may meet some one whom your fancy will idealize, whom you cannot marry,
                     and who will wreck the happiness of your life. Something—I do not know what,
                     tells me this will be so. Guard against it—let your engagement with Eric be
                     announced to<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6444-00000057"/> the world immediately
                     it takes place. And write at once, my dear, dear daughter, to your most
                     affectionate</p>
                  <p>"MARIAN CARYLL."</p>
                  <p>She threw the letter aside with a quick gesture of irritated impatience. As a
                     rule, she was not petulant, and all Mrs. Caryll's wishes carried force, but
                     just now she felt intolerant of this husband thrust upon her, whether she would
                     or no.</p>
                  <p>"Eric Dynely," she said, "a masculine wax doll, a perfumed coxcomb, a dandy of
                     the first water! I hate dandies! I detest pretty men! I would sooner marry
                     Terry Dennison any day!"</p>
                  <p>One of the windows stood open; the soft, chill morning breeze stirred the
                     curtains of silk and lace; she put them aside and leaned out into the fresh
                     coolness, the faint light of the dawn glimmering on her pink silk, her roses
                     and diamonds.</p>
                  <p>"The day for this sort of marriage should have ended a century ago," she
                     thinks, full of impatient pain; "this kind of alliance should be left to
                     royalty. But <foreign xml:lang="FRA">noblesse oblige</foreign>, it seems to be
                     my fate. He is very well, the best waltzer I know, the best second in a duet,
                     he has the bow and grace of a Beau Brummel—the good looks of an Apollo—what
                     more can one want? And yet one does. Loves me, does he, grandmamma? Ah, no!
                     Eric, Viscount Dynely, fell in love many years ago—with himself, and will be
                     the victim of that passion all his life. And after all the dreams and the hero
                     worship they laugh at, I am to marry Eric Dynely!"</p>
                  <p>Then through the mists of the morning there floats before her a face, brown,
                     bearded, grave, with deep lines of care and thought seamed upon it, with

                  <p>THE leafy greenness of May, the soft and veiled warmth of June, had passed; the
                     feverish noontides of July had come, and Lady Dynely's only son had not
                     returned from his idle wanderings to woo and win his bride.</p>
                  <p>To France Forrester this first season of hers had been bright and beautiful as
                     a fairy tale. She had been presented by Lady Dynely, had created, as the
                     critics of the Academy had predicted, a sensation. A certain royal personage,
                     whose approval was a patent right and seal of popularity in itself, had
                     condescended to place his gracious stamp of approbation upon her, and Miss
                     Forrester awoke and found herself "the fashion." "The fashion!" these two magic
                     words told the whole story. Women slandered her fiercely, hated her bitterly,
                     and copied everything she wore, from her coquettish head-gear to her little
                     boots. Men diplomatized for the favor of a waltz, as they might for princely
                     preferment. In the ride, in the ball-room, and opera-box, Miss Forrester was
                     still the best surrounded lady of the assembly, the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >belle des belles</foreign>. "And <emph>why</emph> is it?" her envious
                     compeers asked. "It isn't her beauty; there are scores more perfectly and
                     classically beautiful than she, with her dark skin and irregular features." Was
                     it the dashing independence of her manner, the careless audacity with which she
                     looked into their eyes, and laughed at their flatteries, and threw them lightly
                     over as whiffs of thistle-down? She was so thoroughly heart-whole, so perfectly
                     indifferent to their homage, that she piqued their vanity—always a man's
                     strongest feeling—and rendered them, by that imperious grace of hers, her
                     veriest slaves. Whether she talked Italian politics to Prince Di Venturini,
                     with his wizen, murky face,<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6444-00000058"/> and
                     beady black eyes, or the newest opera with Signor Carlo Dolce, the new Venetian
                     tenor, whether she discoursed art with long-haired, dreamy-eyed students, and
                     stately academicians, or the latest Belgravian gossip with a dashing military
                     duke, it was all the same. She was interested in the theme, not the man; her
                     heart, if she possessed one, was triply clad in steel—no one, it seemed, had
                     power to touch it. And then, presently it leaked out that she had been engaged
                     for years to Lord Dynely, and that the engagement would be publicly <choice>
                        <sic>anounced</sic>
                        <corr>announced</corr>
                     </choice> to all whom it might concern, immediately upon his return to England.
                     "He must have great faith in his affianced," said the sneerers; he certainly
                     seemed in no hot haste to join her. This was after Miss Forrester had said "no"
                     to two of the most eligible gentlemen of the season, and who had followed her
                     about the summer through, like her lap-dog or her shadow.</p>
                  <p>This season, which had been such a brilliant career of victory to Miss
                     Forrester, had been a very busy one for Mr. Locksley the painter. Orders flowed
                     in—his fame and fortune seemed made. Madame Felicia sent by the prince for a
                     companion picture to "How the Night Fell." The Marquis of St. Albans had
                     ordered a Canadian winter scene. Lady Dynely wished to have her own portrait
                     painted for her son. The sittings for this portrait necessitated many visits to
                     the Brompton Studio, and Miss Forrester was almost invariably my lady's
                     companion. She wandered about among the paintings at will, whilst the elder
                     lady sat or lay back, and listened with half-closed eyes to Mr. Locksley
                     talking whilst he painted. He talked well, and as he seemed to have been pretty
                     much everywhere, found subjects enough. Anecdotes of his Indian life, the
                     fighting, the campaigning, the pig-sticking, stories of the American civil war,
                     thrilling and vivid as truth could make them, of Canada, with its brief, hot
                     summers, and long, cold winters, until the hours of each sitting were gone like
                     a dream.</p>
                  <p>"Really, Mr. Locksley is a charming companion," Lady Dynely was wont to say;
                     "talks better than any man I know. What a traveller he has been—been everywhere
                     and seen everything."</p>
                  <p>It was a subject upon which Miss Forrester was suspiciously reticent—Mr.
                     Locksley and the charm of his conversation. And yet, though she would not have
                     owned it even to herself, those hours in the Brompton cottage, sitting by the
                     open window watching the afternoon sun sink behind the tree-tops, leaving a
                     trail of splendor behind, with the scent of the summer roses perfuming the air,
                     while Mr. Locksley painted and talked, and Lady Dynely sat and listened, were
                     the pleasantest hours of her life. All were pleasant; this summer took a glory
                     and a bliss none other had known; but these were the foam of life's
                     champagne.</p>
                  <p>She and Mr. Locksley met tolerably often elsewhere. He still attended at
                     intervals Lady Dynely's Thursdays, and there were literary and artistic
                     gatherings where Miss Forrester met him. It was curious on these occasions to
                     note the restless light in the great hazel eyes, the quick, impatient glances
                     at the door, the sudden stillness that came over her when a new name was
                     announced, the swift shade of annoyed impatience, or the glad, quick light and
                     warmth that spread over her face, as it was or was not the name she wished to
                     hear. And somehow—certainly it was not Mr. Locksley's doing; he was the most
                     modest, least presuming of men—presently he found himself by Miss Forrester's
                     side, holding the little gloved hand she extended in frank, friendly greeting,
                     and basking in the sunshine of her sunniest smiles. In the park, too, leaning
                     over the rails, smoking his twilight cigar, Mr. Locksley was often favored with
                     a gracious bow from a certain coroneted carriage, and a dark, lovely face,
                     framed in a marvel of Parisian lace and rosebuds, shone upon him for an instant
                     like a dusk star. That tall, soldierly figure, that bronzed, bearded face, that
                     grave smile of recognition, Miss Forrester would have known among ten
                     thousand.</p>
                  <p>And still Lord Dynely did not come.</p>
                  <p>"It is <emph>very</emph> strange—it is incomprehensible, it is most annoying,"
                     Lady Dynely said, over and over again, to herself, or to Terry, knitting her
                     blonde brows; "I can't understand. So fond as he used to be of France, too, and
                     see her now flirting with half the men in London."</p>
                  <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6444-00000059"/>
                  <p>"I don't call it flirting," Terry would respond. "France can't help smiling on
                     men and turning their heads any more than the what's-its-name—sunflower—can
                     help turning the sun. And if the sun scorches and shrivels them a little, I
                     don't see that the sun is to be blamed either. Sounds poetical, that, don't
                     it?" said Terry, rather surprised at his own performance.</p>
                  <p>"It is unpardonable of Eric," Lady Dynely would retort, vexed, and
                        <emph>almost</emph> angry with her darling; "and so I shall tell him when I
                     write. Here it is the end of July, and we go down to Devonshire next week. His
                     birthday is in August, and who is to tell us whether he will even come then. Of
                     course France must feel piqued, though she conceals her feelings so well."</p>
                  <p>"Uncommonly well," says Terry. "So well that I for one am disposed to think
                     that she isn't in the least annoyed. Where is Eric loafing now?"</p>
                  <p>"Eric is still in Spain, and is evidently enjoying himself," says Eric's
                     mother, irritably.</p>
                  <p>"'The girls of Cadiz,'" hums Terry, under his breath. "Well, don't worry. I'll
                     go over and fetch him if you like."</p>
                  <p>"Nonsense, Terry! don't be a simpleton. What would France and I have done all
                     this summer without you for an escort? You have been the best of boys, and I
                     know you have been longing more than once to break away and go down to
                     Lincolnshire."</p>
                  <p>"Your pleasure must ever be first with me," Terry answers, but he smothers a
                     little sigh as he says it. Truth to tell, he <emph>has</emph> been longing many
                     times to break away from flower show and opera, party and park, dining and
                     dressing, and all the rest of it, and rush down into Lincolnshire, to the old
                     vicarage of his boyhood, where his loadstar shines. But Lady Dynely wills it
                     otherwise, and Lady Dynely's lightest word is law to Terry.</p>
                  <p>"If I could only have got off duty for a week—just a week," he had said
                     pathetically once to France, "I wouldn't so much mind. You see, she's just the
                     dearest, sweetest little darling in the world—"</p>
                  <p>"Of course," interrupts France, gravely.</p>
                  <p>"And I've been awfully fond of her ever since I wore roundabouts, and she short
                     muslin frocks, tied up on the shoulder, and I'm dying to tell her the good
                     news, my commission and the five hundred a year and—and something else." Terry
                     suddenly turns very red. "A fellow could marry and keep a wife on his pay and
                     five hundred a year, couldn't he, France? Just a little suburban villa, you
                     know, a pretty parlor maid, and a boy in buttons, and a one-horse shay—eh?
                     Couldn't they, France? My tastes ain't expensive, as Lady Dynely said the other
                     day, and she—ah France! I see lots of girls, you know—jolly girls, and dashing
                     girls, and pretty girls, but not one—no, I give you my word, not one-half as
                     good, or sweet, or pretty, as my little Crystal!"</p>
                  <p>Miss Forrester is Terry's confidante; he gets on with her. For Lady Dynely,
                     much as he loves and venerates her, or rather because of that great love and
                     veneration, he stands in awe of her. But France sympathizes with him, more than
                     ever in these later days, and listens dreamily, while Mr. Dennison pours forth
                     the story of his love.</p>
                  <p>"What a good fellow you are, Terry," she says now regretfully. "It is a pity to
                     throw you away upon any insipid little country girl. (I know by her photograph
                     she is insipid.) I have half a mind to fall in love with you myself."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, but don't, please!" says Terry, piteously; "let it be half a mind, don't
                     make it a whole one. If you insisted upon it, I should knock under at
                     once—women can always do what they please with me, and then two clever people
                     should never marry—it doesn't work; besides, you belong to Eric."</p>
                  <p>"Do I?" France responds, gravely. "I am not so sure of that. Eric seems in no
                     hurry to come and claim his belongings."</p>
                  <p>"It's a shame," says Terry; "and so Lady Dynely has just been saying. She's
                     awfully angry. Eric deserves to be shot."</p>
                  <p>"'The absent are always in the wrong,'" Miss Forrester<pb n="122-123"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000060"/> quotes. "I don't see why my lady should be angry
                     with Eric—I'm not. Let the poor boy enjoy himself. But, for you, Terry, you
                     shall go down to Lincolnshire to-morrow, if you wish it. It is too bad, and too
                     selfish of us, to keep you tied to our apron-strings when the prettiest and
                     sweetest girl in England is pining for you among the Lincolnshire fens and
                     marshes. I shall speak to Lady Dynely, at once. Yours is the most aggravated
                     case of 'cruelty to animals' on record."</p>
                  <p>"No, no! It may annoy Lady Dynely—I would not for the world. My affairs can
                     wait," Terry remonstrates in alarm.</p>
                  <p>"So can ours. I am very fond of my lady, but I don't worship the ground she
                     walks on, as some people do. I shall ask her."</p>
                  <p>Miss Forrester kept her word. She sought out Lady Dynely, and broached the
                     subject at once.</p>
                  <p>"Lady Dynely, can't you let Terry off duty for a couple of weeks? The poor
                     fellow is falling a prey 'to green and yellow melancholy,' and the 'worm i' the
                     bud is preying on his damask cheek.' In plain English, he's in love; and now
                     that your generosity has given him something to live on, he naturally wants to
                     go and tell her—wants to lay his hand and fortune at her feet, and do the
                     'come, share my cottage, gentle maid' sort of thing, you know."</p>
                  <p>France spoke lightly. Lady Dynely laid down her pen—she was writing that
                     indignant protest to Master Eric—and looked up with a face that turned to the
                     color of ashes.</p>
                  <p>"Wants to marry!—Terry!" was all she could say.</p>
                  <p>"Naturally. We have made him our 'fetch and carry' spaniel, I know; but he is a
                     man for all that. We have treated him as though he were a page or footman; but
                     he is a lieutenant of dragoons, and nearly twenty-four years old. Not a
                     Methuselah, certainly, but old enough to take unto himself a wife if he wishes
                     to perpetrate that sort of imbecility."</p>
                  <p>"Terry! a wife!" Then Lady Dynely sits still, and over the gray pallor of her
                     face a look of anger flashes. "It is absurd!—it is preposterous! Terry with a
                     wife! Why, he is only a grown-up baby himself. I will not hear of it."</p>
                  <p>"He is more than three years older than Eric," says Miss Forrester, her eyes
                     kindling at this injustice. "When it is Eric's lordly will to take a wife, you
                     won't put in that plea of youth, will you?"</p>
                  <p>"The cases are altogether different—there is no comparison," says Lady Dynely,
                     coldly. "Who is the girl?"</p>
                  <p>"She is one of the Miss Higginses. There are nine Miss Higginses," says France,
                     with a slight shudder. "She is the youngest but one, poor thing. Terry and she
                     have been in love with each other ever since they ate pap out of the same bowl
                     and wore pinafores. And I think it is a little too bad, Lady Dynely," concludes
                     France, indignantly, "that poor Terry can't have a wife if he wants one."</p>
                  <p>"Send Terry here," is Lady Dynely's answer. "I will speak to him on this
                     subject."</p>
                  <p>"And don't be too hard on the poor fellow," pleads France, imploringly. "Oh,
                     Lady Dynely, he loves you as it is the fate of few mothers to be loved. So well
                     that I believe if you order him to give up this girl, to go away and turn
                     Trappist, he will obey you. As you are strong, be merciful—don't be hard on
                     Terry."</p>
                  <p>Then she goes, and Terry comes. He looks uncommonly foolish and guilty, much as
                     he used to do when caught apple-stealing down in Lincolnshire long ago, and was
                     called up before the vicar to answer for his crime. Her ladyship is still pale,
                     very pale, her lips are set, her eyes look anxious, the hands that are folded
                     in her lap tremble nervously at his approach.</p>
                  <p>"What is this, Terry?" she asks, and her clear voice is not steady. "Is it a
                     jest of France's, or do you really wish to—"</p>
                  <p>"Marry Crystal Higgins? Yes, Lady Dynely, with your permission," Terry answers,
                     looking up firmly enough.</p>
                  <p>"You really wish it?"</p>
                  <p>"I really wish it, with all my heart."</p>
                  <p>"Silly boy," Lady Dynely says, "what folly is this? You are too young. Oh, yes,
                     Terry, you are—you are ten years<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6444-00000061"/>
                     younger than your years—in spite of all you have lived in the world, you are as
                     ignorant of it as a girl in her teens. I don't object to that; I like you the
                     better for it indeed. But you are not up to the rôle of Benedick, the married
                     man. And besides, the income that is sufficient for you, with your simple
                     habits, will not suffice for a wife and family. I can't conceive of you in
                     love, Terry, you who treat all the young ladies of your acquaintance with an
                     indifference as unflattering as I am sure it is sincere."</p>
                  <p>"I love Crystal," is Terry's answer, and his blue eyes light. "I have loved her
                     pretty much, I think, since I saw her first."</p>
                  <p>"And she—"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, I don't know—she likes me, that I am sure of. She is only seventeen, Lady
                     Dynely, and knows nothing of the world beyond the vicarage, the village, and
                     her native marshes. And yet I think when I ask her to be my wife she will not
                     refuse."</p>
                  <p>"You mean to ask her then?"</p>
                  <p>"With your permission, Lady Dynely."</p>
                  <p>She lays her hand on his head; her lips tremble.</p>
                  <p>"You are a good boy, Terry; it would be difficult to be hard to you if one
                     wished. But I don't wish. I only ask this—postpone your visit for a little,
                     don't ask her to be your wife until—until Eric comes."</p>
                  <p>He lifts her hand and kisses it.</p>
                  <p>"It shall be as you please," he answers.</p>
                  <p>"Until Eric comes," she repeats, and that grayish pallor is on her face, that
                     troubled look in her eyes. "I have something to tell him—something to tell you.
                     When that is told you shall do as you please—you will be absolutely your own
                     master thenceforth."</p>
                  <p>"You are not angry, Lady Dynely?" Terry asks, in a troubled tone.</p>
                  <p>"Angry! with you? Ah, no, Terry; you have never given me cause for anger in
                     your life." She sighs heavily; she thinks of one, as dear to her as the very
                     heart beating in her bosom, who has given her cause for anger often enough.</p>
                  <p>"It is a compact between us. You will wait until I have told you what I have to
                     tell before you speak?"</p>
                  <p>"I will wait," he answers. And then, with a troubled, mystified look on his
                     face he goes out. "Something to tell; what can it be?" Mr. Dennison wonders. He
                     is not good at guessing; mysteries have never come near his simple life, and
                     they sorely perplex and upset him when they do. For Lady Dynely, she drops her
                     face in her hands with a passionate cry.</p>
                  <p>"I have put it off so long," she sobs, "and now the day is here—is here."</p>
                  <p>"Well," says Miss Forrester, imperiously, "has your superior officer given you
                     leave, Mr. Dennison?"</p>
                  <p>Terry explains—stammering a good deal. Not just yet—he is to wait until Eric
                     comes home.</p>
                  <p>"Until Eric comes home! Grant me patience!" is Miss Forrester's prayer. "Now
                     what under the sun has Eric to do with it? If Lady Dynely could, the whole
                     world would revolve at Eric's pleasure, the sun only shine when it was his
                     sovereign will. I need not ask, Mr. Dennison, if you mean to obey?"</p>
                  <p>"You need not, indeed, Miss Forrester," he answers, coolly; "I mean to
                     obey."</p>
                  <p>She looks at him curiously—almost pathetically—and yet with admiration too.</p>
                  <p>"I think better of my fellow-men, Terry, since I have known you. You give me an
                     exalted idea of human nature. I thought gratitude an extinct virtue—went out
                     with the dark ages—you teach me my mistake. You love and venerate Lady Dynely
                     in a way that is simply wonderful."</p>
                  <p>"She has done so much for me," Terry says, "no gratitude can ever repay
                     her."</p>
                  <p>"Yours will, don't be afraid. You will have chance enough of showing it." Miss
                     Forrester has thrice the worldly wisdom of poor Terry. "How was it all? Your
                     relationship to the Dynely family seems somehow such a hazy affair. What was
                     your life like before she came for you?"</p>
                  <p>But on this point Terry's recollections are misty. A troubled look crosses his
                     face—it was all wretchedness and<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6444-00000062"/>
                     squalor that he vaguely remembers, also that those with whom his early years
                     were spent were kind to him, in a rude sort of way. Out of this blurred
                     picture, the rainy day upon which she entered their hovel, like a very angel of
                     light, with her fair face and rich garments, stands out clear. She came, and
                     all his life changed. No mother could do more for a son than she had done for
                     him.</p>
                  <p>"Could they not?" Miss Forrester says, rather doubtfully, thinking how
                     differently the lives of Eric and Terry are ordered. But she will not throw
                     cold water on his enthusiasm. It is beautiful in its belief and simplicity,
                     this worship of Lady Dynely in a world where gratitude is the exception, not
                     the rule.</p>
                  <p>"But why did she do it? And what claim have you really upon her?" she asks.</p>
                  <p>Here Terry is "far wide" again. His father was some sort of relation of the
                     late Lord Dynely, that much her ladyship told the Vicar of Starling, and that
                     meagre scrap is all Mr. Dennison knows of himself or his history.</p>
                  <p>"Curious," France says, thoughtfully, looking at him. "Lady Dynely is the last
                     to adopt a ragged child through a whim and do for him as she has done for
                     Terry. There is something on the cards we don't see, and something I fancy not
                     quite fair."</p>
                  <p>So all thought of going down into Lincolnshire and making the eighth Miss
                     Higgins blessed for life, was given up by Mr. Dennison for the present, and he
                     resumed his "fetch and carry" duties as France called them, and dutifully
                     escorted his two lady friends everywhere. Even down to the Brompton studio,
                     which bored him most of all, for he didn't care for pictures, and Mr.
                     Locksley—a good fellow enough—was monopolized by the ladies and had no time to
                     attend to him. The bright brief season—for Parliament closed early that
                     year—was at its end, all the world of western London were turning their
                     thoughts countryward, the last sitting for Lady Dynely's portrait was to be
                     given. While she sat, Miss Forrester prowled about as usual among the pictures,
                     and lo! brought one to light that was a revelation.</p>
                  <p>She had seen them all again and again. The Canadian winter scene for the
                     Marquis, a view from the heights of Quebec, with the river a glistening ribbon
                     of frozen silver-white, and the ice cone of Montmorency Falls piercing the
                     vivid blue sky—the glimpses of green Virginian forests, picturesque negro
                     quarters, rich sketches of northern autumnal forests, all gorgeous splashes of
                     ruby-red maple and orange hemlock, and anon a glimpse of Indian life, dusky
                     white-veiled Arabs, and dreary sketches of sandy plain. The companion picture
                     for Madame Felicia was not yet begun. And thus it was that suddenly France came
                     upon her treasure-trove.</p>
                  <p>It was hidden from view in a dusky corner covered by half a dozen larger
                     canvasses—a little thing, merely a sketch, but struck in with a bold hand, with
                     wonderful gradation of light and shade. This is what she saw:</p>
                  <p>An old-fashioned garden; a tangled mass of roses and heliotrope and
                     honeysuckle; a night sky, lit by a faint, new moon; the dim outline of a
                     stately mansion rising in the background over the black trees; a girl in a
                     white dress, her face uplifted to the night sky. In the dim distance, a darker
                     shadow among the shadows, his face entirely obscured—the tall figure of a man
                     stands unseen, watching. The face of the girl is France's own. The blood rushed
                     to her forehead as she looked, with a shock, she could hardly have told—whether
                     of anger or joy. She understood the picture in a moment, and in that moment
                     understood herself. The figure in the background was <emph>his</emph>—and he
                     was bidding her a last farewell. That look of passionate love, of passionate
                     despair—how dared he! With the crimson of conscious guilt still red in her
                     cheeks, her eyes flashed. Did he suspect what until this moment she had never
                     suspected herself? A suffocating feeling of shame, of terror, seized her. Did
                     he suspect—did he dare suspect that she had stooped to care for him
                     unsought?</p>
                  <p>Yes, stooped! Was he not a nameless, struggling artist, one of the toilers of
                     the earth? And she—and then France stopped and knew in her inmost soul that
                     though he were a beggar, he was the one man of all men born to be her
                     master.</p>
                  <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6444-00000063"/>
                  <p>She sat like one in a trance looking at it—heedless how time flew, until
                     suddenly a slip of paper attached to the back caught her eye.</p>
                  <p>It was a short printed poem that told the story of the picture. Mechanically
                     she took it and read: <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"So close we are, and yet so far apart;</l>
                           <l rend="ti-1">So close I feel your breath upon my cheek;</l>
                           <l rend="ti-1">So far that all this love of mine is weak</l>
                           <l>To touch in any way your distant heart;</l>
                           <l>So close, that when I hear your voice I start</l>
                           <l rend="ti-1">To see my whole life standing bare and bleak:</l>
                           <l rend="ti-1">So far, that though for years and years I seek,</l>
                           <l>I shall not find thee other than thou art."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>She laid it down. There was a step behind her, and then lifting her eyes they
                     met his full. He turned quite white, and made a motion as though to take the
                     picture from her hand.</p>
                  <p>"Miss Forrester! I did not mean that you should see that."</p>
                  <p>"So I presume. You must pardon me for having seen it, all the same. May I ask
                     for which of Mr. Locksley's patrons is this?"</p>
                  <p>"Miss Forrester does me less than justice," he answered; "I have not been so
                     presumptuous as that. This picture is not to leave my studio. Have you seen the
                     poem? Yes—well, the fancy took me to put the story it told on canvas. Almost in
                     spite of me the girl's face became yours. It is but an instant's work to dash
                     it out if it displeases you."</p>
                  <p>"The picture is your own; you will do as you please," she said, frigidly.
                        "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Ma mère</foreign>, is the sitting over at last?
                     Shall we go?"</p>
                  <p>"Your picture, France?" Lady Dynely said, glancing at the apple of discord, and
                     putting up her glass. "Really; and very well done. 'The Last Parting.' But what
                     a despairing expression you give her, Mr. Locksley. Who ever saw France with
                     such a look as that?"</p>
                  <p>"No one, mother mine," France said, gayly. There were times when she called
                     Lady Dynely by this title and thus gladdened her heart. "Nor ever will. But
                     these artists have such vivid imaginations."</p>
                  <p>"I should like you to paint France's portrait, really," said her ladyship. "I
                     have none. What do you say? Throw over your engagements and come down to Dynely
                     and do me this favor."</p>
                  <p>"It is quite impossible, madame," the artist answered, moodily, standing by his
                     handiwork and looking down at it with gloomy eyes.</p>
                  <p>And then all of a sudden a change came over Miss Forrester. The look of hauteur
                     broke up, disappeared, and a smile like a gleam of sunshine after a storm
                     lighted her face.</p>
                  <p>"No one ever says impossible to Lady Dynely," she said, in her old, imperiously
                     charming tone; "least of all with that look. And I really should like to see
                     myself as others see me, on canvas. <emph>That</emph> is not I, for I could by
                     no possibility ever wear such a look as that. You shall paint my picture not
                     once, but twice—once for Lady Dynely and once for a dear old lady in Rome, who
                     will prize it above rubies—Grandmamma Caryll."</p>
                  <p>He looked up, a faint flush under the golden tan of his skin.</p>
                  <p>"You mean that?" he asked.</p>
                  <p>"Most certainly. Let Felicia wait, and you may follow us down to Dynely."</p>
                  <p>"I shall take it as a favor," chimed in Lady Dynely.</p>
                  <p>There is a moment's pause, of strong irresolution, France can see. Then he
                     looks up and meets her eyes again.</p>
                  <p>"You are both very good," he says, quietly. "I will come."</p>

                  <head type="sub">"THE LORD OF THE LAND."</head>
                  <p>WALKING up and down the pier of Saint-Jeansur-Mer, on the Brittany coast, under
                     the broiling sea-side sun, waiting for the English packet anchored out in the
                     roads, is a young English gentleman. The July sky is blazing blindingly here by
                     the sea; the heat quivers like a white mist over the water; not a breath of air
                     stirs the chestnuts or laburnums, and the streets of Saint-Jean lie all baked
                     and white in the pitiless, brassy glare of that fierce midsummer sun.</p>
                  <p>But in all this tropical dazzle and heat the young Englishman saunters up and
                     down, and looks cool and languid still. His summer suit of palest gray is the
                     perfection of taste; his boots, his gloves, perfection also; and the
                     handkerchief which he flirts once or twice across his face is of finest
                     cambric, embroidered with a coronet and monogram, and perfumed with attar of
                     violets. He is tall and very blonde, as shapely as a woman, broad-shouldered,
                     slender-waisted, long-limbed, and <emph>very</emph> handsome. His complexion is
                     delicate as a girl's; for such blue eyes and blonde curls many a fair one might
                     sigh with envy; very handsome, very effeminate. He has a little golden
                     mustache, waxed into minute points; a straw hat is thrown carelessly on his
                     fair hair. He is the most beautiful, the most noble, the most perfect of all
                     men, in one woman's eyes at least. He is Eric, Lord Viscount Dynely. He walks
                     up and down, and waits for the boat which is to convey him across the channel,
                     to his home and the lady he is to marry. But he is in no hot haste about it; he
                     has put off the evil day as long as possible.</p>
                  <p>France Forrester is a pretty girl, an elegant girl, a clever girl; a suspicion
                     has entered Lord Dynely's handsome blonde head more than once that she may be
                     even cleverer than himself. <emph>That</emph> is a drawback. In common with all
                     men of good taste and sense, he dislikes clever women; a suspicion of blue in
                     the stockings would outweigh the charm of the daintiest foot and ankle on
                     earth. Still it is a settled thing among the powers that be, and poor France
                     expects it, no doubt; and it is less of a bore, on the whole, to yield
                     gracefully, and sacrifice himself in his youth and loveliness on the altar of
                     filial duty, than make a fuss about it. And, besides, as a wife, he really
                     doesn't know any lady he would prefer to Mrs. Caryll's heiress.</p>
                  <p>At half-past ten he came down to the pier; it is a quarter of eleven now, as he
                     sees by the small jewelled repeater he draws from his pocket, and Lord Dynely
                     frowns a little.</p>
                  <p>"Confound it!" he mutters; "she promised to be here at half-past, sharp, and
                     now it is a quarter of eleven. The boat starts at eleven. Won't she come after
                     all? and have I been ruining my complexion and eyesight in this beastly glare
                     for the last thirty minutes for nothing?"</p>
                  <p>Then he pauses, stops, smiles. <emph>She</emph> is coming—a dark-eyed,
                     coquettish little Frenchwoman, charmingly dressed, and who possesses the good
                     looks that come from youth, good health, good taste, and fine spirits. She is
                     Lord Dynely's last flirtee, met at a Saint-Jean ball, where in ten minutes she
                     had waltzed herself completely into his fickle affections. He had come to
                     Saint-Jean, from his Spanish loiterings, with the intention of crossing over at
                     once, and lo! a fortnight had passed and two merry black eyes and a vivacious
                     French tongue had held him in rose chains ever since. The two weeks' passion
                     had grown <foreign xml:lang="FRA">triste</foreign> now, and he was going, and
                     madame had promised to trip down and bid him adieu on the pier. Such was the
                     gentleman decreed to become France Forrester's lord and master.</p>
                  <p>The fifteen minutes pass; they talk very affectionately, he with his tall, fair
                     head bent devotedly over her, his eloquent blue eyes speaking whole
                     encyclopedias of undying devotion. He is one of those men who naturally delight
                     to play at love-making, and throw themselves into the moment's<pb n="132-133"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000065"/> rôle with all the depth that is in them. One of
                     those men born to be worshipped by women, and to make them suffer mercilessly
                     at his hands. Not robustly bad in any way, but simply without an ounce of
                     ballast in him, body or soul.</p>
                  <p>Eleven strikes from all the clocks of Saint-Jean-sur-Mer—the fatal hour has
                     come. There are tears in madame's black, doll-like eyes as she whispers adieu;
                     beautifully pale, sad and tender Lord Eric looks. He waves the perfumed
                     coroneted handkerchief from the upper deck as long as she is in sight, still
                     mournful and pale to look upon despite the height of the thermometer. Then he
                     laughs, puts the handkerchief in his pocket, lights a rose-scented cigarette,
                     selects a shady spot on deck, orders his valet to fetch him that last novel of
                     George Sand, and in five minutes has as completely forgotten the woman he has
                     left as—the girl he is going to.</p>
                  <p>He reaches London. It is a desert, of course. Everybody has gone. Some three
                     million are left, but they don't count. He looks in weary disgust at the empty,
                     sun-scorched West End streets, at the bleached parks, the forsaken Ladies'
                     Mile, and goes down at once to Devonshire. And in the cool of a perfect summer
                     evening he reaches the village station, and as he is not expected, is driven in
                     a fly, like an ordinary mortal, to the Abbey gates. There is a garden party of
                     some kind, he sees, as he strolls languidly up to the house. This gentleman,
                     who has not attained his majority, has a certain weary and worn-out air, as
                     though life were a very old story indeed, and rather a tiresome mistake—the
                     "nothing new, and nothing true, and it don't signify" manner to perfection.</p>
                  <p>It is a most exquisite evening. Overhead there is a sky like Italy, golden-gray
                     in the shadow, primrose and pink in the light, a full moon rising over the
                     tree-tops, a few bright stars winking facetiously down at grim old earth, a
                     faint breeze just stirring the roses, and clematis, and jessamine, and
                     honeysuckle, and wafting abroad subtle incense, and the nightingales piping
                     their musical, plaintive vesper song. It is unutterably beautiful, but to all
                     its beauty Lord Dynely is deaf and blind. It has been a hot, stifling
                        day,<emph>that</emph> he knows; it is rather cooler now, that is all. What
                     he does see is a group of fair English girls, in robes of white, and pink, and
                     pale green, playing croquet under the beeches, and his tired eyes light a
                     little at the sight. Wherever and whenever Lord Dynely may light upon a pretty
                     girl, or group of them, all his earthly troubles vanish at once. It was a
                     weakness, many cynical friends said, inherited honestly enough from his late
                     noble father.</p>
                  <p>The group clicking the croquet balls did not see him, but as he drew near, a
                     lady standing on the terrace, gazing thoughtfully at the twilight shadows, did,
                     and there was a quick start, a quick uprising, and a rush to meet him, a glad,
                     joyful cry:</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Eric! my son! my son!"</p>
                  <p>He permitted her embrace rather than returned it. It was too warm for powerful
                     domestic emotions of any sort, Eric thought, and then women always went in for
                     kissing and raptures upon the smallest provocation. He let himself be embraced,
                     and then gently extricated himself, and glanced backward at the group.</p>
                  <p>"A croquet party, mother!" he said. "Do I know them? Ah, yes, I see the Deveres
                     and the Dorman girls? Is France—? How is France? She is not among them?"</p>
                  <p>"France is somewhere in the grounds. Oh, my boy! how good it seems to have you
                     at home again—how anxiously I have awaited your coming. We expected you in
                     London at the beginning of the season."</p>
                  <p>"We?" his lordship says, interrogatively.</p>
                  <p>"France and I. Do you know, Eric, that France has been the sensation of the
                     season, the most admired girl in London. Lord Evergoil proposed, and was
                     rejected; but, Eric, you ran a great risk."</p>
                  <p>"Did I? Of losing Miss Forrester? I could have survived it," he answers,
                     coolly.</p>
                  <p>"Don't say that, Eric—you don't mean it, I know," Lady Dynely says, with a
                     singularly nervous, frightened look. "You cannot do better—it is impossible.
                     She is of one of the oldest families in the kingdom; she is handsome,
                     accomplished, and fascinating, and she comes into two fortunes,<pb n="134-135"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000066"/> her own and Mrs. Caryll's. Eric, I shall break
                     my heart if you do not marry her."</p>
                  <p>"Hearts don't break, dear mother—physicians have discovered that; it is an
                     exploded delusion. And as to Miss Forrester's accomplishments and fascinations,
                     do you know I rather find that sort of young person hang heavy on hand—I prefer
                     people of less superhuman acquirements. For the fortune—well, I may not be a
                     Marquis of Westminster, but the rent roll is a noble one, and its lord need
                     never sell himself."</p>
                  <p>Lady Dynely has turned quite white—a dead, gray pallor—as she listens. Is he
                     going to throw over France and her fortune after all? Must she tell him the
                        <emph>truth</emph> in order to make him speak? Before she can turn to him
                     again, he speaks, more cheerfully this time.</p>
                  <p>"Time enough for all that," he says; "don't look so pale and terrified, mother
                     mine. One would think I were a pauper, reduced to heiress-hunting or
                     starvation. Where is France? I will go in search of her, and pay my
                     respects."</p>
                  <p>"She went down the lime walk half an hour ago with Mr. Locksley."</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Locksley? A new name. Who is Mr. Locksley?"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Locksley is an artist; he is painting France's portrait. He made a hit at
                     the Academy this year, and I prevailed upon him to come with us down here."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, you did! And he is received <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en famille</foreign>,
                     I suppose, and France takes solitary strolls with him, does she?" responds
                     Eric, lifting his eyebrows. "It seems to me, my good mother, you don't look
                     after your only son's interests so very sharply after all. The lime walk, did
                     you say? I will go and flush this covey at once."</p>
                  <p>He turns away. His mother stands where he has left her and watches the tall,
                     slender figure, the slow, graceful walk.</p>
                  <p>"He grows handsomer every year," she thinks, in her love and admiration. "Go
                     where I will I see nothing like him. Oh, my boy! if you only knew that you may
                     be a very pauper indeed. That on the mercy of Terry Dennison your whole fortune
                     may hang. If I could only summon courage and end all this deception, and
                     secrecy, and suspense pense at once. Terry is so good, so generous, he loves me
                     so; he is fonder of Eric than any brother; he would rather die than give me
                     pain. That is my only hope. If the sins of the father <emph>must</emph> be
                     visited on the children, oh, let not my darling be the one to suffer."</p>
                  <p>A selfish, a weak prayer, but passionately earnest at least. Her darling had
                     faded from her view, and her tear-filled eyes turned to another figure taller
                     still, with all the grace and elegant languor wanting, only manly strength and
                     vigor in their place. His deep laugh comes to her at the moment, clear and
                     merry as any school-boy's.</p>
                  <p>"Terry will have mercy," she thinks; "he is the soul of generosity, and his
                     wants are so simple, his ambitions so few. With his commission, his five
                     hundred a year, and the vicar's daughter for his wife, he will ask no more of
                     fate. I will tell him when he returns from Lincolnshire, and I know, I feel,
                     all will be well. And yet,"—her eyes went wistfully over the fair expanse of
                     park and woodland, and glade and terrace, flower garden and fountains, all
                     silvered in the radiance of the summer moon—"it is a great sacrifice—a
                     sacrifice not one man in a hundred would make."</p>
                  <p>Meantime Lord Dynely had strolled down the lime walk, and emerged upon a sylvan
                     nook, commanding a view of forest near, and the distant shining sea. Its soft
                     wash reached the ear—the moon left a track of radiance as it sailed up the
                     serene sky. And this is the picture his lordship saw:</p>
                  <p>In a dress of gauzy white, Miss Forrester sat in a rustic chair, blue ribbons
                     floating, trailing roses in the rich brownness of her hair, a great bunch of
                     lilies of the valley in her lap, another cluster in the bosom of her dress. Her
                     coquettish "Dolly Varden" hat lay on the grass beside her—her eyes were fixed,
                     full of dreamy light, on the shining sky and sea, and the man who lay on the
                     sward at her feet, reading aloud. Poetry, of course, Tennyson of course, and
                     "Maud" as it chanced.</p>

                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"I said to the rose, 'The brief night goes</l>

                  <p>Pleasant first words to greet Lord Dynely's ears, pleasant tableau vivant to
                     greet his eyes.</p>
                  <p>Confound the fellow! A strolling artist, too. What presumption! Good looking,
                     no doubt; those painting fellows, with their long hair, and picturesque faces,
                     and velvet blouses, always play the mischief with women. Reading poetry, at her
                     feet. France Forrester's—whom he used to think one of the proudest girls he
                     knew. He had fancied her pining for him, piqued at his absence. Certainly,
                     flirtation was a game for two to play at. She could amuse herself very well at
                     home, it seemed, while he amused himself abroad.</p>
                  <p>"Taking people by surprise is a mistake, I find," he said advancing. "If I
                     don't disturb the exercises, Miss Forrester, perhaps you will turn round and
                     say good-evening."</p>
                  <p>He stood before her, holding out his hand, a smile on his lips. She half arose,
                     turning very pale.</p>
                  <p>"Eric!"</p>
                  <p>"Eric, Miss Forrester—at last. I have been standing for the last five minutes
                     enjoying the poetry and the very pretty picture you two make here in the
                     twilight. Pray present me."</p>
                  <p>"There is no need, Miss Forrester. Unless Lord Dynely's memory be of the
                     shortest, think I he will recall me."</p>
                  <p>Locksley arose to his feet as he spoke, and Lord Dynely saw him for the first
                     time. His face lit up—a look of real pleasure came into his eyes—he grasped the
                     hand of the artist with a genuine warmth, all unusual with him.</p>
                  <p>"Locksley? My dear fellow, what a surprise this is, you know. My mother
                     mentioned your name, but it never occurred to me <emph>you</emph> were the man.
                     Who would look for you in England?"</p>
                  <p>Locksley smiled.</p>
                  <p>"My headquarters is Italy, certainly; but I come to England, nevertheless. I
                     have been here two years."</p>
                  <p>"You have met before," France broke in; "you never told me, Mr. Locksley."</p>
                  <p>"Was it necessary? I had the pleasure of doing Lord Dynely some slight service
                     two years ago, and saw a good deal of him for some weeks after. But how could I
                     tell he would remember? Two years is a considerable time."</p>
                  <p>"Cynical, as usual—a Diogenes without the tub and cabbage leaves. A slight
                     service! Yes, I should think so. He saved my life, France—my boat upset in a
                     squall in the Bay of Naples, and only he took a header gallantly to the rescue,
                     the Dynely succession would then and there have been extinct. Odd I didn't
                     remember your name the moment I heard it, but I am very pleased to meet you
                     here all the same."</p>
                  <p>They had turned, and as by one impulse, walked back towards the house. It was
                     quite night now, the trees making ebony shadows across the ivory light. The
                     croquet players had adjourned to the house, and the balls and mallets had given
                     place to piano music and waltzing. On the portico steps stood Terry, whistling
                     and looking at the moon. He came eagerly forward with outstretched hand, his
                     honest eyes shining with pleasure.</p>
                  <p>"Dear old man!" he said, giving Eric's delicate digit a grip that made him
                     wince; "glad to have you back. Thought you were never coming—thought some old
                     Spanish hidalgo out there had got jealous, and pinked you under the fifth rib
                     in some dark corner. The <foreign xml:lang="SPA">madre</foreign> is beside
                     herself with delight."</p>
                  <p>"Softly, Terry—softly," says Lord Dynely, withdrawing his hand with a slight
                     grimace. "A moderate amount of affection I don't object to, but don't let the
                     grip of the muscular hand express the emotions of the overflowing heart. They
                     are tripping the light fantastic in there—shall we join them?"</p>
                  <p>They enter the drawing-room—there are more greetings and a few introductions.
                     The lord of the land has returned—the seigneur of Dynely, the master, is in the
                     house, and<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6444-00000068"/> his presence makes itself
                     felt directly. He is in excellent spirits—throws off his languor, forgets to be
                     blase, and waltzes like a student at Mabille.</p>
                  <p>France declines; it is too warm, she says; she will relieve Lady Dynely, and
                     play. Mr. Locksley makes his adieux speedily and departs.</p>
                  <p>"How have you come to pick up Locksley, France?" Eric asks, later on.</p>
                  <p>"Pick him up? I don't quite understand. He painted the picture of the year,
                     sold it for a fabulous sum, was overflowing with orders, and, as a special
                     favor to Lady Dynely, consented to throw over everything else, follow us down
                     here and paint my portrait."</p>
                  <p>She speaks with a certain air of constraint, which Lord Dynely does not fail to
                     notice.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, very kind of him, of course. Very fine fellow, Locksley, and very clever
                     artist, but a sort of reserve about him, a sort of mystery, something on his
                     mind and all that. One of the sort of men who have an obnoxious wife hidden
                     away in some quarter of the globe, like Warrington and Rochester in the novels.
                     I must see the portrait—is it a good one?"</p>
                  <p>"Very good, I believe—I have given but two or three sittings as yet."</p>
                  <p>"How long has he been here?"</p>
                  <p>"A fortnight."</p>
                  <p>A pause. He looks at her as he leans over the back of her chair. She is
                     slightly pale still, rather grave, but very handsome—<emph>very</emph>
                     handsome. She has improved, Eric thinks, complacently, and dark beauties are
                     his style, naturally. A very credible wife, he thinks; a fine, high-bred face
                     to see at one's table; and if there be a trifle more brains than one could
                     wish, one can excuse that in a wife.</p>
                  <p>"I must get Locksley to make me a duplicate," he says, bending over her, and
                     putting on his tender look. "France, you have not said you are glad to see me
                     yet."</p>
                  <p>"Is it necessary to repeat that formula?" she answers, carelessly. "That is
                     taken for granted, is it not?"</p>
                  <p>"I was detained at Saint Jean," he goes on. "I have been longing to see you
                     once more; how greatly, you can imagine."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I can imagine," France answers, and suddenly all her reserve gives way,
                     and she looks up and laughs in his face. "I can imagine the burning
                     impetuosity, the fever of longing with which you rushed across the Pyrenees,
                     across France, and home. Eric, that sort of thing may do very well in Spain,
                     but don't try it with me."</p>
                  <p>"Merciless as ever. Your London season has agreed with you, France. I never saw
                     you look so well. And the fame of your conquests have reached even the other
                     side of the Pyrenees. How others slew their thousands and Miss Forrester her
                     tens of thousands. How men went down before her dark-eyed glances like corn
                     before the reaper."</p>
                  <p>"My dear Eric," Miss Forrester replies, politely shrugging with a yawn, "don't
                     you find it fatiguing to talk so much? It was never a failing of yours to make
                     long speeches. But I suppose two years' hard practice of the language of
                     compliments must tell."</p>
                  <p>"Come out on the terrace," is what he says, and in spite of her faint
                     resistance he leads her there. He is growing more and more charmed every
                     moment—not deeply in love, just epris of this new and pretty face. He is as
                     much fascinated now as he was by madame last week, as he may be by any one else
                     you please next, and thoroughly in earnest at the moment. Why should he delay?
                     Why not come to the point at once? Really, France would do credit to any man in
                     England.</p>
                  <p>The moonlight is flooding the terrace with glory, the trees are silver in its
                     light, the stone urns gleam like pearls, the flowers waft their fragrance where
                     they stand.</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" France sighs, "what a perfect night!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," Eric assents, looking up with his poetic blue eyes to the sky; "very
                     neat thing in the way of moonshine. And moonlight hours were made for love and
                     all that; the poet says so, doesn't he, France?"</p>
                  <p>"<emph>The</emph> poet, which poet? Don't be so vague, Lord Dynely."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, France, you may laugh at me—"</p>
                  <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6444-00000069"/>
                  <p>"I am not laughing; I never felt less facetious in my life. My principal
                     feeling, at present, is that it is half-past eleven, that I am tired after two
                     hours' croquet, and that I should—and will say good-night, and go to bed."</p>
                  <p>"Not just yet." He takes her hand and holds it fast. "What a pretty hand you
                     have," he says, tenderly; "a model for a sculptor. Will you let me put an
                     engagement ring among all those rubies and diamonds, France? I wanted to once
                     before—in Rome, you remember, and you wouldn't allow me."</p>
                  <p>France laughs, and looks at him, and draws away her hand.</p>

                  <p>"You certainly lose no time, Lord Dynely. Really the haste and ardor of your
                     love-making takes one's breath away. I have more rings now than I know what to
                     do with—another would be the embarrassment of riches. Eric, let us end this
                     farce. You don't care a straw for me. You don't want to marry me any more than
                     I want to marry you. Why should we bore each other with love-making that means
                     nothing. It will disappoint two good women a little—but that is inevitable. Go
                     to your mother, like a good boy, and tell her she must make up her mind to
                     another daughter-in-law."</p>
                  <p>His eyes light—opposition always determines him for right or wrong.</p>
                  <p>"I will never tell her that. I love you, France—have loved you always—you alone
                     shall be my wife."</p>
                  <p>"Eric, do you expect me to believe that?"</p>
                  <p>"I expect you to believe the truth. And if after all these years—after what has
                     passed between us, you mean to throw me over—"</p>
                  <p>"After what has passed between us!" she repeats, looking at him full, "I don't
                     understand that, Eric. What has ever passed between us?"</p>
                  <p>"You know I have loved you—you did not quite cast me off—you know it has always
                     been an understood thing we were to marry."</p>
                  <p>"And you mean to hold me to such a compact as that?"</p>
                  <p>"I mean I love you, and will be most miserable if you do not become my
                     wife."</p>
                  <p>"Ungenerous," she says, under her breath. "You will hold me to this tacit
                     understanding—to which I have never been a party, mind—whether I will or
                     no?"</p>
                  <p>He only repeats:</p>
                  <p>"I love you, France. I want you for my wife."</p>
                  <p>She stands looking at the softly luminous night, at the dark trees and white
                     shadows, her face pale, her lips set, her eyes darkly troubled.</p>
                  <p>"It is unfair—it is ungenerous," she cries out, presently, "to hold me to a
                     compact to which I have never consented. I will not do anything dishonorable,
                     but, Eric, it is most unkind. You do <emph>not</emph> love me—ah, hush—if you
                     protested forever I would not believe you. I know you, I think, better than you
                     know yourself. You mean it at this moment—next week you may forget my very
                     existence. I am not the sort of wife for you—you want an adoring creature to
                     sit at your feet and worship you as a god. There!" she turns impatiently away;
                     "let me alone. I can give you no answer to-night. The dew is falling; let us go
                     in. I hate to grieve Mrs. Caryll, I hate to disappoint your mother—for your
                     disappointment, if any there be, I don't care a whit."</p>
                  <p>"France, you are heartless," he says, angrily.</p>
                  <p>"No—I only speak the truth. Give me up. Let me go, Eric—it will be better for
                     us both."</p>
                  <p>"I will never let you go," he answers, sullenly. "If you throw me over, well
                     and good—I must submit—only it will not be like France Forrester to play fast
                     and loose with any man."</p>
                  <p>Her eyes flash upon him in the moonlight their angry fire.</p>
                  <p>"You do well to say that," she retorts. "You of all men! Give me a week; I
                     cannot answer to-night. If at the end of that time you are still of the same
                     mind, come to me for your answer."</p>
                  <p>She passes him, returns to the drawing-room, and leaves him on the terrace
                     alone.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">A WEEK'S REPRIEVE.</head>
                  <p>MISS FORRESTER goes to her room and sits at the window, after the fashion of
                     girls, and looks out. She had never taken this affair of the proposed alliance
                     seriously for a moment before. She had said, and with truth, that she
                     understood Eric better than he understood himself. Somewhere in his wanderings
                     he felt he would come upon some gypsy, girlish face, that would captivate his
                     susceptible, romantic heart—no, not heart—<emph>fancy;</emph> and very probably
                     there might be an impromptu marriage, and an end of all worry for her. He was
                     just the sort of man to sneer at matrimony, because it was a cynical, worldly,
                     correct sort of thing to do, and rush headlong into it upon the slightest
                     provocation. To be "off with the old love and on with the new," at a moment's
                     notice, was my Lord Eric's forte.</p>
                  <p>She had not disliked Eric, she had rather liked him, indeed—laughed at his
                     love-making, parodied his pretty speeches, mimicked his languid drawl, and
                     weary, used-up manner; treated him much as she treated Terry, with a sort of
                     fun-loving, elder-sister manner; only she had a real respect for Dennison she
                     never felt for Dynely.</p>
                  <p>"I never could marry such a man as you, Eric," she was wont to say. "You have a
                     great deal fairer complexion than I have, and I don't like dolly men. You cull
                     your hair; you wax that little callow mustache of yours; you perfume yourself
                     like a valet; you think more about your toilet and spend longer over it than a
                     young duchess; and you haven't an ounce of brains in you from top to toe. Now
                     if I have a weakness, it is this—that the man I marry shall be a manly man and
                     a clever man. You, my poor Eric, are neither, and never will be. And besides
                     you're too good-looking."</p>
                  <p>"First time a lady ever objected to that in the man who adored her," Eric
                     drawled.</p>
                  <p>"You're too good-looking," Miss Forrester repeats with a regretful sigh; "and
                     over-much good looks are what no man can bear. You're a coxcomb, my precious
                     boy, of the first water—a dandy <foreign xml:lang="FRA">par
                        excellence</foreign>. Why, you know yourself," cries France, indignantly,
                     "your sobriquet at Eton was 'Pretty Face?'"</p>
                  <p>"I know it—yes," Eric answers, with an irrepressible smile.</p>
                  <p>"Then you see it's quite impossible—utterly impossible and preposterous, Eric,"
                     Miss Forrester was wont to conclude; "so let us say no more about it. I don't
                     object to your making love to me in a general way—it's your only earthly
                     mission, poor fellow, and to veto that would be cruel. But let it be
                     general—let us have no more foolish talk of present engagements and prospective
                     weddings, and that nonsense. Because you know it can never be."</p>
                  <p>"Never, France—really?"</p>
                  <p>"Never, Eric—really; never, never, never. I wouldn't marry you if you were the
                     last man on earth, and to refuse involved the awful doom of old-maidenhood. I
                     like you too well ever to love you. And I mean to love the man I marry."</p>
                  <p>"Really!" Eric repeats, lifting his eyebrows, and pulling the waxed ends of the
                     yellow mustache, intensely amused.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Eric, with all my heart. Ah, you may smile in the superior god-like
                     wisdom of manhood, but I mean it. He is to be a king among men—"</p>
                  <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Sans peur et sans reproche?</foreign>" puts in young
                     Lord Dynely.</p>
                  <p>"Without fear and without reproach. Yes, exactly. Not a man about town, mind
                     you; an elegant tailor's block, too much in love with himself ever to love his
                     wife; but a strong man, a brave man, a hero—"</p>
                  <p>"'I'm Captain Jinks, of the Horse Marines,'" hums Lord Dynely, that popular
                     ditty having about that time burst upon an enraptured world.</p>
                  <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6444-00000071"/>
                  <p>"A man I can look up to, be proud of, who will do something in the world;
                     anything but a handsome dandy who parts his hair in the middle, who wears
                     purple and fine linen, and whose highest aim in life is to lie at young ladies'
                     feet and drawl out the eternal passion that consumes him—a gentleman whose
                     loves are as numerous as the stars, and not half so eternal."</p>
                  <p>In this spirited way Miss Forrester had been used to rebuff her would-be lover,
                     and did sometimes succeed in piquing Eric into deserting her in disgust.</p>
                  <p>A young lady so strong-minded as this at sixteen, what was she likely to be at
                     twenty? He pitied her for her lack of taste—other girls went down before those
                     blue eyes of his, for which Miss Forrester expressed such profound contempt. It
                     had never really meant much with either of them until this night on the
                     terrace. And this night on the terrace Lord Dynely had been in earnest at
                     last.</p>
                  <p>In some way her honor was bound—more or less, while she had laughed at the
                     wished-for alliance, she had yet accepted it. Miss Forrester had a very high
                     sense of honor, and was an exceedingly proud girl. To play fast or loose with
                     any man, as Eric had said, was utterly impossible. In no way was she a
                     coquette. Men had admired her, had fallen in love with her, had wanted to marry
                     her; but the mistake had been of their own making; she had never led them on.
                     If, indeed, then, her honor and truth stood compromised here, she must marry
                     Eric. He did not love her—<emph>that</emph> she knew as well now as she had
                     known it always; if she married him, she would be a most unhappy, unloved and
                     neglected wife—that she also knew. And yet if he held her to it, if Lady Dynely
                     held her to it, if Mrs. Caryll held her to it, what was she to do? To grieve
                     those that loved her was a trial to her generous nature, and she was of the age
                     and the kind to whom self-sacrifice, self-abnegation, look great and glorious
                     things. Yes, it would resolve itself into this—if Lord Dynely held her to their
                     compact, she must marry Lord Dynely.</p>
                  <p>And then out of the mist of the moonlight, the face of Locksley arose, the
                     grave, reproachful eyes, the broad, thoughtful brow, the firm, resolute lips,
                     hid behind that gold, bronze beard, France thought the most beautiful on earth.
                     She covered her face with both hands as if to shut it out.</p>
                  <p>"I cannot! I cannot!" she said. "I cannot marry Eric. It is most selfish, most
                     ungenerous, most cruel to hold me to a promise I never gave."</p>
                  <p>Then there came before her a vision—a vision of what her life might be as
                     Locksley's wife. With her fortune and his genius, loving and beloved, what a
                     beautiful and perfect life would lie before her.</p>
                  <p>Suddenly the carelessly spoken words of Eric came back to her:</p>
                  <p>"One of these mysterious men who have an obnoxious wife hidden away in some
                     quarter of the globe." She turned cold at the thought. Was there anything in
                     it—anything beyond a jealous man's malicious innuendo? There was that strange
                     picture, "How The Night Fell"—his own strange remarks concerning it. Who was to
                     tell what lay in the life behind him? Somehow, he looked like a man who had a
                     secret, who had lived every day of his life, and that life no common one. She
                     sighed; her train of thought broke; she got up abruptly, closed the window, and
                     went to bed.</p>
                  <p>She was looking pale next morning when she descended to breakfast, in spite of
                     the rose-pink cashmere she wore; a shade too pale, fastidious, Eric thought,
                     but very handsome, with the ease of high-bred grace in every word and act; a
                     wife, he repeated again, who would do honor to any man in England. How well she
                     would look at St. George's in bridal veil and blossoms, white satin and Honiton
                     lace, and how all the men he knew would envy him. In his love-making, as in
                     every pursuit of life, self was ever uppermost with Lord Dynely.</p>
                  <p>"Is this one of the Locksley's painting days?" he asked after breakfast;
                     "because I want to see the picture. Does he come here or do you go there? Does
                     Mahomet come to the mountain, or does the mountain, etc.? I must have that
                     duplicate I spoke of, France. To possess the original<pb n="146-147"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000072"/> will not content me; I must have the counterfeit
                     presentment also."</p>
                  <p>This in a tender whisper and a look from under the long, blonde eyelashes that
                     had done killing execution in its time. It missed fire, however, so far as
                     France was concerned.</p>
                  <p>"I doubt if Mr. Locksley will take time to paint duplicates, Eric. Men who make
                     their mark, as he has done, do not generally devote themselves to portrait
                     painting. Here he comes now."</p>
                  <p>Her color rose as she said it—her pale cheeks took a tint rivalling her dress.
                     Lord Dynely saw it and frowned. Mentally, that is; so ugly a thing as a frown
                     seldom marred the smooth fairness of that low brow.</p>
                  <p>"Capital fellow, Locksley," he said, carelessly. "Saw a great deal of him at
                     one time in Naples. Can tell a good story, and knock off a neat after-dinner
                     speech better than any man I know. The set he lived among—painting fellows
                     all—used to drop hints, though, about that discarded wife. There is one
                     somewhere, depend upon it, and Locksley didn't act over and above well in the
                     business, it was understood."</p>
                  <p>France turned upon him, herself again, a look of cool contempt in her eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Eric, don't be ill-natured. I hate womanish men, and there's nothing on earth
                     so womanish as to slander absent friends. <emph>We</emph> do that; but let us
                     retain the copyright."</p>
                  <p>And then she turns away and goes over to Mr. Locksley, looking proud and
                     lovely, and holds out her hand in cordial welcome.</p>
                  <p>"One may have a look at the portrait, I suppose, Locksley?" Eric suggests,
                     unabashed.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Locksley assents; and they adjourn to the painting-room—Terry, who drops
                     in, following in their wake. It is in an unfinished state as yet, lacking in
                     all details, but it is a beautiful and striking picture.</p>
                  <p>From a cloud of misty drapery the face looks vividly out, the lips gravely
                     smiling, the serene eyes earnest and luminous to their very depths, an
                     etherealized expression intensifying its beauty. He has idealized it
                     unconsciously —a handsome girl has sat to him—he has painted a divinity.</p>
                  <p>France stands and looks, and her face flushes. Ah! she has never worn that
                     look. She knows she is of the earth, earthy—very little of the angel about her,
                     after all. And he has painted more an angel than a woman.</p>
                  <p>"He'm," says Eric, with his hand over his eyes, critically, "very good—very
                     pretty, indeed. Paint a halo round her and call it St. Teresa, or St. Cecelia
                     at once—it looks like that sort of thing, you know. It's a pretty picture, but
                     it isn't you, France; that is not your natural expression."</p>
                  <p>"No," France says, under her breath. "I am sorry to say it is not."</p>
                  <p>"And I prefer your natural expression," goes on Eric. "It is very well done, as
                     I said before, but it doesn't do you justice."</p>
                  <p>"And I think it is grossly flattered," puts in Terry, gruffly.</p>
                  <p>France bestows upon him a look of absolute gratitude.</p>
                  <p>"Flattered! I should think so, Terry. <emph>That</emph> face Mr. Locksley has
                     painted out of his inner consciousness, and is what France Forrester should
                     be—what, I regret to add, she is not."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Locksley takes no part in the discussion; he goes steadfastly on with his
                     work. Terry yawns loudly, whistles in an aimless way, thrusts his hands in his
                     pockets, and stares at the artist's rapid movements, until France, whose nerves
                     he sets on edge, orders him peremptorily to leave the room. Eric lingers,
                     lounging in a deep window, looking unutterably patrician and handsome in his
                     black velvet morning coat, contrasting so perfectly with his pearl-like
                     complexion and fair hair. He remains all through the sitting, he follows France
                     out into the Italian rose garden when it is over, he hangs about her like her
                     shadow all day, and makes tender little speeches when he can. At dinner it is
                     the same—in the evening it is worse. He is really and truly in earnest for the
                     time. Whilst he was sure of her he was indifferent—now that he stands a chance
                     of losing her he works himself into a fever of devotion. She is in love<pb
                        n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6444-00000073"/> with Locksley, Locksley with
                     her—that he sees. That hit about the hidden wife has stung. The green-eyed
                     monster blows the slight fire of his affection into a blaze. He will win and
                     wear Miss Forrester, or know the reason why. France endures it as long as she
                     can. That is not very long. At no time are patience and meekness her most
                     notable virtues; as Eric bends persistently over the piano for an hour at a
                     stretch, the slight thread of that patience gives way at last.</p>
                  <p>"Eric, do give me a moment's peace," she cries out. "Go and play chess with
                     your mother; go and talk to Terry or Mr. Steeves; go and make love to Miss
                     Hanford; go and smoke a cigar in the dew; anything, only leave me alone."</p>
                  <p>He starts up, his pride fairly stung.</p>
                  <p>"As you please. As I am so disagreeable to you, suppose I take myself away from
                     the Abbey altogether."</p>
                  <p>"I wish you would," she answers cordially, "for this week at least. You
                     irritate me beyond measure haunting me in this way. Leave me alone, Eric, if
                     you really care for my decision."</p>
                  <p>"If I really care!" he reproachfully repeats.</p>
                  <p>"The more generous you are, the better your chances will be. When the week is
                     up, come back if you like, for—for your answer."</p>
                  <p>"France! and if that answer be favorable. If! Good Heaven, it must be," he
                     cries.</p>
                  <p>"Then"—her voice trembles, she turns her face away from him in the glow of the
                     waxlights—"then you will never more hear me complain of your attentions."</p>
                  <p>He lifts her hand and kisses it.</p>
                  <p>"I will go," he says, gently. "Forgive me, France, but the thought of losing
                     you is so—"</p>
                  <p>"Don't," she says, in a voice that is almost one of pain. "Where will you
                     go?"</p>
                  <p>"To Lincolnshire—to Sir Philip Carruthers' place. I have had a standing
                     invitation to Carruthers' Court for the past two years."</p>
                  <p>"What's that about Lincolnshire?" Terry asks, appearing. "I'm off there—are you
                     on the wing again, Eric?"</p>
                  <p>"For a week, yes—to Carruthers'. You're a Lincolnshire man, Terry—do you know
                     it?"</p>
                  <p>"Do I not? It is three miles from Starling vicarage. Shall be glad to meet you
                     there, dear old boy. Capital fishing, best trout streams anywhere, prime
                     shooting a little later on. We will— <q>

                           <l>"'We will hunt the bear and bison, we will shoot the wild raccoon,</l>

                        </lg>
                     </q> spouts France. "There are nine pretty Misses Higgins—aren't there, Terry?
                     Don't let Eric poach on your manor—it is in his line, you know."</p>
                  <p>France was herself again. The prospect of a week to quietly think the matter
                     out was a great deal. And who knew what even a week might bring forth?</p>
                  <p>It was settled that they should go together; Lady Dynely's consent had been won
                     at last.</p>
                  <p>"But, remember," she said at parting, looking anxiously into Terry's eyes, "you
                     are to return in a week, and meantime you are to say nothing to Miss Higgins.
                     This I insist upon. When you have heard what I have to say—"</p>
                  <p>He looked at her in anxious wonder. What could it be, he thought, to make Lady
                     Dynely wear that face of pale affright? What secret was here? He would obey her
                     in all things; she hardly needed the assurance, and yet it was with a darkly
                     troubled face she stood on the portico steps and watched the two young men
                     disappear.</p>
                  <p>"Thank fortune," France breathed devoutly, "we shall have a quiet week. Men are
                     a mistake in a household, I begin to find. Like yeast in small beer, they turn
                     the peaceful stream of woman's life into seething ferment."</p>
                  <p>"France," the elder lady said, taking both the girl's hands, and looking
                     earnestly down into her eyes, "you are to give Eric his answer when he
                     returns—I know that. When does he return?"</p>
                  <p>"In a week."</p>
                  <p>"And the answer will be—"</p>
                  <p>"Lady Dynely, you have no right to ask that. When the<pb n="150-151"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000074"/> week ends, and Eric returns to claim it, the
                     answer shall be given to <emph>him</emph>."</p>
                  <p>She dropped the hands and turned away with a heavy sigh.</p>
                  <p>"I will do my duty, I hope—I pray," France went on, quietly. "If Eric's
                     happiness were involved—if, indeed, he loved me, after the tacit consent I have
                     given all these years—I would not hesitate one moment, at any sacrifice to
                     myself. But he does not love me—he is incapable of loving any one but himself.
                     Oh, yes! Lady Dynely, even you must hear the truth sometimes about Eric. As a
                     brother, I could like him well enough—be proud of his good looks, his graceful
                     manner, as you are; as a husband, if he is ever that, I shall detest him."</p>
                  <p>"France!"</p>
                  <p>"I shock, I anger you, do I not? It is true, though, and he will tire of me
                     before the honeymoon is over. If we marry, it will be a fatal mistake; and yet,
                     if you all hold me to this compact, what is left me but to yield?"</p>
                  <p>"You are a romantic girl, France; you want a hero—a Chevalier Bayard—a Sir
                     Launcelot. Dear child, there are none left. Like the fairies, they sailed away
                     from England years ago—went out of fashion with tilt and tournament. You will
                     marry Eric, I foresee, and make a man of him. He will go into parliament, make
                     speeches, and be a most devoted husband to the fairest and happiest wife in
                     England. Oh, France, take my boy! I love you so well that I will break my heart
                     if this marriage does not take place."</p>
                  <p>"And I will break mine if it does," France answers, with a curious little
                     laugh. "Let us not talk of it any more, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ma
                        mère</foreign>. We are due at De Vere's, are we not? We have a week's grace,
                     and much may happen in a week. I have the strongest internal conviction that I
                     will never be Lady Dynely."</p>

                  <p>A beauty? Well, as Tony Lumpkin says, "That's as may be." If you liked a
                     complexion of milk-white and rose-pink, the eighth Miss Higgins had it; if you
                     liked big, childish, surprised-looking, turquoise blue eyes, there they were

                     feathery aureole of palest blonde hair, the eighth Miss Higgins rejoiced in all
                     these pretty and pleasant gifts. If you fancied a waist you might span, a
                     shape, small, slim, fragile as a lily-stalk, little Crystal would have been
                     your ideal, certainly. Pretty? Yes, with a tender, dove-like, inane sort of
                     prettiness, that does its work with a certain sort of men. Mind, she had none;
                     depth, she had none; knowledge of this big, wicked world, she had none; in
                     short, she was man's ideal of perfect womanhood, infringing on no claim
                     whatever of the lordly sex. And Terry Dennison was her abject slave and
                     adorer.</p>
                  <p>She was seventeen this sunny August afternoon. It seemed to Terry he had
                     idolized her—idolized was the way Mr. Dennison thought it—ever since she had
                     been seven. She knew she was pretty—dove-like innocence to the contrary<pb
                        n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6444-00000075"/> trary—and rejoiced in that
                     prettiness as thoroughly as any embryo coquette. Had she not been caressed, and
                     kissed, and praised for those blue eyes and golden tresses ever since the days
                     of bibs and tuckers? Had she not seen her seven elder sisters snubbed and
                     passed over, and the cakes and the sugar-plums always presented to her? It
                     would be so forever, Crystal thought. In the eternal fitness of things it had
                     been ordered so—the seven elder Cinderellas worked in kitchen and chamber,
                     sewed, baked, and mended; she, like the lilies of the field, toiled not nor
                     spun. The cakes and sugar-plums of life were to be hers always; they belonged
                     by right divine to pretty people with pale yellow hair and turquoise eyes. Let
                     the snub-noses, and freckled complexions, and the dry-as-dust colored hair do
                     the work. She would marry Terry Dennison some day, and be, as Terry was, an
                     offshoot of the aristocracy. This great lady, who was Terry's patroness and
                     friend, would take her up, would present her at court, would invite her to her
                     parties, and the world of her dreams would become the world of realities. She
                     would see this handsome Lord Eric Dynely, of whom Terry never tired
                     talking—this elegant Miss France Forrester, who was to marry him. And, who
                     knew—these beings of the upper world might condescend even to admire her in
                     turn.</p>
                  <p>Miss Crystal Higgins, strolling with her Tennyson or her Owen Meredith in her
                     hand through the old vicarage garden, had dreamed her dreams, you see. That was
                     the simple little life she had mapped out for herself. She would marry
                     Terry—that was settled. Terry had never asked her, but, ah! the simplest little
                     lassie of them all can read mankind like a book when they have that complaint.
                     Terry was in love with her, had always been; she knew it just as well as Terry
                     himself. And she liked Terry very well; she wasn't in love with him at all, but
                     still she was fonder of him than of any other young man she knew; and he was a
                     dragoon, and <emph>that</emph> threw a sort of halo over him. It was a pity,
                     she was wont to sigh, regretfully, that he was so homely; even being a dragoon
                     could not entirely do away with the fact that he was homely, and had red hair.
                     None of the heroes of Miss Higgins' pet novels ever had hair of that obnoxious
                     hue. Still one mustn't expect everything in this lower world—papa and mamma
                     instilled that into her sentimental little noddle—it is only for beings of that
                     upper world—like Miss Forrester, for instance, to look for husbands handsome as
                     Greek gods, titled, wealthy. Less-favored mortals must take the goods their
                     gods provide, and be thankful. The wife of a dragoon, with five hundred a year,
                     looked a brilliant vista to the "beauty daughter" of the Vicar of Starling.</p>
                  <p>And now the question resolved itself. Why didn't Terry speak? He had written of
                     his good fortune, of Lady Dynely's boundless kindness, and the Reverend Mr. and
                     Mrs. Higgins congratulated themselves that "Crissy's" fortune was insured.
                     Crissy herself simpered and cast down her blonde eyelashes, and saw with secret
                     satisfaction, the sour and envious regards of the seven elder Misses Higgins,
                     who were verging helplessly toward the sere and yellow leaf. Then Terry wrote
                     of his speedy visit. "And I really think, Christabel, my love," said Mamma
                     Higgins, "we might begin making up the outfit. It will take some time, and of
                     course he comes down with but one intention, that of proposing immediately."
                     And a few things were commenced. The first week of August came, the big dragoon
                     with it, his frank face and good-humored eyes fairly luminous with delight at
                     being with them again. Those eager, loving eyes actually devoured Crystal; not
                     for five minutes at a stretch could they leave that pretty doll face. He
                     haunted her everywhere, as a big, lumbering Newfoundland might follow a little
                     curled, silky King Charles. He looked love, he hinted love, he acted love, in
                     ten thousand different ways, but he never spoke it. He blushed if she suddenly
                     looked at him, stammered if she suddenly addressed him, touched the little
                     lily-leaf hand she gave him with the timidity characteristic of big,
                     warm-hearted men, very far gone indeed; but beyond that he never got. "Miss
                     Crystal Higgins, will you marry me?" was a conundrum he never propounded. And
                     Mamma Higgins' matronly eyes began to look at him wrathfully over her
                     spectacles, the seven elder Misses Higgins<pb n="154-155"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000076"/> to cast sisterly, satirical glances after the
                     beauty, and Crystal herself to open those innocent turquoise orbs of hers to
                     their widest, and wonder what made Terry so awfully bashful. The last day but
                     one of the visit had come and Terry had not spoken.</p>
                  <p>It was Crystal's birthday, and there was to be a little fête; croquet in the
                     back garden—the family bleaching-ground on ordinary occasions—a tea-drinking
                     under the apple-trees afterward, and a dance by moonlight.</p>
                  <p>The company had begun to gather; but there were Mamma Higgins and the seven
                     other Misses Higgins to receive and entertain them, so Terry drew his idol's
                     hand inside his coat-sleeve, and led her away for a little last ramble "o'er
                     the moor among the heather."</p>
                  <p>"I go back to-morrow, and I cannot tell exactly how long Lady Dynely may detain
                     me, so let me gather my roses while they bloom," said Terry, growing poetical,
                     as many young gentlemen do when in love.</p>
                  <p>"It seems to me, Terry," said the eighth Miss Higgins, rather pettishly, "you
                     are a sort of companion for Lady Dynely's lap-dog, to fetch and carry, to come
                     and go, as you are told. You are too big, I should think, to let yourself be
                     treated like a little boy <emph>all</emph> your life."</p>
                  <p>It was not often Mlle. Crystal made so determined a stand as this, or uttered
                     so spirited a speech. But mamma had told her this very day that something must
                     be done; that if she couldn't bring Terry to the point herself, papa must ask
                     his intentions. A little firing of blank cartridge is very well, but if you
                     want to bring down your bird, you must use real powder and shot.</p>
                  <p>Terry's face flushed. He understood the reproof, and felt he deserved it. Love
                     may be blind, but not quite stone blind; he saw well enough what was expected
                     of him by the vicar's family, by the little beauty herself, and knew he was
                     exciting anger and blame for not doing what he was dying to do. He deserved
                     this reproof, and reddened guiltily. What if Crystal knew it was by Lady
                     Dynely's command he did not dare speak, how she would despise him? And for the
                     first time it occurred to him that perhaps it was rather unkind of that best of
                     women to have bound him to this promise.</p>
                  <p>"I should never have come down here at all until I was free to say all that is
                     in my heart," he thought. "Oh, my darling! before the sun sinks out of sight
                     yonder, you would know life holds no thought half so sweet as the thought of
                     making you my wife."</p>
                  <p>She was looking very lovely in this roseate evening light—but Terry thought
                     when did she not look lovely? She wore flowing white muslin—she was that sort
                     of ethereal creature who seemed born to wear white muslin. She had a bunch of
                     roses in her breast, roses in her sash, roses in her hand, and a
                     heart-breakingly coquettish "Dolly Varden" on her head. She had a cascade of
                     white wax beads around her long, slim throat, and knots of blue ribbon
                     streaming from her golden locks. The yellow sunshine fell full upon the perfect
                     face without finding a flaw in it; the little snowdrop of a hand rested on his
                     arm; the soft, affectionate, reproachful eyes looked up at him waiting in
                     pathetic appeal.</p>
                  <p>"You know I like you; I know you love me; then why don't you say so, Terry, and
                     please mamma and me? You have only to ask and receive; I think it is a little
                     too bad of you to go on like this." That was what that reproachful little look
                     said, and Terry groaned in spirit as he saw and understood and chafed against
                     the fetters that bound him.</p>
                  <p>"See here, Crystal," he said, "there's something I want to say to
                     you"—Crystal's heart gave a little flutter beneath the roses, Crystal's lips
                     parted in an irrepressible smile—"but I can't say it just now."</p>
                  <p>He paused, for the smile faded away, and the light blue eyes looked up in anger
                     and alarm to his face.</p>
                  <p>"I can't say it just now," pursued Mr. Dennison, with a great gulp,
                     "because—because I've promised. I don't know why, I'm sure, but there's
                     something to be told, and I'm to go back and hear it before I return and speak
                     to <emph>you</emph>."</p>
                  <p>Lucid this, certainly. With dilated eyes and parted lips, Miss Crystal Higgins
                     was staring up at him, while Terry floundered hopelessly through this morass of
                     explanation.</p>
                  <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6444-00000077"/>
                  <p>"I'm going to-morrow," went on the dragoon; "I told her I would; but I'm coming
                     back—back immediately, mind. And then I shall have something to say to you,
                     Crissy, that I've been dying to say for the past year. Today I can explain no
                     further. Only—you won't be angry with me, Crystal, and you'll be patient, and
                     trust me, and wait until I come back!"</p>
                  <p>He looked at her imploringly—a woman blind, and deaf, and dumb, might have
                     understood all he meant. But Miss Crystal was a kittenish little coquette, and
                     her eyes were cast down now, and the rose-pink color had deepened, and she was
                     pulling her roses to pieces and scattering them with a ruthless hand.</p>
                  <p>"I don't understand a word you are saying, Mr. Dennison," was her answer. "What
                     did we come here for, I wonder? Let us go back. I'm dying for a game of
                     croquet, and all the people must have come."</p>
                  <p>"Won't you promise me, then, Crystal?"</p>
                  <p>"Promise you what, Terry?"</p>
                  <p>"To wait until I return. To—to not forget me," says poor Terry, with a sort of
                     groan.</p>
                  <p>Miss Higgins laughs. When a girl's lover stands before her in an agony of
                     masculine awkwardness and bashfulness, that girl is immediately at her
                     ease.</p>
                  <p>"Wait until you return? I have no intention of running anywhere, you stupid
                     Terry. Forget you? Now how could I forget you if I tried, when your name is a
                     household word with the girls from morning until night? Do let us go back and
                     play croquet."</p>
                  <p>"Wait one moment, Crystal. I bought you this, this morning. Wear it for my sake
                     until I return, and then I will replace it with a diamond."</p>
                  <p>He produces from an inner pocket a tiny case, from the case a tiny ring of
                     pearls and turquoise only made for fairy fingers. But it slips easily over one
                     of Miss Christabel's.</p>
                  <p>"Wear it, Crystal," he says, softly, "for my sake."</p>
                  <p>And Terry kisses the little hand, and Crystal looks up in his face, and they
                     understand one another, and there is no more to be said. She is a good little
                     thing after all, and not disposed to play with her big, awkward lover. It is
                     all right; Terry is a dear, good fellow, and she will tell papa not to demand
                     his intentions.</p>
                  <p>They stand a moment still. Over the flat, distant marshes the August sun is
                     setting, turning the pools that lie between the reeds into pools of blood. The
                     distant sea lies sleeping in the tranquil light. It is very pretty—quite
                     Tennysonian, Miss Higgins pensively thinks; but her soul is with the croquet
                     players. "Let us go back, Terry," she is on the point of saying for the third
                     time, when she stops, surprised by the look Terry wears. He is staring hard
                     straight before him, a look of mingled doubt, recognition, and pleasure on his
                     face. Crystal looks too, and sees coming towards them a man.</p>
                  <p>"It is!" says Terry, in delight. "By Jove! it is!"</p>
                  <p>"It is whom, Terry?"</p>
                  <p>"Eric. I wondered he hadn't looked me up before. He has been stopping at Sir
                     Philip Carruthers' place for the last five days. Yes, it <emph>is</emph>
                     Eric."</p>
                  <p>"Eric?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Eric—Lord Dynely, you know. No, by the bye, you don't know, but you have
                     heard of him often enough from me."</p>
                  <p>Yes, Miss Higgins certainly had, and looked with a little flutter again,
                     beneath the roses, at the young nobleman approaching, who had been described to
                     her by enthusiastic Terence Dennison "as the best-looking fellow in
                     England."</p>
                  <p>Miss Higgins looked, and saw a young man of twenty-one, with fair hair,
                     handsome blue eyes, a little golden mustache, and the worn-out air of a
                     centenarian, who has used up all the pleasures of this wicked world some sixty
                     or seventy years ago.</p>
                  <p>"Eric, old boy, glad you've looked me up at last," was all Terry said, but his
                     whole face lit as if the mere sight of the other were pleasant to him. "Let me
                     present you to Miss Crystal Higgins. Crystal, the friend of my youth, the
                     playmate of my happy childhood, as the novels have it—Lord Dynely."</p>
                  <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6444-00000078"/>
                  <p>Lord Dynely lifted his hat and bowed with that courtly grace for which he was
                     celebrated. His languid eyes kindled as the warrior's when he sees the battle
                     afar off. Terry had said she was pretty. Pretty! Terry was a Vandal, a Goth;
                     the girl was a goddess!</p>
                  <p>"Are you a good one at croquet, Eric?" inquired Mr. Dennison. "If so, you may
                     come along. This is Crystal's birthday; there is a croquet party at the
                     vicarage, and good players are in demand. Crystal's past mistress of the art;
                     as the old song says: <q>

                     minutes and a half."</p>
                  <p>"If Miss Higgins will permit me, I shall only consider myself too happy,"
                     murmurs Dynely, with a look that has done its work before, and that sets
                     Crystal's foolish, rustic heart fluttering, and tremulous blushes coming and
                     going.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes, thank you!" is what she says, in her dire confusion of blushes, and
                     she clings unconsciously to Terry's arm, and feels that the days of the
                     demi-gods are not extinct, since this seraphic young nobleman exists.</p>
                  <p>"Don't be afraid, Crissy," says Terry's loud, jolly voice, as he pats the small
                     clinging hand confidingly. "Eric's not half so ferocious, bless you, as he
                     looks! Heard from France or the <foreign xml:lang="SPA">madre</foreign> since
                     you came?"</p>
                  <p>Eric gives him a look and a frown. Terry has no tact. Is this a place to talk
                     of—h'm—France?</p>
                  <p>"I had a note from my mother by this morning's post," he answers. "She bade me
                     tell you not to fail in returning. That is why I looked you up. Had I known you
                     were dwelling in paradise," he adds, gayly, "I would have hunted you up long
                     ago."</p>
                  <p>They reach the vicarage. Lord Dynely is presented to Mr. and Mrs. Higgins, the
                     Misses Higgins and their guests, and strikes all the ladies mute at once by his
                     good looks, his courtly grace of manner, his magnificent condescension. Yes, he
                     can play croquet, and play it well. He and the heroine of the fête come off
                     triumphant in every game. They play croquet, and that other classical game
                     yclept "Aunt Sally," and he lingers by Crystal's side, and for the one
                     thousandth time his inflammable fancy fires, and a new fair face enchants
                     him.</p>
                  <p>They go to tea under the gnarled old apple-trees. There is a snowy cloth,
                     old-fashioned china cups of pearl and blue, fragrant tea, home-made pound cake
                     and jelly; and Eric, whose luncheon has been a glass of sherry and a biscuit,
                     and who has not dined, makes a martyr of himself, and drinks the tea, and
                     partakes of the pound cake and jelly and helps the young ladies, and pays
                     compliments, and tells pretty little stories.</p>
                  <p>The moon has arisen before they have done, and they dance by its light to the
                     music of the jingly vicarage piano, upon which the nine Miss Higginses have
                     practised for the last twenty years. Then they adjourn to the drawing-room, and
                     there is more dancing, and presently it is eleven o'clock, and the party breaks
                     up.</p>
                  <p>"You go back to-morrow then, Dennison?" Lord Dynely asks, carelessly, as they
                     shake hands at parting.</p>
                  <p>"Yes; and you?"</p>
                  <p>"I remain two or three days longer. Carruthers wishes it, it's rather a
                     pleasant house, and he's a good fellow. Capital quarters you have here, old
                     man—a very seraglio of beauty."</p>
                  <p>"How do you like <emph>her?</emph>" Terry inquires.</p>
                  <p>"Which her? there are so many. Oh, the little queen of the revels, of course.
                     As charming a little woodland nymph as ever I saw. My taste doesn't generally
                     run to rustic beauties, but she's as sweet as one of her own roses. When am I
                     to congratulate you, Terry, my boy?"</p>
                  <p>"Soon, I hope," Terry answers, with a laugh and a happy light in his eyes; and
                     Lord Dynely looks at him with a curious smile as he rolls up a cigarette to
                     light him on his homeward way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <emph>She</emph> sees him to the gate—how he manages it no one can tell, but he
                     is exceptionally clever at these things. She goes<pb n="160-161"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000079"/> with him to the gate and gives him a shy little
                     hand across it, the hand that wears Terry's ring.</p>
                  <p>"May I come again, Crystal?"</p>
                  <p>Her name comes naturally and he speaks it. It fits her somehow, and Miss
                     Higgins is a horrible cognomen for this pearl of price. What she answers, the
                     stars and Lord Dynely alone know. It is satisfactory, doubtless, for that
                     half-smile is still on his lips as he saunters, smoking, home.</p>
                  <p>"The most charming little fairy I've seen this many a day," he thinks. "And she
                     is to marry Terry; big, uncouth, lumbering Terry. It would be a sacrilege. How
                     she blushes, and shrinks, and trembles—one sees so little of that sort of thing
                     that its novelty charms, I suppose. One of those tender little souls whose
                     heart a man could break as easily as I knock the ash off this cigarette."</p>
                  <p>It is midnight when he reaches the Court. He goes to his room, but not to bed.
                     He sits staring abstractedly out, and smoking no end of cigarettes. Wonderful
                     to relate, he is thinking. It is something which, on principle, Lord Dynely
                     never does, but he does it to-night. The result is the writing of a letter. He
                     flings away his last cigarette, sits down to his writing-desk, and dashes this
                     off:</p>

                              <p>"MY DEAR FRANCE:—Since we parted I have been thinking over what you
                                 said, and I have come to the conclusion that you were right, that
                                 it <emph>is</emph> unjust and ungenerous to hold you to a compact
                                 made without your consent. I love you devotedly—that I must ever
                                 do; but I shall never compel you to marry me if you do not love me
                                 in return. No, France, at any cost to myself, at any suffering—and
                                 that I shall suffer need I say?—I will resign all claim to your
                                 hand. Unless you feel that the devoted affection I offer, you can
                                 return, then far be it from me to force you into a loveless union.
                                    <emph>I</emph> may be wretched, but you shall be free.</p>
                              <p>"I see plainly now how selfish I have been in urging my claims upon
                                 you in the past. Unless your own heart responds, believe me, they
                                 shall never be forced upon you in the future. Write to me here—it
                                 will be less painful for both of us than a personal interview. If
                                 you can care for me, then call me back, and I will fly to you, with
                                 what joy you can imagine; if you find you cannot, then I bow my
                                 head and submit to your decision.</p>

                  <p>Here was a generous piece of composition! Lord Dynely actually felt in a glow
                     of admiration over his own nobility, generosity and self-sacrifice, as he
                     sealed and addressed it. Not every man would give up the girl he loved in this
                     heroic fashion and resign himself to life-long misery! Not many, by Jove! and
                     so France must think. Only—this in some alarm—she was an odd girl; he hoped she
                     wouldn't feel called upon to be equally generous and insist upon accepting him
                     whether or no.</p>
                  <p>By next morning's post this letter went off to Devonshire. The train that would
                     take away Terry started about 12:50. A few hours later, irreproachable in the
                     negligent elegance of his costume, Lord Dynely presented himself at the
                     vicarage door.</p>
                  <p>They were all very jolly girls, except the three eldest, who were scraggy and
                     old; but Crystal was a pearl among pebbles. She improved upon acquaintance he
                     found; she sang for him in a sweet mezzo-soprano; she wandered with him in the
                     garden, and inserted one of her rose-buds in his button-hole. She was
                     altogether delicious, and next day his lordship came again.</p>
                  <p>That evening's post brought him a letter. He turned cold as he looked at
                     it—France's bold, firm hand, and the seal and crest of the Forresters. It
                     looked big and square, and belligerent, and altogether formidable. Still it
                     must be read—six crossed pages at the least, he thought with a groan. Girls
                     never lose an opportunity of inflicting that sort of thing on their victims. He
                     opened it. It consisted of three words—three of the shortest in the
                     language:</p>

                  <head type="sub">TELLING TERRY.</head>
                  <p>ON the evening of the day that was to bring Terrence Dennison to the Abbey,
                     Lady Dynely sat alone by her chamber window waiting. It had been a sultry
                     August day; the air, even now, was oppressive, sky and atmosphere heavily
                     charged with that electricity which precedes a thunderstorm. In the breathless
                     gloaming, not a bough stirred, not a leaf trembled, not the faintest puff of
                     wind came to relieve the oppressed lungs or cool the hot forehead. Lady Dynely
                     leaned wearily against the glass. At all times pale, she was almost ghastly in
                     the livid twilight as she sat here. She was waiting for Terry, and in all the
                     years that were gone, in all the years that were to come, she was in all
                     probability the only woman who had ever trembled or faltered at the approach of
                     Terry. It was not Terry she feared, but that which she had to tell Terry, that
                     which had lain on her conscience, destroyed her peace of mind, embittered every
                     day of her life for the past sixteen years. A secret that, when given into her
                     keeping first, had been the secret of another's wrongdoing and cruelty, but
                     which had since become the secret of her sin. She was a good woman, a
                     conscientious woman, doing her duty to all men according to her light; a kind
                     mistress, charitable benefactress, a loving mother, a loyal friend. In all her
                     life she had wilfully wronged but one fellow-creature, and that one the man who
                     venerated and loved her above all women on earth—Terry.</p>
                  <p>But she was a weak woman, weak in her pride and the intensity of her love for
                     her son. That pride and that love had stood between her and duty, had sealed
                     her lips, and led her into sin. She had wronged Terry, deeply and deliberately
                     wronged him, and she had paid the penalty in a remorse morse that never left
                     her, that preyed on health of body and mind at once, that made her life
                     miserable. The burden of her guilt was a burden to be borne no longer—this
                     evening the truth should be told; then, come what might, her conscience would
                     be free.</p>
                  <p>But it was hard—how bitterly, humiliatingly hard, only her proud heart knew.
                     She dared not think of her dead husband, lest she should be tempted to hate his
                     memory; she dared not think of her son, and of the passionate anger and
                     reproach with which he would overwhelm her, should this ever reach his ears.
                     She hardly dared think of Terry—the loyal, true-hearted lad, who trusted her so
                     utterly, who believed in her so implicitly, whose affection and gratitude were
                     so profound. On all sides the path was beset with thorns, but the path must be
                     trodden.</p>
                  <p>"Help me, oh, Heaven!" was the bitter prayer of her heart; "my cross seems
                     heavier than I can bear."</p>
                  <p>There came a step she well knew down the corridor—the step for which she waited
                     and watched. There came a tap at the door. A moment she paused to gather
                     strength. Then, "Come in," she said, faintly, and Dennison entered.</p>
                  <p>She shrank back into the shadow of the curtains. In the obscurity of the twilit
                     room he could not see the fixed pallor of her face; yet something in her
                     manner, as she sat there, startled him. He advanced and took her hand.</p>
                  <p>"There is nothing the matter?" he anxiously asked. "You are not ill?"</p>
                  <p>"I am not ill," she answered, in that faint voice. "Sit down, Terry. I am going
                     to tell you a story to-night. I should have told you long ago, but I have been
                     a coward—a weak and wicked coward—and I dared not—I dared not."</p>
                  <p>He seated himself on a hassock at her feet, and looked up at her in silent
                     wonder and alarm.</p>
                  <p>"You have trusted me, Terry, been grateful to me, loved me. Ah! my poor boy!
                     that trust and love of yours have been bitter to bear. I have deserved neither
                     from you—nothing from you but contempt and scorn."</p>
                  <p>"Lady Dynely!"</p>
                  <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6444-00000081"/>
                  <p>"I have prayed for strength," she went on, "but strength did not come. I saw my
                     duty to you and to Heaven, and to my own conscience, but I would not do it. I
                     have concealed the truth, and gone on in secrecy and wronged you from first to
                     last."</p>
                  <p>"Wronged me! my dear Lady Dynely!" he exclaims, in consternation. "Do you know
                     what you are saying?"</p>
                  <p>"Ah! do I not?" she answers, bitterly. "It sounds strangely, Terry; but wait

                     </choice> heard all. Then you will despise me a thousand times more than you
                     have ever loved me."</p>
                  <p>"<emph>That</emph> I will never do," he answered, steadily. "Tell me what you
                     will, nothing will ever alter the affection and gratitude I feel for you. It
                     has grown with my growth; it is part of my life; I could almost as soon lose
                     faith in Heaven. When I cease to believe in <emph>your</emph> goodness I shall
                     cease to believe in all goodness on earth."</p>
                  <p>"Don't! don't!" she says, in a voice of sharpest pain. "Wait until you hear.
                     Terry, has it ever occurred to you to wonder why I took you from the Irish
                     cabin and charged myself with your care and education through life?"</p>
                  <p>"Well," the young man answers, in a troubled voice, "at times—yes. But I took
                     it for granted the meagre story I heard of myself was the true one. I am the
                     orphan son of some distant connection of your late husband, and, in your
                     goodness of heart, you sought me out and provided for me. That is the story, is
                     it not?"</p>
                  <p>"Ah, no, no, no!—not the story at all. <emph>My</emph> goodness of heart! What
                     bitter satire it sounds from your lips. A distant connection of my late
                     husband! Terry—you are his son!"</p>
                  <p>"Lady Dynely!"</p>
                  <p>"His son, Terry—his elder son!"</p>
                  <p>He sat stricken mute, looking at her. Was Lady Dynely insane? What was this she
                     was telling him? Lord Dynely's son! And then over Terry's face there came a
                     sudden, deep, burning flush. Lord Dynely's son.—And his mother had been a
                     peasant girl. What need to say more?—all the story was told in that.</p>
                  <p>He dropped his face in his hands like a man stunned by a blow. There are few
                     men, even the worst, who do not venerate more or less, the memory of their
                     mothers. To Terry's simple soul she had been a tender, idealized memory—to keep
                     in his heart of hearts, to speak of never. And now his father had been Lord
                     Dynely!</p>
                  <p>"Lady Dynely," he said, huskily, "why have you told me this?"</p>
                  <p>She laid her hand upon his bowed head.</p>
                  <p>"It is not as you think, Terry," she said, sadly. "I know what you mean—it is
                     not that. Your mother was Lord Dynely's wife, as truly as ever I was. You are
                     Lord Dynely's son, as truly as Eric is. More—you are Lord Dynely's heir."</p>
                  <p>He scarcely heard the last words, so swift and great a rush of joy and
                     thankfulness flooded his heart at the first.</p>
                  <p>"Thank Heaven!" she heard him whisper; "<emph>that</emph> would have been hard
                     to bear. But—Lord Dynely's son! Oh, Lady Dynely, pardon me, but I find this
                     very hard to believe."</p>
                  <p>"It is a surprise, no doubt. But do you fully understand, Terry?—You are not
                     only Lord Dynely's son, but Lord Dynely's heir."</p>
                  <p>"His heir?" he repeated, bewildered.</p>
                  <p>"You are three years older than Eric. Do you not see? Your mother was Lord
                     Dynely's wife; you are not Terrence Dennison, but Viscount Dynely."</p>
                  <p>He lifted his head and looked at her, a sort of horror in his eyes. "And Eric
                     is—what?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes—what?" Eric's mother cried, wildly. "He is Eric Hamilton—the younger son,
                     with a portion about half of what he spends yearly for cigarettes and bouquets.
                     You are the heir and the lord of the land; he is the younger son and brother.
                     That is the secret I learned to my cost sixteen years ago, by your father's
                     death-bed—the secret of my so-called generosity to you, the secret that has
                     poisoned and blighted my whole life. If I had been as strong in my wickedness
                     as I am weak, I would have kept it to the end; but that I could not do. It is
                     told; a load is off my soul at<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6444-00000082"/> last;
                     you know the truth, and my son and I are at your mercy."</p>
                  <p>Then there was long and deep silence in the room. She was sitting upright in
                     her chair, her face gleaming out like marble in the gray gloom, her slender
                     hands clenched together in her lap, her eyes dry and haggard, looking straight
                     into vacancy. For Dennison, he sat stunned, absolutely stunned, trying with his
                     whole might to realize this. His head was in a whirl. He Lord Dynely's eldest
                     son and heir!—not Terry Dennison, the dependant, the poor relation, but a peer
                     of the realm! Eric, lordly Eric, his younger brother, with no claim to the
                     title he bore, to the thousands he squandered! Not a powerful mind at any time,
                     never a deep-thinking brain at best, mind and brain were in a helpless whirl
                     now.</p>
                  <p>"Tell me all about it," was the first thing he said, in his dazed
                     bewilderment.</p>
                  <p>She drew a long, heavy breath, and set herself to the task. The worst had been
                     told—it was bitter almost as the bitterness of death, and yet it was easier
                     telling Terry than telling most men. Her secret had weighed upon her so long,
                     tortured her so unbearably, that she absolutely felt a sense of relief
                     already.</p>
                  <p>"Tell you all?" she repeated; "it seems very little to tell when all is told. I
                     suppose most of life's tragedies can be told in few words—this certainly. On
                     the night of Lord Dynely's death—sixteen years ago this very night; was it not
                     fit to choose that anniversary?—I learned it first myself. I recall that night
                     so well—like no other in all my life. My cousin had come to me—you have heard
                     of him, Gordon Caryll, poor fellow!—to tell me his story. It was a brilliant
                     moonlight night. Arm-in arm we walked round the fish-pond, while he told me his
                     life's tragedy, in brief, bitter words. I see it all," she said, looking before
                     her with dewy eyes, her voice softening, "like a picture. The white light of
                     the moon, the long, black shadows, the fish-pond like a sheet of circular
                     glass, the scent of the flowers, and the coolness of the evening wind. There he
                     said good-by—and he left me, my poor Gordon! and I have never seen him since.
                     That man, Locksley, reminds me of him somehow; my heart warms to him whenever
                     we meet for that chance resemblance."</p>
                  <p>She paused. She had drifted from the thread of her story, thinking of the
                     soldier cousin from whom she had parted this night sixteen years ago.</p>
                  <p>"He left me," she continued, after that pause, "and I still lingered out there,
                     thinking what a mistake life was for most of us, how we seem to miss the right
                     path, where happiness lies, and love and ambition alike lead us astray. He had
                     married for love—I for ambition; the end was the same to both—darkest,
                     bitterest disappointment. I had never cared for Lord Dynely; he was many years
                     my senior, and, though I never was a sentimental girl, all the liking I ever
                     had to give had been given to Gordon Caryll. I had to do my duty as a wife in
                     all things, but I was not a happy wife, had never been; and, when they brought
                     me word my husband had met with an accident and lay dying, it was the horror we
                     feel for the merest stranger who meets a tragic end that filled me, not the
                     despairing sorrow of a loving wife.</p>
                  <p>"I hastened to him. He lay dying indeed—life was but just there when I reached
                     him. But he was a man of most resolute will; he would <emph>not</emph> die
                     until he had seen me. He had been very fond of me—ah, yes! I never doubted
                     that, in his own selfish, passionate way, he was very fond of his wife. He had
                     spared himself all his life, but now that he lay dying he would not spare me.
                     Thorough and utter selfishness has ever been the chief characteristic of his
                     race—I wonder sometimes, Terry, how you managed to escape."</p>
                  <p>She paused again and sighed. She was thinking of her son. Blindly, devotedly as
                     she loved and admired him, she could not be utterly blind to his faults.
                     Thoroughly and absolutely selfish all the Dynelys had been, thoroughly and
                     utterly selfish was the last Lord Dynely.</p>
                  <p>"As I knelt by his bedside there, Terry, he told me in few and broken sentences
                     the sad and shameful story. In his wanderings through Galway he had met Maureen
                     Gannon, a dark, Spanish-looking beauty, as many of these Galway<pb n="168-169"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000083"/> way girls are, and, in his usual hot-headed
                     fashion, he fell in love with her. He had been noted for running recklessly
                     after any woman who struck his fancy his life long; another trait of his you
                     seem to have escaped and my poor Eric to have inherited. You know what Irish
                     girls are—the purest women under heaven—love-making that did not mean marriage
                     was utter madness. He was mad where his own selfish gratification was
                     concerned. He married Maureen Gannon."</p>
                  <p>Again she paused, catching her breath with a painful effort. It was quite dark
                     now, and the rising wind, precursor of coming storm, soughed through the park.
                     An elm just outside tapped with spectral fingers on the glass. She shuddered as
                     she heard it, and drew closer to her silent and listening companion.</p>
                  <p>"He had called himself Dennison from the first, and under that name he married
                     her. The ceremony was performed in the little rustic chapel by the parish
                     priest. Of his class and friends there were naturally none present; her humble
                     friends and family—that was all.</p>
                  <p>"He took her away at once, and they saw no more of her at home until she
                     returned to die. She came back with you in her arms, and the story of her life
                     was at an end. It was such an old story—hot fancy at first, cooling fancy
                     after, coldness, indifference, utter neglect, and finally desertion. She died,
                     and you were left, and Lord Dynely was free to woo and win another.</p>
                  <p>"I was that other. Of the girl whose heart he had broken, of his only child in
                     poverty and neglect in Ireland, I believe he never once thought—until Eric was
                     born, and then remorse and alarm awoke within him for the first time. She had
                     been his lawful wife, you were his lawful son and heir. He loved me, as I say,
                     in his selfish fashion; he also loved little Eric, and a great fear of the
                     future of his youngest son began to come to him.</p>
                  <p>"But he told no one, he took no steps about you, he just drifted on to the end,
                     putting all troublesome thoughts away from him, as was the habit of his life.
                     Only when he lay dying this night, and thought that in some other world he
                     might have to atone for the crimes of this, he turned coward—once more self
                     became his first thought. What did it matter what became of Eric or me so that
                     he atoned and escaped the consequences of his wrongdoing. He sent for me and
                     told the truth.</p>
                  <p>"'You'll find it all down in writing in my desk,' he said. 'I've made a clean
                     breast of it. The marriage certificate and the youngster's baptismal record are
                     there too. The law might pick a flaw in an Irish marriage like that, but,
                     Lucia, when a man comes to die he sees these things in another light from the
                     law of the world. I couldn't meet that poor girl in the next world, as I
                        <emph>may</emph>, and look her in the face, and know the wrong I've done her
                     son. He's the heir, Lucia, mind that—not Eric, poor little beggar. And I want
                     you to do, when I am gone, what I never had courage to do myself—the right
                     thing by that little lad in Ireland. My first marriage must be proven, and the
                     young one come to his rights. You are provided for in any case, as my richly
                     dowered widow, and your boy will have a younger son's portion. But the one in
                     Ireland, poor Maureen's boy, is the heir, mark that.'</p>
                  <p>"I knelt beside him, Terry, listening to this dreadful revelation, frozen with
                     a horror too intense for words or tears. I have loved Eric from the day of his
                     birth I think with four-fold mother love; he has all I had; his father did not
                     share my heart with him, as is the happy case of most mothers. He was all I had
                     on earth—all; and now I was called upon to stand aside, to take him with me,
                     and give his title and estates to another woman's son. Terry," she cried out
                     "he asked more than human nature could give."</p>
                  <p>Her voice broke in that fierce, hysterical, sobbing cry. Dennison took both her
                     hands in his and held them in that strong but gentle clasp.</p>
                  <p>"I think he did," he answered sadly.</p>
                  <p>"He died as I knelt there," she went on, "his glazing eyes fixed threateningly
                     on my face to the end.</p>
                  <p>"'Mind,' he said to me, 'that you see justice done. I couldn't do it; you must.
                     I won't rest easy in my grave unless you promise. Promise me you will seek out
                     this boy,<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6444-00000084"/> and see him righted before
                     the world. Promise.' They were his last words. But the promise was never
                     given—I couldn't speak—not to save his life as well as my own. I knelt there
                     stunned, stupefied, dazed, soul and body. While he still looked at me the awful
                     death rattle sounded. His eyes were fixed in ghastly threat on my face when the
                     film of death sealed them. I remember no more. Some one, after a time, came to
                     me, and I fell back and all was darkness.</p>
                  <p>"They buried him, and Eric and I went to the funeral as chief mourners! They
                     put black on my boy; I tore it off in horror. Mourning for the father who had
                     so bitterly wronged him—no! I wore it, but there was no mourning, only fierce
                     rebellion and passionate anger, in my heart. They put up a marble tablet
                     recording his social and domestic virtues, and under the glowing record,
                        '<emph>His works do follow him</emph>.' Ah, yes, they followed him—in
                     bitterness and remorse and shame. I could have laughed aloud at the hollow
                     satire of it all. I believe my mind to a certain degree gave way, my health
                     began to fail. I had a horrible dread of this man, dead in his grave; that
                     night and its revelations haunted me like some ghastly nightmare. I could
                     not—would not obey. I trembled with horror at refusing, it seemed so awful to
                     deliberately disobey a dying command. He couldn't rest easy in his grave, he
                     had said, if I disobeyed. A sickening, superstitious fear that he might rise
                     from that unquiet grave and pursue me, nearly froze me at times with terror. I
                     believe the struggle would have ended in insanity if it had gone on, but the
                     medical men ordered me to Italy for change of air. I went to Galway instead,
                     and found you. The rest you know. I compromised with my conscience, paltered
                     with the truth. As my own son you should be reared and educated; share all his
                     advantages—all but my affection. That, my poor Terry, much as you deserved it,
                     I could not give. The horror and hatred I was wicked enough to feel for your
                     father I was wicked enough to feel for you. One day I thought, perhaps when I
                     was dying myself I would tell you; meantime your life should be as easy and
                     pleasant as money could make it. When we are wronged, not knowing we are
                     wronged, our loss is nothing. Eric should never give up his title and estates
                     to you, the son of an Irish peasant girl—his life should never be blighted at
                     the dying command of a cruel, and selfish, and sensual father. I would
                        <emph>not</emph> tell the truth.</p>
                  <p>"I have said that ten thousand times, Terry, and the years have gone on, and
                     you are both men. His majority comes in a few days; France is to be his wife,
                     the girl in Lincolnshire yours. I vowed I would not tell, and I am telling. I
                     have prayed passionate, rebellious prayers, wearied Heaven with them, to know
                     the right, and be given strength to do it. That strength has been given to me
                     at last—my duty is done. You know the truth—how shamefully all your life long
                     you have been wronged and cheated. Here are the papers Lord Dynely left; I am
                     prepared to repeat the story in any court in England. All that seems easy,
                     but—when I think of Eric, it breaks my heart."</p>
                  <p>Her voice died away in a choking sob. She knew so well Eric's passionate anger,
                     his fierce rage and protest; how he would do battle to the death with his
                     interloper; how he would, in his stormy, selfish wrath, curse the father and
                     hate the mother. Hate her! Ay, his life long; your weak and selfish men are
                     good haters always. Why had she not held her tongue?—how dared she speak?—what
                     were the cowardly dying fears of ten thousand fathers to his birthright? Was
                     this her pretended love for him? Let it end how it might he would never forgive
                     her, never see her face again. She knew what would follow as well as she knew
                     that she sat here.</p>
                  <p>She placed a packet in Terry's hand. He loosened his clasp of hers and took it
                     in dead silence. Even he, she thought in her bitter despair, was turning
                     against her already. And this is what it was to do one's duty.</p>
                  <p>"There is no more to tell," she said, in a stifled voice. "Go away, Terry, and
                     leave me alone."</p>
                  <p>He arose, but lingeringly, and stood looking at her. In the deep darkness that
                     now filled the room he could see but the outline of her figure and the white,
                     rigid gleam of her face.</p>
                  <pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6444-00000085"/>
                  <p>"I don't know what to say yet," he began, in a constrained voice, that did not
                     sound like Terry's. "I feel stunned and stupefied. My head is in a muddle. It
                     is all so strange. You will give me to-night to think it over—will you
                     not?"</p>
                  <p>"What have I to do with it?" she answered, huskily. "All is in your own hands
                     now. You are master. You are Lord Dynely."</p>
                  <p>"You are not angry with me?" he asked, wistfully, still hesitating.</p>
                  <p>It was a question he had asked her many times in his life, when her look of
                     half-concealed dislike had repelled and chilled him, and he had wondered
                     timidly what he had done to vex her. Its wistful, boyish pathos and simplicity
                     went to her heart now.</p>
                  <p>"Angry with you!" she said, with a sob. "Oh my Terry! you never gave me cause
                     for anger in all your life."</p>
                  <p>"I am glad of that," he said, simply; "I hope I never will. And, Lady Dynely,"
                     hesitating again, "my opinion cannot matter to you, of course; but I hope you
                     feel, I want you to feel, that I don't blame you in all this. I understand how
                     you must have felt—it was too much to ask of any mother—you would have been
                     more than mortal to have acted as he commanded you."</p>
                  <p>She only looked up at him in the darkness with sad, hopeless eyes.
                        "<emph>You</emph> would have done it, Terry," she said.</p>
                  <p>"No—I don't know. I am not very heroic, and it requires heroism to do these
                     things. I am an awkward, blundering sort of fellow, not much like Eric, but I
                     think I could more easily die than deliberately wrong any one I cared for to
                     gratify myself. You know what I mean, Lady Dynely. Don't grieve too much over
                     this; I can't bear to see you in trouble. All will go well yet. Eric—Eric does
                     not know, of course?"</p>
                  <p>"Not yet! oh, not yet! <emph>That</emph> will be the hardest to bear of
                     all."</p>
                  <p>He knelt on one knee, and for the first time in all his life touched his lips
                     to her cheek.</p>
                  <p>"Mother," he said, and love made Terry's voice like an angel's, "mother, the
                     best friend, the truest, man ever had, don't grieve. All will go well. To-night
                     I will think it over—to-morrow we will make an end of it forever."</p>
                  <p>Then he arose softly and left her.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THINKING IT OUT.</head>
                  <p>THAT night, for the first time in the four-and-twenty years of his life, Terry
                     Dennison sat up until the "wee sma' hours ayont the twal," and thought.
                     Thought!—of all novel experiences, this surely was the most novel in this
                     supremely thoughtless young man's life. The good or the evil of Terry's life,
                     and there had been much of both, had alike been unpremeditated; in all things
                     he had acted naturally and involuntarily, and without thinking of it
                     beforehand. Now in a moment he was called upon to settle the destinies of four
                     lives—his own, Eric's, Lady Dynely's and little Crystal's. A sort of smile came
                     over his face as he thought of it—he the arbitrator of brilliant Eric's whole
                     future life—he, Terry.</p>
                  <p>But the smile quickly faded as he entered the room and laid the little packet
                     her ladyship had given him down upon the table, and looked at the yellow paper,
                     the faded writing. The father who had wronged him so greatly, who had so
                     irreparably wronged his mother, and written this—had striven to do him justice
                     when that justice could no longer annoy himself. He had served Satan all his
                     life, and would make his peace with Heaven at the last, at any sacrifice to
                     those left behind. He had lived a life of sin and sensualism, and would offer
                     the dregs of that bad life to his Creator. There was more a feeling of disgust
                     in Terry's breast than any other as he looked at the faded writing and thought
                     of him who had written it, dust and ashes years ago.</p>
                  <p>"And his works do follow him!"</p>
                  <p>He sat down and looked blankly before him. He was Lord Dynely's elder son; no
                     longer plain, impecunious Terry Dennison, a dependant on a great lady's bounty,
                     but Viscount Dynely, with estates and mansions in half a dozen counties, a
                     villa at Ryde, a rent-roll as long as his lineage. And he could make Crystal,
                     Lady Dynely. His face flushed for a moment at that. All that might be spread
                     before him, a glittering vista. He was one of the least mercenary of men, but
                     he had lived too long in the world not to know the great and utter change it
                     would make in his life. One of the oldest titles in the United Kingdom, one of
                     the noblest incomes—that is what he was called upon to claim or resign
                     to-night. For a moment, as he thought of it, his heart beat quick. He was very
                     human after all, and this was no child's toy he must lay down or take up. Men
                     called Terry Dennison a good fellow—rather a simple soul, perhaps, but a good
                     fellow all the same. He had few enemies and many friends, but in their liking
                     for him there was more or less blended a slight shade of contempt. He was one
                     of them, but not of them. His manners and habits were primitive to a degree. He
                     wasn't a "plunger," as they were to a man; didn't drink, to speak of; didn't
                     gamble at all; hunted down no woman, married or single, to her own destruction.
                     He was behind his age in all these things, in a most remarkable degree. Still
                     men liked him, and laughed with Terry, and at Terry, and never carried their
                     laughter too far. He was the soul of good-nature, but there was that in his six
                     feet of stature, his trained muscles, and scientific British way of "hitting
                     out straight from the shoulder," on occasions, that commanded respect. In the
                     annual battles between "Town and Gown," at Oxford, Dennison had ever been a
                     host in himself. In all athletic and field sports he stood his own with the
                     best of them. He was a "mighty hunter before the lord," down in the shires; but
                     in the ball-room and the boudoir, at court and at courting, Terry was decidedly
                     a failure. He never lost his heart for barronne or ballerina, duchess or
                     actress; he ran away with no man's wife, wasn't a fascinating sinner of any
                     sort. He had his failings, they were many—he had his virtues, they were many
                     too, and generosity stood chief among them. To give pain to a woman, to
                        <emph>any</emph>
                     <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6444-00000087"/> woman—to a woman he loved and
                     venerated, as he did Lady Dynely, would have been impossible to him; and in
                     asserting this claim before the world he would simply break Lady Dynely's
                     heart.</p>
                  <p>Wrong had been done. Yes; but, to Terry's mind, hardly by her. She loved her
                     handsome son, as few sons ever deserve to be loved, and Eric Hamilton certainly
                     did not. How, then, loving him, could she deliberately, and at the command of a
                     selfish and cowardly husband, hand over his birthright to a stranger, and
                     blight his whole life? Lord Dynely had asked too much; it was not in frail
                     human nature to do it. He had been wronged, but not by her. Why, she might have
                     left him all his life in that Irish cabin by the wild Galway coast, to drag out
                     the wretched, unlettered life of a peasant. Who then would have been the wiser?
                     But she had come for him, and in all things done by him as her own son. And
                     now, at last, she had told him all, and, at all cost to herself, was ready to
                     prove the truth of her words. Then his thoughts drifted to Eric. He saw Eric's
                     rage and fury as plainly as he saw the paper on the table, the blue eyes lurid
                     with rage, the fair, womanish face crimson with anger and rebellion. Eric would
                     do battle to the death, would contest every inch of the ground. The sympathy
                     would be with Eric; possession, the "nine points of the law," would be with
                     Eric; the glory and the power were Eric's;—what chance would he stand? There
                     would be an endless chancery suit, the kingdom would ring with the scandal, the
                     informal Irish marriage would be contested; perhaps in the eye of the law,
                     proven no marriage at all. And, meantime, Lady Dynely would have broken her
                     heart at the shame and publicity, and ended her part of the tragedy. No, had he
                     been ever so inclined, as selfishly bent on his own interests as Eric himself,
                     the thing was impossible on the face of it. But he was not. It was really very
                     little of a sacrifice to him. He had no ambition whatever—he was, I have said,
                     a most commonplace young man. Life as he held it contented him. With his
                     commission, his five hundred a year, and Crystal for his wife, the world might
                     wag; he asked no more of fate.</p>
                  <p>With a long-drawn breath he broke from his reverie; with a motion of his hand
                     he seemed to dismiss the whole thing at once and forever.</p>
                  <p>He lit a cigar, opened the little packet and looked at the papers. The marriage
                     certificate, the record of his baptism, his father's brief, terse confession of
                     his own marriage to the Galway girl, under the name of Dennison. He read them
                     all gravely and tied them up again.</p>
                  <p>"Poor soul," he thought, "it was hard lines on <emph>her</emph>. No, my Lord
                     Dynely, you did harm enough in your lifetime; we won't let you do any more in
                     your grave."</p>
                  <p>He rose up, went to the open window and smoked away meditatively. What was
                     Crystal doing? Ah, asleep no doubt, little darling, his ring on her finger and
                     thoughts of him in her heart. He would go down to-morrow, and tell her what had
                     been in <emph>his</emph> heart so long. He could see the dear little face,
                     dimpling and smiling, and blushing, hear the dear little voice faltering forth
                     its tender confession, and Terry's whole soul was in one glow of love and
                     gratitude and rapture. How happy he would make her life, how devotedly he would
                     cherish his little stainless lily, how sweet it would be to care for her, and
                     devote his whole existence to her. Yes, to-morrow he would go down, and before
                     Christmas they would be married, and then—well, Terry was not imaginative—and
                     then they would live happy forever after.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Dennison was not an early riser. The early bird that catches the worm was
                     no kin of his. All the clocks and watches of Dynely were sharply marking the
                     hour of one, when, in freshest morning toilet, shaven and shorn, he presented
                     himself before Lady Dynely.</p>
                  <p>"My dear Lady Dynely," he began, and there stopped.</p>
                  <p>Good Heaven! what a ghastly, terrified face he saw. White with a pallor like
                     death, lips blue and parched, eyes haggard and hopeless. She had slept not at
                     all—she had spent the whole night in fevered pacing to and fro, half maddened
                     at the thought of what she had done, of what might be. The world would know.
                     Eric would know—there lay the bitterness of death. Terry was generous, but<pb
                        n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6444-00000088"/> to her the generosity that would
                     hide this from the world looked more than mortal.</p>
                  <p>She stood up and confronted him, one hand holding by her chair, her haggard
                     eyes fixed upon his face. So might look a terrified woman waiting for sentence
                     of death. She tried to speak—her dry lips trembled, only a husky sound
                     came.</p>
                  <p>He was by her side in a moment, holding both hands fast in his, full of pity
                     and remorse. How she had suffered. Why had he kept her in suspense even for a
                     single night? How little she knew him, when she could fear him like this. It
                     gave him a pang of absolute pain.</p>
                  <p>"Lady Dynely—my dearest mother—you did not think I could ever use the secret
                     you told me last night? If you did, then you have certainly wronged me. I loved
                     you too well, Eric too well, ever to dream of such shameful, selfish
                     ingratitude. Look here!"</p>
                  <p>He drew out the packet, took a match, struck it, and touched it to a corner of
                     the paper, then threw it in the grate.</p>
                  <p>She uttered a gasping cry—a cry he never forgot—then stood spellbound.</p>
                  <p>With fascinated eyes both watched the paper shrivel, then blaze up, then a
                     cloud of black drift floated up the chimney, and the record of the Irish
                     marriage was at an end.</p>
                  <p>"With that ends our secret," Terry said. "Living or dying, a word of what you
                     told me will never pass my lips."</p>
                  <p>She fell heavily forward, her arms around his neck, her face on his shoulder,
                     shaking from head to foot with dry, hysterical sobbing. He held her close;
                     neither spoke a word, and there were tears big and bright in Terry's round blue
                     eyes. Then very gently he put her back in her chair and knelt down before
                     her.</p>
                  <p>"Don't," he said, pleadingly; "it hurts me to hear you. How could you think I
                     would do what you feared? What a wretch you must have thought me."</p>
                  <p>"A wretch! Oh, my Terry, my Terry! You are more an angel than a man!"</p>
                  <p>Terry laughed. It was all very solemn, but the idea of Terry Dennison in the
                     rôle of angel, tickled the dragoon's lively sense of the ludicrous, and that
                     merry schoolboy laugh of his pealed forth.</p>
                  <p>"I beg your pardon, Lady Dynely," Terry said, struggling manfully with that
                     explosion; "that's a little too good. You are the first, I give you my word,
                     who ever accused me of angelic qualities. And I don't deserve it—oh, I assure
                     you I don't—it isn't any sacrifice to me. I am not an ambitious sort of fellow,
                     nor a clever fellow, nor a brilliant fellow, like Eric. As a dragoon, with five
                     hundred a year and the dearest little girl in England for my wife, I am a round
                     peg, fitting neat and trim in a round hole. As a nobleman, with title and
                     estates, and the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">noblesse oblige</foreign> business to
                     do, I would be an object of pity to gods and men. Eric was born a darling of
                     fortune; I was born—plain Terry Dennison."</p>
                  <p>She looked at him with sad, yearning, wondering eyes. Her arms still loosely
                     clasped his neck as he knelt before her.</p>
                  <p>"Plain Terry Dennison!" she repeated; "Terry, you are the stuff heroes are made
                     of. Eric is not like you—ah, if he only were! Where did you get this generous
                     heart, this great, grateful soul of yours? You have your father's face—ay, you
                     are like him to the very color of his hair. You have his face—Eric, I fear—I
                     fear his heart."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Eric isn't half a bad fellow," responded Terry, uneasily. He was
                     uncommonly fond of Lady Dynely, but he was only a man, and the heroics were
                     becoming a little too much for him. "Don't let's talk about it any more. Let
                     all be as though you had never told, as though I were in reality what I have
                     all along considered myself—a distant connection of a very grand family. If—,"
                     Terry's head drooped a little and his color rose—"if it makes you ever so
                     little fonder of me, Lady Dynely, then, as the goody sort of novels say, 'I
                     shall not have labored in vain.'"</p>
                  <p>She bent forward and kissed him, for the first time in her life, as fondly as
                     she might have kissed Eric.</p>
                  <p>"Who could help being fond of you, Terry? That girl<pb n="180-181"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000089"/> in Lincolnshire is a happy and fortunate girl,
                     indeed. I know you are dying to go back to her, but just at present I feel as
                     though I could not let you out of my sight. My wonderful good fortune, your
                     wonderful generosity, seem altogether unreal. If I lose you I shall doubt and
                     fear, and grow wretched again. My nerves are all unstrung. Stay with me yet a
                     few days, Terry—the happiness of your life is all before you—until I have
                     learned to realize how blessed I am."</p>
                  <p>It was a far greater sacrifice, had she but known it, than the sacrifice he
                     made in resigning all claim to title and fortune. But he made it promptly and
                     gratefully.</p>
                  <p>"I will remain a week," he said; "as I have waited so long, a few more days
                     will not signify."</p>
                  <p>He wrote down to Lincolnshire. A week would pass before he could be with them,
                     but he was surely coming, and meantime he was "Hers devotedly, Terry."</p>
                  <p>The order of release came at last. Armed with his ring, a half-hoop of diamonds
                     to fit the dearest little engagement finger on earth, Mr. Dennison started, one
                     bright August morning, on his way. The birds were singing, the sun was shining,
                     the grass was as green as though it had been painted and varnished, the sky was
                     without a cloud. So was his sky, Terry thought; and in faultless summer
                     costume, looking happy and almost handsome, his long limbs stretched across on
                     the opposite cushions of the railway carriage, he was whirled away to Starling
                     vicarage. <q>

                     weeks. Is he at Carruthers' still, and what's the dear boy's little game now, I

                  <head type="sub">AT THE PICNIC.</head>
                  <p>WITH that brilliant light of the August afternoon pouring down over everything
                     like amber rain, Mr. Dennison opened the little wicket gate and made his way
                     into the vicarage. It was all ablaze with double roses, and honeysuckle, and
                     verbena, and geranium, and fuchsia, and the summer air was sweet with drifts of
                     perfume. All the windows and doors of the vicarage stood open, but a Sabbath
                     silence reigned. As his lofty six feet darkened the parlor doorway, the only
                     occupant of that apartment looked up from her sewing with a little surprised
                     scream. It was the eldest and scraggiest of the three elder Misses Higgins.</p>
                  <p>"Lor!" cried Miss Higgins, "what a turn you gave me. Is it you, Terry? Who'd
                     have thought it? Come in. You see I wasn't expecting anybody to-day, and all
                     the rest are off but Belinda and me, and—"</p>
                  <p>"Off!" cried Terry, blankly; "off where, Arabella?"</p>
                  <p>"Off to the picnic. Oh, I forgot, you don't know. Sir Philip Carruthers, Lord
                     Dynely, and some of the gentlemen stopping at the Court, have organized a
                     picnic, and all the rest have gone. I and Belinda were invited, but some one
                     must stay home and do the work, while the others gad. Belinda's in the kitchen,
                     making jam—I'm sewing for Crystal. It's always the way," said the elder Miss
                     Higgins, bitterly; "'this little pig goes to market, and this little pig stays
                     at home.' I've been the one to stay at home all my life."</p>
                  <p>"Where's the picnic, Bella?" asked Terry, briskly.</p>
                  <p>For a moment—a moment only—he had felt inclined to be disappointed at this
                     contretemps; now it was all right again.</p>
                  <pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6444-00000090"/>
                  <p>"At Carruthers Court, of course," Bella answered. "They have had no end of
                     water parties, and garden parties, and croquet parties, and junketings since
                     you went away. Crystal's growing a regular gadabout, and so I tell mamma. A
                     chit of a child like that ought to be in the nursery for the next two years,
                     instead of flirting and carrying on with gentlemen in the way she does. I never
                     did such a thing when I was a—oh, he's off. Another of little missy's victims,
                     I suppose. What fools men are."</p>
                  <p>The eldest Miss Higgins, aged thirty-five, was not vicious, as a rule, but the
                     blind neglect of mankind during the last fifteen years had rather soured the
                     milk of human kindness in her vestal bosom. She went back to her sewing, and
                     Terry went to the picnic.</p>
                  <p>The walk was a long one, the afternoon, as I have before remarked, hot. The
                     summer fields lay steeped in sunshine, the scarlet poppies nodding in the faint
                     breeze. Terry's complexion was the hue of the poppies by the time he reached
                     the festal ground. Tents and marquees everywhere dotted the sward; the military
                     brass band discoursed sweet music beneath the umbrageous foliage; archery,
                     croquet, dancing and other sports, in which the youthful and frivolous mind
                     delights, were going on. Girls in white, girls in blue, girls in pink, girls in
                     lilac and green, dotted the velvet sward like gorgeous posies, but the girl of
                     his heart Mr. Dennison could nowhere behold.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, Terry, my lad," said the Rev. Samuel Higgins, extending one clerical hand
                     in a black thread glove, "how are you? When did you come?"</p>
                  <p>"Just now. Where's—I mean where are the girls?"</p>
                  <p>"Amelia, and Josephine, and Emiline are yonder, engaged in archery; Cornelia
                     and Victoria are playing croquet; Evangeline is with her mother, and Elizabeth
                     Jane was with me a moment ago. Arabella and Belinda are at home," answered
                     calmly the Reverend Samuel.</p>
                  <p>"I saw Bella. Where's Crystal?" asked Mr. Dennison, in desperation.</p>
                  <p>"Crystal is—ahem!" said the Reverend Mr. Higgins, looking meekly about through
                     his spectacles. "I don't see Crystal. Elizabeth Jane, my child, where is
                     Christabel?"</p>
                  <p>"Crissy's gone off for a sail with Lord Dynely, pa," answered in a pert tone
                     the seventh Miss Higgins, with a sharp glance at Mr. Dennison. "If you want to
                     find them, Terry, <emph>I'll</emph> guide you."</p>
                  <p>Elizabeth Jane took Mr. Dennison's arm and led him briskly across meadows, down
                     woody slopes, to where, between two sloping hills, a broad mere, a miniature
                     lake, lay. And there, half-way out, went floating a little white boat like a
                     great water lily, and in that boat a young gentleman and a young lady sat.</p>
                  <p>"That's Criss," said Elizabeth Jane, sharply, "and that's Lord Dynely. I don't
                     know what Lord Dynely's intentions may be, but if I were pa I would ask."</p>
                  <p>Terry's face flushed. He turned suddenly and looked at her with a sharp
                     contraction of the heart.</p>
                  <p>"What do you mean, Lizy Jane?"</p>
                  <p>"This," said the seventh and sharpest of the Misses Higgins, "that Lord Dynely
                     comes a great deal too often to the vicarage, and pays a great deal too marked
                     attention to our Criss for an engaged man. He is an engaged man, isn't he,
                     Terry?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes—no—I don't know—Elizabeth Jane, you don't mean to say that Crystal
                     has—has"—his ruddy complexion turned white—"fallen in love with Lord
                     Dynely?"</p>
                  <p>"I don't know anything about it," retorted Elizabeth Jane, still sharply; "I
                     don't go mooning about myself, reading novels and poetry books, week in and
                     week out; I have my district visiting, and Bible society, and Dorcas meetings
                     to attend. I don't know anything about falling in love and that sentimental
                     rubbish," says Elizabeth Jane, her black eyes snapping; "but I do know, if I
                     were pa, I'd not have a gay young nobleman loafing about my house from morning
                     until night, flirting with my prettiest daughter, taking moonlight rambles, and
                     sunlight rambles, and early morning rambles, and lying on the grass at her feet
                     for hours at a stretch, reading Meredith and Tennyson, and holding skeins of
                     silk for her, and singing duets with her, and—bah!" says<pb n="184-185"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000091"/> Elizabeth Jane, with snappishness, "if pa had
                     three pairs of glasses he wouldn't see what goes on under his nose."</p>
                  <p>"And they carry on like this!" Terry asked, in blank dismay.</p>
                  <p>"Like this! You ought to see them. You can't so much as mention his name to
                     Crystal but she blushes to the roots of her hair. I've told pa, Bella's told
                     pa—what's the use? 'Tut, tut, tut, children; let the little one enjoy herself.
                     He's only a good looking boy, she's only a child.' That's what pa says. Queer
                     sort of child's play, I think. And ma, she's worse. We all know what ma thinks,
                     that she'll have a 'my lady,' for her daughter. I've no patience with such
                     folly!" cries the practical and matter-of-fact Miss Elizabeth Jane Higgins.</p>
                  <p>Terry stands dead silent. The ruddy heat has faded out of his complexion,
                     leaving him very pale. He looks with blank eyes at the shining water. The
                     little white boat has turned a wooded bend and disappeared. Crystal is singing
                     now.</p>
                  <p>Her sweet voice comes to them where they stand. The clear tenor tones of Dynely
                     blend presently with hers. They stand silent both, until the last note of the
                     music dies away.</p>
                  <p>"Come," says Elizabeth Jane, looking up in Terry's face, and not without a
                     touch of compassion in her own. She likes Terry; she is engaged to the Rev.
                     Edwin Meeke, her father's curate, whose name but faintly sets forth his nature,
                     and can afford to be sisterly and practical, and her liking for the big dragoon
                     is beyond reproach. "Only if you're a friend of Miss France Forrester and our
                     Crystal, drop Lord Dynely a hint to make his vicarage visits more like angels',
                     few and far between."</p>
                  <p>She leads him back. But the glory has gone out of the heavens, the beauty from
                     the earth. The sun no longer shines, or if it does, it shineth not on Terry.
                     For the first time in his life he is jealous. Elizabeth Jane does with him as
                     she pleases. She holds his arm and leads him about, and talks to him in her
                     sharp little staccato voice of the house "Mr. Meeke" is furnishing—of the poor
                     of the parish—of her schools and societies, and it all falls dead flat on
                     Terry's ears. He hears as he might hear the drowsy ripple of a mill stream—he
                     comprehendeth not. "Crystal and Eric—Eric and Crystal," these united names ring
                     the changes over and over and over again in his dazed brain.</p>
                  <p>"There they are!" cries Elizabeth Jane, with another vicious snap of the little
                     dark eyes. "Pretty pair, aren't they?"</p>
                  <p>The seventh Miss Higgins did not mean it in that sense, but they
                        <emph>were</emph> a pretty pair. They came together over the grass. Eric,
                     tall, languid, elegant, handsome, in faultless summer costume, a straw hat
                     pulled over his eyes; Crystal, in pale rose-pink gauze, a little straw flat
                     titled over her pretty Grecian nose, and a bunch of big fragrant water lilies
                     in her hand. It was a specialty of the prettiest Miss Higgins that you rarely
                     saw her except covered with floral decorations. They espied Elizabeth Jane and
                     her escort, and Crystal gave a little nervous start and gasp for breath.</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" she said, in that frightened whisper, "it is Terry!"</p>
                  <p>"Ah, ya-as—so it is, Terry," drawled Lord Dynely, putting up his eye-glass.
                     "Where did he drop from? I say, little 'un, how are you?"</p>
                  <p>He sauntered up to Terry with the words, and held out one languid hand. Terry
                     took it, and dropped it, as if it burned him. For the first time the sight of
                     Lady Dynely's son gladdened neither his eyes nor his heart.</p>
                  <p>"Didn't expect you, you know. Glad to see you all the same. Awfully warm work
                     travelling it must have been. Just come?"</p>
                  <p>"Just come," Terry responded, coldly, his eyes fixed on Crystal's face. That
                     face was flushed and drooping; the shy, averted glance, the shy, reluctant
                     hand, smote him to the heart.</p>
                  <p>"You are well, Crystal?" he said. "You received my letter?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes, thank you."</p>
                  <p>It is always Miss Crystal's formula when greatly embarrassed<pb n="186-187"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000092"/> rassed, and then she stood blushing and
                     downcast, tracing figures on the grass with her white parasol.</p>
                  <p>"You don't ask after them at home, Dynely," said Terry, looking at him; "your
                     mother or Miss Forrester?"</p>
                  <p>"Don't I? It's too warm to ask for anything or anybody at an August picnic.
                     Thanks for your reminder. How are my mother and Miss Forrester?"</p>
                  <p>There was a certain defiance in the coolly insolent glance of Eric's blue eyes,
                     a certain defiance in the lazy drawl with which he repeated Terry's words.</p>
                  <p>"They are well—wondering a little though what can keep you so long in foreign
                     parts. You were to be back in a week."</p>
                  <p>"Was I? I find my constitution won't stand the wear and tear of a perpetual
                     express train. And really, on the whole, I think I prefer Lincolnshire to
                     Devonshire."</p>
                  <p>Then he turns and says something in a lower tone to Crystal, at which she
                     laughs nervously, puts her hand within his arm, and turns to go.</p>
                  <p>"Ta, ta, Terry!" he says. "Amuse yourself well, only don't make your attentions
                     to Elizabeth Jane too marked, else the Reverend Edwin, lamb-like as he is, may
                     turn jealous. And jealousy is a frightful monster to admit into the human
                     heart."</p>
                  <p>They saunter away together as they came, and Elizabeth Jane's black eyes snap
                     again as they look after them.</p>
                  <p>"There!" she says, "what do you think of that?"</p>
                  <p>"I think I shall go and have some claret cup, if there is any going," is
                     Dennison's response. "I see Mr. Meeke coming, 'Liza Jane. You'll excuse me,
                     won't you?"</p>
                  <p>He hardly waits for 'Liza Jane's stiff "Oh, certainly." He rushes off, takes a
                     long draught from the iced silver tankard, but all the claret cup that ever was
                     iced will not cool the fire of love and jealousy that is raging within Terry.
                     He wanders away, he doesn't know where—anywhere, anywhere out of the world.
                     Presently he finds himself far removed from the braying brass band, and sight
                     and sound of the picnicers, and flings himself face downward in the
                     warm-scented summer grass.</p>
                  <p>He has lost Crystal!</p>
                  <p>Ay, lost her; though Eric should be playing his old game of fast and loose with
                     girls' hearts, wooing them this hour with his charming grace and debonnaire
                     beauty, to throw them away the next, Crystal is lost to him all the same. If
                     her heart has gone to Dynely or any other man, then she goes with it. The heart
                     that comes to him for life must have held no other lodger. And she loves
                     Eric—it has ever been an easy thing for all women to do that—he has seen it in
                     the first glance of her eyes, in the first flush of her cheek. And Eric—what
                     does Eric mean?</p>
                  <p>"By heaven!" Terry thinks, his eyes flashing, "he shall not play with her, as
                     he has done with so many. He shall not win her love only to fling it
                     contemptuously away; he shall not woo her, and tire of her, and spoil her life,
                     and break her heart as he has done with others. I'll kill him with my own hand
                     first."</p>
                  <p>The day wanes, the sun sets, the stars come out, the evening wind arises. Terry
                     gets up cold and pale, and looking as unlike Terry as can well be conceived,
                     and returns to the merry-makers. Dancing is going on by the white light of the
                     stars, in the great canvas tent, the band blares forth a German waltz, and
                     little Crystal is floating round and round like a whiff of eider-down in Lord
                     Dynely's practised arms. He sees Terry, and smiles a curious sort of smile to
                     himself. If Terry's purpose in coming were printed on his forehead it could not
                     be plainer reading to Lord Dynely. He has seen his state from the first, he
                     knows as well as the dragoon himself, that he has come down to Starling
                     Vicarage to woo and win the flower of the flock. And Eric's arm tightens around
                     Crystal's slim, pink waist, his blue eyes look with an intolerable light of
                     triumph down into her fair, childish face.</p>
                  <p>"She shall never belong to him—to any man but me," he thinks. "I will speak
                     to-night, or that over-grown dragoon will to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>His fancy for Crystal has never cooled, never for a moment. He loves her—or
                     thinks he does—with his whole heart. She will not be half so creditable a wife
                     as France,<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6444-00000093"/> he feels that he will
                     tire of that sweet, shy, dimpling baby face a month after marriage; still—have
                     her he must and shall. Opposition and a rival have but fired him; come what
                     will, this little village beauty shall be his wife. This very evening he will
                     speak.</p>
                  <p>The waltz ends; he draws her away with him, from the dancing booth, out into
                     the white, star-gemmed twilight. She is ever willing to go—to ends of the
                     earth, so that he leads the way. She has been living in a trance of bliss ever
                     since she saw Lord Dynely first.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, what a day it has been!" she sighs, swinging her hat by its rosy ribbons,
                     and looking up at the star-studded sky; "I never enjoyed myself so much in my
                     life."</p>
                  <p>"Particularly since Terry Dennison has come!" puts in his lordship.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Lord Dynely!—Terry! as if I cared for Terry!" Crystal says, with a pretty,
                     petulant gesture.</p>
                  <p>"No? You are sure, Crystal? You don't care for Terry?"</p>
                  <p>"Lord Dynely, you know I don't."</p>
                  <p>"Then you do care for some one else. Who is it, little one? Such hosts of
                     lovers you have. You don't know how madly jealous I have been before now."</p>
                  <p>She glances up at him quickly, almost angrily, to see if he is in earnest. Eyes
                     and lips are smiling—he is looking at her with a gaze she cannot meet. She
                     flushes rosy red and shrinks from him ever so little. Then all at once he
                     speaks.</p>
                  <p>"I love you, Crystal," he says; "I want you to be my wife."</p>
                  <milestone n="* * * * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>It is an hour later. The picnicers are beginning to disperse. Lord Dynely is to
                     drive Miss Crystal home in his phaeton. Everybody is thronging to their
                     carriages when they return to the starting spot.</p>
                  <p>What a face Crystal wears! transfigured with bliss. Lord Dynely is, as he ever
                     is, cool, languid, self-possessed, and outwardly at least, a trifle bored. But
                     in the phaeton, alone with Crystal, he is not in the least bored.</p>
                  <p>"I shall speak to the dear old dad to-morrow," he is saying ing. "Of course we
                     know what the answer will be. And I must get you an engagement ring. Let's see;
                     give me this little blue and white concern as a guide."</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" Crystal cries, a sudden pain in her voice, "Terry gave me that!"</p>
                  <p>"Did he?" said Dynely, coolly, abstracting it and putting it in his waistcoat
                     pocket; "then we'll return it to Terry, and he can give it to Victoria, or
                     Evangeline, or Josephine, or any of the rest he fancies. You wear no man's ring
                     but mine henceforth forever."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">"THEY SHALL TAKE WHO HAVE THE POWER."</head>
                  <p>THEY spend a very pleasant evening at the vicarage, and end a delightful day in
                     a very delightful manner. Delightful at least to Crystal and her lordly lover.
                     They show little outward sign of the rapture within; but Crystal's eyes keep
                     that radiant light of great joy, and there is a half smile of exultation and
                     triumph in Eric's. They drink tea out of their egg-shell china, and partake of
                     lemon cakes and thin bread and butter, and Crystal trips down to the gate, by
                     her lover's side.</p>
                  <p>"I will be here to-morrow as early as common decency will allow, little one,"
                     he says, taking the pretty dimpled face between both his hands, "for that
                     private interview with papa. Good-night, 'queen rose of the rosebud garden of
                     girls,' and dream of me."</p>
                  <p>Will she not? She watches him out of sight. How handsome he is! A very king
                     among men! How noble, how great, how good! So far above her, yet stooping in
                     his wonderful condescension to love her and make her his wife. Oh, what a
                     thrice-blessed girl she is! Surely some beneficent fairy must have presided at
                     her birth that she should be thus chosen the elect of the gods.</p>
                  <p>Then she is aroused from her reverie, for the Rev. Edwin and Elizabeth Jane are
                     crunching over the gravel behind her.</p>
                  <p>"Are you going to stay mooning here all night, Crystal?" sharply inquires the
                     elder sister. "Do you know that the dew is falling, and that your dress is
                     grenadine? Where is <emph>he?</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Lord Dynely has gone," Crystal answers, gently. "Good-night, Mr. Meeke," and
                     then she lifts two lovely, compassionate eyes to Mr. Meeke's face.</p>
                  <p>Poor little fellow, she thinks, what a life Elizabeth Jane will lead him, and
                     how different her life is ordered from poor, plain Elizabeth Jane's. She feels
                     a great pity for them both, so hum-drum and commonplace their wooing is; a
                     great pity for the whole other eight, so far less blessed than she.</p>
                  <p>"What have I ever done that I should be so happy?" she muses. "What can I ever
                     do to prove how thankful and grateful I am?"</p>
                  <p>She stops and recoils, a swift flush of pain and shame darkens her lily-leaf
                     face, for, tall and dark, Terry looms up before her.</p>
                  <p>"I've had no chance to say a word to you all day, Crystal," he says, trying to
                     speak cheerfully. "You have been so completely monopolized by Dynely. It is a
                     lovely night—let us take a turn around the garden?"</p>
                  <p>"What—at twelve o'clock? Oh, Terry!" she laughs, "I am dead tired besides after
                     the picnic. Some other time. Good-night."</p>
                  <p>She flies up the stairs lightly, a small roseate vision, kisses her hand to him
                     from the upper landing, and disappears.</p>
                  <p>The Rev. Mr. Higgins' nine daughters are paired off two by two. It is Crystal's
                     misfortune to be billeted with Elizabeth Jane. And when Elizabeth Jane comes
                     up, half an hour later, and finds her "mooning" again, sitting, leaning out of
                     the window, heedless of dew and grenadine, the window is closed with asperity,
                     and Miss Crystal ordered peremptorily to "have done fooling and go to bed.</p>
                  <p>She goes, she even sleeps, but she wakes early, to find the sun of another
                     lovely day flooding her chamber, and a hundred little birds trilling a musical
                     accompaniment without, to Elizabeth Jane's short, rasping snores within. Again
                     Crystal thinks of the Rev. Edwin, and laughs and shudders as she looks at
                     Elizabeth Jane asleep, with her mouth open, and pities him with unutterable
                     pity. Yesterday's bliss comes back to her as she springs lightly out of bed and
                     dresses. To-day he is coming to ask papa—in two or three hours at most he will
                     be here. She sings softly as she dresses, for very gladness of heart, and flies
                     lightly down the stairs, and out into the fresh, sweet summer morning.<pb
                        n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6444-00000095"/> All within is still and asleep, all
                     without is awake and full of jubilant life. The roses turn their crimson, pink
                     and snowy faces up to that cloudless sky, a hundred choirs of birds pour forth
                     their matin song; over all the sun rises in untold Summer splendor.
                     Involuntarily Mendelssohn's Hymn of Praise rises to her lips—"Let all that hath
                     life and breath sing to the Lord."</p>
                  <p>She runs down to the gate and leans over it, still singing. Her song reaches
                     another early riser, lounging aimlessly against an elm near by, smoking a
                     matinal cigar. He starts, flings the cigar away, and crashes through the dewy
                     Lincolnshire grass to join her. It is Terry. Who else in that household of
                     women smokes regalias at five in the morning?"</p>
                  <p>Terry has not slept well—has not slept at all—and looks haggard and anxious in
                     this brilliant morning light. He pulls his straw hat farther over his eyes to
                     exclude the dazzling sun, and sees Crystal's sweet face cloud, and hears her
                     glad song die away as he joins her. A nervous, troubled look fills the gentle
                     eyes, the loveliest, he thinks, on earth.</p>
                  <p>"You were always an early riser, Crystal," he says, with a faint smile. "I see
                     you keep up your good habits. I hope you have quite slept away yesterday's
                     fatigue."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes, thank you," replies Miss Crystal. "I hope your dreams were pleasant,
                     Terry?"</p>
                  <p>"I neither slept nor dreamed at all," Terry answers, gravely.</p>
                  <p>She glances up at him shyly, then turns away and begins pulling nervously at
                     the sweetbrier growing over the gate. He takes one of the little destructive
                     hands and holds it fast, and looks at the finger upon which he had placed the
                     pearl and turquoise ring. "It is gone," he says, blankly.</p>
                  <p>She snatches her hand away, half-frightened, half-petulant, and says
                     nothing.</p>
                  <p>"You promised to wear it, Crystal."</p>
                  <p>"I beg your pardon, Terry, I did not. You put it there, and I wore it
                     until—"</p>
                  <p>"Until—go on, Crystal."</p>
                  <p>But she will not, it seems. She turns farther from him and tears the sweetbrier
                     sprays wantonly.</p>
                  <p>"Until when, Crystal? Answer me."</p>
                  <p>"Until last night, then."</p>
                  <p>"And what became of it last night?"</p>
                  <p>He tries to see her face, but she holds it low over the fragrant blossoms, and
                     is silent again.</p>
                  <p>"Crystal! Crystal!" he cries out; "what does it all mean? Who removed my
                     ring?"</p>
                  <p>Then all at once she turns at bay and looks at him full.</p>
                  <p>"Lord Dynely took it last night. He had a right to take it. I can wear no man's
                     ring but his all the days of my life. I will give it to you back to-day. I—I
                     don't want to hurt you, Terry, but—I love <emph>him</emph>."</p>
                  <p>Her courage dies away as quickly as it came. She grows crimson all over her
                     pearl-white face, and returns once more to the suffering sweetbrier.</p>
                  <p>For Terry—he stands as a man who receives his deathblow—white, mute. And yet he
                     has expected it—has known it. Only that does not seem to make it any the easier
                     now.</p>
                  <p>The silence frightens her. She steals a look at him, and that look frightens
                     her more.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Terry, don't be angry," she falters, the ready tears springing to her
                     eyes. "How could I help it? How could I—how could any one help loving him?"</p>
                  <p>"No," Terry answers, a curious stiffness about his lips, a curious hardness in
                     his tone; "you could not help it. I might have known it. You are only a child—I
                     thought you a woman. You could not help it; but he—by Heaven, he's a
                     villain!"</p>
                  <p>She started up—stung into strength by that.</p>
                  <p>"It is false!" she cried out, passionately. "How dare you, Terry Dennison! You
                     say to me behind his back what you dare not say to his face. He is the best and
                     noblest man that ever lived."</p>
                  <p>He turned and looked at her. He caught both her hands, and the blue eyes looked
                     up fearless and flashing into his own.</p>
                  <p>"You love him, Crystal?"</p>
                  <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6444-00000096"/>
                  <p>"With my whole heart—so well that if I lost him I should die."</p>
                  <p>"And he—he tells you he loves you, I suppose?"</p>
                  <p>"He tells me, and I know it. I know it as surely and truly as I stand
                     here."</p>
                  <p>He dropped her hands and turned from her, leaning his folded arms across the
                     pillar of the gate.</p>
                  <p>"He tells you, and you know it! I wonder how many score my Lord Dynely has told
                     that same story to in his one-and-twenty years of life? We live in a fast age,
                     but I doubt if many men go quite so fast as that. I wonder what France
                     Forrester will say to all this?"</p>
                  <p>The angry color faded out of her face, the angry light died out of her eyes.
                     She stood looking at him, growing ashen gray. She had utterly forgotten
                     that.</p>
                  <p>"Miss Forrester!" she responded, slowly; "I forgot! I forgot! And last night he
                     told me—he told me—"</p>
                  <p>"He told you nothing about her, I'll swear!" Dennison said, with a short,
                     mirthless laugh; "that it has been an understood thing from his boyhood that he
                     was to marry her; that he returned home three weeks ago to ask her to be his
                     wife; that he <emph>did</emph> ask her, beg her, entreat her, and that she sent
                     him down here out of the way, pending her final answer; that if that answer be
                     favorable they are to be married next spring in London. His mother told me.
                     Whatever he told you last night, Crystal, I am quite sure he did not tell you
                     this."</p>
                  <p>"No," she said, in a voice like a whisper, her very lips blanched—"he did not
                     tell me this."</p>
                  <p>"There is one fortunate circumstance about it," the young man went on; "he is a
                     villain, but he won't break her heart. Incredible it may seem to you, but all
                     the beauty and attraction of your demi-god are quite thrown away upon her. She
                     doesn't care for him. She knows him to be weaker and more unstable than
                     water—the frailest of all broken reeds for any woman to lean on—and will
                     rejoice accordingly at being rid of him. But for you, Crystal—you're not the
                     first, nor the hundred-and-first, he has sworn undying love to; and you'll not
                     be the last, that <emph>I</emph> swear, if you give him a chance. If you care
                     for Lord Eric Dynely, and want to keep him, why, then, marry him out of
                     hand—strike while the iron is hot."</p>
                  <p>She said not a word. White and still she stood, all life and color stricken out
                     of eyes and face by his words.</p>
                  <p>As he looked at her the bitterness died out of his own soul in compassion and
                     remorse.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Crystal, forgive me!" he said. "I am a brute! I ought not to say such
                     things to you. But—I loved you so—I have loved you all my life. I trusted you,
                     and I trusted him."</p>
                  <p>It was more than she could bear—her own pain and his. She turned hastily away,
                     down one of the garden paths, and vanished.</p>
                  <p>The day was six hours older—the vicarage clocks were striking eleven—as Lord
                     Dynely dismounted from "his red roan steed" at the vicarage gate, and flung his
                     horse's bridle over that very gate-post. Before he could reach the house, a
                     slim, white figure came gliding out of one of the garden paths and beckoned him
                     to approach.</p>
                  <p>"You, my darling," he said, gayly, "and on the watch for your devoted knight's
                     coming. I'm not late, am I? But early rising, as you understand the term in
                     this primitive wilderness, is <emph>not</emph> my most prominent
                     perfection."</p>
                  <p>"Eric," she said, faintly. "I have something to say to you. Last night when we
                     were talking—when you told me you cared for me, you—you said nothing of Miss
                     Forrester."</p>
                  <p>His face flushed, his blue eyes flashed with the quick angry light ever so
                     ready to rise.</p>
                  <p>"Who has been talking to you?" he demanded. "But I need hardly ask. Mr.
                     Terrence Dennison, of course."</p>
                  <p>"I have known it this long time," she returned, shrinking from his angry looks,
                     trembling like a nervous child, yet resolute to go on, "only I forgot it
                     yesterday. Oh, Lord Dynely! You were very cruel to say such things to me, and
                     all the time engaged to marry her."</p>
                  <p>She broke down utterly for the first time with the words, and covering her face
                     with her hands, sobbed hysterically.</p>
                  <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6444-00000097"/>
                  <p>"Why did you ever come here—why did you make me love you—how could you deceive
                     me so? I knew I was not worthy of you. I was happy before you came; I—"</p>
                  <p>"You would have married Dennison, and lived happy for ever after? Is that what
                     you are trying to say, Miss Higgins? Terry has been pleading his own cause this
                     morning, I see, and slandering me. Common gratitude from the dependant of my
                     mother's bounty might have kept him silent, if nothing else; but gratitude is
                     an obsolete virtue. Since you are so easily influenced by him, it would be a
                     pity to take you from him. Here is his ring—let me replace it on your finger,
                     and take back all the nonsensical things I said to you last evening."</p>
                  <p>She uttered a cry like a child under the lash. At that sound all anger died out
                     within him, he caught her hands and held them in a fierce, close clasp.</p>
                  <p>"I will never let you go," he said. "I swear it. My wife you shall be, and no
                     other's. You are mine—mine alone, and as mine I claim you. I deny all
                     Dennison's slanders. I am not engaged to Miss Forrester or any other living
                     woman. Miss Forrester is no more anxious to marry me than I am to marry her. It
                     is all my mother's doing and her guardian's—they made the compact, but we will
                     not ratify it. You I love, and you I will make my wife. Where is your
                     father?—in his study? Then I will go to him at once, and make an end of all
                     doubt."</p>
                  <p>He strode away, and, looking handsome and haughty, was admitted into Mr.
                     Higgins' private sanctum. In few and somewhat insolently authoritative words he
                     made known his errand. He loved his daughter Crystal, he wished to make her his
                     wife. Then he sat still, and looked at the clergyman. If he expected the Vicar
                     of Starling to be overpowered by the honor he was doing him, he was
                     mistaken.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Higgins sat aghast, literally aghast, and pushing his spectacles up his
                     forehead sat helplessly staring at the young wooer.</p>
                  <p>"My daughter! My daughter Crystal. <emph>You</emph> want to marry her, Lord
                     Dynely. Oh, impossible! impossible!"</p>
                  <p>"And why impossible, sir, may I ask?" haughtily and angrily.</p>
                  <p>"Because—Lord bless my soul! because she's too young to marry any one; because
                     when she's two or three years older we're going to marry her to Terry Dennison.
                     It's been an understood thing always, always, that Christabel was to marry
                     Terry."</p>
                  <p>"And may I ask again, Mr. Higgins," cried Lord Dynely, still more angrily,
                     still more haughtily, "if you prefer Dennison to me?"</p>
                  <p>"Well—well—well, don't be angry, my dear young gentleman, don't be angry. Bless
                     my soul! <emph>you</emph> marry Crystal! Upon my word and honor, I never
                     thought of such a thing—never! Prefer Dennison! well, in a worldly point of
                     view, you're the best match of course, but, then, we know Terry, and he's one
                     of the family, and he's a good lad—oh, a very good lad! and I shouldn't be
                     afraid to trust my little one to his keeping."</p>
                  <p>"And you <emph>are</emph> afraid to trust her to mine!" said lordly Eric, pale
                     with passion.</p>
                  <p>"No, no, not that either! Bless my soul, don't be so quick to jump at
                     conclusions. It's only this—I know him better than I do you—I trust him
                     entirely, and then it's been an understood thing always. Crissy has no right to
                     play fast and loose with Terry. Besides, there's your cousin—no, she's not your
                     cousin, I suppose, but it's all the same. I mean, of course, Miss France
                     Forrester."</p>
                  <p>"Well, sir," demands the exasperated young lord, "and what of Miss France
                     Forrester?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, this—you've been engaged to her, or so I have been told."</p>
                  <p>"Then, Mr. Higgins, you've been told an infernal lie," retorted Lord Dynely,
                     too utterly overcome with rage and exasperation to much mind what he said; "I
                     never was engaged to France Forrester or any one else. Am I to understand that
                     you decline to accept me as the husband of your daughter?"</p>
                  <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6444-00000098"/>
                  <p>"Oh, dear me," said Mr. Higgins, in a troubled tone, "I don't know what to say,
                     I'm sure. You've taken me so much by surprise—I always looked upon her as
                     belonging to Terry—"</p>
                  <p>This was growing more than Lord Dynely could bear. He rose to his feet,
                     exasperated beyond endurance.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, don't," said the vicar, piteously; "wait a little, my lord. What does
                     Christabel say? She is in love with you, I suppose?"</p>
                  <p>"She does me that honor, Mr. Higgins."</p>
                  <p>"It's a brilliant match for her, and yet," in that troubled tone, "I do believe
                     she would be happier married to—"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Higgins, you insult me! I decline to listen longer. Good-morning."</p>
                  <p>"I beg your pardon, Lord Dynely. I had no intention of insulting you, I am
                     sure. If Crystal wishes it, and you wish it, why then—why then I have no more
                     to say. Only this, obtain your mother's consent. No daughter of mine shall
                     enter any family that considers her beneath them or is unwilling to receive
                     her. Obtain your mother's consent and you shall have mine. Only"—this in a low
                     voice and with a sorrowful shake of the head—"I would rather it had been
                     Terry."</p>
                  <p>Lord Dynely, quite pale with haughty surprise and anger, bowed himself out.
                     Opposition was crowding upon him, and he set his teeth, and swore he would have
                     her in spite of a thousand imbecile vicars, a thousand match-making mothers.
                     And Mr. Higgins sat blinking in a dazed way in the sunshine, full of vague,
                     apprehensive regrets.</p>
                  <p>"He's a fine young man—a handsome young man, well-born, well-bred, titled and
                     rich; and yet I am afraid of him. It's these brilliant young men who break
                     their wives' hearts as easily as I could my pipe-stem. It will be a great match
                     for one of my girls, but I would rather it were Terry."</p>
                  <p>Leaning against the vine-clad porch, Lord Dynely came face to face with Terry
                     himself. He paused and looked at him, his blue eyes lurid with anger and
                     defiance.</p>
                  <p>"Well, little 'un," he said, with an insolent laugh, "you've heard the news, I
                     suppose? I'm to marry Crystal. Congratulate gratulate me, won't you? I've been
                     rather poaching on your manor, you see; but, if the dear little girl has the
                     bad taste to prefer me to you, what then? And all's fair in love and war."</p>
                  <p>He turned to go before Dennison could speak, that defiant ring still in eyes,
                     and voice, and laugh.</p>
                  <p>"Can you tell me where I'll find her, Terry? Ah, I see her in the arbor yonder.
                     Don't look so seedy, dear old man—you know the adage that has held good ever
                     since the world began, that— <q>

                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>His mocking laugh came back as he struck a Vesuvian, lit a cigarette, and
                     sauntered down the path to join Crystal.</p>

                  <p>"NORTON?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, my lord."</p>
                  <p>"Pack my portmanteau, and hold yourself in readiness to accompany me by the
                     9:50 train. I return to Devonshire."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, my lord."</p>
                  <p>"Tell them to have the trap round in fifteen minutes. Train starts in half an
                     hour. Can do the distance in the odd quarter."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, my lord."</p>
                  <p>"Hand me that tobacco pouch, Norton, that book of cigarette paper, and—Come
                     in."</p>
                  <p>All this multiplicity of directions Lord Dynely murmured in the sleepiest,
                     laziest of tones, his long, slender length stretched out upon a sofa. His
                     orders had been cut short by a tap at the door, and, in answer to his
                     invitation, Terry Dennison entered.</p>
                  <p>It was nine o'clock of the morning following that interview in the Vicar of
                     Starling's study. Only nine o'clock, and Lord Dynely, whose usual hour of
                     rising and calling for chocolate in bed was twelve, was up and dressed. Not
                     only dressed, but dressed for travelling, in most unexceptional get up. He was,
                     as has been said, a dandy of the first water, as difficult to please in the fit
                     of a coat as any young duchess about her wedding robe. He found fault with
                     Poole's most faultless works of art, and the peculiar shade of necktie most
                     becoming his complexion had been known to painfully exercise his manly mind for
                     hours.</p>
                  <p>As he lay now, every garment he wore, in make, and coloring, and texture, was
                     above reproach. To do him justice, his efforts were not in vain, his dress
                     always looked as though it were a part of himself.</p>
                  <p>He looked up gayly at Dennison's approach. He was in high good humor this
                     morning—at peace with all the world. Yesterday's irritation had entirely passed
                     away. Crystal's father might be exasperating to the last degree, but Crystal
                     herself was entirely satisfactory. And when Crystal was his wife he would take
                     care the Vicar of Starling and his family saw uncommonly little of her. For
                     Terry—well, looking at it dispassionately, after an excellent dinner and a
                     prime Manilla, he was forced to admit that Terry, poor beggar! <emph>had</emph>
                     some little cause of complaint. Something very like foul play had been done on
                     his part, something the codes of his order and his honor would hardly
                     recognize. Still, what was done, was done. Crystal he would resign to no man
                     living, and Dennison must make the best of it. This unexpected opposition had
                     but strengthened his passion; he had never been so thoroughly in earnest before
                     about any love affair in his life. He was going to see his mother to-day and
                     bring her to reason. She would prove a little restive on his hands at first, on
                     France's account, but he would speedily bring her around. For France—well, he
                     winced a little at the thought of meeting France. To be laughed at was
                     horrible, and he could see France's dark, mischievous, satirical eyes, France's
                     cynical little laugh, hear France's sarcastic, cutting speeches. "Who was she?"
                     indeed. The girl must be a witch. Your sharp girl, your clever girl, was an
                     outrage on nature. Women were made for man's use, benefit and pleasure; why,
                     then, were half of them as man didn't like them? Crystal, without two ideas in
                     her pretty head and loving heart, was his ideal of womankind. Yes, he would
                     bring his mother round, fetch her down here to see Crystal, have the marriage
                     arranged to take place before Christmas, all on the quiet, and spend the Winter
                     rambling about sunny Italy. And next season Lady Dynely would burst upon London
                     the loveliest thing out, a pride to her husband, an honor and credit to his
                     taste.</p>
                  <p>All this in rambling, disconnected, self-satisfied fashion, Lord Dynely had
                     thought over last night. Now he lay rolling<pb n="202-203"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000100"/> up a cigarette, with white, practised fingers, a
                     smile on his lips and in his handsome blue eyes as he looked up at Mr.
                     Dennison.</p>
                  <p>"How are you, Terry?" he said, genially. "Come in; knock those things off the
                     chair, and sit down. I'm in the midst of an exodus, you see—off to Devonshire.
                     Any commission for France or the madre?"</p>
                  <p>"I will send a note by you to Lady Dynely," Terry answered. He was looking very
                     grave, and rather pale, Eric could see at second glance, his mouth set and
                     stern under his tawny beard and mustache. "It may be some time before I see her
                     in person. I join my regiment this week at Windsor."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! leave of absence expired? Be off, Norton, and order round the trap. Only
                     ten minutes to starting time now. Very inhospitable of me, Terry—you don't pay
                     morning calls at Carruthers Court often—but I really must cut it short.
                     Twenty-five minutes to starting time, and you know what the drive to the
                     station is."</p>
                  <p>"I won't detain you," Terry answers, setting his lips still harder under his
                     leonine beard. "I came to say a few words about Crystal."</p>
                  <p>Lord Dynely's cigarette was quite ready now. He looked up at his companion with
                     that slow, indolent smile of his that had so much of latent insolence in it,
                     struck a fuse and lit up.</p>
                  <p>"About Crystal? Let us hear it, Terry. You couldn't choose a more interesting
                     subject. How is the little darling this morning?"</p>
                  <p>"I won't say anything about your conduct in this matter, Lord Dynely," Terry
                     began; "you know best whether it has been the conduct of a man of honor or not.
                     Crystal, perhaps, is not to blame."</p>
                  <p>"How magnanimous! 'Crystal is not to blame.' You have never asked her to marry
                     you, and because she honors me by her preference and acceptance, she is not to
                     blame. And don't you think—as her friend, now, Terry—she makes a rather better
                     match in marrying Lord Dynely than she would in marrying Terry Dennison?"</p>
                  <p>That angry gleam was lighting again Eric's sleepy eyes, but his soft, slow
                     tones never rose as he spoke. He watched Terry from behind the wreaths of
                     scented smoke, and saw the flush that arose and overspread his whole face.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," Terry answered, after a pause, in a slow, strange voice, "you are right;
                     she makes a better match in marrying Lord Dynely than in marrying Terry
                     Dennison. As I had never, in so many words, asked her to be my wife, whatever
                     may have been understood, I repeat I hold <emph>her</emph> blameless in this.
                     She loves you—she never did me. I might have foreseen, but—I trusted you
                     both."</p>
                  <p>"Don't seem to see it," Lord Dynely drawled, looking at his watch. "Only seven
                     minutes, Mr. Dennison; very sorry to cut it short, I repeat, but—"</p>
                  <p>"But you shall hear what I have come to say," Terry exclaimed, turning upon
                     him. "It is this: I know how you hold women—I know how it is you have treated
                     them—I know you hold it fair sport to win hearts and fling them away. What I
                     have come to say is—don't do it here. She has no brother or father capable of
                     protecting her. I will be her brother, if I may be no more. For your mother's
                     sake, you are the last man on earth I would wish to raise my hand against, but
                     this I say, this I mean—if you trifle with Crystal as you have trifled with
                     others, Eric, you shall answer to me!"</p>
                  <p>He brought his clenched hand down upon the inlaid table, the veins of his
                     forehead swollen and dark, with the intensity of feeling within him. Lord
                     Dynely laughed softly, and flung his cigarette out through the open window.</p>
                  <p>"Bon! But would it not be well to intimate as much quietly. You do it very
                     well, my dear boy, for an amateur; but one gets so much of that kind of thing
                     at the theatre, and they do it better there. You mean well, I dare
                     say—sentiments do you honor, and all that; but this tremendous earnestness is
                     in such deuced bad form—in August, of all months, particularly."</p>
                  <p>"I have said my say," was Dennison's response. "It is part of your creed, I
                     know, to make a jest of all things; jest if you like, but hear and remember. As
                     surely as we both stand here—if there is any foul play in this business,
                        your<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6444-00000101"/> life shall answer it. You
                     shall not play with her, fool her and leave her, as you have done with so many.
                     You shall not break her heart, and go unpunished of God and man. If all is not
                     open and above board here, you shall pay the penalty—that I swear."</p>
                  <p>"Time's up," said Eric, looking at his watch again. He replaced it, arose to
                     his feet, and laid his hand on Terry's shoulder, with that winning smile of his
                     that made his face so charming.</p>
                  <p>"Look here, Terry," he said, "I am not such a scoundrel, such a Lovelace, such
                     a Don Giovanni, as you try to make me out. I'm ready to go with little Crystal
                     to the St. George's slaughter-house, or the little church down among the trees
                     yonder, this very morning if I might. You're a good fellow, and, as I said
                     before, your sentiments do you honor, and so on. You feel a little sore about
                     this business, naturally—I would myself, in your place; but all's right and on
                     the square here. I never was in earnest before—I am now. I'm going up for my
                     mother—she must come here and receive Crystal as her daughter. And when the
                     wedding comes off, you shall be the best man, 'an' ye will,' Terry—that
                        <emph>I</emph> swear, since swearing seems the order of the day. And now,
                     dear old man, don't lecture any more; it's too hot—give you my word it is, and
                     I want to reserve all my strength for the journey. Here's seltzer and sherry.
                     Compose your feelings with that liquid refreshment, and dash off your note to
                     the madre while I get into my outer garments."</p>
                  <p>There was no resisting Eric in this mood, it was not in human nature. The
                     charming smile, the charming voice, the affectionate, frankly cordial manner,
                     would have moved and melted a Medusa.</p>
                  <p>"No, Crystal was not to blame," Terry thought, with a sigh, glancing over at
                     their two images in the glass—it was in the nature of things that women should
                     fall in love at sight with Eric.</p>
                  <p>He scrawled off the note in a big, slap-dash sort of hand, each long word
                     filling a whole line; folded, sealed it, and gave it to Eric just as he sprang
                     up into the trap.</p>
                  <p>"Bye-bye, old boy," he said, gayly. "When shall I tell the madre to expect you?
                     Not before Christmas? Oh, nonsense! She couldn't survive without you half the
                     time. Well, as you won't be here when I return, adieu and au revoir. Love to
                     everybody."</p>
                  <p>The groom touched the horses. They sped down the avenue like the wind, and
                     Terry was alone.</p>
                  <milestone n="* * * * * * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>"It is very odd we don't hear from Eric—that he doesn't return. I can't
                     understand it at all. It is three weeks since he left; he was to be back in
                     one. There's something very singular about it, to say the least."</p>
                  <p>Thus petulantly Lady Dynely to Miss Forrester. They were together in the
                     drawing-room—her ladyship reclining upon a sofa, a book in her hand. Miss
                     Forrester looking charming in palest amber tissue and white roses, lying back
                     in a vast downy arm-chair before the open window, putting the finishing touches
                     to a small sketch.</p>
                  <p>"The house is like a tomb since he and Terry left. It is most incomprehensible
                     indeed, Eric's staying all this time. If you understand it, France, and feel
                     satisfied, it is more than I do. My dear child, do put down that tiresome
                     drawing and listen. Ever since Mr. Locksley's advent, I believe you have given
                     yourself wholly to art."</p>
                  <p>The color rose in Miss Forrester's clear, dark face. She looked up from her
                     drawing at once.</p>
                  <p>"I beg your pardon, Lady Dynely. What was it you said?"</p>
                  <p>"About Eric. It's three weeks since he went away—he was to be back in one. And
                     he never writes to me at least. Perhaps he treats you better—France, what are
                     you laughing at? Eric has written to you?"</p>
                  <p>Miss Forrester's musical, merry laugh chimed out.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ma mère</foreign>, Eric has written to
                     me."</p>
                  <p>"And you never told me. What does the wretched boy say?"</p>
                  <p>"I don't think he is wretched. It was a very pleasant letter. He merely wrote
                     to give me up."</p>
                  <p>"France!" in horror.</p>
                  <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6444-00000102"/>
                  <p>"Yes, mamma—he came to his senses down in Lincolnshire. Couldn't think of
                     forcing my inclinations—if the proposed alliance of the noble houses of Dynely
                     and Forrester were distasteful to me, then, at any cost to himself and his own
                     lacerated heart, he resigned me. It read like one of Lord Chesterfield's
                     masterpieces—was a model of polite and chivalric composition."</p>
                  <p>"Good Heaven! and you—France, what did you say?"</p>
                  <p>Again Miss Forrester's laugh rang out.</p>
                  <p>"I answered in three words, mamma—terse, pithy, and to the point. I wrote,
                     'Dear Eric: Who is she?' That epistle he has not done me the honor of
                     answering. I think I see his face when he read it."</p>
                  <p>And then France lay back and went off into a prolonged peal of merriment.</p>
                  <p>Lady Dynely rose up on her sofa, her delicate cheeks flushing with
                     vexation.</p>
                  <p>"You wrote that, France—to Eric?"</p>
                  <p>"I wrote that, mamma, to Eric. I understand Eric better than you do, and I'm
                     not the least afraid of Eric, and you are. I could not have written anything
                     more to the point, if I had tried for a month. He might have answered, though;
                     I should like to know who my rival is this time."</p>
                  <p>"France, do you really believe—"</p>
                  <p>"That Eric has fallen in love in Lincolnshire, for the one-millionth time? Yes,
                     Lady Dynely, as firmly as that I sit here. Now, who do you suppose she can be?
                     There are no ladies in Sir Philip's household, and I don't think he would
                     bestow his heart's best affections upon the cook."</p>
                  <p>"Miss Forrester, if you consider this a theme for jest—"</p>
                  <p>"Please don't be dignified, mamma, and please don't call me Miss Forrester.
                     Don't I say, I don't believe he would. It must be one of Terry's family—you
                     know what I mean—one of the Council of Nine—one of the nine Misses Higgins! It
                     would be comical if Terry and he were brothers-in-law after all, both married
                     on the same day, in the same church, in the same family, by the same pastor and
                     papa. Quite a pastoral idyl altogether."</p>
                  <p>Miss Forrester laughed again. Of late, since the receipt of Lord Dynely's
                     letter, the whole world had turned rose-color to the heiress of Caryllynne. The
                     portrait painting business was still going on; but not even to herself would
                     Miss Forrester admit that that had anything to do with it.</p>
                  <p>Tears actually sprang to Lady Dynely's pale blue eyes.</p>
                  <p>"You are cruel, France; you don't mean to be, perhaps, but you are. I have set
                     my heart, my whole heart, on seeing you Eric's wife, and you treat the matter
                     like this. You despise him—you must, since you hold him and his feelings so
                     lightly and contemptuously."</p>
                  <p>France laid down her drawing, went over, knelt beside the elder lady, and gave
                     her a kiss.</p>
                  <p>"Now, mamma mine, look here," she said, coaxingly, "it's just this. You love
                     Eric, and love is blind; you don't see him as he is. I'm not in love with him,
                     and couldn't be if he lived in the same house for the next hundred and fifty
                     years, and I do see Eric as he is. He's very handsome, and very brilliant, and
                     very charming, but he is as unstable as water. He has no back-bone; and if I
                     married him, and he didn't break my heart the first year, I should henpeck him
                     to death, or—the divorce court. For the rest, you'll see I'm right. Some new
                     face caught his fickle fancy down there, and hence that magnanimous letter. I
                     don't blame him; he was born so, I suppose, and can't help it. Hark!"</p>
                  <p>She started to her feet and ran to the window. A fly from the railway was just
                     stopping, and a young gentleman in a light gray suit in the act of leaping out.
                     Again France laughed. <q>

                  <p>Eric it was. He came in as she spoke, and met her laughing, roguish glance,
                     that seemed to read his inmost thoughts.</p>
                  <p>"At last! Just as your mother and I were turning our thoughts to crape and
                     bombazine. We had given you up for lost, Eric, and here you come upon us like a

                     now, while you tell her all the news of your sojourn, I will run away and dress

                  <p>She left the room, almost disconcerting Eric by her last saucy backward glance.
                     Almost, not wholly—nothing earthly ever entirely put his lordship out of
                     countenance.</p>
                  <p>"Really, Eric," his mother began, pettishly, "I don't see how France can treat
                     your desertion of her so lightly. In my days such conduct would have been
                     considered unpardonable."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! but we don't live in the dark ages now," Eric responded, first ringing the
                     bell, then sinking into France's vacated chair. "And my desertion of
                     France—please translate that, mother mine; I don't understand."</p>
                  <p>"It is easily understood. You asked France to marry you before you left, did
                     you not?"</p>
                  <p>"I—I believe so. It is three weeks ago, and a man may naturally be pardoned if
                     his memory is somewhat hazy at that distance of time."</p>
                  <p>"You asked her to marry you," pursued his mother, overlooking this persiflage,
                     "and she told you to come for her answer in a week—did she not?"</p>
                  <p>"My dear mother, what an admirable counsel for the prosecution you would make.
                     Yes, she did. Sherry and seltzer," to the footman who entered.</p>
                  <p>"And you never came," Lady Dynely said, her eyes flashing angrily. "Eric, is
                     that the conduct of a gentleman—a lover—a man of honor?"</p>
                  <p>"It was the conduct of a man of sense. <q>

                     I came to see. I didn't come for the answer; I wrote for it."</p>
                  <p>"You did?"</p>
                  <p>"I did," said Eric, filling himself a glass of sherry; "I wrote, renouncing her
                     unless she came to me of her own free will. It was a most honorable, manly and
                     high-toned letter, I consider myself."</p>
                  <p>"And she said?" eagerly.</p>
                  <p>"She said," said Eric, laughing at the recollection, "'Who is she?' I believe
                     Miss Forrester must be a sorceress. I haven't taken the trouble to tell her who
                     she is, but I have taken the trouble to return here to-day to tell you."</p>
                  <p>"Eric," his mother cried, starting to her feet, "you mean to tell me—"</p>
                  <p>"Mamma," Eric said, plaintively, "do sit down. Don't excite yourself. Good
                     Heaven! where's the use of everybody taking things so seriously in this
                     way—getting steam up to such a height for nothing? I mean to tell you that I
                     have met a girl I like a thousand times better than France Forrester; that I
                     have asked her to marry me; that I have asked her father for his consent, and
                     that he has given his consent, contingent upon yours. There is the whole matter
                     for you in a nutshell."</p>
                  <p>His mother dropped back, stunned.</p>
                  <p>"In three weeks," she murmured, in a dazed voice, "all this in three weeks'
                     time."</p>
                  <p>"We live in a rapid age, mother," responded the young man, coolly. "Time is
                     precious; why waste it? Strange it may seem, but no less strange than true. And
                     truth is stranger than fiction. It is an accomplished fact."</p>
                  <p>"Who is she?" Lady Dynely asked, helplessly.</p>
                  <p>"France's question over again. She is Miss Higgins."</p>
                  <p>"Higgins!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, poor child. It's not a distinguished appellation, and a rose by any other
                     name does not smell as sweet. 'Christabel—twenty-first Viscountess Dynely,
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">née</foreign> Higgins,' will not look well in
                     Debrett. However, there is no rose without its thorn, they tell me. She is the
                     Vicar of Starling's eighth daughter."</p>
                  <p>"France said so," murmured her ladyship, still in that helplessly stunned
                     tone.</p>
                  <p>"Did she? Then we ought to have France burned as a witch. Terry hasn't been
                     writing to her, has he?"</p>
                  <pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6444-00000104"/>
                  <p>"I don't know. This girl is the sister of the girl Terry is going to
                     marry?"</p>
                  <p>"No, madame," said her son, coolly, filling another glass of sherry; "not her
                     sister, but herself."</p>
                  <p>"What!"</p>
                  <p>"What an amount of talking these things seem to involve," Eric said,
                     pathetically, "and how inexcusably void of comprehension people appear to be. I
                     repeat, my dear Lady Dynely, the young lady I intend to marry is the young lady
                     Mr. Dennison honored with his preference, and intended to transform into Mrs.
                     Dennison. Unfortunately for him, 'I came, I saw, I conquered.' She preferred me
                     to the big dragoon, and I left; Terry exclaiming, like Francis First at Pavia,
                     'All is lost but honor.'"</p>
                  <p>He paused. His mother had risen to her feet, every trace of color leaving her
                     face, her eyes fixed in a sort of horror upon her son.</p>
                  <p>"Eric," she said, huskily, "you tell me—you mean to tell me that you have taken
                     from Terry the girl he loved?"</p>
                  <p>Eric lifted his blonde eyebrows in weary resignation.</p>
                  <p>"If you put it in that sentimental way—yes, mamma."</p>
                  <p>She stood and looked at him. She tried to speak—no words came. The baseness of
                     this, after all Terry had resigned, the noble self-sacrifice he had shown—was
                     too much. He had given up his birthright to Eric, and this was Eric's
                     return.</p>
                  <p>"Mother," Eric cried, rising to his feet, aroused to something like alarm by
                     the pale horror of her face. "What is the matter now? Why do you take Terry's
                     affairs so much to heart? Isn't he big enough and old enough to look after
                     himself? Am I to blame, is she to blame, if she prefers me to him? I expected
                     to be taken to task on France's account, but, gad! I certainly didn't expect to
                     on Terry's."</p>
                  <p>"You don't know—you don't know—" she said in a broken voice.</p>
                  <p>"No, I don't know," Eric answered, with an impatient frown, "but I should
                     uncommonly like to. What is Dennison that I should let his feelings stand in my
                     way? He hadn't spoken, so he has no reason to complain. Here is a note from
                     him, by the way, to you."</p>
                  <p>He presented her the letter, and sat watching her while she read it, lying back
                     among the cushions of his chair. It was short:</p>

                                 as I have told him, he shall answer to me. She loves him with all
                                 her innocent heart, and she is so dear to me, that I would die to
                                 save her a moment's pain. Let him look to it, if he tires of her,
                                 and tries to throw her over. For you, if I have any claim whatever
                                 upon you, I ask this favor of you in return. Come here, take her to

                                 repaid. Ever yours,</p>

                  <p>She sank back on her sofa, crushed the letter in her hand, laid her face
                     against the cushions, and burst into an unrestrained passion of tears. Eric
                     arose angrily to his feet.</p>
                  <p>"I don't understand this," he said. "What is Dennison that his interests should
                     be nearer to you than mine? What has he said in the letter?"</p>
                  <p>"Nothing that concerns you to see," Lady Dynely said, proudly lifting her head.
                     "Have you anything more to say, Eric, before I go to dress?"</p>
                  <p>"This, that it is my wish you accompany me to Lincolnshire to-morrow, and
                     formally receive Crystal as my betrothed wife."</p>
                  <p>He stood haughtily erect before her—a young Sultan issuing his sovereign
                     commands to his womankind.</p>
                  <p>"I will go," she answered briefly. "Is there anything else?"</p>
                  <p>"That you will tell France—I don't wish any chaffing on this subject; it is a
                     weakness of Miss Forrester's to chaff a fellow, and is very bad form. Tell her
                     at once, and have done with it."</p>
                  <p>The youthful autocrat must be obeyed. With a weary sigh Lady Dynely sought out
                     Miss Forrester, and found her<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6444-00000105"/> quite
                     dressed and looking very handsome, sitting gazing with dreamy eyes at the sun
                     setting over the green Devon woods.</p>
                  <p>"Well, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ma mère?</foreign>" she asked.</p>
                  <p>"It is all as you said, France," my lady answered; "he fell in love in
                     Lincolnshire."</p>
                  <p>Miss Forrester laughed, and yet with a touch of feminine pique too.</p>
                  <p>"I knew it. I felt it in the uttermost depth of my prophetic soul— <q>

                  <p>"One of the nine Misses Higgins."</p>
                  <p>"And Terry and Eric will be brothers-in-law, as I said. What a capital joke,
                     Lady Dynely."</p>
                  <p>"No, France—not brothers-in-law. It is—"</p>
                  <p>But France started impetuously to her feet.</p>
                  <p>"Lady Dynely don't say it. Don't say it is the particular Miss Higgins Terry
                     wanted. Don't make me think so badly of Eric as that."</p>
                  <p>But Lady Dynely sat sorrowful and mute, and France read all the truth in that
                     sad face.</p>
                  <p>"It is, then. Oh, this is too bad! too bad!—too bad of her, too bad of Eric. It
                     reminds one of the Scripture story of the cruel man who took his neighbor's one
                     ewe lamb. My poor, good Terry!"</p>
                  <p>She sat down, her eyes flashing through bright tears.</p>
                  <p>"I knew him weak and fickle," she said; "I never thought him dishonorable. For
                     her," contemptuously, "she never could have been worth one thought from Terry
                     Dennison."</p>
                  <p>"I have had a letter from Terry," Lady Dynely said, sadly. "Poor fellow! he
                     makes no mention of coming back. He wishes me to accompany Eric to Lincolnshire
                     and formally countenance the engagement."</p>
                  <p>"You will go, of course?"</p>
                  <p>"I can do nothing else. And you, France—you care wholly on Terry's account, I
                     am sure, not at all on your own."</p>
                  <p>"Not in the least on my own," France said, holding her handsome head high, her
                     dark eyes still full of indignant fire. "But Terry loved this girl, and Terry—I
                     must say it, though I offend you, Lady Dynely—is worth two hundred Erics. Oh,
                     it is a shame—a shame!"</p>
                  <p>They met at dinner. Miss Forrester's greeting was of the coldest and most
                     constrained. Eric was his own natural, languid, charming self, at his best. His
                     mother's sad, pale face he would not see, France's flushed cheeks and angry
                     eyes he overlooked.</p>
                  <p>"It takes two to make a row," Eric thought; "you won't make a row with me."</p>
                  <p>Once France spoke of Terry—her bright, angry eyes fixed upon his face, her own
                     wearing a very resolute look. Where was Terry? How had he left him? Where was
                     he going? When did he mean to return? Eric bore it heroically. <q>

                     </q> he laughed. "How you ring the changes on that classical name. I don't know
                     anything of Terry's outgoings and incomings. Am I my brother's keeper? Your
                     solicitude does Mr. Dennison too much honor."</p>
                  <p>She turned from him.</p>
                  <p>"He has no heart," she thought; "no sense of remorse; no feeling for any human
                     being but himself. I pity Miss Crystal Higgins."</p>
                  <p>The evening brought Mr. Locksley, the artist.</p>
                  <p>"So he comes still," Eric thought, watching with sleepy, half-closed eyes his
                     mother and the artist playing chess, while France sat at the piano and sang
                     softly. "I wonder—I wonder if this is the secret of your queenly indifference,
                     Miss Forrester, to me."</p>
                  <p>Next day Lady Dynely and her son departed. France watched Eric out of sight
                     with a smile, the fag end of an old ballad on her lips: <q>

                  <head type="sub">"ONCE MORE THE GATE BEHIND ME FALLS."</head>
                  <p>IN that pleasant upper room of Dynely Abbey, set apart as Mr. Locksley's
                     studio, and sacred wholly to that artist and his painting goods and chattels,
                     Mr. Locksley himself stood on the morning of the day that took Lady Dynely and
                     her son to Lincolnshire. He stood with folded arms and a darkly thoughtful
                     look, gazing at his own work. As he stood there, tall, strong, erect, the
                     soldierly air that told of his past calling was more manifest than ever.</p>
                  <p>This portrait was a gem—something more than an ordinary portrait—as a work of
                     art, worthy of Reynolds or Romney. It had been a labor of love, heart and soul
                     had been in the work, and the result did what the works of master hands seldom
                     do, satisfied himself.</p>
                  <p>From a darkly misty background the face of France Forrester shone vividly out,
                     startlingly life-like in coloring and expression. He had caught her very look,
                     that mischievous sparkle of eye and smile, that brightly mutinous turn of the
                     graceful head, as she leaned forward from the canvas. Those darkly laughing
                     eyes looked up at the artist now from beneath that floating chevelure of rich,
                     waving hair, the perfect lips smiled upon him saucily, as though they
                     understood his sombre thoughts and mocked at them.</p>
                  <p>"As she would, most likely," he thought, "if she knew all. But no—that is not
                     France Forrester. Proud she is, proud of the name she bears, the lineage that
                     lies behind her and the place she holds in life, but to laugh at any mortal
                     pain is not in her. I can see the first flush of haughty anger and amaze at the
                     nameless painter's presumption—then the soft womanly compassion for his
                     suffering, that would make gentle and tender her parting words. And yet I have
                     thought that if she knew all, the whole truth"—he paused suddenly and turned
                     impatiently away towards the window. "What a fool I am," he muttered,
                     half-aloud. "She loves that handsome dandy, of course—he is the sort of gilded
                     fop womankind make idols of. Could I not see it in her face last night?"</p>
                  <p>He stood staring out at my lady's carefully kept Italian garden, all ablaze
                     with gorgeous August flowers. It was a sultry, overcast day—sunless, windless,
                     gray. Early in the morning the sun had come out with a dazzling brightness,
                     only to vanish again and leave behind a low, leaden sky, frowning with drifting
                     cloud.</p>
                  <p>The great house was very still. My lord and lady had gone; Miss Forrester's
                     clear voice, and the light, silken rustle of her garments were nowhere to be
                     heard. She was not to sit to Mr. Locksley any more; the last sitting had been
                     given a week ago, and though he still came daily it was but to add the few last
                     finishing touches to his perfected work. He dined with the two ladies at
                     intervals, and spent occasional evenings at the Abbey when there were no other
                     visitors. From general society he shrank; but he never refused my lady's
                     cordial invitations when she and her ward were alone. It might have been wiser
                     if he had. They were growing dangerously dear to him, these long tête-à-tête
                     evenings with the heiress of Caryllyne; perilously precious, this standing
                     beside her, turning over her music, listening to the old ballads she loved to
                     sing, watching the white, flying fingers, the tender, lovely, spirited face—how
                     dear, how precious, he was finding out now to his cost.</p>
                  <p>He turned from the window and began pacing impatiently up and down the long,
                     lofty room. In spite of the wide open window the atmosphere was almost
                     painfully oppressive. So sultry, so airless was the leaden day, that it was
                     only by an effort one could breathe. The physical suffering blended with the
                     mental. He loosened the strip of black ribbon at his throat, as though even
                     that suffocated him. He was facing for the first time the bare truth to-day. He
                     had shut his eyes wilfully to his own danger; the moth had<pb n="216-217"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000107"/> seen the lighted candle, and intoxicated by its
                     brilliancy, had still flown headlong in. Was the moth to be pitied, then, let
                     him singe his wings ever so badly?</p>
                  <p>"I will go!" he said to himself, abruptly, "I will go to-morrow. Flight is
                     one's only safeguard in these things. If I stay, if I see any more of her I
                     will commit the last crowning act of folly, and tell her all. My work is
                     finished—there is no cause to linger. Yes, I will go—I will start for Spain
                     to-morrow, and explore it from the Escurial to the Alhambra, and in painting
                     dark-eyed Morisco maidens and bullfights I will forget this summer's
                     fooling."</p>
                  <p>He looked at his watch—two o'clock. Three was his dinner hour—it would take him
                     the hour to walk to the village. He made his headquarters at the
                     "Kiddle-a-wink" in the village of Dynely, and slept in that upper chamber
                     wherein sixteen years before, one summer night, Alexis Dynely lay dying.</p>
                  <p>As he passed out from the house into the sultry afternoon, he glanced up at the
                     sky. It was growing darker every instant—a faint, damp rain was beginning to
                     fall. It was doubtful, good walker though he was, if he would outstrip the
                     storm and reach the inn before the summer rain fell. He looked around as he
                     walked rapidly away, to catch a glimpse of a gauzy dress, to hear a girl's
                     sweet voice singing, to see a graceful head bent over a book or a drawing. Miss
                     Forrester, however, was nowhere to be seen. It was as well so, perhaps.</p>
                  <p>"I will call this evening and make my adieux to both ladies," he thought, and,
                     pulling his hat over his eyes, strode rapidly on his way.</p>
                  <p>Yes, he would leave England on the morrow—for good and all this time. Where was
                     the use of coming back, where the sight of the familiar places, the familiar
                     faces that knew him no more, brought nothing but pain? He would make Rome his
                     headquarters for life, and give himself up utterly to his art. A boy's mad
                     folly, a woman's base deceit had wrecked his life sixteen years ago. He had
                     been thrust out from his mother's home and heart with scorn and bitter words,
                     his birthright given to a stranger. It never occurred to him to sue for
                     commutation of that sentence. With the past he had nothing to do; he had
                     deserved his fate, he had disgraced his name; his mother had done rightly; in
                     the future the art he loved was all he had left him. He would start upon his
                     second exile to-morrow. This time there should be no looking back, this time it
                     should be life-long. To return to England meant returning to see her the happy
                     wife of Lord Dynely; to return and sue for his mother's favor, meant to oust
                     her from her fortune, to rake up all the old dead-and-gone scandal, to bring
                     the shame from which that mother, the haughtiest woman in England, had fled
                     sixteen years before, back to her in its first force. No, there was nothing for
                     him but silence and exile to the end.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Locksley?"</p>
                  <p>The clear sweet voice made him look up from his moody reverie with a start. And
                     then, like a vision, France Forrester's brightly smiling face, set in a
                     ravishing bonnet, beamed upon him. Miss Forrester, with a tiny groom behind
                     her, drove a low, basket phaeton and a pair of spanking little ponies. She drew
                     up the ponies in dashing style, and turned to the artist with that bewitching
                     smile of hers.</p>
                  <p>"Are you going home, Mr. Locksley—I mean to the inn? Pray don't go just yet.
                     Let me offer you this vacant seat. I have something to say to you."</p>
                  <p>Was fate pursuing him when he meant to fly from danger? He took the seat beside
                     her, and Miss Forrester with a touch of her parasol-whip, sent the little
                     steppers briskly ahead.</p>
                  <p>"I am alone to-day—do you know it? And as I didn't expect even your society,
                     Mr. Locksley—I came away. They left by the early train this morning."</p>
                  <p>"They—who?"</p>
                  <p>"Lady Dynely and Eric. Oh, you don't know, then—I thought perhaps she had told
                     you over your chessmen last evening. Yes, they started for Lincolnshire this
                     morning—to be gone a week at the least; and I am queen regent, monarch of all I
                     survey, until their return. The first use I<pb n="218-219"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000108"/> make of my liberty is to spend a whole long day
                     at dear old Caryllynne. It is not nearly so ancient nor so stately as the
                     Abbey, but I love it a hundred times more. Have you ever been there, Mr.
                     Locksley?"</p>
                  <p>She looked up at him, half wondering at the dark gravity of his face.</p>
                  <p>"I have been there, Miss Forrester."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed! Strange that Mrs. Matthews, the housekeeper, told me nothing about
                     it."</p>
                  <p>"I have not been in the house."</p>
                  <p>"Then you have missed an artistic treat. The Caryll picture gallery is the
                     pride of the neighborhood; there is nothing like it in the whole country. Mrs.
                     Caryll, as I have told you, is really a devotee of art, and always was. There
                     are Cuyp's, and Wouvermain's, and Sir Joshua's portrait, and sunsets by Turner,
                     and sunrises by Claude Lorraine, a gallery of modern and a gallery of Venetian
                     art. Oh, you really must see it, and at once. I shall drive you over and play
                     cicerone. Nothing I like so well as showing the dear, romantic old Manor."</p>
                  <p>"You are most kind, Miss Forrester," he said, with a sort of effort, "but it is
                     quite impossible. I mean," seeing her look of surprise, "that as I leave
                     Devonshire to-morrow, I will have no time. Wandering artists don't keep valets,
                     so I must attend to the packing of my own portmanteau, and that, with some
                     letters to write, will detain me until midnight."</p>
                  <p>He was not looking at her, else he might have seen and possibly understood the
                     swift, startled pallor that came over her face.</p>
                  <p>"You are going away?" she said, slowly.</p>
                  <p>"The portrait is finished, my work here is done. I owe Lady Dynely and you,
                     Miss Forrester, many thanks for your kind efforts to render my sojourn
                     agreeable."</p>
                  <p>"If Lady Dynely were here," Miss Forrester answered, her color returning, and
                     in her customary gay manner, "she would say the thanks were due you, for
                     helping to while away two poor women's long, dull evenings. Isn't it rather a
                     pity to go before she returns? She will regret it extremely, I know."</p>
                  <p>"If I had known of this sudden departure, I would have made my adieux to her
                     ladyship last night. May I further trespass on your great kindness, Miss
                     Forrester, and charge you with my farewell?"</p>
                  <p>She bent her head and set her lips a little as she cut the ponies sharply with
                     her whip. It had come upon her almost like a blow, this sudden revelation, but
                     her pride and thorough training hid all sign.</p>
                  <p>"Artists are like gypsies—ever on the wing—that I know of old. And whither do
                     you go, Mr. Locksley? Back to the green lanes and rural quiet and the inspiring
                     surroundings of old Brompton."</p>
                  <p>"Farther still," he said, with a smile; "to Spain. I have roamed almost over
                     every quarter of the habitable globe in my forty years of life, but Spain is
                     still a terra incognita. I have had an intense desire ever since I gave myself
                     up wholly to art to make a walking tour over the country. One should find a
                     thousand subjects there for brush and pencil."</p>
                  <p>"To Spain," she repeated, mechanically; "and then?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, I can hardly say. I shall devote a year at least to Spain, and then most
                     probably I shall return to Rome and make it my headquarters for life."</p>
                  <p>There was dead silence. The ponies bowled swiftly along; the road that led to
                     the village had long been passed. Neither noticed it. The thoughtful gravity
                     had deepened on his face. Her hands grasped the reins tightly, her lips were
                     set in a certain rigid line. Her voice, when she spoke again, had lost somewhat
                     of its clear, vibrating ring.</p>
                  <p>"You picture a very delightful future, Mr. Locksley; I almost envy you. Oh, no
                     need to look incredulous—the Bohemian life is the freest, brightest, happiest
                     on earth, but it is not for me. What I waylaid you for—to return to first
                     principles—is this. I have had a letter from my dear old guardian, Mrs. Caryll,
                     and she begs me to send her a duplicate of my portrait. She has one, but that
                     was painted five years ago, and I have been chanting the praises of your
                     handiwork until she is seized with a longing for a copy. You flatter me so
                     charmingly on canvas, Mr. Locksley, that I really should like to gratify her if
                     it were possible to<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6444-00000109"/> procure her the
                     copy. But I suppose all that is out of the question now."</p>
                  <p>"Mrs. Caryll shall have the copy. I trust she is well. I saw her so often in
                     Rome," he said, half apologetically, "that I take an interest in her
                     naturally."</p>
                  <p>"She is as well as she is ever likely to be," France answered, rather sadly,
                     "and so lonely without me that I think of throwing over everything and going
                     back to join her. I should infinitely prefer it, but she will not hear of it
                     and neither will Lady Dynely. I must remain, it seems, and run the round of
                     Vanity Fair whether I wish it or not. I ought not to complain—I
                        <emph>did</emph> enjoy last season. Come what will," with a half laugh, "I
                     have been blessed."</p>
                  <p>"Mrs. Caryll has no intention then of returning to England?"</p>
                  <p>She will never return. It is full of bitter associations for her. It would
                     break her heart to see poor old Caryllynne."</p>
                  <p>"She still takes her son's wrongdoing so much to heart—she is still so bitter
                     against him? Pardon me, Miss Forrester, I have heard that story, of
                     course."</p>
                  <p>"There is no apology needed. You will wonder, perhaps when I tell you, you
                     remind us all of him. That is the secret of Lady Dynely's interest in you from
                     the first."</p>
                  <p>The clear, penetrating, hazel eyes were fixed full on his face. That trained
                     face never moved a muscle.</p>
                  <p>"As to being bitter against him," pursued France, "it is just the reverse. It
                     is remorse for her own cruelty that drives her nearly to despair at times. For
                     she was cruel to him, poor fellow, when he came to her in his great trouble and
                     shame—most cruel, most unmotherly. He came to her in his sorrow and
                     humiliation, and she drove him from her with bitter scorn and anger.
                        <emph>That</emph> is the thought that blights her life, that has preyed upon
                     her health, that makes the thought of home horrible to her. She drove him from
                     her into poverty and exile here, and here she will never return. A thousand
                     times she has said to me, that, to look upon his face once more, to hold him in
                     her arms, to hear him say he forgave her, she would give up her very life, give
                     up all things except her hope of Heaven."</p>
                  <p>"She has said that?"</p>
                  <p>She was too wrapped in her subject to heed his husky voice, to mark the change
                     that had come over his face.</p>
                  <p>"Again and again. The hope of seeing him once more is the sole hope that keeps
                     her alive."</p>
                  <p>"She thinks that <emph>he</emph> is still living?"</p>
                  <p>"She thinks it. Every year since that time, with the exception of the two last,
                     he has sent her some remembrance. A line, a trinket, a flower, a token of some
                     sort to let her know he still exists. Those tokens have come to her from every
                     quarter of the globe. India, Africa, America, and all countries of Europe.
                     There is never an address—merely the post-mark to denote whence they came, and
                     his name in his own familiar hand. Ah! if we but knew where to look for
                     him—where to find him, I believe I would travel the wide earth over, if at the
                     end I could find Gordon Caryll."</p>
                  <p>"Miss Forrester! you would do this?"</p>
                  <p>"A hundred times more than this! He was my hero, Mr. Locksley, as far back as I
                     can remember. There is no one, in all the world, I long so to see."</p>
                  <p>"And yet the day that finds him robs you of a fortune."</p>
                  <p>She looked up at him indignantly, impetuous tears in her eyes, an excited flush
                     on either dusk cheek, more beautiful than he had ever seen her.</p>
                  <p>"A fortune! Mr. Locksley, do you think no better of me than that? Oh! what
                     would a million fortunes be to the joy of seeing him once more—of restoring him
                     to his mother! Caryllynne is not mine—only held in trust. One day or other, I
                     feel, Gordon Caryll will return, and then 'the king shall have his own
                     again!'"</p>
                  <p>What was it she read in the face of the man looking down at her? Something more
                     than intense admiration surely, though she read that there plainly enough. It
                     brought her down from her heroics, from cloudland to earth, from romance to her
                     sober senses. She pulled up the ponies sharply.</p>
                  <p>"We must go back," she said, in a constrained tone. "I have passed the turning
                     to the village. As you insist upon going at once to the inn, I suppose a
                     'wilful man must have his way.'"</p>
                  <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6444-00000110"/>
                  <p>He touched the reins lightly with his hand, and checked her in the act of
                     turning.</p>
                  <p>"Excuse me, Miss Forrester; I have changed my mind. I resist no longer. Since
                     you are so kind as to be my guide, I will gladly go with you to Carryllynne and
                     see the picture."</p>
                  <p>She looked at him again—rather haughtily it seemed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <unclear>"You are</unclear> quite sure it is your wish, Mr. Locksley, and not a
                     matter of politeness? You are quite sure it will not inconvenience you at
                     all?"</p>
                  <p>"Quite sure, Miss Forrester. I wish to go."</p>
                  <p>She turned without a word and drove on. The distance was short. In a few
                     minutes the great Manor gates were reached, and not an instant too soon. The
                     summer storm, threatening all day, was upon them at last. As they passed
                     beneath the lofty arch of masonry, two great drops splashed upon their
                     faces.</p>
                  <p>They sped up the avenue, beneath the dark waving trees, at full speed. A groom
                     came out to take the horses. Two or three old servants, on board wages, still
                     kept up the place. Not an instant too soon; the rain was beginning to fall
                     heavily and fast, and a sharp flash of blue lightning cut the dark air.</p>
                  <p>"Hurry! hurry!" was Miss Forrester's cry, as, laughing and breathless, she ran
                     up the steps. "Welcome to Caryllynne, Mr. Locksley!"</p>
                  <p>He removed his hat with a certain reverence, as though he stood in a church;
                     emotion on his face she could not read. She led the way into the vast tiled
                     hall, the black and white marble flooring covered with skins of wild
                     beasts.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Mathews, the housekeeper, came forward to receive her young lady.</p>
                  <p>"We have come to see the pictures, Mrs. Mathews," Miss Forrester said, "and, as
                     we appear to be storm-bound for some hours, I think I must ask you to give us
                     some lunch. This is Mr. Locksley, and as Mr. Locksley has not dined, pray give
                     us something that will serve as a substitute."</p>
                  <p>Sixteen years ago Mrs. Mathews had been housekeeper here. She bowed
                     deferentially, her eyes fixed upon Mr. Locksley with a curiously intense gaze.
                     As she turned away she met her daughter, also domesticated here.</p>
                  <p>"Who is it, mother?" the girl asked. "Who is the gentleman? Lord Dynely—Mr.
                     Dennison?"</p>
                  <p>"Neither," her mother answered. "His name is Mr. Locksley; and if ever I saw
                     one man's eyes in another man's head, he has the eyes of Mr. Gordon
                     Caryll."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
                  <head type="sub">"STAY."</head>
                  <p>MISS FORRESTER ran lightly to one of the upper rooms to remove her bonnet and
                     lace scarf. It was but a moment's work. Her guest awaited her below; but she
                     made no haste to rejoin him. She stood by one of the windows looking down
                     blankly at the rain-beaten garden, and trying to realize what she had been
                     told. He was going away—going away the first thing to-morrow—never to return to
                     England more.</p>
                  <p>She lingered, leaning against the window, while the rain lashed the clear
                     glass, and beat down the tall ferns and grasses and flowers, heedless of how
                     the moments passed.</p>
                  <p>All at once she awoke—as one might from a dream—broad awake. Why was she
                     lingering? To-morrow was still to-morrow; to-day was here and he with it. He
                     was her guest, in this house by her invitation; the duty of hospitality called
                     her to his side. The rôle of love-lorn damsel was a rôle entirely out of her
                     part in the drama of life. She would put off all thought of what to-morrow must
                     bring until to-morrow came.</p>
                  <p>She found Mr. Locksley loitering through the long drawing-room, looking at the
                     few pictures it contained, mostly family portraits, examining the curiously
                     carved ebony chairs and cabinets, the sandalwood caskets, the great porcelain
                     jars filled with roses and lavender, and touching tenderly, as though they were
                     sensitive things, the curious, old china, the quaint, pretty trifles scattered
                     everywhere, just as Mrs. Caryll's hand had placed them last.</p>
                  <p>"Isn't it a darling old room," France said. "Everything old-fashioned, and
                     quaint, and queer, and faded, with no modern newness or splendor anywhere, and
                     yet twice as beautiful as any of the grand recently-fitted up rooms of the
                     Abbey. Everything is just as it was left when she went away—this room and her
                     room. In Gordon's too, poor fellow, nothing has been changed."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Locksley looked at her—a curious smile on his face, a curious expression in
                     his eyes, half cynical, half sad.</p>
                  <p>"What an interest you seem to take in Gordon Caryll, Miss Forrester—this black
                     sheep of a spotless flock, this one scapegoat of an irreproachable family. Was
                     he worthy of it."</p>
                  <p>"Most worthy of it, I am sure. He was unfortunate, Mr. Locksley; he ruined
                     himself for a woman's sake. It's not a common act of folly—men don't do that
                     now-a-days, they're not capable of it. I think I should like them a little
                     better if they were. There's a sort of heroism, after all, about a man who
                     deliberately throws up all his prospects in life for a woman."</p>
                  <p>"Very doubtful heroism, Miss Forrester, it seems to have been in his case. He
                     took a leap in the dark, and awoke to find himself in a quagmire of disgrace,
                     from which all his life long he can never arise. What a pretty garden."</p>
                  <p>He joined her at one of the windows and stood looking down. The Caryllynne
                     gardens covered in all some half-dozen acres, utterly neglected of late years,
                     and running wild, a very wilderness of moss-grown paths, tangled roses and
                     honeysuckles, clematis and syringa, fallen statues, empty marble basins, where
                     fountains once had been. Over all, to-day, the wildly sweeping rain and vivid
                     play of summer lightning.</p>
                  <p>"Ruin and decay everywhere," France said, with a sigh. "It is plain to be seen
                     no master's eye ever rests here. The gardens of Caryllynne, years ago, Mr.
                     Locksley, were the glory of the place. This was Mrs. Caryll's; it has never
                     been kept up since she went away."</p>
                  <p>"But you, Miss Forrester, I should think that—"</p>
                  <p>"Nothing shall be changed—nothing altered by me. As Gordon Caryll left, so he
                     shall find it when he comes back."</p>
                  <p>"You are so sure he will come back, then."</p>
                  <p>"As sure as that I stand here. I don't know why, but<pb n="226-227"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000112"/> ever since I have been old enough to hear about
                     him and think about him I have known that he will come back."</p>
                  <p>"And that return will really make you—really make his mother happy?"</p>
                  <p>"It will be new life to his mother. It will make me happier than anything," she
                     paused a moment and her color rose—"<emph>almost</emph> happier than anything
                     on earth."</p>
                  <p>"Then in spite of the past Gordon Caryll ought to be a happy man. You have
                     never seen him—this forgotten exile in whom you take so deep an interest?"</p>
                  <p>"I have never seen him, but I have seen his picture and have heard of him from
                     my earliest childhood, and whenever and wherever we meet I shall know him."</p>
                  <p>He gave a quick start, flushed slightly and laughed. She looked up at him in
                     surprise.</p>
                  <p>"You will know him—you who have never seen him—you think that, Miss
                     Forrester?"</p>
                  <p>"I think that, Mr. Locksley."</p>
                  <p>"But he will have changed—sixteen years and more is a tolerable time. No, Miss
                     Forrester, you might meet him face to face, talk to him, clasp hands, and still
                     be as strangers. Time and trouble change men; sixteen years knocking around the
                     world, leading the sort of life he has led, a free companion, a soldier of
                     fortune, will change any man. Miss Forrester, believe me, when you meet, if
                     ever you do meet, you will not know Gordon Caryll."</p>
                  <p>He paused abruptly. The dark, penetrating eyes were watching him with a
                     suspicious intentness he did not care to meet.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Locksley," she said quickly, "<emph>you</emph> were a soldier of
                     fortune—you fought in India about the same time, or so Terry Dennison has told
                     me. Did you ever meet Gordon Caryll?"</p>
                  <p>His face flushed again, dark red. There was an instant's silence—then once more
                     he laughed.</p>
                  <p>"You are a sorceress, Miss Forrester. What have I said to make you think
                     so?"</p>
                  <p>"You have said nothing. And yet—Mr. Locksley, if you know anything tell me. I
                     would give half my life to know."</p>
                  <p>"Well, then—yes," but the answer was given reluctantly, "I think I once met
                     Gordon Caryll."</p>
                  <p>She clasped her hands together, and stood looking at him breathlessly.</p>
                  <p>"In India?" she asked.</p>
                  <p>"In India I met a man that I judge may have been the man you mean. He was not
                     called Caryll—how was it he called himself? And yet I know from certain things
                     he told me of his history that he was the man."</p>
                  <p>Her eager eyes were fixed upon him, her eager lips were apart, the sensitive
                     color coming and going in her face.</p>
                  <p>"Go on," she breathed.</p>
                  <p>"I have very little to tell. He told me his story one night as we lay beside
                     our bivouac fire—the story of his terrible mistake—of his terrible awakening—of
                     his divorce from the woman who had so utterly deceived him—of his return to
                     England—of his sentence of outlawry and exile. I know he had no intention of
                     ever trying to have that sentence revoked—he felt that he deserved it. It was
                     simple justice; he bowed his head and accepted his doom. He had dishonored a
                     name never approached by disgrace until he bore it; he had broken his father's
                     heart and brought him to the grave; he had driven his mother forever from the
                     home and the country he had resigned. What return—what earthly redemption,
                     could there be for him?"</p>
                  <p>"And yet there is—there is!" she broke forth vehemently. "From first to last he
                     was more sinned against than sinning. He loved that woman—that wicked, wretched
                     woman, whose memory I hate—and he would have given up all things for love of
                     her, had she not been the wretch she was. He came to his mother in his trouble,
                     and she thrust him forth. She has repented—oh, how bitterly—and the only
                     happiness life can hold for her is to make atonement, to receive and forgive
                     him again. Oh, Mr. Locksley, if you know anything of him now, if you can aid me
                     in finding him, help me. Bring him back to us, to his mother, to his home, and
                     the whole gratitude of my life will be yours."</p>
                  <p>She stretched forth both her hands to him. He took them, very pale, and held
                     them in his.</p>
                  <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6444-00000113"/>
                  <p>"He will rob you of a noble inheritance. Have you any right to throw it away?
                     What will Lord Dynely say to that?"</p>
                  <p>"Lord Dynely!" She looked at him in angry surprise. "What has Lord Dynely to do
                     with this!"</p>
                  <p>"Much, since he has to do with you. The day that restores Gordon Caryll to his
                     mother, robs you of half your fortune."</p>
                  <p>"You spoke of that before, Mr. Locksley. Never speak of it again. What are a
                     thousand fortunes compared to the right?—to seeing her, my best and dearest
                     friend, happy, and him restored from wandering and exile to his own?"</p>
                  <p>"And as Lady Dynely you can afford to be magnanimous—a fortune more or less can
                     concern you little."</p>
                  <p>She looked at him still haughtily, but with a heart beginning to beat fast. If
                     he cared nothing for her, why this bitter tone, this pale, stern face?</p>
                  <p>"As Lady Dynely. There is some mistake here, Mr. Locksley. I don't know what
                     you mean."</p>
                  <p>"I beg your pardon, Miss Forrester. It is presumptuous, no doubt, in me to
                     allude to it, but as your engagement to Lord Dynely is no secret, I may—"</p>
                  <p>"My engagement to Lord Dynely! Who says I am engaged to Lord Dynely? I am
                     nothing of the sort. Lord Dynely is engaged to a clergyman's daughter in
                     Lincolnshire."</p>
                  <p>He stood still, looking at her, his head in a whirl, wonder, incredulity, blank
                     amaze in his face.</p>
                  <p>"There was some sort of foolish compact between Mrs. Caryll and Lady Dynely,"
                     proceeded Miss Forrester, "to marry us when we grew up—a compact in which I
                     have had no part—and which we never could ratify. Eric and I have grown up as
                     brother and sister—more than we are now we never will or could be to each
                     other. With the ordering of my life or fortune, <emph>he</emph>, at least, has
                     nothing to do."</p>
                  <p>There was a moment's pause—a most awkward and uncomfortable pause for Miss
                     Forrester. Mr. Locksley stood still, so petrified by this sudden revelation
                     that his very breath seemed taken away.</p>
                  <p>"I thought—I thought," he said, "you loved him."</p>
                  <p>She made no answer.</p>
                  <p>"I thought you loved him," he went on. "I thought you were engaged to him. And
                     last night, when he returned, I fancied I read new happiness in your face—that
                     his coming had brought it, and it was more than I could bear. I had done with
                     loving—or so I thought—done with women forever, and yet I accepted Lady
                     Dynely's invitation and came down here. And I thought you were to be his wife,
                     that all your heart was his, and I—"</p>
                  <p>"Resolved to run away to Spain, and in painting dark-eyed Spanish donnas,
                     forget France Forrester."</p>
                  <p>She laughed as she spoke. Her dark face was flushed, but the old, gay,
                     mischief-loving spirit was back. She could not look at her lover, but she could
                     laugh at him.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," he said, moodily, "there are some dangers from which flight is the only
                     safeguard. You, a wealthy heiress in your first youth—I, a man of forty, poor,
                     unknown, an artist whose brush brings him the bread he eats. You cannot realize
                     more fully than I do, how insane my love for you is."</p>
                  <p>"Have I said it was insane?"</p>
                  <p>"France!" he cried.</p>
                  <p>She did not speak.</p>
                  <p>"France," he cried again, "can it be possible that you care for me! Speak my
                     fate in one word—shall it be go, or stay?"</p>
                  <p>She turned toward him, the dark eyes full of radiant light, and answered:</p>
                  <p>"Stay!"</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
                  <head type="sub">"GORDON CARYLL."</head>
                  <p>TEN minutes have passed. All that it is necessary to say has been said; the
                     first delirium is over, and reason has resumed her sway.</p>
                  <p>"But what will Lady Dynely say?" Locksley asks. "How am I to go and tell her
                     that the impecunious artist whom she brought down here, to paint her ward's
                     picture, has had the presumption to fall in love with his sitter, and declare
                     that presumptuous passion? And what will your guardian in Rome say—Mrs.
                     Caryll?"</p>
                  <p>"I don't know that it matters very greatly what they say," France laughs. "Mrs.
                     Caryll I should like to please certainly, but since I am not to marry Lord
                     Dynely, I do not think her objections will be very difficult to overcome. For
                     Lady Dynely, I am under her care for the present, but to control my actions in
                     any way she has no right whatever. I shall be of age in two years, and
                     then"—she looks up into the eager face above her, still laughing—"and then, so
                     you are pleased, it won't matter very greatly what all the world together
                     says."</p>
                  <p>"That means you will be wife. France—am I to believe it—that one day I may
                     claim you as my own?"</p>
                  <p>"If you care to have me. And, meantime, I suppose you will give up your idea of
                     rushing out of the world, and remain here like a reasonable mortal, and paint
                     that duplicate picture for dear old grandmamma Caryll."</p>
                  <p>"I will do anything you say—I will paint a thousand duplicates—I will stay here
                     and face an army of guardians if necessary, and be branded as a fortune-hunter,
                     an adventurer. For a fortune-hunter they will call me, and believe me to
                     be."</p>
                  <p>"Not in my presence, at least," France answers; "no one, not those I hold
                     nearest and dearest, shall speak ill of you and remain my friend. And speaking
                     of fortune, I hope you have no objection to my restoring to Gordon Caryll,
                     should he at any time return, all the inheritance his mother bequeathes me. I
                     hold it in trust; and let him appear tomorrow, or thirty years from now, I will
                     still return it."</p>
                  <p>Locksley laughed.</p>
                  <p>"I object! Not likely! Still—I hope he will not come!"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Locksley!"</p>
                  <p>"I decline to answer to that name any longer to you. I have another, though the
                     idea does not seem to have occurred to you."</p>
                  <p>"What is it? I have seen G. Locksley at the bottom of your pictures. What is
                     it? George? Godfrey? Geoffry? What?</p>
                  <p>"None of these—my name is—"</p>
                  <p>The dark, luminous eyes were lifted to his face.</p>
                  <p>"Is—well?"</p>
                  <p>"My name is Gordon."</p>
                  <p>"Gordon!" a startled expression came over her face for a moment—her eagerly
                     wistful eyes looked at him. But he met her gaze with his curiously
                     imperturbable smile.</p>
                  <p>"It is a favorite cognomen of yours, I know. There are other Gordons in the
                     world beside Gordon Caryll, who as I said before, I hope will never
                     return."</p>
                  <p>"And why?"</p>
                  <p>"Because I am mortally jealous of him. He has always been your hero, by your
                     own showing—is so still—and I feel in the depths of my prophetic soul that he
                     is destined to be my rival. If it were not for that, I might be tempted to—" a
                     smile and a provoking pause.</p>
                  <p>"Well, to what?" she cries with that pretty imperiousness of manner that was
                     one of her chief charms.</p>
                  <p>"To find him for you. It ought not to be an impossible task. I think I could
                     accomplish it, if I were quite sure your hero of the past would not become your
                     idol of the future. To bring him here with a halo of romance enveloping<pb
                        n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6444-00000115"/> ing him would be a dangerous
                     experiment. I had made up my mind to go and surrender you to Lord Dynely; to
                     surrender you now to Mr. Gordon Caryll—no, I am only human—I could not do that.
                     Lord Dynely would be a dangerous rival for any man living, with the youth and
                     the beauty of a Greek god; but Gordon Caryll must be old and as battered as
                     myself. To be ousted by him—"</p>
                  <p>He paused; she had clasped her hands, her lips were apart, her eyes were
                     dilated.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Locksley—"</p>
                  <p>"Gordon—Gordon—I told you my name."</p>
                  <p>"Gordon, then—do you think—<emph>do</emph> you think you can find him?"</p>
                  <p>"Caryll? Why, yes. I can try at least. I dare say he is as anxious to return as
                     you are to have him back. Only tell me, France, that when he is found he will
                     never come between you and me?"</p>
                  <p>She looks at him, an indignant flash in her eyes—an indignant flush on her
                     cheeks.</p>
                  <p>"Neither Gordon Caryll nor any man on earth can do that. I belong to you. Only
                     I want him back for his own sake, for his mother's, for mine. He has suffered
                     enough, been in exile long enough, for what at no time was his fault, but his
                     misfortune. Fetch him back, if you can—it is all that is needed to complete my
                     perfect happiness now."</p>
                  <p>The name of her lover does not come fluently from her lips yet. "Gordon." It is
                     an odd coincidence, she thinks, that he should resemble the exiled heir of
                     Caryllynne, and bear the same name. Some dim, vague suspicion is beginning to
                     creep over her, some shadow of suspicion rather; for, as yet, the truth is too
                     wildly unreal and improbable to be thought of. He knows more of Gordon Caryll,
                     she thinks, than he will tell, and the dark eyes look up at him wistfully,
                     searchingly. Something in Locksley's face makes her think the subject
                     distasteful to him. He stands there understanding her thoroughly, and with a
                     half-repressed smile on his lips. They have changed places it would seem; she
                     is no longer the haughty, high-born heiress—he no longer the obscure scure,
                     penniless artist, and soldier of fortune. It is his to rule, hers to obey.</p>
                  <p>"What a wretched expression of countenance, Miss Forrester," he said laughing.
                     "Are you regretting your hasty admission of five minutes ago? Are you sorry
                     already you bade me stay? If so—"</p>
                  <p>Her clasped hands tighten on his arm. Sorry she bade him stay! Her radiant eyes
                     answer that.</p>
                  <p>"Then it is solely on Gordon Caryll's account. Be at peace, my France, ask no
                     questions; we will talk of ourselves, not of him. Only be sure of this—he shall
                     return to his home, to his mother, and to you."</p>
                  <p>She lays her happy face against his shoulder in eloquent silence. So they
                     stand—looking out at the leaden summer afternoon, listening to the soft, dark
                     rush of the summer rain.</p>
                  <p>"How will we get back to Dynely Abbey if this lasts?" France says at last.</p>
                  <p>"It is not going to last," Mr. Locksley answers; "it is lighting already in the
                     west yonder. In two hours from now, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ma belle</foreign>,
                     you will drive me back to the village through a perfect blaze of sunset glory.
                     Meantime we have the house to see, luncheon to eat, and, by the same token, I
                     wish your old lady would hurry. It may seem unromantic, Miss Forrester,
                     but—"</p>
                  <p>"You have had no dinner and are famished," laughs France. "Here comes Mrs.
                     Mathews now, to announce that our banquet is ready."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Mathews enters, unutterably respectable to look at, in her stiff, black
                     silk, and widow's cap. Yes, luncheon is ready, and as Mrs. Mathews makes the
                     announcement, she gazes with strange intensity into the face of the tall,
                     bearded stranger. She remembers her young master as though she had seen him but
                     yesterday, and <emph>how</emph> like this gentleman is to him none but Mrs.
                     Mathews can realize. His eyes, his expression, the very trick of manner with
                     which he shakes back his thick brown hair. Her master returned! It cannot be,
                     else surely Miss France must know it; and yet—and yet—the house-keeper's eyes
                     followed him as one fascinated.</p>
                  <pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6444-00000116"/>
                  <p>She waits upon them. It is a very merry little repast. In spite of love's
                     delirium they both enjoy the creature comforts provided. Mr. Locksley is really
                     hungry—does the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">grande passion</foreign> ever impair a
                     healthy man's appetite? It does France good to see him eat. And then, luncheon
                     over, they saunter away to look at the rooms.</p>
                  <p>Locksley's prediction concerning the weather is already beginning to be
                     fulfilled. The afternoon has lighted up once more—the sun, behind its veil of
                     clouds still, will be out in full splendor presently; the rain falls, but
                     gently. The swift August storm is spent.</p>
                  <p>"We shall have a delicious drive home," France says, as they wander through
                     long suites of rooms, drawing-rooms, library, and picture-gallery. "What an
                     eventful day this has been. How little I thought, when I started forth
                     'fetter-less and free' this morning, that I should wear captive chains before
                     night; I am glad Lady Dynely is away—she would be certain to read all my
                     wrongdoing in my guilty face upon my return, and to sit down and tell her in
                     cold blood so soon, I could not. It would seem a sort of desecration."</p>
                  <p>You are sure you will never repent?" Locksley asks, uneasily. "You have made
                     but a miserable bargain, France. With your youth and beauty, your birth and
                     fortune, the offers you refused in the season, to end at last with a free
                     lance, an obscure artist, whose youth is passed, who can give you nothing but
                     an unknown name, and a heart that you took captive at sight, in return. My
                     darling, the world will tell you, and tell you truly, you have made but a sorry
                     bargain."</p>
                  <p>'The world will never tell it to me twice. Why do we talk of it? I love you;
                     with you I am happy—without you I am miserable—all is said in that."</p>
                  <p>There is silence for a time. They look at the pictured faces of dead-and-gone
                     Carylls, and do not see them. At last—.</p>
                  <p>"And so you take me blindfolded?" Locksley says. "You ask nothing of the forty
                     years that lie behind me? You give me yourself, without one question of what my
                     life has been? How are you to tell I am worthy of the gift?"</p>
                  <p>She looks at him and her happy face pales suddenly. All at once there returns
                     to her the memory of Eric's words, the memory of that hinted at, hidden away,
                     "obnoxious wife."</p>
                  <p>"I have a story to tell you," he says in answer to that startled look; "you
                     shall hear it before we quit this house—you shall know all my life as I know it
                     myself. How many more rooms have we to see? Whose is this?"</p>
                  <p>"It is—it was—Gordon Caryll's."</p>
                  <p>They pause on the threshold. The sun has come from behind the clouds and fills
                     the room with its slanting, amber glory. The rain has entirely ceased—a rainbow
                     spans the arch of blue sky they can see from the tall window.</p>
                  <p>"Nothing has been altered," France says softly; "everything is as he left it.
                     Books, pictures, pipes, whips, guns,—all!"</p>
                  <p>They enter. What a strange expression Locksley's face wears, the girl thinks,
                     as he looks around. She does not understand, and yet those vague, shapeless
                     suspicious are floating in her mind. They touch nothing—they stand together and
                     look, and the yellow sunshine gilds all. The books in their cases, the
                     handsomely framed proof engravings of dogs and horses, the pipes of all
                     nations, the sidearms of all countries—dirks, cimetars, swords, bowie knives,
                     the gaudy robe de chambre, now faded and dim, thrown over a chair back—all as
                     Gordon Caryll had left them.</p>
                  <p>They quit this room presently and enter the next. It was Mrs. Caryll's
                     sitting-room, in those long gone days, the room in which, as the twilight of
                     another August day fell, she stood and banished her only son from her side
                     forever.</p>
                  <p>The bright yellow sunshine floods all things here too; the chair in which she
                     used to sit, the work-table and work-box upon it, her piano in the corner, the
                     velvet draperied oratory beyond; and over the chimney, one picture with its
                     face turned to the wall. "It is a portrait of Gordon Caryll," France says,
                     almost in a whisper, for something in her companion's face startles her
                     strangely; "she placed it so on that last cruel evening when she drove him from
                     her. So it has hung since."</p>
                  <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6444-00000117"/>
                  <p>"Turn it," Locksley commands briefly, and she obeys. She stands upon a chair
                     and turns the pictured face to the light. It is covered with dust. Spiders have
                     woven their webs across it. She glances around for a cloth, finds one, wipes
                     dust and cobwebs together off, and the boyish face of the last Squire of
                     Caryllynne smiles back upon her in the sunshine.</p>
                  <p>"Was he not handsome?" she asks, regretfully. "Poor Gordon! brave and generous
                     and beloved of all—to think he should pay for one mistake by life-long exile
                     and loneliness."</p>
                  <p>She looks down at her lover. She pauses suddenly; a wild expression comes over
                     her face. She springs from her perch and glances from the pictured face of the
                     boy to the living face of the man gazing gravely up.</p>
                  <p>She sees at last—neither years, nor bronze, nor beard can deceive her longer.
                     She gives a little cry, and stands breathless, her hands clasped, her color
                     coming and going.</p>
                  <p>He sees he is known, and turns to her with the very smile the pictured face
                     wears.</p>
                  <p>"My France," he says, "you know at last that I am Gordon Caryll."</p>

                  <p>SO! The truth is out at last—the desire of her life is gained. Gordon Caryll
                     stands there before her—her lover!</p>
                  <p>She hardly knows whether she is glad or sorry, she hardly knows even whether
                     she is surprised. She has turned quite white, and stands looking at him in a
                     silence she is unable to break.</p>
                  <p>Gordon Caryll laughs—the most genially amused laugh she has heard yet.</p>
                  <p>"If I had said, 'I am his Satanic Majesty, horns, hoofs and all,' you could
                     hardly look more petrified, more wildly incredulous. My dear child, do come out
                     of that trance of horror and say something."</p>
                  <p>He takes both her hands, and looks smilingly down into her pale, startled
                     face.</p>
                  <p>"Look at me, France—look at that picture. <emph>Don't</emph> you see the
                     resemblance? Surely you don't doubt what I have said?"</p>
                  <p>"Doubt you! Oh, Gordon! <emph>what</emph> a surprise this is. And yet—I don't
                     know—I don't really know—'As in a glass, darkly,' I believe I must have seen it
                     from the first."</p>
                  <p>"And you are sorry or glad—which? You told me that the desire of your heart was
                     Gordon Caryll's return. Gordon Caryll stands before you—your heart's desire is
                     gained, and you look at me with the blankest face I ever saw you wear. Are you
                     sorry, then, after all?"</p>
                  <p>"Sorry! Ah, you know better than that. Why," with a laugh, "the romance of my
                     life was that Gordon Caryll would return, and that I should be the one to
                     console him for the<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6444-00000118"/> bitter past—that
                     I should one day be his wife. And to think—that my dream should come true. Yet
                     still—"</p>
                  <p>"Well—yet still."</p>
                  <p>"Yet still—more or less it is a disappointment. I had hoped to be the good
                     genius of your life in all things—that my fortune would be your stepping stone
                     to fame. Now I can do nothing; I am not going to marry a struggling artist and
                     help him win his laurel crown. The heir of Caryllynne need owe nothing to his
                     wife. My romance of love in a cottage, while you won a name among the
                     immortals, is at an end."</p>
                  <p>"Not so. After all it will be due to you the same—I take Caryllynne from you.
                     And I would never have taken off my mask, and shown myself to the world as I
                     am, but for you."</p>
                  <p>"Not even for your mother's sake?"</p>
                  <p>"Not even for my mother's sake. How, but for you would I ever have known that
                     my mother desired it, that I was forgiven, that she longed to take me back? It
                     makes me happier than I can say now that I know it; but of myself I never would
                     have discovered it. What was done, was done; I meant to have walked on the way
                     I had chosen to the end. But you appeared, and lo! all things changed."</p>
                  <p>"It is like a fairy tale," she said; "I <emph>cannot</emph> realize it. Oh!
                     what will Lady Dynely, what will Eric, what will your mother, what will all the
                     world say?"</p>
                  <p>"I don't think it will surprise Lady Dynely very greatly," Caryll answered
                     coolly. "She recognized me the first day—I saw it in her face—only she took
                     pains to convince herself it was an impossibility. I had been gone so long it
                     was impossible I could ever come back; that was how she reasoned. For Eric,
                     well it would be dead against every rule of his creed to be surprised at
                     anything. He will open those sleepy blue eyes of his for a second or two, and
                     lift his blonde eyebrows to the roots of his hair."</p>
                  <p>"Very likely," says France; "he has not far to lift them."</p>
                  <p>"I wonder you did not marry him, France. He's a handsome fellow, and a gallant.
                     As unlike a battered old soldier such as I am as—as the Apollo is unlike the
                     Farnese Hercules."</p>
                  <p>"And yet there are many people, of undoubted taste too, who prefer the Hercules
                     as the true type of manliness to the Apollo. Eric is very handsome—absurdly
                     handsome for a man; the wife of a demi-god must have rather a trying time of
                     it. I don't care, besides, to share a heart that some scores of women, dark and
                     light, have shared before me. 'All or none,' is the motto of the Forresters.
                     Are you sure, sir, I may claim all in the present case?"</p>
                  <p>"All—every infinitesimal atom. I offer you a heart that for the past seventeen
                     years has had no lodger. Before that," he drew a deep breath and looked at her.
                     "You know that story."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I know it—Lady Dynely told me. She is dead?"</p>
                  <p>"Would I ever have spoken to you else? Yes, she is dead."</p>
                  <p>He dropped her hands suddenly and walked over to the window. Beyond the green
                     hill tops the sun was dropping into the sea—the whole western sky was aflush.
                     The sparkling drops, glittering like diamonds on roses and verbenas, were all
                     that remained of the past storm.</p>
                  <p>She stood where he had left her, looking after him wistfully, with something
                     that was almost a contraction of the heart.</p>
                  <p>"Nineteen years have passed," she thought, "since they parted. Does the very
                     memory of that time still affect him like this?"</p>
                  <p>She remembered the story Lady Dynely had told her—of how passionately he had
                     loved that most worthless wife. Could any man love like that twice in a
                     lifetime. The wine of life had been given to that dead actress—the lees were
                     left for her.</p>
                  <p>"France!"</p>
                  <p>She was by his side in an instant—ashamed of that unworthy spasm of jealousy of
                     the dead.</p>
                  <p>"Am I to take this day as emblematic of my life? Have the rain and the darkness
                     passed forever, and will the end be in brightness such as this? It has been a
                     hard life sometimes, a bitter life often, a lonely life always, but the darkest
                     record you know. The story of the woman I married and who was my ruin."</p>
                  <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6444-00000119"/>
                  <p>She glanced up with that new-born shyness of hers into his overcast face in
                     silence.</p>
                  <p>"Let me tell you all to-day, and make an end of it," he said. "It is something
                     I hate to speak of—hate with all my soul to think of. You know the story—Lady
                     Dynely has told you, you say. You know then how I was divorced, how our united
                     names rang the changes through England and Canada; how the name of Caryll,
                     never dishonored before, was dragged through the mire of a divorce court. You
                     know how I came to England and saw my mother and Lucia. Saw Lady Dynely, told
                     her all, and bade her good-by upon that other August night nineteen years
                     ago—the very night her husband died. All that you know?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I know," she said. "Go on."</p>
                  <p>"I had left my old regiment and exchanged into one ordered to India, and in
                     India the next twelve years were spent. It was hot and exciting work at first;
                     little time to think, little time to regret. The horrible mutiny, of which you
                     have heard, with whose bloody and sickening details all England was ringing
                     then, when women and children were butchered in cold blood, was at its height.
                     Who could stop and think of private woes when the whole British heart was wrung
                     with agony. It was the best discipline that could possibly have befallen me—for
                     my life I was reckless, the sooner a Sepoy bullet ended a dishonored existence
                     the better. But the flying Sepoy bullet laid low better men and passed me. I
                     carried a sort of charmed life—I passed through skirmish after skirmish, hot
                     work too with the fierce black devils, and never received a scratch. At last
                     our slaughtered countrymen were avenged and the mutiny was over.</p>
                  <p>"Of the life that followed in India I have little to say. It was the usual dull
                     routine of drill and parade; of Calcutta and Bombay—of hill parties, of
                     up-country excursions, of jackal shooting, and pig sticking. Of a sudden I grew
                     tired of it all. India became insupportable, a sort of homesickness took
                     possession of me. I must see England. I must see my mother once more. I sold
                     out and came home, and came here, and heard all about my people. My mother had
                     quitted Caryllynne forever, and taken up her abode at Rome. She had adopted
                     General Forrester's only child as her daughter and heiress, Miss Forrester
                     being then at a Parisian convent. Lady Dynely was a widow—she too was
                     abroad—she too had adopted an orphan lad, who was now with her son and heir at
                     Eton. That was what I learned from the village gossips, and then once more I
                     left England.</p>
                  <p>"This time I went to America. There I remained, rambling aimlessly about the
                     country, trying to decide what to do with my future life. Suddenly it occurred
                     to me to ascertain for certain what had become of the woman who had been my
                     wife. Was she living or dead? I never thought of her at all when I could avoid
                     it, but that thought had often obtruded. Now was the time to know for
                     certain.</p>
                  <p>"I went to Canada—Quebec, to the place where I had seen her last. The lonely
                     house on the Heights, which she had chosen as her home, stood silent and gray,
                     desolate and uninhabited. I returned to the town, hunted up the man who had
                     been its owner thirteen years before, who was its owner still.</p>
                  <p>"'Could he tell me anything of the lady—Mrs. Gordon—who had been his tenant in
                     that past time?' He pushed up his spectacles and looked at me curiously.</p>
                  <p>"'Humph!' he said, 'that is a very long time ago. Mrs. Gordon! Do I remember
                     her? I should think so, indeed—no one who ever saw <emph>that</emph> face was
                     likely to forget it in a hurry. Perhaps—would I mind telling him?—perhaps I was
                     Mr. Gordon—the gentleman whom he had the honor of speaking to once before?'</p>
                  <p>"'It can matter nothing to you,' I answered, 'who I am. I am interested in Mrs.
                     Gordon's ultimate fate. Can you tell me where she is now?'</p>
                  <p>"He laughed in a grim sort of way."</p>
                  <p>"'Well, no—seeing there is no telegraphic communication between this world and
                     the next. Mrs. Gordon is dead.'</p>
                  <p>"'Dead!' Whether we hate or love, the abrupt announcement of the death of any
                     one we have intimately known<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6444-00000120"/> must
                     ever come upon us with something of a shock. "Dead!' then I was free! I drew a
                     long breath—a breath of great relief. 'Will you tell me how she died?' I asked
                     after a moment.</p>
                  <p>"'It was a very shocking thing—oh; a very shocking thing, indeed. She was
                     killed.'</p>
                  <p>"'Killed.'</p>
                  <p>"'I don't wonder you look startled. Yes, poor soul—killed in a railway
                     accident. Wait a moment—I have the paper somewhere—I generally cut out such

                  <p>"He ransacked in his desk—produced a Montreal paper of four years before, and
                     pointed out a paragraph. It gave a detailed account of a very terrible
                     collision on the Grand Trunk Railway, of the loss of life, the list of the
                     wounded and killed. Among the killed I read the name of Mrs. Gordon.</p>
                  <p>"'Is that all your proof?' I said to him. 'That is nothing. Gordon is a common
                     name.'</p>
                  <p>"'Ah, but look here.'</p>
                  <p>"He turned over the paper and pointed to another place. 'The Mrs. Gordon whose
                     name is recorded in another column as among the number killed, was a lady with
                     a history of more than ordinary interest. She was of a beauty most remarkable,
                     by profession an actress of more than ordinary talent. Her history must still
                     be familiar to our readers, as the heroine of the celebrated divorce case of
                     nine years ago. A young English officer of family and wealth, named Gordon
                     Caryll,' etc., etc. In short, the whole miserable story was given of the
                     actress, her accomplice, and her dupe. 'Since that time,' the record went on to
                     say, 'she had returned to the stage and was rising rapidly to fame and fortune
                     when this most melancholy disaster ended her brilliant career.'</p>

                     few weeks after your last visit here, and left by Mrs. Gordon in charge of Joan
                     Kennedy, when she went away.'</p>
                  <p>"A child! I had never known of that—never thought of that. I sat for a moment
                     quite still trying to realize what I had heard.</p>
                  <p>"'She named the little one Gordon, after its papa, I suppose. She couldn't take
                     it with her very well, so she left it with Joan when she went, and had ever
                     since paid liberally for its support. Once a year, too, she came to visit it,
                     and it was returning from that ill-starred visit this year she had met her
                     terrible end.'</p>
                  <p>"I rose up, startled beyond all telling by this new revelation.</p>
                  <p>"'Where does this Joan Kennedy live?' I inquired. 'I must see her at once, if
                     possible.'</p>
                  <p>"'It is not possible,' returned Mr. Barteaux. 'I know nothing of Joan Kennedy
                     now. Three years ago she married a man named McGregor, and left with him for
                     the Western States. She took Mrs. Gordon's child with her. She could not have
                     been more attached to it had it been her own. Since then I have seen or heard
                     nothing of her.'</p>
                  <p>"'Can I not obtain her address?'</p>
                  <p>"'Not here, sir—no one knows where they went. McGregor had no particular
                     location in view. You might advertise<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6444-00000121"
                     /> vertise in New York and Western papers, and see what will come of it.'</p>
                  <p>"I followed his advice—I did advertise, again and again, but with no result. I
                     wanted intensely to find that child. I travelled West, I inquired everywhere—in
                     vain. Then the civil war broke out, and I joined the army. Two more years
                     passed, and then in one of the great battles I received a wound that was so
                     nearly mortal as to incapacitate me from further fighting. The moment I could
                     quit hospital, I returned to Europe—went at once to Rome, and took to painting,
                     as the one last ambition and love of my life. In Rome I saw you, saw my mother
                     many times, but I held aloof. I only knew I had driven her from England, that
                     my dishonor clung to her like a garment. I had no thought but if I came before
                     her I should be spurned once more. That I did not choose to bear. Then my
                     restless familiar again took possession of me—I came back to England. I painted
                     that picture, sent it to the Academy, and there, one sunny May afternoon, met
                     my fate and you."</p>
                  <p>"And that picture," France said, speaking as he paused and looked fondly down
                     upon her, "'How the Night Fell,' was your parting with <emph>her</emph>, was it
                     not?"</p>
                  <p>"It was."</p>
                  <p>"Poor soul! Ah, Gordon! she was to be pitied, after all. She loved you and lost
                     you. I can think of no bitterer fate."</p>
                  <p>"Don't waste your pity, France. Of love, as you understand it, she knew
                     nothing. Good heavens! what an utterly vile and cold-blooded plot it was! and
                     what an easy dupe she and that scoundrelly old major found in me! Don't let us
                     talk about it. I have told you—so let it end. I never want to speak of her
                     while I live again. Only—I should have liked to find that child."</p>
                  <p>They stand silently, side by side. The sun has set, but the sky is all rosy,
                     and purple and golden, with the glory it has left. France pulls out her
                     watch.</p>
                  <p>"Seven. How the hours have flown. I should have started long ago—it will be
                     quite dark before I reach the Abbey now. Do order round the phaeton, Gordon,
                     whilst I run up and put on my hat."</p>
                  <p>She quits his side and runs lightly up the polished oaken stairs, singing as
                     she goes for very gladness of heart. She has always loved the dear old house;
                     she will love it now more than ever, since in it she has been so supremely
                     happy.</p>
                  <p>She adjusts the coquettish little bonnet and returns.</p>
                  <p>The lord of the manor, stately and tall, a very man of men, France thinks,
                     awaits her and assists her in. He gathers up the reins as one who has the
                     right, and drives her at a spanking pace away from Caryllynne. The broad yellow
                     moon is lifting her luminous face over the pearl and silver sky, the rose and
                     amethyst splendor is fading tenderly out of the west. She sits beside him in
                     silence, too happy to talk much. All her life dreams are realized. Her artist
                     lover is hers—and he and Gordon Caryll are one. She has been wooed and won as
                     romantically as the most romantic girl could desire. His voice breaks the
                     spell.</p>
                  <p>"I start for Rome to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>"To-morrow!" She looks up for an instant. "Gordon! so soon?"</p>
                  <p>"She has waited sixteen years," he answers. "Can I go too speedily? Yet if
                     you—"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no, no! It is her right, it is your duty. You must go. Only you will not
                     stay very long?"</p>
                  <p>The nightingales are singing in the woods of Caryllynne—they alone may hear his
                     answer.</p>
                  <p>He drives her to the Abbey gates—he will not enter. He will walk back to the
                     village, he tells her; he needs a walk and a smoke, to calm his mind after all
                     this.</p>
                  <p>"Shall I see you to-morrow before you go?" she asks.</p>
                  <p>"I think not—no, I will leave by the first train—it would be too early. Our
                     parting will be to-night. Tell Lady Dynely; and let wonder be over before I
                     return."</p>
                  <p>Then under the black shadows of the chestnut trees they clasp hands and say
                     farewell.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">KILLING THE FATTED CALF.</head>
                  <p>THE golden summer days are over. September is at an end—the sharp crack of the
                     fowling-pieces no longer rings the long days through, as the doomed partridges
                     wheel in the sun. The ides of October are here—the steel-gray mornings, the
                     frost-bound nights, the stripped branches of the tossing trees, the shrill wild
                     winds. It is October, the last week of the month, the last hour of the day; and
                     the night which the white chill moon is heralding even now, is to be a grand
                     field night at Dynely Abbey. For my lady gives a ball, the first for many a
                     year; half the county are invited, and all invited are coming. Has not the news
                     spread;—has not Gordon Caryll, the black sheep of the flock, the "hero of a
                     hundred battles," whose life reads, so far as they know it, like a chapter from
                     some old romance, returned to claim his own, and are they not to behold him
                     tonight? It has been something more than the ordinary nine days' wonder, this
                     story that has been told of him; these good people in a circuit of twenty miles
                     have talked of nothing it would seem since it came out first. They can recall
                     him well, scores of them—a tall, fair-haired, handsome lad, a dashing young
                     trooper before he left for that transatlantic world, where he met the siren who
                     has been his doom. It all comes back to them, the first dark whisperings of
                     that terrible scandal that broke his haughty father's heart, that drove his
                     mother into exile forever. Then the full details of the story—the public shame,
                     the divorce, the return, the decree of banishment. They had all thought him
                     dead, and France Forrester the heiress of Caryllynne, and lo! he starts up all
                     in a moment, a distinguished and popular artist, and the accepted lover of his
                     mother's heiress. He has been in Rome all these weeks, visiting that mother
                     herself; publicly and joyfully recognized and received by her, and to-night he
                     returns, and they will see him face to face at Lady Dynely's.</p>
                  <p>At Lady Dynely's! Why, in the days that are gone, when he was but the merest
                     lad, there was an old story that he was his cousin's lover. She has not seen
                     him yet in his new character—it will be curious to watch them, the friends and
                     neighbors maliciously think. And France Forrester is to marry him. Is the
                     actress wife dead then, they wonder? They had thought Miss Forrester and Lord
                     Dynely were engaged, and now it comes out that Lord Dynely is to marry a
                     clergyman's daughter in Lincolnshire—a Miss Higgins. Miss Higgins is to be
                     present also to-night—she and her father and one of her sisters are expected
                     this evening. Certainly a treat is in store for them—not one who is invited
                     will miss coming.</p>
                  <p>As the last light of day fades out and the white starry moonlight floods earth
                     and sky, Lady Dynely comes out of her dressing-room. In the clustering
                     waxlights she looks pale, pale even for her who is always pale, but fair and
                     youthful and elegant in her trailing violet velvet, her priceless point lace,
                     and the Dynely diamonds flashing on slender throat and wrists and hands. The
                     very first of her guests will not arrive for a full hour yet, but she has
                     dressed early, and stands quite alone, glad to be alone for a little before it
                     all begins. Up in her room France is dressing—in theirs Crystal and Crystal's
                     sister are dressing likewise—Eric is in his—Terry in his. For Terry has broken
                     through his resolution of not putting in an appearance before Christmas, and
                     run down for a night. Lady Dynely has ordained it so, and Terry knows no will
                     of his own where she wills otherwise. The first sharp, cruel pain of loss is
                     not even yet obliterated—all his life long, though he lived to be a hundred, no
                     other woman will ever be to him quite what little Crystal Higgins has been. In
                     no way is she at all remarkable; pretty, but scores he sees every day are as
                     pretty; not brilliant, not wise, not clever, and yet—she will stand alone among
                     all womanhood forever and ever to Terry Dennison. He has not met her yet. She
                     reached the Abbey early in the afternoon<pb n="248-249"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000123"/> noon, he not half an hour since, and he looks
                     forward to the meeting with nervous dread that half unmans him. She is Eric's
                     now—well, so that Eric is loyal, so that Eric makes her life happy, he can
                     forgive even him. On New Year's eve she is to be Eric's wife, and he is bidden
                     to the wedding. He has had an interview with Lady Dynely—of necessity very
                     brief. All his generosity, all Eric's disloyalty is in her mind as she comes
                     forward to meet him, and takes his hand in hers and holds it tight, and looks
                     with pale imploring eyes up in his face—a face that is just a thought graver
                     and more worn than she ever saw it before.</p>
                  <p>"It is all right," he says, simply, knowing by intuition what she would say.
                     "So that Eric makes her happy, all the rest is nothing. I don't blame him
                     much—her not at all. Who would look at me twice beside Eric?"</p>
                  <p>And then he kisses her cheek gently and goes up-stairs to his own old room, and
                     meets France on the upper landing on her way to dress.</p>
                  <p>"Dear old Terry," Miss Forrester says, giving him both hands; "it is like water
                     in the desert to see you again. Go where I will, meet whom I may, there is but
                     one Terry Dennison."</p>
                  <p>"And but one Mr. Locksley—no, I beg his pardon, but one Gordon Caryll. So your
                     hero has come at last, France. All your life you have been worshipping him from
                     afar off, now your demigod has plumped from the clouds at your feet. You have
                     thrown over Eric and are going to marry Caryll."</p>
                  <p>"Thrown over Eric!" Miss Forrester retorts, forgetting grammar in indignation.
                     "I like that way of putting it, when everybody knows he threw over
                        <emph>me</emph>. A case of love at sight, wasn't it, Terry? and, amazing to
                     relate, it seems to last. I suppose you know she's here."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I know. Do you like her, France? But you do, of course."</p>
                  <p>"I don't perceive the of course. She is pretty enough—oh, yes, I don't deny her
                     pretty Grecian features and pink and pearl complexion; but, like her—that's
                     another thing. Little idiot!"</p>
                  <p>"And why little idiot, Miss Forrester?"</p>
                  <p>"She jilted you, Terry, for him—a man for a manikin. She led you on, and would
                     have married you if he had not come; and, at the first sight of his ambrosial
                     curls and little amber mustache and girl's complexion, she goes down at his
                     lordly feet. Bah! I've no patience with her."</p>
                  <p>"But you'll be good to her, France, all the same. Poor little Crystal! It looks
                     a very brilliant match, and yet—"</p>
                  <p>"And yet she would be ten thousand-fold happier as your wife. The woman who is
                     lifted to the honor and bliss of being my Lord Viscount Dynely's bride, bids
                     fair, once the honeymoon is ended, to win the martyr's crown. The handsomest
                     peer in the realm, the most notorious male flirt in Europe, is hardly likely to
                     be held long by the pretty, innocent, baby face of Crystal Higgins. It was
                     awfully good of you, Terry, to come at all."</p>
                  <p>"Her ladyship wished it," is Terry's quiet answer, as though all was said in
                     that, and Miss Forrester shrugs her imperial shoulders.</p>
                  <p>"As the queen wills! You should have been born of the Dynely blood and race;
                     the motto of the house suits you—'<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Loyal au
                        mort</foreign>.' You would be faithful to the death, Terry, I think. It
                     certainly does not suit Eric—it is not in him to be faithful to any human
                     being."</p>
                  <p>"I wish he heard you, France."</p>
                  <p>"He has heard it a thousand times. By the bye, Terry, it occurs to me to ask
                     exactly what relation are you to Eric?"</p>
                  <p>The clustering wax lights shed their lustre full-upon Terry's face, and, as she
                     asks the heedless, impulsive question, France sees that face turn dark red from
                     brow to chin. The swift abruptness of the simple demand strikes him mute. The
                     truth he may not tell—may never tell, and falsehoods never come trippingly from
                     Terry's tongue. Miss Forrester lays her slim ringed hand on the young man's
                     arm.</p>
                  <p>"I beg your pardon," she says, hastily. "I know, of course—Eric's distant
                     cousin; but, as you stood there, on my word you looked sufficiently like him to
                     be his brother. I have often noticed a vague resemblance before, in height and
                     bearing; but never, I think, so markedly as now."</p>
                  <pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6444-00000124"/>
                  <p>The dark, painful flush deepens on Dennison's face. He looks at her with
                     startled eyes. She is wonderfully acute in her surmises. Has some inkling of
                     the truth come to her? But no—the smiling face that meets his is supremely
                     unconscious. She pulls out her watch.</p>
                  <p>"Past seven. I should have been under the hands of Pauline an hour ago. Ta, ta,
                     Terry; run away, my dear boy, and make yourself beautiful forever."</p>
                  <p>She trips past and vanishes in one of the upper rooms; and Terry, drawing a
                     long breath, goes more slowly to his.</p>
                  <p>"No," he thinks; "it was but a random shot that struck home. I am Eric's
                     distant cousin. She suspects nothing."</p>
                  <p>But Mr. Dennison was mistaken. It had been a random shot; but, as the red light
                     of guilt flamed out in the dragoon's face, the first suspicion of the truth
                     that had ever come to her broke upon her then. She had heard that vague story
                     of distant kinship—she had heard, years ago, that Lady Dynely had made a
                     pilgrimage to some wild region of western Ireland and brought Terry back, a
                     little uncouth waif and stray; she knew how zealously she had cared for him
                     since—she knew of Terry's boundless love and gratitude, in which to her there
                     was always something almost pathetic; but she never dreamed there might be more
                     on the cards than met the eyes. "Sufficiently like Eric to be his brother." She
                     had heard what manner of man the late Right Honorable Viscount Dynely had
                     been—Eric's light-headed fickleness was as hereditary as the title. Who was to
                     say that Eric and Terry were not brothers, after all? Yes, that was the secret
                     of Lady Dynely's compassionate care—of Terry's humble, patient devotion.</p>
                  <p>"Poor fellow!" she thought, "it is hard lines on him. The name, the rank, the
                     wealth, the love—all to the younger; to the elder brother nothing. Ah, well! as
                     poor Stephen Blackpool says, 'Life's aw a muddle.'"</p>
                  <p>She sits musing for a while under Pauline's practised hands, then her thoughts
                     shift away from Terry Dennison to Gordon Caryll. He will be here to-night, and
                     under the silk, and flowers, and laces her heart gives a glad leap. Since that
                     happy evening under the moonlit limes and chestnuts they have not met; to-night
                     he will be with her once more. How strange, how romantically strange it all has
                     been, she thinks. From earliest childhood she has heard of him, set him up as a
                     hero, and loved him in her girlish, romantic way, without any hope of ever
                     seeing him. And now he is back—her own, forever.</p>
                  <p>"Hurry, Pauline—hurry, my child," she says in French.</p>
                  <p>It wants but an hour until his arrival, and she must be the first to meet him.
                     Already wheels are crashing over the gravel, and the guests are beginning to
                     arrive.</p>
                  <p>There is a tap at the door.</p>
                  <p>"Please, Miss Forrester, may I come in?" says a timid little voice.</p>
                  <p>France breaks away from Pauline's hands, opens the door, and sees Crystal
                     standing there dressed and ready to go down and trembling with nervous dread of
                     the ordeal. She has been but little accustomed to society—until the coming of
                     Lord Dynely and her fairy fortune she has been looked upon as a baby at home.
                     To-night she must do credit to Eric's taste—Eric, the most critical and
                     sensitive of mankind—must face half a county and be criticised, and see Eric's
                     mortification in his face if her country manners fail. She loves him so wholly,
                     that the thought of his displeasure is as death.</p>
                  <p>Two great, imploring, blue eyes look up to Miss Forrester, shy, humble,
                     deprecating—the gaze of a very child. She is afraid of this stately, dark-eyed
                     heiress, but not half a quarter as she is of Eric.</p>
                  <p>"Please, Miss Forrester, may I come in and wait until you are dressed, and go
                     down with you?" she falters.</p>
                  <p>France takes her suddenly in her arms, all her prejudices fading away at sight
                     of that pathetic, baby face, puts back the feathery, flaxen hair, and kisses
                     her.</p>
                  <p>"You pretty little baby," she says; "come in and let me look at you. My dear, I
                     had no idea you were half so lovely."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Miss Forrester"—Crystal's pearly face flushes rose-pink with pleasure—"do
                     you think I am pretty? Do you think I will do? Do you think Eric will not be
                     ashamed of me?"</p>
                  <p>"Ashamed of you? Well, Eric is tolerably fastidious,<pb n="252-253"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000125"/> tolerably hard to please, but I think even he
                     would find it difficult not to be fully satisfied to-night. No, little vanity,
                     I won't flatter you, I won't tell you what I think of your looks. Only you are
                     more like the queen of the fairies, or a 'lily in green covert hiding,' than
                     any ordinary mortal I ever saw. Pauline, what do you think?"</p>
                  <p>Thereupon Pauline bursts forth into a vehement French outpouring of praise and
                     admiration, that brings smiles, and dimples, and blushes to Crystal's shy face.
                     "Like a lily in green covert hiding?" Yes, the poetic simile is a true one.
                     With her filmy, gossamer dress of palest green, her pale pearl ornaments, her
                     paler floating, flaxen hair, her pure, pale face, her large, shy eyes, she
                     looks like some water spirit, like Undine herself—a lake lily in its green
                     array.</p>
                  <p>Ten minutes more complete Miss Forrester's toilet. Dark, and stately, and tall,
                     entirely self-possessed and at her ease, a greater contrast than the two could
                     scarcely be found as they descend to the already filled rooms. A blue, silvery
                     silk sweeps behind her, silver lilies trail in the rich darkness of her hair,
                     looped with diamond stars, a cluster of fragrant white blossoms in her hand. So
                     Miss Forrester and Miss Higgins dawned upon the view of the best county
                     society.</p>
                  <p>Eric is watching for his lady love—Eric, looking extremely patrician, and
                     elegant, and his eyes light as they fall upon his betrothed. Truth to tell, he
                     has been dreading this ordeal almost more than she has; his vanity is so
                     thin-skinned—so much stronger than any other passion of his life. What if she
                     does not do him credit to-night? What—good Heaven!—what if she appears looking
                     rustic, or countryfied, or dressed in bad taste? He has been turning
                     alternately hot and cold for the last fifteen minutes as he stands here, when
                     he sees her enter the rooms on France Forrester's arm. And then doubting and
                     fearing are at an end. His heart gives an exultant leap, his eyes light, a
                     smile comes over his lips, he draws a long breath of intense, unutterable
                     relief. Rustic, countryfied, dressed in bad taste! Why, she is lovelier than he
                     has ever seen her, and her dress is the very perfection of good taste. Yes, the
                     country parson's daughter will do credit to Lord Dynely to-night.</p>
                  <p>He advances and takes possession of her, stooping his fair, tall head to
                     whisper something that lights up Crystal's soft, sweet face. The worst is over
                     now, she feels she can face all England, all the United Kingdom, in a body.
                     Eric, the sovereign lord and ruler of her life, is deigned to be pleased with
                     his lowly handmaiden.</p>
                  <p>Miss Forrester is surrounded immediately, she is besieged with petitions for
                     the next waltz, but she declines. It is her intention not to dance at all
                     before supper, and she takes Terry Dennison's arm, and clings to him as her
                     rock of refuge.</p>
                  <p>"I'm engaged to you for the next waltz, Terry," she says imperiously; "not to
                     dance it though—you understand?"</p>
                  <p>"I understand," Terry gravely responds. "We are waiting for the hero of the
                     piece to come on, and we want to be disengaged to meet him, looking cool and
                     lovely, and our very best. That is a very delicious thing in the way of
                     dresses, Miss Forrester—misty, silvery blue, a sort of moonlight color that is
                     vastly becoming to your dark complexion. Being in love agrees with you, I
                     think—I never saw you looking so well as to-night. Give you my word there's
                     nothing half so handsome in the house."</p>
                  <p>Miss Forrester bows her acknowledgment.</p>
                  <p>"Monseigneur, 'you do me proud.' The first compliment I ever received from Mr.
                     Dennison in my life! But you haven't seen all in the house—you haven't seen
                     Miss Crystal Higgins. Look yonder."</p>
                  <p>Terry looks. Sooner or later be knows it must come, and he has schooled himself
                     to meet her. His sunburnt face pales a little as he sees her leaning on Eric's
                     arm, lovely as a dream, happy as it is ever given mortals here below to be. He
                     pulls his tawny whiskers and tries to laugh.</p>
                  <p>"Bliss is a wonderful beautifier—knocks all Madame Rachel's cosmetics into thin
                     air. Handsome couple, aren't they?—look as though they were made for each
                     other, and all that. Shall we go up and pay our respects?"</p>
                  <p>"You may—I have none to pay; and Lady Dynely beckons—I think she wants you,
                     Terry. When you've spoken to Crystal, you had better join her."</p>
                  <p>So Terry goes up, and Crystal lifts those imploring, innocent<pb n="254-255"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000126"/> cent eyes of hers in humble appeal to his face,
                     and the look goes through Terry's heart of hearts. Ah no; she is not to be
                     blamed. She has done as eleven girls out of twelve would have done—there are
                     not many like France Forrester to look upon Eric, with undazzled eyes. He pays
                     his respects and makes his greetings in frank, brotherly fashion enough, and
                     requests the honor of a waltz. The turquoise eyes glance timidly up at Eric as
                     if seeking his permission. For, earlier in the evening, Eric has issued his
                     princely ukase that his affianced wife shall waltz with no one but himself.</p>
                  <p>"I don't choose to see my promised wife gyrating round the room with every
                     fellow in the county who chooses to ask her. Remember, Crystal, you dance round
                     dances with me only!"</p>
                  <p>She is very willing: If he had ordered her to sit in the remotest corner of the
                     room until morning dawned, she would have obeyed willingly, gladly, so that his
                     sultanship deigned but once or twice to smile upon her in her exile. But Terry
                     Dennison, Terry, who is almost like a brother, will not Eric make an exception
                     in his favor? Eric, who is to have so much—Terry, who has lost all. But Eric's
                     blonde brows knit themselves ever so slightly; to Terry he is not disposed to
                     yield an inch.</p>
                  <p>"Crystal only waltzes with me, Terry. Scratch your initials down for a
                     quadrille, old boy, if you do that sort of idiotic performance, and do it
                     quickly, for our waltz begins."</p>
                  <p>Terry does that sort of idiotic performance, scratches his initials
                     accordingly, then seeks out Lady Dynely. Lady Dynely merely wants him to make
                     himself useful all night, in finding partners for unpartnerable elderly girls,
                     and lead the forlorn hope himself.</p>
                  <p>"It is what Eric should do," her ladyship says, "but Eric won't do it. If he
                     dances at all, it will be with the youngest and prettiest girls present, so,
                     Terry, I look to you."</p>
                  <p>"'England expects every man to do his duty,'" laughs France Forrester, passing
                     him, and giving him a perfumed blow of her fan. "My poor Terry! Some men are
                     born martyrs. Some have martyrdom thrust upon them; I begin to think you are
                     one of the latter."</p>
                  <p>But Mr. Dennison pulls on his kid gloves a little tighter, braces himself for
                     the battle, and looks about him undismayed. Old or young, handsome or ugly, it
                     is all the same to Terry. Since Crystal is not for him, all the rest doesn't
                     much matter. The most venerable virgin present, the scraggiest matron, are the
                     same to him for this night as the Venus herself.</p>
                  <p>"Let's see," he says; "there's Belinda Higgins—I'll lead off with her. After
                     that I'll take 'em as they come—one down, t'other come on."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Dennison goes and with polite empressement asks the eldest Miss Higgins but
                     one for that waltz. Eric and Crystal float past them as perfect in their
                     waltzing as in their beauty. Eric whispers something in her pretty pink ear
                     that makes her look at Terry and her bony elderly sister and laugh. It is the
                     unkindest cut of all, but Terry bears it manfully. Let them laugh. He is
                     pleasing Lady Dynely, he is making, for the time, poor old Belinda happy—he
                     asks no more.</p>
                  <p>Miss Forrester is not dancing. She is growing impatient. Her restless eyes
                     wander ceaselessly to the door. He should have been here a full hour ago; the
                     train was due at eight, it is ten now. Can anything have happened? Can he not
                     be coming, after all? He telegraphed this morning he would be with them by the
                     eight o'clock train. Why does he not come?</p>
                  <p>"Will she dance?" Dance! No, she could as soon think of flying. She gets away
                     from Prince Di Venturini, who is present, and who dances like a little yellow
                     Italian angel; makes her way from the warm, brilliantly lit, brilliantly filled
                     saloon, to the cloak room, throws a heavy wrap over her shining ball-dress, and
                     goes out into the chill October night.</p>
                  <p>A wild autumnal gale is blowing, the trees rock in the stormy moonlight that
                     floods earth and sky and distant sea. She goes down the portico steps and
                     stands alone on the white, cold terrace. The stone urns gleam like silver; Ajax
                     in marble stands with his face uplifted to the purple sky, defying the
                     lightning. Above the roaring of the gale<pb n="256-257"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000127"/> she can hear the deeper, hoarser roar of the
                     far-off sea, above all the sweet ringing of the German waltz music within. The
                     old stone Abbey is lit to the roof—countless figures flit past the windows like
                     shapes in a magic lantern. She stands here alone, wondering why he does not
                     come. Suddenly, over the soughing of the wind, the tossing of the trees, there
                     comes a sound that makes her heart spring, her eyes light—the rapid roll of the
                     wheels up the drive. The carriage was sent two good hours ago to meet him; all
                     is well, he is here at last.</p>
                  <p>She leans eagerly forward. Yes! the tall form of her lover leaps out and
                     approaches. He sees the solitary figure standing on the terrace—the pale,
                     expectant, eager face upon which the white moon shines. He is by her side in a
                     moment, and France's perfect hour has come.</p>
                  <p>"What! waiting for me?" he says; "getting your death out in the cold. Come into
                     the house immediately. How long have you been here?"</p>
                  <p>"Not long—ten minutes or more. I must confess to feeling just a trifle uneasy.
                     You are two hours behind time."</p>
                  <p>"And you took it for granted that perishing in a ball-dress on the terrace
                     would fetch me the sooner," growls Mr. Caryll, but he takes her happy face
                     between both his hands, and his frown changes to a smile. "Yes, we're two hours
                     behind time; got shunted off—misplaced switch, something wrong with the road—I
                     was asleep at the time, and knew nothing about it until we were under way
                     again. High jinks going on within, aren't there? Awful bore to go and dress and
                     face them all."</p>
                  <p>"You would rather face a regiment of Sepoys, I dare say; but a brave man never
                     shows the white feather, be the danger what it may. Will you go to your room at
                     once?—the dear old <foreign xml:lang="FRA">atelier</foreign> where my portrait
                     was painted—"</p>
                  <p>"And the unhappy painter hopelessly done for."</p>
                  <p>"Has been fitted up for your use," goes on Miss Forrester. "So run up at once,
                     get into regulation costume, and come down to be looked at."</p>
                  <p>"Is there a <emph>very</emph> great crush, France?" Caryll asks, in dismay.</p>
                  <p>"Three hundred, if one; and as Miss Higgins has been stared at until they can
                     stare no more, you will be the cynosure of all; every eye will be concentrated
                     upon you."</p>
                  <p>She laughs at his blank face, slips her hand through his arm, and leads him
                     into the house.</p>
                  <p>"How is grandmamma?" she asks; "and what did she say? Tell me everything."</p>
                  <p>"Tell you everything! They talk of the labor of Hercules; but to tell you
                     everything 'grandmamma' has said in the past seven weeks would be a Herculean
                     task indeed. She says this, for one thing—that you are to join her in Rome next
                     week, or a week after, at latest."</p>
                  <p>"What! with you?"</p>
                  <p>"Forbid it, Mrs. Grundy. Oh, no! we don't outrage the proprieties in that
                     fashion. With Lady Dynely, of course. She will chaperone you—will she not?"</p>
                  <p>"Are you going back, Gordon?"</p>
                  <p>"Naturally. We part no more. My poor mother! It is something to be loved as she
                     loves me."</p>
                  <p>"She knew you at once?"</p>
                  <p>"At once—the moment we met. She neither fainted nor screamed—it is a wonderful
                     old lady!—she just came forward and took me in her arms, and not one word was
                     spoken on either side. Outwardly all those years have changed her little less
                     than they have done me; she is very feeble. She would have come with me if she
                     had been able. Not being able, and longing to see you, she bids me bring you
                     and Lady Dynely when I go back. Will you come, France?"</p>
                  <p>"Will I not?" she answers, lifting her happy eyes. "But my stay must be a short
                     one. Eric's wedding takes place on New Year's Eve, and I am to be first
                     bridesmaid."</p>
                  <p>"Bridesmaid for the last time, then," says Gordon Caryll. "Pity we can't make
                     it a double wedding. I don't see the sense of waiting, myself; and I promise
                     you this, I don't mean to wait long. When will it be, France? January?"</p>
                  <p>"No, sir; not January, not February, not March, nor<pb n="258-259"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000128"/> April; not a day sooner than May. And then, in
                     the height of the season, with flying colors, if you insist upon it, we will
                     march to St. George's, and you shall be made miserable for life. No, it's of no
                     use putting on that imploring face; when my decree is issued, all the eloquence
                     of men fails to move me. Go up to your room—you have not a moment to spare, you
                     are shamefully late as it is."</p>
                  <p>She releases herself, and hastens back to the ball-room. Near the entrance she
                     meets Eric on his way for ices and orangeade, and in her face he reads the
                     truth.</p>
                  <p>"'Lo! the conquering hero comes!' and Miss Forrester's eyes light up their
                     lamps, and Miss Forrester's cheeks fling out the flag of welcome. I had about
                     given up the hero of the night as a laggard in love; but better late than
                     never."</p>
                  <p>Half an hour passes, and then into their midst, so quietly that but few find it
                     out for the first hour, the "hero of the night" enters. He makes his way to
                     Lady Dynely's side, and she who has met him daily but seven short weeks before,
                     greets him as though she had never looked upon him since that August night by
                     the lake.</p>
                  <p>"It is like a fairy tale," she says; "I cannot realize it. I thought you dead,
                     in spite of all of France's hopes, in spite of the yearly gifts to your mother.
                     And to think that we have you with us once more. But you are greatly,
                     wonderfully changed."</p>
                  <p>"Well, yes," Caryll answers; "a dozen years' campaigning is apt to change a
                     man. Still, I think you half-recognized me that day at the Academy."</p>
                  <p>"You see, I could not realize it," her ladyship answers, leaning on his arm,
                     and making her way slowly through the rooms. "The voice was the same, and the
                     eyes; but I had made up my mind so entirely never to look upon you more, that I
                     wouldn't admit the likeness. Still, it drew me to you. It was for the sake of
                     that likeness I wished you so much to accompany us here."</p>
                  <p>"I came to my destiny!" he laughed. "But for that journey, France and I would
                     never have arrived at an understanding, and I should have gone down to my grave
                     'Gordon Locksley.'"</p>
                  <p>"France will make you a charming wife, Gordon. I congratulate you, with all my
                     heart. After all, you have not done so badly with your life. You have won a
                     name for yourself, with your sword, and with your brush, and you have won
                     France Forrester's whole heart—such a great, generous, loyal heart! I had
                     thought to see her Eric's wife; but you know how that has ended."</p>
                  <p>"Happily for me—yes; happily for him, I trust, also. Is that little
                     green-and-white fairy on his arm, with the apple-blossom face, the bride elect?
                     What a model for Undine! Present me, Lucia, will you?"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Caryll is presented and begins the business of the night by dancing with
                     the bride elect. As France has laughingly predicted, people stare, in a
                     well-bred way, until even curiosity is satiated. The hero and heroine of the
                     evening, meandering through the Lancers, are the observed of all observers.
                     France dances, too, with her lover, with Eric, with Terry, whom she rescues
                     from an elderly-young lady, with unpleasantly prominent shoulder blades, and
                     unpleasantly prominent rouged cheeks. With the Prince Di Venturini last of all
                     before supper. As this dance ends Mr. Caryll advances to claim his property,
                     and the Neapolitan prince renews his acquaintance and presents his
                     congratulations.</p>
                  <p>"Madame Felicia has been deploring her loss in your gain, monsieur," the prince
                     says; "she fears now she will never receive what you promised her—the companion
                     picture to 'How the Night Fell.'"</p>
                  <p>"Did I promise her?" says Caryll, carelessly. "Then let madame be at rest. If
                     it affords her any pleasure she shall yet have the companion picture. What
                     shall we call it? 'How the Morning Broke?'"</p>
                  <p>He looks at France with a smile that says the dawn has come with her.</p>
                  <p>"A charming title," cries Di Venturini. "May I ask has monsieur ever seen
                     Madame Felicia?"</p>
                  <p>"Never," Caryll responds. "She was playing in London last season, I am aware,
                     and I naturally heard a great deal about her, but I never had curiosity enough
                     to go and see<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6444-00000129"/> her. I was very busy,
                     and I had long lost my relish for theatre-going."</p>
                  <p>His face clouds a little. Di Venturini looks at him with small, keen,
                     glittering eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Pardon, monsieur, but I inferred from what I have heard Madame Felicia say,
                     that she certainly knew you."</p>
                  <p>"Impossible, prince. To my knowledge she never met me in her life."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! my mistake then, of course. She will be charmed to learn that she is to
                     have the companion picture."</p>
                  <p>He bows himself off, and France and Caryll go into supper together. That
                     pleasant banquet is prolonged. When it is over, a little knot of Miss
                     Forrester's admirers press around and plead with her to sing. She yields and is
                     led to the piano, still on Gordon Caryll's arm.</p>
                  <p>"Sing 'Ay Chiquita,'" some one says.</p>
                  <p>She points to a pile of music, and Mr. Caryll tosses it over to find the song.
                     He places it upon the piano, and Frances' slim fingers float over the keys in
                     tender prelude. He is replacing the loose sheets as he found them, when all at
                     once he stops still—stops with one of the pieces in his hand and stares at it
                     as though it were a ghost. He is gazing at the outer page, not at the music,
                     with a face from which every trace of color slowly fades out. The song
                     begins—Miss Forrester's sweet, vibrating voice fills the room. He never hears,
                     he never heeds. Every feeling of sight and sense, and hearing, seems
                     concentrated in that fixed rapt gaze on what he holds.</p>
                  <p>It is a waltz. "The Felicia Waltz," composed by Prince Di Venturini, and
                     dedicated to Madame Felicia. Below the title is a colored vignette of madame
                     herself, leaning smilingly forward—<foreign xml:lang="FRA">en buste</foreign>.
                     It is a beautiful face—even this highly-colored lithograph cannot make it
                     otherwise—and eyes and lips flash back their brilliant smile on all
                     beholders.</p>
                  <p>So long he stands there holding it, that the song ends. There is a murmur of
                     pleasure and thanks from the group about the piano, but the singer turns from
                     all for a smile of praise from him. His face is averted, he is bending over a
                     piece of music, and does not speak a word.</p>
                  <p>"What is it you have there, Gordon?" she asks, gayly, "that holds you so
                     enchained?"</p>
                  <p>"Monsieur honors my poor composition with his closest attention," says the
                     voice of Di Venturini; "or is it madame's fair face that holds him
                     spell-bound?"</p>
                  <p>Their words arouse him. He lays down the sheet and turns away, but his face
                     still keeps that startled pallor under its bronze.</p>
                  <p>"A fair face indeed, prince, and one I have surely seen before, though the name
                     is new to me. In America, or Canada probably—madame has been there?"</p>
                  <p>He listens for the reply with an intensity of eagerness his outer quietude does
                     not betray. Prince Di Venturini looks at him with quick, suspicious eyes.</p>
                  <p>"But no, monsieur—Madame Felicia has never crossed the Atlantic in her
                     life."</p>
                  <p>"You are sure, prince?"</p>
                  <p>"I am very sure, monsieur. I have it from madame's own lips. She detests
                     everything transatlantic."</p>
                  <p>"I have been mistaken then," Caryll says, calmly; "I really thought I had seen
                     that pictured face before. It is merely one of those chance resemblances we
                     meet sometimes. I once knew a person who looked very like that."</p>
                  <p>He offers his arm to France and leads her away. No more is said on the subject,
                     but through all the hours that follow the pale gravity never quite leaves his
                     face. And once, when all are dancing and the music-room is entirely deserted,
                     he goes back, tears off the page that has the pictured face of Madame Felicia,
                     and conceals it quietly in one of his pockets for further inspection.</p>
                  <p>The chill October morning is gray in the east when the last carriage rolls away
                     from the great gates of Dynely Abbey, and the spent household betake themselves
                     to their rest. But for full an hour after, Gordon Caryll sits in his room, that
                     picture spread out before him, gazing steadfastly down at the gaudily-colored
                     portrait of the French actress as though it held him by some sorceress'
                     spell.</p>
                  <pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6444-00000130"/>
                  <p>"Her eyes, her smile, her every feature," he says under his breath. "Can there
                     be two women on this earth so much alike? Years older, but the same. Had she a
                     sister, or—has the grave given up its dead? Has she come back from Hades itself
                     to torment me?"</p>

                  <head type="sub">HOW THE OLD YEAR ENDED.</head>
                  <p>IT is the night of the 31st of December, and the vicarage of Starling is bright
                     with lights, gay with people, merry with music, and festive with feasting. The
                     eve of the old year is going merrily out in "babble and revel and wine." And
                     to-morrow is pretty Crystal's wedding-day.</p>
                  <p>They are all down—Lord Dynely, his mother, France, Terry. They have been here
                     two days now, and to-night a score of guests, intimate friends all, crowd the
                     quaint, low-ceilinged, comfortable old vicarage to repletion, to welcome in
                     right merrily the blithe new year.</p>
                  <p>Gordon Caryll is not here—he is the only absentee of the family. He is back
                     with his mother under the genial Roman sky. She is not able to travel, not able
                     to bear the rigor of an English winter, and she grows more and more exigeante
                     in her old age, and cannot bear her restored idol out of her sight. So he is
                     with her greatly to Miss Forrester's regret.</p>
                  <p>She and Lady Dynely have but just returned from Italy for this wedding; they go
                     back for the winter when it is over. The first week in May she and Gordon are
                     to be married, and, after their bridal tour, settle down at Caryllynne. Already
                     the workmen are busy there, beautifying and putting it in order. Eric and his
                     wife will take up their abode at the Abbey, his mother going to her jointure
                     house, Dynely Hall. That is the programme.</p>
                  <p>The vicarage rooms are full—the gayety is at its height. A set of "Sixteen
                     Lancers" are pounding away over the drawing-room carpet to the piping of the
                     eldest Miss Higgins, who adorns the piano stool. They will support nature
                     presently on lemonade and negus. Eric leads off the revellers;<pb n="264-265"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000131"/> looking happy and handsome, and in the wildest
                     of wild high spirits. It is a difficult thing to believe, but on this eve of
                     his wedding he is as deeply in love as he was the day of the memorable picnic.
                     It may possibly not last—but it is intoxicatingly delicious while it does last,
                     and little Crystal is ready enough to take the glitter for purest gold. For
                     Crystal—well, she is at her brightest and fairest, too, to-night. There are hot
                     red roses in her cheeks, a streaming light in her blue eyes; her sweet, foolish
                     little laugh rings out in her joyous excitement. Even now, on the eve of her
                     wedding, she can hardly realize her own bliss. Surely it is the most wonderful
                     freak of fortune that gives this darling of the gods to be her very own
                     to-morrow morning at eleven o'clock. It is eleven at night now—twelve more
                     hours, and earth and all its powers will never be able to separate her from him
                     more. She lifts her little peach-bloom face to her partner and talks and
                     laughs. As a rule, she has but little to say, but she can always talk to Terry,
                     and never half so gayly as to-night. Terry is her partner, and, whatever he may
                     feel, no one outwardly is happier there.</p>
                  <p>Miss Forrester is not dancing. She is flitting restlessly about, here and there
                     and everywhere. The rooms are garlanded with holly, and ivy, and mistletoe;
                     glorious fires are burning, and in the dining-room a long table is set out, to
                     which the gay company will sit down presently to toast the New Year in. No room
                     is vacant; sentimental couples sit spooning in spoony little nooks, go where
                     you will. The vicar and Lady Dynely, a portly dowager and Sir John Shepperton,
                     the nearest magnate, sit at whist. So the moments fly.</p>
                  <p>Presently France steals away, and leaving the hot, bright rooms, goes out into
                     the porch. It is a dazzling winter night; the earth lies all white, and
                     sparkling and frozen, under the glittering stars; the leafless trees stand
                     motionless, their black branches sharply traced against the steel blue sky. Far
                     off the village bells are ringing—bells that ring out the dying year. One hour
                     more and the new year will have dawned. It has been a very happy year to the
                     girl who stands there, in her white dress and perfumy roses, and the new year
                     is destined to be happier still. Her heart is full of a great unspoken
                     thankfulness, and ascends to the Giver of all good gifts in eloquent, wordless
                     prayer.</p>
                  <p>Presently the dancing ends, and, flushed and warm, the dancers disperse
                     themselves about, eating ices and drinking lemonade. Terry leads Crystal to a
                     cool nook, and Eric, his fair face flushed, joins them, and flings himself on a
                     sofa by his bride's side.</p>
                  <p>"Lend me your fan, Crystal," he says. "Look upon me and behold an utterly
                     exhausted, an utterly used-up man. Did you see my partner—did you see that
                     stall-fed young woman who has been victimizing me for the past half hour? It
                     was the most flagrant case of cruelty to animals to ask that girl to dance. I
                     saw her eying you, Dennison—there's your chance, old fellow, to take fortune at
                     its flood. She's two hundred and fifty avoirdupois, and she has seven thousand
                     a year, so I am told, to her fortune. Go in and win, Terry; you'll never have
                     such another chance."</p>
                  <p>The young lady alluded to had sunk into a capacious armchair at the other end
                     of the room, her face crimson, her fleshy chest heaving, her fan waving after
                     her late exertions.</p>
                  <p>"You see her," says Eric, "the sylph in green silk and pink roses, quivering
                     like a whole cascade of port wine jelly."</p>
                  <p>"Yes," answers Terry, looking at the shapeless florid mass of adipose
                     good-nature, with sleepy, half-closed eyes; "only, you see, it requires courage
                     to marry so much, and I don't set up for a hero. How she does palpitate—reminds
                     one of the words of the poet: 'A lovely being scarcely formed or
                     molded—a'—France, what's the rest?"</p>
                  <p>"'A peony with its reddest leaves yet folded,'" supplements France, gravely.
                     "Terry, what will you do through life without me by your side to tell you what
                     you mean? I am sent here to order you gentlemen to take somebody down to
                     supper. I suppose you're booked, Eric, for the green-silk young lady?"</p>
                  <p>"Not if I know it," Eric answers, drawing Crystal's hand within his arm. "A
                     lifetime of bliss, such as I look forward to, would hardly compensate for
                     another hour like the last."</p>
                  <pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6444-00000132"/>
                  <p>"Then you take her, Terry," commands France, and Terry obeys, as usual, while
                     Sir John offers his arm to Miss Forrester, and Lady Dynely takes the place of
                     honor by the vicar's side.</p>
                  <p>It is a very long table, and the party is not so large, even counting the nine
                     daughters of the house, but that they all find seats. For it is not a "stand-up
                     feed," as Terry says, where every chicken wing and every glass of wine is
                     fought for <foreign xml:lang="FRA">à outrance</foreign>. And then the battle
                     begins—the fire of knives and forks and plates, the sharp shooting of champagne
                     corks, the chatter and clatter of laughter and talk, of toasts and compliments.
                     The boar's head that has grinned as the centrepiece with a lemon in its jaws,
                     is sliced away, raised pies are lowered, wonderful pyramids of amber and
                     crimson jellies are slashed into shapeless masses, and lobster salads vanish
                     into thin air.</p>
                  <p>The moments fly—the last hour of the old year is fast drawing to its close.</p>
                  <p>"Ten minutes to twelve," cries Lord Dynely. "Here's to the jolly New Year. Let
                     us drink his health in the good old German way, to the one we love best."</p>
                  <p>He filled his glass, looked at Crystal, and touched his to hers.</p>
                  <p>"The happiest of all happy New Years to you," he says, "and I am the first to
                     wish it."</p>
                  <p>And then a chorus of voices arises. "Happy New Year!" cry all, and each turns
                     to somebody else. Lady Dynely stretches forth her hand to her son with a look
                     of fondest love; Terry Dennison leans over to her with the old wistful light in
                     his eyes. The vicar and his wife exchange affectionate glances. France turns to
                     no one; her thoughts are over the sea, with one absent.</p>
                  <p>Then they all rise, and as by one accord throng to the windows to see the New
                     Year dawn. White and clear the stars look down on the snow-white earth; it is
                     still, calm, beautiful. From the village the joy-bells clash forth; the old
                     year is dead—the new begun.</p>
                  <p>"Le roi est mort!—vive le roi!" exclaims Lord Dynely. "May all good wishes go
                     with him."</p>
                  <p>The piano stands by his side. He strikes the keys with a bold, skilled touch,
                     and his rich tenor voice rings spiritedly out: <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"He frothed his bumpers to the brim—</l>
                           <l>A jollier year we shall not see;</l>
                           <l>And though his eyes are waxing dim,</l>
                           <l>And though his foes speak ill of him,</l>
                           <l>He was a friend to me!</l>
                           <l rend="ti-1">Every one for his own.</l>
                           <l>The night is starry and cold, my friend;</l>
                           <l>And the New Year, blithe and bold, my friend,</l>
                           <l rend="ti-1">Comes up to take his own."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>"My pale, my pensive France," he says, "why that mournful look? The old year
                     has been a good friend to you also, has he not? As Tennyson says, 'He brought
                     you a friend and a true, true love.'"</p>
                  <p>"'And the new year will take them away,'" finishes Lady Dynely, with a smile.
                     "An ominous quotation, Eric. Let us hope for better things. And now, my little
                     bride elect, as you are to be up betimes to-morrow, I propose that you go to
                     bed at once, else that pretty peach face of yours will be yellow as any orange
                     at the altar to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>So it is over, and the new year is with them. The guests not stopping at the
                     vicarage say good-night and go, the others disperse to their rooms. There is a
                     farewell which no one sees between the happy pair, then Eric saunters out into
                     the white starry night to smoke one last bachelor cigar, and Crystal is kissed
                     by mamma and Lady Dynely and France, and takes her candle and goes off to her
                     room singing softly to herself as she goes: <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"You must wake and call me early, call me early, mother dear,</l>
                           <l>For to-morrow will be the happiest day of all the glad New Year."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The morning comes, sparkling and glimmering with frosty sunlight, and the
                     vicarage is all bustle and gay confusion, a very Babel of tongues. Nine;
                     coffee—ten—dressing; eleven—carriages at the door, everybody down stairs, and
                        <emph>the</emph> supreme hour has come.</p>
                  <p>Up in her "maiden bower," the bride stands robed for<pb n="268-269"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000133"/> the altar. The hot red roses of last night have
                     died out, she is paler than the white silk she wears. The chilly nuptial
                     flowers are on her head, the filmy veil shrouds her like a mist. Silent,
                     lovely, she stands in the midst of her maids, not crying, not speaking, with a
                     great awe of the new life that is beginning overlying all else.</p>
                  <p>She is led down, she enters the carriage, and is whirled away through the
                     jubilant New Year's morning to the church, There the bridegroom awaits her. The
                     church is full; villagers, friends, guests, charity children, all assembled to
                     see the vicar's prettiest daughter married. There is a mighty rustling of silks
                     and moires as the ladies of the family flock in, a flutter of pink and snowy
                     gauze as the six bride-maids take their places. France is at their head, and
                     divides the admiration of the hour with the bride herself. As usual the
                     bridegroom dwindles into insignificance—the one epoch in the life of man when
                     he sinks his lordly supremacy and is, comparatively speaking, of no account.
                     Terry Dennison is there, looking pale, and cold, and miserable, but who thinks
                     of noticing <emph>him?</emph> Only France's compassionate eyes look at him once
                     as he stands, silent and unlike himself, with an infinite pity in their dark
                     depths.</p>
                  <p>It begins—dead silence falls. The low murmured responses sound strangely
                     audible in that hush. It is over—all draw one long breath of relief, and a
                     flutter and a murmur go through the silent congregation. They enter the
                     vestry—the register is signed—they are back in the carriages, whirling away to
                     the wedding breakfast, and bridegroom and bride are together, and the Right
                     Honorable Lord Viscount Dynely is "Benedick, the Married Man."</p>
                  <p>After that the hours fly like minutes. They are back at the vicarage. They are
                     seated at breakfast, champagne corks fly, toasts are drunk, speeches made and
                     responded to. The bridegroom's handsome face is flushed, his blue eyes glitter,
                     all his feigned languor and affected boredom, for the time being, utterly at an
                     end. By his side his bride sits, smiling, blushing, dimpling, most divinely
                     fair. Opposite, is Terry Dennison, trying heroically at light talk and
                     laughter, that he may not be the one death's head at the feast, but his face
                     keeping all the time its mute, cold misery.</p>
                  <p>The breakfast is over. The newly-made Viscountess hurries away to change her
                     dress. They will travel by the afternoon express to London—thence to
                     Folkestone. The honeymoon will be spent in Brittany—the first week of February
                     will find them in Paris, there to remain until the London season is fairly at
                     its height.</p>
                  <p>White satin splendor, nuptial blossoms, virginal veil, are changed for a
                     travelling suit of pearl gray, that fits the trim little figure to a charm.
                     From beneath the coquettish round hat and gossamer veil, the sweet childish
                     face looks sweeter and more childlike than ever. In the hall below the
                     impatient bridegroom stands—at the door the carriage waits. She is trembling
                     with nervous excitement from head to foot; she is but a frail, sensitive little
                     creature at best. Her mother is weeping audibly—her father coughs, takes off
                     his glasses and wipes them incessantly. France Forrester stands with dark,
                     tender eyes, and in her heart a vague feeling of pity, which she cannot define,
                     for this fragile looking child-wife.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Eric!" she says, laying her hand on his shoulder and looking up at him
                     with those dim, dusk eyes, "be good to her! take care of her, love her always.
                     You hold that child's very life in your hands; if you ever neglect her, if you
                     ever grow cold to her, as surely as we both stand here, she will break her
                     heart."</p>
                  <p>He laughs—nothing irritates him this thrice happy day, and <emph>this</emph> is
                     really a most stupendous joke.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>I</emph> neglect her! I cold to her! When I am either, I pray Heaven I
                     may die!"</p>
                  <p>She shrank back, something in his words, something in his look, frightened
                     her.</p>
                  <p>"He will neglect her, he will turn cold," some inward, prophetic voice
                     whispered; "and the doom he has invoked may fall."</p>
                  <p>One other heard those impassioned words—Dennison. He paused a moment, caught
                     Eric's hand, and wrung it hard.</p>
                  <pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6444-00000134"/>
                  <p>"Look to yourself, Dynely," he said, in a hoarse, hurried voice, "if you ever
                     forget that vow!"</p>
                  <p>Then he ran rapidly up the stairs and disappeared.</p>
                  <p>Lord Dynely looked after him, shrugged his shoulders slightly, and laughed
                     again.</p>
                  <p>"Poor old Terry!" he said, "'the ruling passion strong in death.' As much in
                     love with Lady Dynely as he ever was with Crystal Higgins. Ah, well! time
                     blunts these things. Let us hope he will have lived down his ill-starred
                     madness before we meet again."</p>
                  <p>The bride's door opens—a flock of pink and white, and sky blue nymphs flutter
                     out. The bride for an instant remains alone. Indifferent to what may be
                     thought, may be said, Dennison enters, goes up to the new-made peeress, takes
                     both her hands in his, with a clasp whose cruelty is unconscious, and looks
                     down with gloomy eyes into the startled, milk-white loveliness of her face.</p>
                  <p>"Crystal," he says, his voice hoarse and hurried still, "I must say one word to
                     you before we part. If, in the time that is coming, you are ever in trouble, if
                     you are ever in need of a friend, will you send for me? All our lives we have
                     been as brother and sister—by the memory of that bond between us let me be the
                     one to come to you if you ever need a friend."</p>
                  <p>She looked up at him. To the day of his death that look haunted him—so
                     radiantly, so unutterably happy.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>I</emph> in trouble! <emph>I</emph> in need of a friend!" she repeated
                     in a slow, rapturous sort of whisper. "<emph>I</emph>, Eric's wife! Ah, Terry!
                     dear old fellow, dear old brother, that can never be. I am the happiest,
                     happiest creature on all God's earth!"</p>
                  <p>"Yet, promise," he reiterates, in the same gloomy tone. "Who can foresee the
                     future? <emph>If</emph> trouble ever comes—mind, I don't say that it ever
                     will—I pray it never may—but if it comes and you need help, you will send for
                     me? Promise me this."</p>
                  <p>"It is treason to Eric to admit any such supposition," she laughs; "I
                        <emph>don't</emph> admit it, but if it will please you, Terry," the radiant
                     brilliance of her eyes softens to pity as she looks at him, "I promise. It is a
                     promise you will never be called upon to redeem—remember that. No trouble can
                     ever touch me. Eric loves me and has made me his wife. Let go, Terry—he is
                     calling."</p>
                  <p>He releases her hands, she holds out one again, with that tender, compassionate
                     glance.</p>
                  <p>"Good-by, Terry," she says, softly. "If I have ever given you pain I am sorry.
                     Forgive me before I go."</p>
                  <p>"There is nothing to forgive," he answers, huskily. "No man on earth could help
                     loving you, and all women seem to love <emph>him</emph>. Good-by, little
                     Crystal, and God in heaven bless you!"</p>
                  <p>It is their parting. She flies down the stairs to where her impatient possessor
                     stands.</p>
                  <p>"I—I was saying good-by to Terry," she falters, trembling already, even at that
                     shadow of a frown on his god-like brow. But at sight of her the shadow changes
                     to brightest sunshine.</p>
                  <p>"Good-by! good-by! good-by!" echoes and echoes on every hand.</p>
                  <p>The bride is kissed, and passed round to be kissed again, and there is crying
                     and confusion generally, and in the midst of it Miss Forrester's wicked black
                     eyes are laughing at Eric, who stands inwardly fuming at all this "confounded
                     scene," mortally jealous, and longing to tear his bride from them all and make
                     an end of the howling.</p>
                  <p>It does end at last; he hands her into the carriage, springs after, slams the
                     door, the driver cracks his whip, and they whirl off from the door. A shower of
                     slippers are hurled after them—then the carriage turns an angle and disappears,
                     and all is over.</p>
                  <milestone n="* * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>The guests begin to disperse, some at once, some not until next day. A gloomy
                     silence falls over the lately noisy, merry house—it is almost as though there
                     had been a death. Reaction after so much excitement sets in, everybody, more or
                     less, looks miserable. Terry Dennison is the first to go—he rejoins his
                     regiment. Lady Dynely, dowager, and Miss Forrester are the next, they return
                     for the winter to Rome; and Miss Forrester makes no secret of her eagerness to
                     be off.</p>
                  <pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6444-00000135"/>
                  <p>The next day dawns, sleety, rainy, chill, a very winter day. The last guest has
                     left the vicarage by the noon train, and the depression and dismalness is more
                     dismal than ever. The eight remaining Misses Higgins wander, cheerless and
                     miserable of aspect, through the lately-filled rooms, setting to rights and
                     taking up the dull thread of their dull gray lives once more.</p>
                  <p>When night falls, shrouded in sleety rain, the dark old vicarage stands sombre
                     and forlorn, despite the presence of those eight bright creatures, under the
                     inky, dripping, Lincolnshire sky.</p>

                  <head type="sub">HOW THE NEW YEAR BEGAN.</head>
                  <p>A RAW and rainy February evening—the first week of the month. Over London a
                     murky, smoke-colored sky hung, dripping wet, miserable tears over the muddy,
                     smoke-colored city. The famous "peasoup atmosphere" was at its very
                     pea-soupiest—figures flitted to and fro through the murk, like damp spectres,
                     shrouded in great-coats and umbrellas. The street lamps, that had been lit all
                     day, winked and flickered, yellow and dismal specks in the fog.</p>
                  <p>The streets of the city were filled with noisy, jostling life—the streets of
                     the West End were silent and deserted. The deadest of all dead seasons had
                     come; the great black houses were hermetically sealed; the denizens of
                     Belgravia and Mayfair had flitted far away; even the brilliant, gas-lit
                     emporiums of Regent Street were empty and deserted this foggy February
                     evening.</p>
                  <p>At the bay-window of one of the great club houses of St. James Street, a man
                     stood smoking a cigar and staring moodily out at the dark and dismal twilight.
                     The wet flag-stones glimmered in the pallid flicker of the street lamps, few
                     and far between; drenched and draggled pedestrians went by. Now and then a
                     hansom tore past, waking the gruesome echoes. These things were all the man at
                     the bay-window had to stare at; but for the last hour he had stood there<pb
                        n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6444-00000136"/> motionless, his moody eyes fixed
                     upon the rain-beaten glass. The solitary watcher, stranded upon Western London
                     at this most inhospitable season, was Terry Dennison. Terry Dennison who
                     yesterday had obtained a fortnight's leave, and who, this dreary February
                     evening, found himself in the old familiar quarters—why or wherefore, he hardly
                     knew. There were numbers of country houses—bright, hospitable houses, to which
                     he held standing welcome—houses where a "southerly wind and a cloudy sky
                     proclaimed it a hunting morning," but he had thrown over all, and was here as
                     utterly alone, it seemed to him, as though he had been wrecked on a deserted
                     island.</p>
                  <p>The five weeks that had passed since Christabel Higgins' wedding day had made
                     but slight outward alteration in Terry. He was looking haggard, and jaded,—the
                     honest blue eyes kept the old kindly, genial glance for all things, but they
                     look out with wistful weariness to-night. Where are they this wretched,
                     February evening, he wonders—where is <emph>she</emph>, what is she doing?</p>
                  <p>Are she and Eric doing the honeymoon still in the leafless groves of Brittany,
                     or have they gone to Rome to join the Gordon Caryll party, where Lady Dynely
                     and Miss Forrester also are? An unutterable longing to see Crystal once more
                     fills him—it is folly, he knows, something worse than folly, perhaps, but
                     before these two weeks of freedom expire he must stand face to face with
                     Viscount Dynely's bride.</p>
                  <p>The last gleam of the dark daylight is fading entirely out as a hansom whirls
                     up to the door and deposit sits one passenger. The glare of the lamp falls full
                     upon him, and Dennison recognizes an old acquaintance. As the man enters he
                     turns and holds out his hand.</p>
                  <p>"What! <emph>you</emph>, Dennison? My dear fellow, happy to meet you. I saw a
                     face at the window and thought it was Macaulay's New Zealander come before his
                     time, to philosophize over the desolation of London. Beastly weather, as usual.
                     How three millions of people, more or less, can drag out existence through
                     it—"</p>
                  <p>The speaker flings himself into a chair and gives up the problem in weary
                     disgust.</p>
                  <p>"I thought you were in Greece, Burrard," says Terry, throwing away his cigar,
                     and depositing himself in a second easy-chair.</p>
                  <p>"Was, all January. Gave it up and came to Paris, to have what our transatlantic
                     neighbors call 'a good time;' and just as I was having it (Felicia's there, you
                     know), came a telegram from Somersetshire, summoning me home. Governor—gout in
                     the stomach—thinks he's going to die, and wishes to have all his offspring
                     around him. It's the fifth time I have been summoned in the same way," says Mr.
                     Burrard, in a disgusted tone, "and nothing ever comes of it. It's all hypo on
                     the governor's part, and the family know it; but as he'll cut us off with a
                     shilling if we disobey, there's nothing for it. It was beastly crossing the
                     Channel, and I'm always seasick. It's an awful nuisance, Terry—give you my
                     word," Mr. Burrard gloomily concludes.</p>
                  <p>"Hard lines, old fellow," laughs Terry. "Let us hope this time that your
                     journey will not be in vain. So Paris is looking lively, is it? No February fog
                     there, I suppose? I shouldn't mind running over myself for a few days. Many
                     people one knows?"</p>
                  <p>"Lots," Mr. Burrard sententiously replies; "and, as I said before, la belle
                     Felicia at the Variétés, younger, and love-lier, and more fatal than ever. Gad!
                     Terry, the divine art of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">petits soupers</foreign> will
                     never die out while that woman exists. She's a sorceress and enchantress, a
                     witch. She must be five-and-thirty at the very least: and last night, as I sat
                     beside her, I could have taken my oath she wasn't a day more than
                     seventeen."</p>
                  <p>"Hard hit as ever, dear boy," Terry says, lighting another regalia. "I thought
                     that was an old story—over and done with ages ago—that you were clothed and in
                     your right mind once more, and about to take unto yourself a wife of the
                     daughters of the land. Have one?"</p>
                  <p>He presents his cigar case and box of Vesuvians, and Burrard gloomily selects
                     and lights up.</p>
                  <p>"You know Felicia, Terry?" he asks, after a smoky pause.</p>
                  <p>Terry nods.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>You</emph> never were one of her victims though, were you," the other
                     pursues.</p>
                  <pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6444-00000137"/>
                  <p>"Not I, old fellow," Terry laughs good humoredly. "The rôle of quarry to any
                     woman's hawk is not in the least my line. And I never could see, for the life
                     of me, what there was in belle Felicia, that men should go down before her,
                     like corn before the reaper. She's a monstrous fine woman for those who admire
                     the swarthy sort, which I don't, and knows how to use those two black eyes of
                     hers; but that dancer has never danced—were it the daughter of Herodias
                     herself—who could quicken my pulses by one beat."</p>
                  <p>"You're a cold-blooded animal, Dennison, I'm afraid," responds Mr. Burrard.
                     "Your insensibility to all womankind has passed into a proverb. You always had
                     the entree, too, when Felicia was in London."</p>
                  <p>"I had the good fortune to be of some slight service to her on one occasion,
                     and, like all women, she magnified a mole-hill into a mountain. So she is still
                     as fatal as ever—who is the last unhappy devil who has fallen into her
                     clutches?"</p>
                  <p>"Their name is legion. There are two American millionaires over there, ready to
                     blow each other's brains out about her. There is an Austrian archduke, with
                     five-and-twenty quarterings, an empty purse, and the bluest of sang azure,
                     ready, they say, at a moment's notice, to make her his wife. There is Prince Di
                     Venturini, who has come to his own again, since the young Italy party took the
                     reins—that affair is old and settled; it's an understood thing if she behaves
                     her self she is to be Madame la princess. And last, but by no means least in
                     the fair Felicia's eyes—since the bracelets, and rings, and rubbish of that
                     sort he gives her, they say would fill a Rue de la Paix jeweller's window—is
                     young Lord Dynely."</p>
                  <p>Terry has been lying back in his chair, dreamily watching the clouds of smoke
                     curl upward, and taking but a languid interest in the conversation. At this
                     name he sits suddenly upright, staring with round, startled blue eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Who?" he asks, sharply and suddenly.</p>
                  <p>"Dynely—know him, don't you? Oh, by the bye, yes—you and he are connections,
                     aren't you? Married at Christmas—country parson's daughter, didn't he, all on
                     the quiet? Well, my word, he's going the pace now, I can tell you."</p>
                  <p>"Burrard, do you mean to say Dynely is in Paris?"</p>
                  <p>"Been there the past three weeks. Went to Brittany or Normandy, or somewhere
                     for the honeymoon—so I was told; found love among the roses, a week after
                     matrimony, awfully slow work; most men do in like case, poor devils; set the
                     proprieties at defiance—couldn't serve out his sentence; came to Paris, and
                     fell, like the greenest of all green goslings, straightway into the talons of
                     that bird of paradise, Felicia. By the bye, birds of paradise haven't talons, I
                     daresay, but you know what I mean."</p>
                  <p>The color has faded out of Terry's face, leaving him very pale. Mr. Burrard,
                     with whom the handsome dancer is evidently a sore subject, and who is also
                     suffering evidently from an attack of the green-eyed monster, goes aggrievedly
                     on:</p>
                  <p>"Never saw a fellow so far gone in so short a time—give you my honor, Dennison!
                     He's mad, stark mad, running after that piratical little demon. It's early days
                     to leave the pretty wife alone in their big hotel. All Paris is talking about
                     it, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">sotto voce</foreign>, of course. Did you know her,
                     Terry?"</p>
                  <p>Burrard's sleepy, half-closed eyes, look across at him, and note for the first
                     time the sudden, startled pallor of his face.</p>
                  <p>"Yes—I know her," he answers slowly. "How is she looking, Burrard?"</p>
                  <p>"Never met her but once, and that was before the Felicia had gobbled her
                     husband up body and bones. I met them driving in the Bois, and I remember
                     everybody was turning to stare at the little blonde beauty. She appeared also
                     one night at an embassy ball, and was the talk of the clubs for the next three
                     days. It was her first and last appearance. She's there still, but invisible to
                     the naked eye. While he follows Felicia like her poodle or her shadow, the
                     little one mopes at home. I wouldn't say all this, Dennison, you understand,"
                     says Mr. Burrard, fearing he has gone too far, "but it is public talk in Paris.
                     Dynely's infatuation is patent to all the world."</p>
                  <p>The face of Terry has settled into an expression Horace Burrard has never seen
                     on that careless, good-humored face<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6444-00000138"/>
                     before. It is set and stern, the genial blue eyes gleam like steel. But he
                     speaks very quietly.</p>
                  <p>"And the Prince Di Venturini allows her to carry on like this? Wide latitude
                     for a future princess, you must own. Accommodating sort of Neapolitan, the
                     prince."</p>
                  <p>"Understand me, Terry," says Burrard, answering this last sneer rather
                     earnestly. "I don't mean to say Felicia goes much further than some of our own
                     frisky matrons do. A flirt she is <foreign xml:lang="FRA">à
                     outrance</foreign>—she would flirt with her own chasseur if no better game
                     offered. Beyond that, scandal goeth not. Di Venturini is most assuredly a man
                     who can take care of his own, a dead shot, and a noted duelist. Madame is also
                     most assuredly his <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fiancée</foreign>. She has an
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ame damnée</foreign>, who goes about with her
                     everywhere—the widow of an English curate, and propriety itself in crape and
                     bombazine. But she takes men's presents, fools them to the top of their bent,
                     cleans them out, and throws them over, with as little remorse as I throw away
                     this smoked-out cigar. 'One down, t'other come on,' that's the fair danseuse's
                     motto."</p>
                  <p>There was some bitterness in Burrard's tone. Evidently he was one of the
                     "cleaned out and thrown over." He arose as he spoke and looked at his
                     watch.</p>
                  <p>"Have you dined, Dennison? Because I have ordered—"</p>
                  <p>"Thanks—I dined two hours ago. Don't let me detain you, Burrard, and
                     good-night."</p>
                  <p>He went slowly up to his room, his face keeping that set, stern look.</p>
                  <p>She has no father, no brother to take her part; I may be that to her, if I may
                     be no more. If Burrard's story be true, then it is high time some one went to
                     the rescue."</p>
                  <p>His own words came back to him. Had the time come already for him to defend her
                     against the husband she loved, and for whom she had jilted him? He knew Eric
                     well—knew how recklessly, insanely, he tore every passion to tatters—knew how
                     little hold principle or fidelity had upon him, knew him weaker, more unstable
                     than water, selfish to the core, regardless of all consequences where his own
                     fancies were concerned. And into the keeping of such a man as this, little
                     Crystal's whole heart and life had been given.</p>
                  <p>"If he is false to her," Terry ground out between his set teeth, "I'll kill him
                     with my own hand. Only one short month his wife, and neglected, forsaken
                     already. Oh, my little Crystal! My little, pretty, innocent Crystal!"</p>
                  <p>He remembered his words to her on her wedding-day: "If you are ever in
                     trouble—if you ever need a friend, promise to send for me." She had not sent,
                     poor child! but she had not forgotten those words, he knew. He would go to
                     her—go at once. While Eric was kind she had not needed him—Eric had tired of
                     her, was on with another love before the honeymoon had waned—she needed him
                     now. Yes, he would go at once—to-morrow—by fair means or foul, Eric must be
                     made to quit Paris; and that painted sorceress, who wrought men's ruin, must be
                     forced to give back his allegiance to his wife. He should not neglect her and
                     break her heart with impunity.</p>
                  <p>That night Terry Dennison spent tossing feverishly on his bed, listening to the
                     lashing rain, and chilly, whistling, February wind. Before the dark, murky day
                     had fairly broken he was at the London bridge station—at nightfall he was in
                     Paris.</p>
                  <milestone n="* * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>The February weather, so bleakly raw in London, is brilliant with sunshine,
                     sparkling with crisp, clear frost here in Paris. The great avenues of the Bois
                     and Champs Elysées may be leafless, but the hoar frost sparkles in the early
                     sunshine like silver, the icicles glitter like pendant jewels, and the bright,
                     glad life, that never under the Parisian sky grows dull, is at its
                     brightest.</p>
                  <p>On this night that brings Dennison to Paris, gaslight has taken the place of
                     sunlight, and seems to his eyes, accustomed to London fog and dreariness, no
                     whit less dazzling. The bright streets are thronged—the huge front of the Hotel
                     Du Louvre is all a glitter of gaslights as his fiacre whirls up, and deposits
                     him and his portmanteau at the entrance.</p>
                  <p>"Can he have a room?" he asks the gentlemanly clerk.</p>
                  <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6444-00000139"/>
                  <p>And "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Mais oui monsieur</foreign>," is the answer;
                     "there is one room at monsieur's service, but it is <foreign xml:lang="FRA">au
                        cinquième numéro quatre-vingts douze</foreign>."</p>
                  <p>Monsieur does not care; he prepares to mount, turns back and asks:</p>
                  <p>"Lord and Lady Dynely are here?"</p>
                  <p>"Certainly, monsieur. Their apartments are <foreign xml:lang="FRA">au
                        premier</foreign>, lately vacated by his Serene Highness M. le Duc —."</p>
                  <p>Terry ascends to his cockloft, with a gravely meditative face. Are they at home
                     he wonders? is she? and how will Eric receive him? If what Burrard says be
                     true, it does not much matter—his and Eric's day of reckoning will have
                     come.</p>
                  <p>At that very hour, in one of her gorgeous suite of rooms, Lady Dynely sits,
                     quite alone. Alone! ah, poor Crystal! when is she not alone now? She sits, or
                     rather crouches, on the wide velvet-cushioned window sill, overlooking the
                     brilliant, busy quadrangle below, where flowers bloom in great tubs, and tall
                     palms stand dark under the glass roof, heedless of how she crushes her pretty
                     dinner dress of blue silk, the hue of her eyes. The soft blonde hair falls
                     loose and half curled over her shoulders. What does it matter? Eric is not here
                     to see—Eric is never here now it seems to her. What she wears, how she looks,
                     have ceased to interest Eric. He cares for her no more—after the deluge.</p>
                  <p>Her very attitude as she sits, huddled up here, is full of hopeless, pathetic
                     pain. The street lamps flare full upon the pretty, youthful face—youthful
                     still, childish no longer. She has eaten of the tree of knowledge, and its
                     fruit has been bitterer than death. All the sweet, childlike, surprised
                     innocence of the soft fair face, that made half its charm, is gone—its
                     peach-like, dimpled outline has grown sharp, the pearly fairness has turned to
                     fixed pallor—its delicate wild rose bloom has entirely faded—the tender,
                     turquoise eyes have taken a look of patient despair, very sad to see. Not six
                     weeks a bride, and the wife's despair shining from the sad, sweet eyes
                     already.</p>
                  <p>Her cheek is pressed against the cool glass; her hands—from one of which her
                     wedding-ring slips, so wasted it has grown—are loosely clasped in her lap; her
                     tired eyes watch listlessly the crowds that pass, the many vehicles that flash
                     up to the great doorway, and flash away again. Her mind is as listless as her
                     looks. She has been alone for two hours—two weeks it seems to her. She does not
                     care to read, she cannot go out, she cannot call in her maid and talk to her,
                     and there is no one else she knows. For Eric—well, the largest of the small
                     hours will bring Eric home—perhaps.</p>
                  <p>Suddenly she starts. From a fiacre that has just drawn up a man leaps out. The
                     lamp light falls upon him for a second, and Crystal's heart gives a leap. Big,
                     broad-shouldered, ruddy, bearded, in the familiar round hat and suit of
                     tweed—how much it looked like Terry. Oh! to see Terry once more—dear old, ever
                     kind Terry! oh, to see any of them from home—even sharp Elizabeth Jane or
                     snappish old Belinda. What a long, long time it seems since her wedding
                     day!</p>
                  <p>Her wedding day! It is only six weeks—six little weeks, and how happy she had
                     been! That day, with all its details, returns to her with a pang of remembrance
                     that pierces her heart. She recalls Terry's parting words with strange
                     vividness now—in all these weeks she has never thought of them before.</p>
                  <p>"If in the time that is coming, you are ever in trouble, if you ever need a
                     friend, will you send for me? All our lives we have been as brother and
                     sister—by the memory of the past, let me be the one to help you if you ever
                     stand in need."</p>
                  <p>She had laughed in her happy incredulity then—ah, how true his words had come.
                     But she could never send for him, or for any one on earth; her trouble was a
                     trouble she could only take to the good God. He alone could befriend her here.
                     How had the change come about?—was she to blame? She could not tell. Her mind
                     went over, in a dazed, helpless sort of way, all her brief married life, and
                     the fault had not been hers—that she knew. They had been so happy in Brittany,
                     so intensely happy—with a happiness that, as a quaint English writer says,
                     "Spread out thin, might have covered comfortably their<pb n="282-283"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000140"/> whole lives." They had been happy—intensely—for
                     one week; happy in a more moderate degree, on Eric's part, the second. The
                     third set in with steady drizzling rain, and wild wintry winds, and before its
                     close the bridegroom was yawning in the face of the bride. He was as fond of
                     Crystal as ever, no doubt, but four days of incessant rain in a dull Breton
                     town are apt to be trying to the frivolous masculine mind.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, I say, Chris," Eric said, with a prolonged yawn, "this is awfully slow,
                     you know. I can't stand much more of St. Malo and this infernal weather—upon my
                     word I can't. It's a beastly dull hole at any time; a fortnight's as long as
                     any rational being could survive it. I say, let's go to Paris."</p>
                  <p>If Eric had said, "Let us go, like Hans Pfaal, up to the moon in a balloon, and
                     live there," Crystal would have looked up in her lord's handsome, bored face,
                     with blue eyes of adoring delight, put on her things, and gone. Paris, or St.
                     Malo, or the moon, were all alike to this worshipping, little three weeks'
                     wife. Next day they came to Paris. and Crystal's troubles began. The first four
                     days all was well. He drove with her in the Bois, his vanity tickled by the
                     profound admiration her delicate blonde loveliness everywhere excited. He took
                     her to the Louvre, to the Tuileries, to a ball at the English Embassy, to a
                     dinner at the Earl of Albemarle's.</p>
                  <p>The fourth evening was windy and wet; she had a slight headache, and could not
                     go out. Eric was to dine at the Jockey Club, of which he was a member. After
                     dinner, with a couple of friends, he went to the Varieties to see Felicia in
                     her new piece, "The Golden Witch." He went, and Crystal's doom was sealed.</p>
                  <p>"It's rather odd," Eric said, as he and his friends took their places in the
                     stalls, "that I've never seen this celebrated Felicia. She had finished her
                     engagement and left London before I came. Is she really the great irresistible
                     she's called?"</p>
                  <p>"Ah! wait until you see," one of his companions answered. "If you are made of
                     anything like the inflammable ble materials I wot of of old, one flash from her
                     black eyes will finish you."</p>
                  <p>Eric laughed.</p>
                  <p>"We have changed all that, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ami</foreign>. I have
                     outlived my taste for black beauties, and can defy all the sorceresses that
                     ever bounded before the footlights."</p>
                  <p>There was a glow at his heart as he said it. A vision rose up before him, of
                     the pure, sweet face, crowned with its halo of pale gold hair, that he had left
                     at home. Ah yes! these dark daughters of the earth had had their day—he was his
                     little white wife's forever now. Then the curtain rose, and the "La Sorcière
                     d'Or," in a triumphant burst of music, bounded before them. The lights flashed
                     up, a thunder of welcome shook the house, their favorite was smiling and
                     kissing hands to her friends. Eric Dynely looked with critical eyes. Her scant
                     drapery was as if woven of cloth of gold—she seemed robed in a sunburst. Her
                     magnificent black hair fell in a rippling shower to her slim waist, clasped
                     back with brilliants. The great, dark Southern eyes seemed to outflash the
                     diamonds. Whatever her age, under the gaslights she did not look a day over
                     eighteen.</p>
                  <p>"By Jove!" Eric said, his breath fairly taken away; "she's handsome,
                     Argyll!"</p>
                  <p>Argyll smiled.</p>
                  <p>"Look out for your counter-charm, old fellow. The fair Felicia slays, and
                     spares not. She is handsome—yes as a tigress or panther is handsome—and as
                     merciless."</p>
                  <p>She danced—it was the very poetry of grace and motion. She sang—and her
                     magnificent contralto filled the building. It was the merest trifle of a play,
                     but she threw herself with wonderful <emph>abandon</emph> and passion into her
                     part, carrying her audience with her. At the close, when the "Golden Witch" is
                     tried, condemned, and found guilty of witchcraft, when she is sentenced to be
                     bound to the stake, when the sacrificial fire is kindled about her, when, with
                     wild agony and despair in the beautiful, ghastly face, she chants her own weird
                     death song, a silence that is painful and oppressive fills the house. The mimic
                     flames mount high—the death song dies out in an unearthly wail of<pb
                        n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6444-00000141"/> anguish as the curtain falls. The
                     "Golden Witch" has been burned alive.</p>
                  <p>"Best thing they could do with her," growls Argyll; "it's a thousand pities
                     they don't try it in reality. There are a good many <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >belle dames sans merci</foreign> in this one city, but I'll take my oath
                     she's the wickedest woman in Paris. Wake up, Dynely. On my word, the fellow's
                     in a trance!"</p>
                  <p>The theatre shook with its thunders of applause. "Felicia! Felicia!" a hundred
                     voices called. She came, gliding out before them, smiling and bowing once more,
                     with a serpentine smoothness of motion, a supple grace, that <emph>was</emph>
                     very pantheresque. A shower of bouquets were flung upon the stage—then with a
                     last brilliant smile she vanished, and everybody arose to go.</p>
                  <p>"Will you come behind and be presented, Dynely?" his friend said; "you rather
                     look as if you'd like it. I have the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">entrée</foreign>.
                     There's to be a supper, and Felicia's little suppers are things to dream of.
                     She and I are old acquaintances," he laughs as he lights his cigar; "any friend
                     of mine is sure of a welcome."</p>
                  <p>To turn from the voice of the tempter was an act of self-sacrifice Eric had
                     never striven to do in his life. He did not strive now. Certainly he would go
                     and be presented to the adorable Felicia.</p>
                  <p>"By Jove! Argyll, old fellow, she <emph>is</emph> a stunner and no mistake," he
                     said.</p>
                  <p>So they went, and the lovely Felicia, all smiles and darkling, sparkling
                     glances, proffers her hospitality to Mr. Argyll's friend. Eric accepts. For one
                     instant the pale slumbering face of his wife rises before him reproachfully,
                     but he puts the thought impatiently away. She is asleep long ago—what odds will
                     an hour or two make to her to-morrow. It is, as Argyll says, a <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">chef d'œuvre</foreign> of a supper—the cuisine,
                     perfection—the guests the wittiest, cleverest men, the most beautiful and
                     successful actresses in Paris. And in a state of wild intoxication, that comes
                     more from Felicia's smiles and looks than her sparkling wines, Eric reaches his
                     rooms as the new day grows gray in the east. Next morning—is it by chance?—they
                     meet in the Bois—Lord Dynely on horseback, Felicia in a fairy chariot, drawn by
                     two coal-black Arabs, handling the lines like "Four-in-hand Fossbrooke"
                     himself. The brilliant smiles and glances are showered on Lord Dynely once more
                     in dazzling profusion—he becomes her attendant cavalier, and they take the Bois
                     in dashing style, the observed of all observers. In a delicious bonnet—a work
                     of art in itself—behind a flimsy dotted veil, madame still looks eighteen—no
                     more. Her violet velvets, her rich sables, set off her dusk beauty well; all
                     eyes follow her, very audible French exclamations of admiration reach her
                     gratified ears. Hats fly off at her approach—gentlemen innumerable salaam
                     before her, and the graceful head bends like a queen's to it all. Ladies look
                     on the other side, it is true—but what will you! She is a dancer, and men adore
                     her—two unforgivable sins in their eyes; a coquette of the first water—farther
                     than that slander itself will not go. The sheep dog—the demure-faced curate's
                     widow—occupies the other side, as they fly along, down the great wooded drive
                     of the Bois de Boulogne.</p>
                  <p>And little Crystal's doom was sealed! Neglect, coldness, impatience—there was
                     nothing left for her but these. Evening after evening, upon one pretext or
                     another, he was absent; evening after evening she sat while the long, dragging,
                     miserable hours wore by, and waited, waited, waited, for one who did not come.
                     Many madnesses of this sort had held him before, but none so utterly,
                     recklessly mad as this. What did it mean? What had she done? She could not
                     understand the change in him. Was Eric growing tired of her already? The
                     childish blue eyes would lift to his face in bewildered, pathetic questioning,
                     the childish lips would quiver. He could not meet those glances. He avoided her
                     more and more—her meek, uncomplaining patience was the keenest reproach she
                     could make. Then the bewildered questioning died out of the eyes, and a dark
                     despair took its place. Even to her, secluded as a nun, vague rumors of the
                     truth came. Eric had tired of her—another woman had caught his eye and fancy.
                     All was over for her. "Milor's" infatuation for the actress was the gossip of
                     the very servants, the magnificent presents he gave her, his constant<pb
                        n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6444-00000142"/> attendance upon her; and in some way
                     it all floated to Crystal's ears. Her own maid looked upon her with pitying
                     eyes—all Paris knew that she was a bride forsaken before the honeymoon had
                     waned. She uttered no word of complaint—no reproach, only the color died out of
                     her face, the light from her eyes—to her it was death—her life had come to an
                     end—just that.</p>
                  <p>She sits alone this evening as usual—she is always alone now. She accepts no
                     invitations—she receives no visitors. But there is a visitor for her to-night,
                     however, a tall gentleman, at whom Marie, the maid, casts glances of admiration
                     as she announces him. Crystal rises, bewildered, from the window—she has not
                     caught the name. Under the light of the chandelier her visitor stands, and a
                     great cry of amaze and delight fills the room.</p>
                  <p>"Terry!" she cries; "oh, Terry!"</p>
                  <p>She rushes forward, and fairly flings her arms around his neck. She is so
                     utterly lonely, so homesick and desolate, poor child, and Terry is the big
                     brother who has always been so good to her—nothing else.</p>
                  <p>His face flushes under the swift caress. Then she recollects herself, and lets
                     him go, and puts back her loose, falling hair in blushing confusion.</p>
                  <p>"I—it was so sudden, and I—I <emph>am</emph> so glad to see a face from home.
                     Sit down, Terry. When did you come, and how are they all?"</p>
                  <p>Her fingers lace and unlace nervously. Her lips tremble like the lips of a
                     child about to cry. She has grown nervous and hysterical of late from being so
                     much alone with her misery, and the sight of Terry has unnerved her.</p>
                  <p>"All well," he answers cheerily; "at least I've not been down at the Vicarage,
                     but I had a letter from Linda a week ago. I told them I was going to cross over
                     and look you up, and they sent no end of love and all that."</p>
                  <p>Then there is a pause—a painful one. The color has faded out of her face, and
                     it look bluish white against the crimson velvet back of her chair. Good
                     heavens! Terry thinks, with a thrill of pain and anger, how changed she is, how
                     thin, how worn, how pallid. But he makes no mention of her looks, he only asks
                     in a constrained sort of voice:</p>
                  <p>"Eric is well, I hope?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes, thank you!"</p>
                  <p>Her voice falters as she repeats the old formula. Again there is silence. Terry
                     is not a good one for making conversation, and silence is little Crystal's
                     forte.</p>
                  <p>"Is Eric not at home?" he ventures after that uneasy pause.</p>
                  <p>"No," she answers, her eyes fixed on the rings she is unconsciously twisting
                     round and round; "he is dining out. It—it is a bachelor party. He could not
                     take me."</p>
                  <p>"And what business has he at bachelor parties <emph>now</emph>?" rises to
                     Terry's lips, but he represses it. She is going to say something, he sees—the
                     sensitive color is coming and going in her face—something that she finds hard
                     to say. It comes out at last hurriedly."</p>
                  <p>"Terry! I wish you would take me to the theatre to-night."</p>
                  <p>"Crystal!"</p>
                  <p>"To the Variétés. I—I want to go. I must go!" She lifts her eyes to his, and
                     they flash for a moment. "I have wanted to go all this week. Will you take me
                     to-night?"</p>
                  <p>He sets his lips. She has heard then. He asks no questions—he makes no
                     reply.</p>
                  <p>"Don't refuse me, Terry," she pleads, and the sweet lips tremble. "You never
                     did refuse me anything—don't begin now. I want to go—oh, so much! I want to
                     see—that woman."</p>
                  <p>The wifely hatred and jealousy she feels for "that woman" are in the bitterness
                     with which she pronounces the two words. It is hard to refuse her—but Terry
                     sits silent and troubled still.</p>
                  <p>"I would do anything for you, Crystal," he says at length; "but this—is this
                     best?"</p>
                  <p>"I want to go—I <emph>will</emph> go," she says, passionately, turning away. "I
                     did not think you would refuse, Terry Dennison."</p>
                  <p>"I have not refused, Crystal," he answers gently. "Of<pb n="288-289"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000143"/> course I will take you, with pleasure, since you
                     wish it. There is plenty time, too. While you put on your mantle and gloves, I
                     will go and secure a box—if one is to be had."</p>
                  <p>She gives him a grateful glance.</p>
                  <p>"You were always good to me, Terry," she repeats softly.</p>
                  <p>He sighs to himself as he leaves her. So changed! so changed! and she is as
                     dear to him as ever. The hottest anger he has ever felt against any living man,
                     he feels to-night against Lady Dynely's son.</p>
                  <p>She dresses without the aid of her maid—dresses hurriedly, and stands all ready
                     as Dennison reappears.</p>
                  <p>"It is all right, Lady Dynely," he says in his cheery voice; "by great good
                     luck there was one unoccupied box, and I got it. Our fiacre is at the
                     door."</p>
                  <p>She slips her gloved hand within his arm and goes down; she is trembling with
                     nervous excitement, he can feel. She has never seen this beautiful, wicked
                     actress, who has charmed her darling from her—she has never dared speak of her
                     to Eric, and he has never offered to take her anywhere. He may be angry when he
                     hears of this—she has no intention of concealing it from him—but she must see
                     her, she must. She must look upon the face fair enough to take the bridegroom
                     from his bride before the honeymoon is at an end.</p>
                  <p>The house is full when they reach it—a glittering horseshoe of faces, and
                     toilettes, and gaslight, and perfume and fluttering fans. She sinks into her
                     seat and draws back behind the curtain. The play has begun, and "<foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">La Sorcière d'Or</foreign>," in her dark, insolent,
                     triumphant beauty, and dazzling raiment, is on the stage, electrifying the
                     audience by her passionate power.</p>
                  <p>Crystal looks at her and turns sick, sick at heart, sick with despair. Yes, she
                     is beautiful—terribly, brilliantly beautiful—insolently, demoniacally
                     beautiful, it seems to her. Her voice is like silver, her eyes like dusk stars;
                     and Eric worships beauty in all things, and this woman—this, is her rival. She
                     turns away in sick, mute despair as the curtain falls. What power has she to
                     hold him against a glittering enchantress tress like this. At that moment a
                     party of gentlemen enter the box opposite; she gives a quick gasping cry—one of
                     them is her husband.</p>
                  <p>He has been dining and wining evidently. His fair, girl's complexion is
                     flushed—his blue eyes glitter with passionate excitement. He leans back and
                     sweeps the house with his glass—she shrinks tremblingly farther from sight.
                     Terry, too, draws back—Terry, whose face wears a look Crystal has never seen it
                     wear before.</p>
                  <p>The curtain rises on the second act. Lord Dynely's double-barrels turn from the
                     people to the players. <emph>She</emph> is on the stage once more—his opera
                     glass devours her. He lies back and stares immovably all through the act. When
                     at its close loud plaudits ring through the house, his primrose-kidded hands
                     applaud to the echo. She comes—floral showers, as usual, rain upon her. Crystal
                     does not look at her now—her fascinated eyes are riveted upon her husband. She
                     sees him lean forward, a smile on his handsome face—sees him take a little
                     bouquet of fairy roses and geranium leaves from his button-hole and fling it to
                     the actress. Crystal gives a little gasping cry of sheer physical pain.
                        <emph>She</emph> formed that little bouquet—<emph>she</emph> pinned it into
                     his button-hole as she kissed him good-by four hours ago. And now the actress
                     lifts it—lifts it from amid hosts of others, presses it to her lips—flashes one
                     lightning glance at the fair-haired Englishman in the box above, and
                     disappears.</p>
                  <p>"You stand well with the Felicia, Dynely," one of the party, a compatriot of
                     Eric's, says, with a loud laugh. "She selects your bouquet from all that
                     pyramid. Lucky beggar! We poor devils stand no chance against such a curled
                     darling of the gods."</p>
                  <p>The third act finishes—the golden witch dies at the stake, singing her wondrous
                     funeral song. The play is over.</p>
                  <p>"And I'd like to be the one to fire the fagots, by —," Terry grinds out between
                     his set teeth. Then he leans over and speaks to his companion. "Are you tired,
                     Crystal? You look pale," he says—so gently he says it.</p>
                  <p>She is more than pale; her very lips are colorless; but<pb n="290-291"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000144"/> she lifts her grateful, hopeless eyes, and
                     repeats the old foolish formula:</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no, thank you."</p>
                  <p>"The 'Golden Witch' is finished. There is a grand new ballet—do you care to
                     wait to see it?" he asks again.</p>
                  <p>"I will wait, Terry, if you please."</p>
                  <p>She does not care for the ballet; she will not see it at all, very likely; but
                     Eric is yonder—her Eric—her husband—and while she can sit and watch him, this
                     place is better than any other in Paris.</p>
                  <p>But presently Eric gets up, leaves his box, and goes away. There is rather a
                     long interval before the ballet. People chat, flirt, laugh, discuss the play
                     and Felicia, and presently there is a stir, and a bustle and a sensation amid
                     them all.</p>
                  <p>Every glass in the house turns to one box as the curtain rises and the new
                     ballet begins. Terry and Crystal look, too.</p>
                  <p>In that stage-box the star of the night sits. Madame Felicia, in elegant full
                     dress, ablaze with diamonds, lies back in her chair, wielding a fan with the
                     grace of a Castilian donna, and listening, with a smile on her perfect lips, to
                     the whispered words of the man who bends over her. He stoops so low that his
                     blonde hair mingles with her jetty tresses. The little knot of fairy roses
                     nestle in these ebon locks; and the tall cavalier who bends so closely, so
                     devotedly, is Eric, Lord Dynely</p>
                  <p>Crystal can bear no more. With a great sob, she turns to Dennison, and holds
                     out her hands.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Terry," the poor child says, "take me home!"</p>
                  <p>He does not speak a word. He rises, wraps her cloak around her, draws her hand
                     within his arm, and leads her out of the theatre. In the fiacre she falls back
                     in a corner and hides her face from the pitiless glare of the streets. No word
                     is spoken all the way—what is to be said? Both know the worst.</p>
                  <p>He conducts her to her own door, still dead silent. There he pauses, takes both
                     her hands and holds them in his strong, friendly clasp, while he looks down in
                     the drooping, heartbroken face.</p>
                  <p>"Keep up heart, little Crystal," he says; "I'll fetch Eric home in an
                     hour."</p>
                  <p>She lays her cold cheek down for a second on the warm, true hands.</p>
                  <p>"Dear old Terry!" she says, softly. Then he lets her go, and the velvet-hung
                     door closes behind her.</p>

                  <head type="sub">"LA BELLE DAME SANS MERCI."</head>
                  <p>AND this is how it has ended. Only five weeks married—and he has wearied of her
                     already—a newer, more brilliant beauty has won him from her. Terry has known it
                     would come—known it from the first, but not so soon—good Heaven! not so soon.
                     He takes his way into the street, the hottest, fiercest wrath he has ever felt
                     against any human being, burning in his heart against Eric Dynely. How she has
                     changed—what a pale shadow of the lovely, happy face she took to the altar last
                     New Year's day. What a pitiful, crushed, heart-broken look the sweet, childish
                     eyes wear. If she could have loved him—if he could have won her—if Eric had
                     never come between them, how happy he could have made her! He would have made
                     her life so blessed, she would have been all his own in time, beyond the power
                     of any man to come between them. With a sort of groan he breaks off. His she is
                     not, his she can never be. Eric must return to her or she will die—the whole
                     story is told in that.</p>
                  <p>"He shall return to her," Terry says inwardly, setting his teeth, "or I will
                     know the reason why."</p>
                  <p>He does not pause a moment—he hurries at once to the theatre. The ballet is but
                     just ended—the people are pouring forth, but nowhere among them does he see
                     Eric. At length in the crowd he espies a man he knows, one of the four who
                     first entered with him he is seeking, and he makes his way to him and taps him
                     familiarly on the shoulder.</p>
                  <p>"Boville, old boy," he says with the Briton's customary curt greeting, "how are
                     you?"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Boville looks over his shoulder and opens two small, sleepy-looking
                     eyes.</p>
                  <p>"What, Dennison! what, Terry! you here! thought you were at Aldershot. Awfully
                     glad to see you all the same."</p>
                  <p>"I'm looking for Eric," Terry responds, plunging at once into his subject. "He
                     came in with you. Where is he now?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, he came in with me," Boville says, with a faint, weary little laugh.
                     "Where is he now? In much pleasanter company, dear boy—driving home with Madame
                     Felicia. Intoxicating creature that—eh, Terry? And weally, on my word, you
                     know," lisps Mr. Boville, raising his white eye-brows, "Dynely is altogether
                     the spooniest fellow!"</p>
                  <p>"Where does Madame Felicia live?" Terry growls, with a flash of his eye,
                     cutting Mr. Boville's drawl suddenly short.</p>
                  <p>The slow, sleepy eyes open again. Mr. Boville looks at Mr. Dennison with a
                     curious little half smile. But he gives Madame Felicia's address readily
                     enough, and watches the big dragoon out of sight with a shrug.</p>
                  <p>"Is Eric to be brought to his senses, and is Terry deputed to do it, I wonder?"
                     he thinks. "If so, then Terry has quite the most difficult task before him that
                     heavy dragoon was ever called upon to do."</p>
                  <p>Yes, Terry was going to bring him to his senses—going to bring him to his wife;
                     and without a moment's hesitation, he hails a fiacre, gives the address, and is
                     whirled away through the noonday gaslit brilliance of the boulevards.</p>
                  <p>"There's to be a supper, no doubt," he thinks. "Is not Felicia famous wherever
                     she goes for her after-theatre suppers? Well, fortune stands my friend this
                     time—I hold the open sesame to <emph>her</emph> doors, and though I have never
                     availed myself of it before, by Jove! I will to night."</p>
                  <p>His mind goes back to a certain day two years before, when he had in all
                     probability saved Madame Felicia's life, or at least what was of equal account
                     to her, her beauty. It was the old story of runaway horses—the lady rescued in
                     the nick of time. Madame's passion for spirited ponies had, on more occasions
                     than one, placed her pretty neck and graceful limbs in jeopardy—on this
                     occasion the runaways<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6444-00000146"/> had become
                     altogether unmanageable, the reins had been jerked from her hands, and with
                     heads up and eyes flashing, they had rushed madly along. The gates of a great
                     park ended the road—if those gates were open madame still stood one chance, if
                     they were closed—she shuddered, intrepid little Amazon as she was, and sat
                     still as death, and white as marble, straining her eyes through the whirlwind
                     of dust as they flew along. The park came in sight—the gates were
                        <emph>closed!</emph> It was just at that moment Terry Dennison, on
                     horseback, came in view. He took in the situation in an instant. To a tempt to
                     check the horses in their mad career would have been useless now; they would
                     wrench his arms from the sockets before they could be stopped. He galloped up,
                     hurled himself off his horse, and with the agility of a circus rider and the
                     strength of a latter-day Samson, lifted the lady sheer out of the carriage. The
                     horses went headlong at the closed gates, shivering the frail phaeton to atoms,
                     and Madame Felicia fainted quietly away in Lieutenant Dennison's arms.</p>
                  <p>That was the story. Terry never made capital of it, but the actress did. She
                     was profoundly and greatly grateful, and to show that gratitude, made every
                     possible effort to captivate her preserver and break his heart. For once she
                     failed. Mr. Dennison was invulnerable. All her cajoleries, all her
                     fascinations, all her beauty and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chic</foreign>, fell
                     powerless on this big dragoon's dull sensibilities. He saw through her and
                     laughed at her quietly in his sleeve. What the deuce did the little, gushing
                     dancer mean making eyes at him? Terry wondered. He wasn't an elder son; he
                     didn't keep an open account at Hunt &amp; Roskell's; he had never given any one
                     a diamond bracelet in his life. She knew it too—then what did she mean? It was
                     madame's way of showing her deep gratitude to the preserver of her life—simply
                     that. But for Terry she would have been smashed to atoms with the phaeton, her
                     beauty ruined, her symmetrical limbs broken, her occupation gone. She shuddered
                     when she thought of it; death would have been preferable to that. She
                        <emph>was</emph> grateful, deeply and truly grateful, and gave Mr. Dennison
                     carte blanche to come and go as he pleased from henceforth forever. It was a
                     privilege for which royalty itself was sighing just then, but with the dull
                     insensibility that had always characterized him in these things, Dennison
                     treated it and her with the calmest, utterest indifference. He liked her as a
                     dancer, but as a woman, and in private life, not any, thanks. Terry did not go
                     in for dancers. In short Mr. Dennison would <emph>not</emph> be numbered among
                     her victims, would not lose his head for her; and madame saw and laughed
                     good-naturedly, and gave it up and respected him accordingly. It would be a
                     refreshing novelty to have a masculine friend, a friend pure and simple, who
                     would never be a lover, and so she liked Dennison as honestly, as a more honest
                     woman might, and still kept her doors open to him. He came at times to those
                     pleasant, post-opera suppers, where the cleverest painters, the most
                     distinguished novelists, the handsomest actresses in London were to be met, and
                     was ever warmly welcomed.</p>
                  <p>He had known she was in Paris—he had not met her for seven months, but he had
                     not had the faintest intention of calling upon her here. And now he was
                     whirling along rapidly to her rooms. Of his welcome from her, at all times and
                     in all places, he was sure; his welcome from Eric was much more to the point
                     just at present; and of that he was not at all sure.</p>
                  <p>"Hang her!" Terry thought, with an inward growl; "hang all such confounded
                     little pirates, cruising in honest waters, and raising the devil wherever they
                     go. Still if one goes there at all, one must be civil, I suppose.</p>
                  <p>Civil accordingly, Mr. Dennison was when ushered into the gem-like drawing-room
                     of Madame Felicia.</p>
                  <p>A chandelier, blazing like a mimic sun in the frescoed ceiling, made the room
                     one sheet of golden light. The walls were lined with mirrors, the windows hung
                     with satin and lace, the air heavy with pastilles. Half-a-dozen elegantly
                     dressed and exceptionally handsome women reclined in every species of
                     easy-chair, with attendant cavaliers. On a low fauteuil reclined the great
                     Felicia herself, robed in a billowy cloud of translucent white. As a rule she
                     affected costly moires, stiff brocades, heavy velvets; to-night,<pb n="296-297"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000147"/> crisp, white gossamer floated about the perfect
                     form, richest lace draped the arms and shoulders, diamonds and opals glittered
                     about her, and pale, perfumy, yellow roses nestled in the dead-blue blackness
                     of her hair. By her side, Lord Dynely sat, gazing at the dusky, languid,
                     slightly-bored, warmly-lovely face, as if he could never gaze enough. All
                     started and stared as the new-comer was announced. Unknown to all but two—most
                     unlooked for by them—Terry yet advanced with that ease that the utter absence
                     of all vanity, of all self-consciousness, gives.</p>
                  <p>"I only reached Paris to-night," he said, "and unorthodox as is the hour, I
                     could <emph>not</emph> resist the temptation to call. It is seven months since
                     we met, madame, and you will recollect that in your goodness I hold permission
                     to visit you in season and out of season."</p>
                  <p>Quite a lengthy and diplomatic speech for the speaker, but he had prepared it
                     in the fiacre. When one deals with serpents one must be subtle. The
                     yellow-black eyes turned upon him, a light of real pleasure in them; she half
                     arose and held out her hand. She was cordially pleased to see Terry.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Dennison knows he is always more than welcome—one does not easily forget
                     such service as he rendered. How very nice of you to call. Let me introduce you
                     to Lord Dynely; but you know him, perhaps?"</p>
                  <p>She looked doubtfully at his lordship. Know him? Surely! for on Lord Dynely's
                     face an unmistakable scowl has arisen.</p>
                  <p>"What the devil brings you to Paris, Dennison?" he bluntly demands; "when did
                     you come?</p>
                  <p>"To-night, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon cher</foreign>—have you not heard me say
                     so? Delighted to see me does he not look?" Terry says gayly, turning to
                     madame.</p>
                  <p>"Where are you stopping?" Eric asks, still with a scowl.</p>
                  <p>"I honor the Louvre with my patronage on this occasion, my lord."</p>
                  <p>Then there is a pause. The two men look at each other—one straight, level,
                     searching glance—angry and suspicious picious on Eric's part—stern and resolved
                     on Terry's. Eric is the first to turn away, with a shrug, and a slight
                     contemptuous laugh.</p>
                  <p>"John Bull is ubiquitous! Go where you will he crops up when you least expect
                     him. It is one of the great drawbacks of our civilization."</p>
                  <p>"Was monsieur at the Variétés to-night?" madame asks, coquettishly. She is not
                     French, but she affects the French language as she affects French cookery,
                     French toilettes, and French morals.</p>
                  <p>"I have had that pleasure," Terry responds. "Madame is irresistible in all
                     things, but she out-does herself in '<foreign xml:lang="FRA">La Sorcière d'
                        Or</foreign>.' Shall we see you in it at the Bijou next London season?"</p>
                  <p>Felicia laughs softly, and glances up from under her black lashes at Lord
                     Dynely's gloomy face.</p>
                  <p>"Ah—who knows? Next London season—it begins in a month or two, does it not? but
                     who knows what may happen in a month or two? One may be a thousand miles away
                     from your bleak fogs, and easterly winds, and dull phlegmatic stalls by that
                     time. <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Mon ami</foreign>, how sulky you look," striking
                     Dynely a blow with her perfumed fan. "As you say in your country—a penny for
                     your thoughts."</p>
                  <p>"They are worth much more—I was thinking of <emph>you</emph>," he answers
                     rather bitterly.</p>
                  <p>"Lord Dynely does me too much honor. Judging by his tone they must be pleasant.
                     May I ask what?"</p>
                  <p>"I was wondering if there will be <emph>any</emph> Madame Felicia to enchant
                     the sleepy British stalls of the Bijou next season. I was wondering if by that
                     time it will not be Her Excellency, Madame La Princesse Di Venturini."</p>
                  <p>She laughs a second time. His angry, jealous tone, which he cannot conceal if
                     he would, amuses her vastly.</p>
                  <p>"Who knows?" is her airy answer; "such droll things happen! I am not sure,
                     though, that it would be half so pleasant. They are announcing supper. Mr.
                     Dennison, will you give me your arm? Lord Dynely, the most delightful of men,
                     the most gallant of gentlemen on ordinary occasions, yet falls a prey at times
                     to what I once heard a<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6444-00000148"/> countryman of
                     his call <emph>the doldrums</emph>. And I cannot endure people who have the
                     doldrums!"</p>
                  <p>She laughs once more, softly and musically, and shows dazzlingly white teeth.
                     She is a trifle vulgar, this peerless Felicia—her most ardent admirers admit
                     that. She smokes, she drinks a great deal of her own champagne—she has even
                     been known to swear at times. But she laughs well—it is one of her most telling
                     points—languidly, sweetly and very often. What her nationality is no one seems
                     exactly to know. English she is not—French, Italian, Spanish, German, she is
                     not. There are people who hint at Yankee extraction; but this madame herself
                     denies, furiously and angrily denies. She has never crossed the Atlantic in her
                     life, and never, <emph>never</emph> will. She hates America. The lazy, topaz
                     eyes flash as she says it. She will never play in America in her life.</p>
                  <p>The ruby velvet portières were drawn aside, and they filed in by twos into the
                     adjoining dining-room. Here too the light was vivid as noonday, and beneath the
                     mimic sun of gas a table glittered that was a vision. Tall epergnes of frosted
                     silver, filled with rarest hot-house flowers, slender glasses of waxy camellias
                     from the greenery of a duke, rarest, costliest grapes, peaches and pears.</p>
                  <p>There was a brief pause in the gay hum of conversation as they sat down.
                     Felicia's cook was a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chef</foreign> of the first
                     water—his works of art were best appreciated by silence. For her wines—was not
                     every famous cellar in Paris laid under contribution?—nothing finer were to be
                     met at the table of imperial royalty itself. Presently, however, the first lull
                     passed, gay conversation, subdued laughter, witty sallies, brilliant repartees
                     flashed to and fro. Perhaps of all the clever company assembled, the hostess
                     herself was least clever. As a dancer she was not to be surpassed—as a beauty
                     she was without peer—as a brilliant, a witty conversationalist, she was
                     nowhere. She ate her delicate <hi rend="i"/>salmis, drank her famous clarets
                     and sparkling Sillery, laughed softly at the gay sallies going on around her,
                     and watched Lord Dynely, her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">vis-à-vis</foreign>, with
                     a mocking smile in the languid depths of her topaz eyes. He sat, like herself,
                     almost entirely tirely silent through all the bright badinage going on around
                     him, his brows bent moodily, drinking much more than he ate—a sort of "marble
                     guest" amid the lights, the laughter, the feasting and the flowers.</p>
                  <p>Terry's sudden coming had completely upset him. Something in Terry's eyes
                     roused him angrily and aggressively. What business had the fellow here? What
                     business in Paris at all? Through the unholy glitter, his wife's face rose
                     before him as he had left her hours ago, pale, patient, pathetic. The tiny knot
                     of roses she had given him gleamed still amid the blackness of Felicia's
                     hair—Felicia, who, lying back, eating an apricot, seemed wholly engrossed by
                     her conversation with Dennison. The broad band of gold and diamonds on her
                     perfect arm blazed in the light. Only yesterday he had given it to her, and now
                     she had neither eyes nor ears for any one but this overgrown, malapropos
                     dragoon.</p>
                  <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Mon ami</foreign>," Felicia said to him, with a
                     malicious laugh, as they arose to return to the drawing-room, "you remind one
                     of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tête de mort</foreign> of the Egyptians—wasn't
                     it the Egyptians who always had a death's head at their feasts as a sort of
                        <foreign xml:lang="LAT">memento mori?</foreign>—and the rôle of death's-head
                     does not become blonde men. For a gentleman whose honeymoon has not well ended,
                     that face speaks but illy of postnuptial joys."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, let him alone, madame!" cried Cecil Rossart, a tall, pretty, English
                     singer, with a rippling laugh. "You know what the poet says—what Byron says: <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">

                  <p>"If late hours involve curtain lectures," cried Adele Desbarats, shrilly,
                     "then, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ma foi!</foreign> milor should be well used to
                     them by this. To my certain knowledge, he has not been home before three in the
                     morning for the last two weeks."</p>
                  <p>"Let us hope my lady amuses herself well in his absence<pb n="300-301"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000149"/> sence!" exclaimed Miss Rossart, flinging herself
                     into a Louis Quatorze fauteuil, and rolling up a cigarette with white, slim
                     fingers—"no difficult thing in our beloved Paris."</p>
                  <p>Eric glanced from one to the other at each ill-timed jest, his blue eyes
                     literally lurid with rage. Dennison's face darkened, too, so suddenly and
                     ominously, that Felicia, not without tact, saw it, and changed the subject at
                     once.</p>
                  <p>"Sing for us, Adele," she cried imperiously, lying luxuriously back in her
                     favorite dormeuse. "Mr. Dennison has not heard you yet. Have you heard
                     Mademoiselle Desbarats, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ami?</foreign>"</p>
                  <p>"I have not had that pleasure, madame."</p>
                  <p>The vivacious little brunette went over at once to the open piano, and began to
                     sing. The others dispersed themselves to smoke and play bezique. Madame's rooms
                     were Liberty Hall itself. Lord Dynely leaned moodily across the piano, a deep,
                     angry flush, partly of wine, partly of jealousy, partly of rage at Dennison,
                     partly of a vague, remorseful anger at himself, filled him. For Terry, madame
                     cleared away her billowy tulle and laces, and made room for him beside her,
                     with her own enchanting smile.</p>
                  <p>Immediately above the piano—immediately opposite where they sat, a picture
                     hung, the broad yellow glare of light falling full upon it. It was the picture
                     that had created the furore last May in the Academy. "How the Night Fell."</p>
                  <p>"I have always had a fancy, madame," Terry said, doubling his hand and looking
                     through it at the painting, "that the woman in that picture is excessively like
                     you. I never saw you with such an expression as that—I trust I never may; still
                     the likeness is there—and a very strong one too, Do you not see it
                     yourself?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes. I see it," madame answered, with a slow, sleepy smile.</p>
                  <p>"It's odd too, for Locksley—Caryll I mean—never saw you. I asked him myself. He
                     had a dislike to theatre-going it seemed, and never went near the Bijou."</p>
                  <p>The slow, sleepy smile deepened in madame's black eyes, as they fixed
                     themselves dreamily on the picture.</p>
                  <p>"He never went to the Bijou—never saw me there? You are sure of that?"</p>
                  <p>"Quite sure. Told me so himself."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! well, his dislike for theatres and actresses is natural enough, I suppose,
                     considering his past unlucky experience. Quite a romance that story of his; is
                     it not? Is she alive still?"</p>
                  <p>"No," Terry answered gravely, "dead for many years. Killed in a railway
                     accident in Canada, ages ago."</p>
                  <p>The sleepy smile has spread to madame's lips. She flutters her fan of pearl and
                     marabout with slim jewelled fingers.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Locksley—I mean Caryll—promised me a companion picture to this. I suppose
                     I may give up all hope of that now. I really should like to make his
                     acquaintance; I have a weakness for clever people—painters, poets, authors—not
                     being in the least clever myself, you understand. No, I don't want a
                     compliment—there is no particular genius in being a good dancer. For the rest,"
                     with a faint laugh, "my face is my fortune. Where is Gordon Caryll now?"</p>
                  <p>She speaks the name as though it were very familiar to her—with an
                     undertone—Terry hears but does not comprehend.</p>
                  <p>"In Rome, with his mother."</p>
                  <p>"Does he ever come to Paris?"</p>
                  <p>"He is expected here almost immediately, I believe."</p>
                  <p>"Ah!" she laughs. "Well, when he comes, Monsieur Dennison, fetch him some night
                     to see me. Will you?"</p>
                  <p>"If he will come. And when he hears you have wished it, I am quite sure he
                     will," says Terry.</p>
                  <p>There is a pause. Madame's eyes are fixed, as if fascinated, on the picture
                     beyond.</p>
                  <p>"I presume, after Mr. Caryll's first unlucky matrimonial venture, he will
                     hardly thrust his head into the lion's jaw again. I have heard a rumor—but I
                     can hardly credit it—that he is to be married again next May."</p>
                  <p>"It is quite true."</p>
                  <p>"To a great heiress—to that extremely handsome Miss Forrester I saw so often
                     with you last season in the park?"</p>
                  <pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6444-00000150"/>
                  <p>Terry bows. He does not relish France's name on Madame Felicia's lips.</p>
                  <p>"It is a love-match, I suppose?"</p>
                  <p>"A love-match, madame."</p>
                  <p>She tears to pieces a rose she holds, watching the scented leaves as they
                     flutter and fall.</p>
                  <p>"But there is a great disparity of years. She nineteen, he almost forty. I
                     wonder"—she says this suddenly, flashing the light of the yellow-black eyes
                     electrically upon him—"if the first unlucky Mrs. Caryll were <emph>not</emph>
                     dead, only divorced—if Miss Forrester would still marry him?"</p>
                  <p>"I am quite sure she would not," Dennison responds; "but there is no use
                     speaking of that. The woman is dead—dead as Queen Anne—was killed in a railway
                     accident, as I say, and a very lucky thing too for all concerned."</p>
                  <p>There is a flash, swift and furious, from the black eyes, but Terry does not
                     see it. The ringed hands close over the pretty fan she holds with so savage a
                     clasp that the delicate sticks snap.</p>
                  <p>"See what I have done!" she laughs, holding it up; "and Lord Dynely was good
                     enough to give it to me only yesterday. Well—it has had its day—he must be
                     content." She flings the broken toy ruthlessly away, and looks up at her
                     companion once more. "Does Miss Forrester accompany Mr. Caryll to Paris in this
                     expected visit?"</p>
                  <p>"They all come together—his mother, Lady Dynely (the dowager Lady Dynely I
                     mean), Miss Forrester and Mr. Caryll," Terry answers, uneasily, longing to
                     change the subject but hardly knowing how.</p>
                  <p>She smiles a satisfied kind of smile and is silent. Her eyes rest on Lord
                     Dynely's moody, sullen face, as he stands by the piano, heedless of the song
                     and the singer, and she laughs.</p>
                  <p>"Your coming seems to have had a depressing effect upon your kinsman. By the
                     bye, he <emph>is</emph> your kinsman, is he not? He was in the wildest of wild
                     high spirits before you entered. Is this romantic Mr. Caryll not a relative
                     also?"</p>
                  <p>"A second cousin. You do Gordon Caryll the honor of being interested in him,
                     madame," Terry says brusquely.</p>
                  <p>Madame laughs again and shrugs her smooth shoulders.</p>
                  <p>"And you are sick of the subject! Yes, he interests me—one so seldom meets a
                     man with a story nowadays—men who have ever, at any period of their existence,
                     done the 'all for love, and the world-well-lost' business. Shall we not call
                     over poor Lord Dynely and comfort him a little? He looks as though he needed
                     it. <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Très cher</foreign>," she looks towards him and
                     raises her voice, "we will make room for you here if you like to come."</p>
                  <p>"I shall make my adieux," Lord Dynely answers shortly. "You are being so well
                     entertained, that it would be a thousand pities to interrupt. It is one
                     o'clock, and quite time to be going. Good-night."</p>
                  <p>He turns abruptly away and leaves them. Again madame laughs, and shrugs her
                     graceful shoulders at this evidence of her power.</p>
                  <p>"What bears you Britons <emph>can</emph> be!" she says; "how sulkily jealous,
                     and how little pains you take to hide it. Why did not your Shakespeare make
                     Othello an Englishman? What, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ami!</foreign>—you
                     going too?"</p>
                  <p>"For an uninvited guest have I not lingered sufficiently long?" Terry answers
                     carelessly, and then he hurriedly makes his farewells, and follows Eric
                     out.</p>
                  <p>He finds him still standing in the vestibule, and lighting a cigar. The night
                     has clouded over, a fine drizzling rain is beginning to fall, but Eric
                     evidently means to walk. The distance to the Hotel du Louvre is not great.</p>
                  <p>"Our way lies together, old boy," Terry says, linking his arm familiarly
                     through Eric's, "so I cut it short and came away."</p>
                  <p>"What an awful cut, for Felicia," Eric retorts, with an angry sneer. "Let me
                     congratulate you, Terry, on your evident success; I never knew before that you
                     went in for that sort of thing."</p>
                  <p>"If by going in for that sort of thing, you mean flirtation with danseuses, I
                     don't go in for it," is Terry's reply. "If I did I should certainly choose some
                     one not <emph>quite</emph> old enough to be my mother."</p>
                  <p>"What do you mean?" Dynely asks, savagely.</p>
                  <pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6444-00000151"/>
                  <p>"I mean Felicia, of course—thirty-five if she's a day. Oh, yes, she is—I've
                     heard all about her. She wears well, but she's every hour of it. And the most
                     dangerous woman the sun shines on."</p>
                  <p>"I wonder, then, you fling yourself into the jaws of the lioness," Eric
                     retorts, with another bitter sneer. "You make a martyr of yourself with the
                     best grace possible—make love <foreign xml:lang="ITA">con amore</foreign> as
                     though you enjoyed it, in fact."</p>
                  <p>"I didn't come to see Felicia," Terry says, quietly. "I came to see
                        <emph>you</emph>."</p>
                  <p>Eric's eyes flash fire. He turns to speak, but Dennison stops him.</p>
                  <p>"Wait one moment," he says, in the same quiet, resolute tone. "You are angry,
                     and excited, and jealous. Jealous! faugh! of such a woman as that! Do you know
                     that your infatuation for her—your neglect of your wife—is the talk of
                     Paris—the talk of London?—for in London it reached me."</p>
                  <p>A furious oath is Eric's answer as he wrenches his arm free.</p>
                  <p>"And you came after me as my keeper, as a d—spy!" he cries, hoarse with
                     passion.</p>
                  <p>"I came after you as your friend, as <emph>hers</emph>," Terry answers, his own
                     eyes kindling. "It is early days, Dynely, to neglect your bride—to leave her
                     there, utterly forsaken and alone, to break her heart in solitude, while you
                     fling gifts in the lap, and sit at the feet of a Jezebel like that. I do not
                     set up as your keeper—as any man's—but I will not stand by and see
                        <emph>her</emph> heart-broken, her life blighted, while I can raise my voice
                     to prevent. Eric! if you had seen her as I did, three hours ago, pale, crushed,
                     heart-broken—"</p>
                  <p>"'Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife!' My wise Terry, my virtuous Terry,
                     my pink and pattern of all morality, did you ever hear <emph>that?</emph>
                     You're as much in love with Lady Dynely as you ever were with Crystal Higgins.
                     I only wonder you took the trouble to come. Would it not have been pleasanter
                     to have stayed behind and soothed her sorrows with your pathetic and pious
                     conversation?"</p>
                  <p>Terry looks at him—at the flushed, furious face—at the blue eyes lurid with
                     rage, in wonder—almost in horror.</p>
                  <p>"Good Heaven!" he says, "is <emph>this</emph> Eric? If any other living man had
                     said as much, or half as much, I would have knocked him down. But I see how it
                     is; that devilish sorceress has turned your brain. Well—she has turned stronger
                     brains, but she shall not make an absolute fool of you. Eric! dear old man, I'm
                     not going to quarrel with you, if I can help it. You don't know what you are
                     saying. I promised little Crystal to fetch you home in an hour. It's awfully
                     lonely in that big hotel for her, poor child, and she was never used to being
                     alone, you know."</p>
                  <p>His voice softened. "Ah, poor little Crystal!" he thinks, with a great
                     heart-pang, "if your married life begins like this, how in Heaven's name will
                     it end!"</p>
                  <p>"So!" Eric says between his set teeth, "<emph>she</emph> sent you after me, did
                     she?—a naughty little boy to be brought home and whipped! Perhaps she also told
                     you where to find me?"</p>
                  <p>"She told me nothing—nothing, Eric, and you know it," Terry answers, sternly.
                     "Is it likely she would discuss her husband with any one? It wasn't difficult
                     to find you. The very street gamins could have told me, I fancy, so well is
                     your new infatuation known, Eric, old fellow, we have been like brothers in the
                     past, don't let us quarrel now. Keep clear of that woman—she's
                     dangerous—awfully dangerous, I tell you. She has ruined the lives of a score of
                     men—don't let her ruin yours. Don't let her break Crystal's heart—Crystal,
                     whose whole life is bound up in yours. Pity <emph>her</emph>, Eric—poor little
                     soul—if you have none for yourself."</p>
                  <p>Again Eric laughs harshly and long.</p>
                  <p>"Hear him, ye gods! Terry Dennison in the rôle of parson! Is your sermon quite
                     finished, old boy?—because here we are. Or is this but a prelude to a few more
                     to come? How well the patronizing elder-brother tone comes from you—you, of all
                     men—the dependant of my mother's bounty. <emph>She</emph> comes to Paris next
                     week—what fine stories you will have to tell her—what eloquent lectures you can
                     prepare together. Let me tell you this, once and for all, Dennison," he says,
                     white with anger, his blue eyes<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6444-00000152"/>
                     aflame—"I'll have no sneaking or spying on my actions—I'll be taken to task by
                     no man alive, least of all by <emph>you!</emph> Let there be an end of this at
                     once and forever, or by—you'll repent it!"</p>
                  <p>Then he turns, dashes up the wide stairway, and Terry is alone.</p>

                  <p>TERRY stands for a while irresolute. One by one the clocks of the great city
                     chime out the hour after midnight; a few belated pedestrians, a few fiacres fly
                     past. Even Paris is settling itself for its night's sleep, but Dennison has no
                     thought of sleeping. It is of no use mounting to his cock-loft under the eaves
                     in his present disturbed state of mind—sleep and he will be strangers for hours
                     to come. Eric has robbed him of more than one night's rest since last
                     September—since that eventful day of the Lincolnshire picnic, when all that was
                     brightest and sweetest in his life went out of it forever. Well, so that he had
                     been true, so that he made her happy, Terry could have borne his pain with
                     patient heroism to the end; but to-night, the old, half-healed pang comes back
                     sharp and bitter as ever. Only six weeks a bride—six weeks, and neglected,
                     outraged already—his brief, hot fancy dust and ashes—Felicia, the actress,
                     preferred before Crystal, the wife.</p>
                  <p>"He's a villain," Terry thought, savagely; "he's worse than a villain—he's a
                     fool! Yes, by Jove! as they say over here, a fool of the fourth story."</p>
                  <p>He glanced up at the window where four hours ago Crystal had wistfully sat.
                     Lights still burned there. Was Eric taking her to task for what <emph>he</emph>
                     had done—little Crystal, to whom no one ever spoke a harsh word! He could not
                     stand there with the thought in his mind—he turned, and without knowing or
                     caring whither, made his way through the now almost silent city streets.</p>
                  <p>The drizzling rain that had begun to fall at midnight was falling still, not
                     heavily, but with a small, soaking persistence<pb n="308-309"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000153"/> ence, that showed it meant to keep it up until
                     morning. Smoking as he went, his hands thrust deep into the pockets of his
                     overcoat, Dennison strolled on and on, quite heedless where he went, or how
                     far. His thoughts were still with Crystal—what should he do for her? how help
                     her? It was useless, worse than useless to remonstrate with Eric—no one knew
                     better than Terry how hopelessly and utterly obstinate opposition made him. If
                     he could only induce him to quit Paris. His mother was coming; but Terry knew
                     how little influence his mother had over him where the gratification of his own
                     fancy was concerned. For Eric himself it did not so much matter—he could afford
                     to spend a few thousands in bracelets and bouquets for the dark-eyed dancer,
                     until his feverish fancy burned itself out as so many scores of other feverish
                     fancies had done; it was Crystal who was to be considered—Crystal, who lived
                     but in his love, who drooped already like a broken lily—whose heart he was
                     breaking as thoughtlessly and as surely as ever careless child broke the toy of
                     which it had wearied.</p>
                  <p>"I'll speak to Felicia herself," Terry thought, with a last desperate impulse;
                     "she can't be <emph>all</emph> bad—no one is, they say, and I have heard
                     stories of her lavish generosity to the poor, and all that. Even so insatiable
                     a coquette as she is may spare one victim. I'll go to her to-morrow and tell
                     her how it is, tell her of the poor little girl-wife he neglects for her, and
                     ask her to shut the door in his face. She told me once, I remember, after that
                     runaway scrape, to ask any favor I chose, 'though it were half her kingdom,'
                     and I should have it. I never wanted anything of her before—let's see if she
                     will keep her promise to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>The idea was a relief. His train of thought broke—much thinking was not in
                     Terry's line—he paused suddenly and looked about him. For the first time he
                     became aware that he had lost his way, that the night was advancing, that it
                     was black, chill and rainy, and that the sooner he retraced his steps the
                     better. As he turned, a cry, faint and far off, reached his ear—a cry of pain
                     or fear—then another, then another. It was a woman's voice, a woman in trouble.
                     Instantly Terry plunged in the direction, running full speed. The cry was
                     repeated, nearer this time—a shrill, sharp cry of affright. He made for the
                     sound, turned a corner, and found himself in a narrow, dark street, high houses
                     frowning on either hand, and a woman, flying, panting, and crying out, with two
                     men in hot pursuit.</p>
                  <p>"Hallo!" Dennison cried, sending his strong, hearty, English voice through the
                     empty, silent street, "what the deuce is to pay here?"</p>
                  <p>With a shrill scream of delight the flying figure made for him and clutched his
                     arm, panting for breath.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, sir, you are English," she gasped, in that language; "save me from those
                     horrid men!"</p>
                  <p>Terry passed his right arm around her. One of the men, a beetle-browed,
                     black-bearded Frenchman, came insolently up, and without further parley Mr.
                     Dennison shot out his left in the most scientific manner, and laid him on the
                     pavement. His companion paused a second to see his fellow's fate, and then
                     precipitately fled.</p>
                  <p>"And unless we want the gendarmes to come up and march us to the station, we
                     had better follow his example, I think," said Mr. Dennison to his fair
                     friend.</p>
                  <p>He looked down as he spoke with some curiosity. An Englishwoman alone and
                     belated at this hour, in the streets of Paris, was a curiosity. The light of a
                     street lamp fell full upon her. A woman! why, she was a child, or little
                     better, a small, dark, elfish-looking object, with two wild black eyes set in a
                     minute white face, and a dishevelled cloud of black hair, falling all wet and
                     disordered over her shoulders.</p>
                  <p>"Who are you?" was Dennison's first astounded question.</p>
                  <p>The wild black eyes lifted themselves to his face—two small hands clutched his
                     arm tightly. Where had he seen eyes like those before?</p>
                  <p>"Oh, sir! don't leave me, please! I am so afraid! it is so late."</p>
                  <p>"Late! Egad, I should think so. Rather late for a little girl to be wandering
                     the streets of any city, French or English. You <emph>are</emph> a little girl,
                     aren't you?" doubtfully.</p>
                  <p>"I am sixteen years and six months—and I didn't want<pb n="310-311"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000154"/> to wander the streets. I lost my way," was the
                     answer, somewhat angrily given.</p>
                  <p>"Who are you?"</p>
                  <p>"I am Gordon Kennedy."</p>
                  <p>"And how do you come to have lost your way, if I may ask, Miss Gordon
                     Kennedy?"</p>
                  <p>The big black eyes lifted themselves again to his face in solemn, searching
                     scrutiny. Evidently the gaze was reassuring; she drew a long breath of relief
                     and clung confidently to his arm. But again Terry was
                        nonplussed—<emph>where</emph> had he seen some one like this before?</p>
                  <p>"I came from Scotland—from Glasgow," the girl answered, with a certain
                     old-womanish precision. "I came in search of a person residing in Paris. I
                     reached here in the train to-night. I have very little money, hardly any, and I
                     was foolish enough to try and find the person I wanted on foot, instead of in a
                     cab. I lost my way naturally; and I know so little French, and speak it so
                     badly that I could not make myself understood. I did not know what to do; I
                     wandered on and on; it grew dreadfully late; I thought I would stay in a church
                     porch until morning out of the rain. While I was looking about for one, those
                     two dreadful men followed and spoke to me. I ran away and they pursued. I
                     screamed for help and you came. And I am very, very much obliged to you, sir,"
                     concluded Miss Gordon Kennedy, with another solemn, upward, grateful glance of
                     the lustrous eyes.</p>
                  <p>"And how do you know whether I am any better than the two men you fled from?"
                     Terry asked, with a half-laugh.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, sir, you are English, and you have a good face. I am not afraid of
                        <emph>you</emph>," the girl answered, with a second profound sigh of
                     relief.</p>
                  <p>"Thank you," Terry said, still laughing; "it is the highest compliment ever
                     paid me in my life. Well, Miss Kennedy, it is getting on for two o'clock, and
                     is raining, as you see. Shall I look you up a convenient church porch, or what
                     shall I do with you? Even a church porch in Paris on a wet night is not
                     altogether a desirable lodging for a young lady of sixteen. Where shall I take
                     you?"</p>
                  <p>"I don't know," the girl answered, with an air of anxious distress. "If it were
                     not so late, so dreadfully late, I might try to find <emph>her</emph>. Tell me,
                     sir, are all the theatres closed yet?"</p>
                  <p>"Closed two hours ago. You don't think of exchanging the church porch for a
                     theatre, do you, mam'selle?"</p>
                  <p>"Don't laugh at me," she returned, with a sudden flash of the black eyes;
                     "there's nothing to laugh at. I want to find a person who belongs to a
                     theatre—a lady, an actress. She plays at the Varieties."</p>
                  <p>"At the Varieties?" Terry repeated, a little startled. The flashing black eyes
                     had once more discomfited him by their resemblance to other eyes he had
                     somewhere seen. "I know some of the ladies who play at the Varieties. May I ask
                     what is her name?"</p>
                  <p>"It is Madame Felicia."</p>
                  <p>They were walking swiftly along through the rain. At these words Dennison
                     suddenly stood still. The girl looked up at him in surprise. Again, by the
                     glare of the street lamps, that strange, striking resemblance flashed upon him.
                     Madame Felicia! Why, this child was sufficiently like Madame Felicia to be her
                     own daughter. Well—Terry suppressed a whistle, and still stared blankly down at
                     his little companion.</p>
                  <p>"Well," she cried, impatiently, "what is it?—Why do you look at me so? Have I
                     said anything strange? Do you know," with a sudden glow of hope, "Madame
                     Felicia?"</p>
                  <p>"Come on," was Terry's answer; "you'll get your death standing here in the
                     rain. Do I know Madame Felicia? Well—a little. Do you know her?"</p>
                  <p>"No."</p>
                  <p>"You don't! Then, why—if I may ask—"</p>
                  <p>The dark eyes look up at him again with another petulant flash.</p>
                  <p>"No, you may not ask! I can't tell you. I want to find Madame Felicia—the
                     actress who plays at the Varieties. That is all I intend to tell you. I have
                     come all the way from Glasgow alone to find her. I <emph>must</emph> find
                     her—to-night, if possible. She is the only friend I have in the world. Oh, sir,
                     you have been very good to me. You have done me a<pb n="312-313"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000155"/> great service—I know you have a kind heart; take
                     pity on me and, if you know her, take me to her."</p>
                  <p>"Does she expect you?" Terry asked, staggered.</p>
                  <p>"No, sir, she does not; but all the same she will take care of me."</p>
                  <p>"You are quite sure of that?"</p>
                  <p>"Quite sure, sir."</p>
                  <p>"Have you ever met Madame Felicia?"</p>
                  <p>"Never to remember her, but I know what she is like. It is a great many years
                     since she came to see me. We lived in Canada then."</p>
                  <p>"We—whom?"</p>
                  <p>"Joan and me. Joan is my foster-mother, and she is dead. But I have no right to
                     tell you this. I <emph>won't</emph> tell you!" with a child's impatient
                     petulance again.</p>
                  <p>"You speak of Madame Felicia visiting you in Canada," Terry went on, taking no
                     notice of the brief outbreak of anger; "you must make a mistake, mademoiselle.
                     The Madame Felicia I know was never in Canada in her life."</p>
                  <p>"Look here!" cried the girl, excitedly. She disengaged her arm, and produced a
                     photograph from the pocket of her dress. "Look at this! Is your Madame Felicia
                     anything like this?"</p>
                  <p>They pause again—again beneath a street lamp—and he looks at the picture.
                     Madame Felicia, sure enough—to the life—a softly tinted, perfect likeness.</p>
                  <p>"Well?" the girl impatiently demands. He hands it back and looks at her with
                     strongest curiosity.</p>
                  <p>"That is my Madame Felicia. There is but one such face as that on earth. And, I
                     repeat again, she never was in Canada."</p>
                  <p>"And I repeat she <emph>was!</emph>" she flashed out angrily. "Why do you
                     contradict me? I know better! It is very impolite! She <emph>was</emph> in
                     Canada! she was! she was! She lived there—I was born there—"</p>
                  <p>She paused. In her excited vehemence she had betrayed herself. She clasped her
                     hands and looked up at him wildly.</p>
                  <p>"I—I—didn't mean that!" she gasped. "I—I—didn't mean anything!"</p>
                  <p>"No, of course not," Dennison responded, unable to repress a smile. What a
                     child she evidently was, what a passionate, excitable, wilful child!</p>
                  <p>"Oh, take me to her!" she cried, with a sort of sob. "It is so late, so cold,
                     so wet! I never was out at this time of night with a strange man before. What
                     would Joan say? Ah, poor Joan!"</p>
                  <p>She sighed bitterly and clung to him, looking about at the unfamiliar scene,
                     her eyes dusk with bewilderment and terror.</p>
                  <p>"Joan was your mother?" Terry insinuated; "no, by the bye, your
                     foster-mother?"</p>
                  <p>"It does not matter to you what she was!" retorts Miss Kennedy, with a sudden
                     return to sharpness. "Will you take me to Madame Felicia, or will you
                     not?—there!"</p>
                  <p>"My dear child, Madame Felicia will be in bed."</p>
                  <p>"She will get up when she hears who I am. Oh! please take me to her house—only
                     to her house. She will let me in. She will take care of me when she hears who I
                     am."</p>
                  <p>"When she hears who you are," Terry thought, looking at the dark, passionate,
                     pleading, upturned face—at the large, dilated black eyes. "<emph>She</emph> was
                     in Canada, and you were born there! There is a story in the past, then, that
                     madame keeps as a sealed book. I always thought so—I always thought there was
                     more in her hatred of America than met the eye."</p>
                  <p>"Will you take me to her—say?" cried the girl, giving his arm an angry,
                     impatient shake, "or are you a wicked man after all, like the Frenchman you
                     knocked down?"</p>
                  <p>"A wicked man?" Terry repeated, laughing, and with a sort of pity in his face
                     for this unsophisticated child. "My dear little girl, no. I am the incarnation
                     of every domestic and Christian virtue, and I will take you to Madame Felicia
                     instanter. We are near her house now—I only hope she will take you in. If she
                     will not, some one else shall. Gracious powers!" he thought, "if this outspoken
                     child had fallen into other hands."</p>
                  <p>The girl drew a long breath, and gave the arm she had so lately shaken a
                     little, grateful squeeze.</p>
                  <pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6444-00000156"/>
                  <p>"You <emph>are</emph> good. I am sorry I was so cross with you, but I hate to
                     be contradicted. She will take care of me; don't you be afraid, and she will
                     thank you too. What is your name?"</p>
                  <p>"Terry, mademoiselle."</p>
                  <p>"Terry what?"</p>
                  <p>"Terry Dennison; and yours you say is Gordon Kennedy? An odd name for a young
                     lady."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, isn't it? But the Gordon was after my father, and the Kennedy was after
                     Joan. Joan always called me Donny, for short."</p>
                  <p>"The Kennedy was after Joan, was it? That's odd too. Had your father no other
                     name than Gordon? Was that his family name?"</p>
                  <p>"I wish you wouldn't ask so many questions!" was Miss Kennedy's answer, with
                     still another return to sharpness. "It is awfully impolite to ask questions. My
                     name is Gordon Kennedy, and I want to go to Madame Felicia—that's enough for
                     you to know."</p>
                  <p>"I beg your pardon, mademoiselle," Terry said, laughing; "I stand rebuked. I
                     won't offend again. Here we are at Felicia's, and lights are burning yet. Stand
                     here; I will inquire at the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">loge</foreign> if madame is
                     to be seen."</p>
                  <p>He left her and hastened to make inquiries. The household of madame had not yet
                     retired—madame's chasseur, in gorgeous livery, was produced, who in voluble
                     French declared it to be utterly impossible to disarrange madame at that
                     hour.</p>
                  <p>"Call madame's maid," Dennison said, authoritatively; "it's a matter of the
                     utmost importance to madame herself. I will explain to her."</p>
                  <p>The maid was reluctantly summoned. Dennison hastened back to his waiting
                     protégée.</p>
                  <p>"Have you anything—a note, a token to send to madame that will prove your
                     identity? She will not see you else," he explained.</p>
                  <p>The girl produced from her pocket a small sealed packet, and put it confidently
                     in his hand.</p>
                  <p>"Joan gave me that before she died," she said. "She told me to give it to
                     Madame Felicia when I met her. You send it to her, and all will be right."</p>
                  <p>The femme de chambre appeared, sleepy and sulky. Madame could see no one at
                     such an hour. Madame had already retired—she could not dream of disturbing
                     madame. Monsieur's business must wait until to-morrow. Monsieur cut short the
                     flow of French eloquence by slipping a glittering Napoleon in one hand and the
                     packet in the other.</p>
                  <p>"Give madame that, with Mr. Dennison's compliments. Tell her that the young
                     lady—Gordon Kennedy—is here, just arrived from Scotland, and waiting to see
                     her."</p>
                  <p>The Frenchwoman vanished. In silence, Dennison and the young girl stood and
                     waited. How would it end?</p>
                  <p>Would madame receive her? Or would she treat her as an impostor, and send her
                     away? His own pulses quickened a little with the suspense. Five, ten, fifteen
                     minutes, and the maid did not appear.</p>
                  <p>"Are you cold?" Terry asked very gently, as the girl gave an irrepressible
                     shiver from head to foot.</p>
                  <p>She looked at him, with those sombre, spectral dark eyes, so like, yet so
                     unlike Felicia's own.</p>
                  <p>"I am <emph>afraid</emph>," she answered, her teeth chattering. "I don't know!
                     what if she will not receive me after all? She is a great lady—I am so poor, so
                     wretched. She may not want me. Oh, if she does not, what will become of
                     me?"</p>
                  <p>"I will care for you," he answered kindly. "My dear child, don't tremble so.
                     Ah! here comes the woman now."</p>
                  <p>The maid returned, curiosity painted on every feature of her face.</p>
                  <p>"Madame would see mademoiselle. Mademoiselle was to come to madame at
                     once."</p>
                  <p>With a little cry of joy the girl sprang forward.</p>
                  <p>"I knew she would! I knew she would!" she said, with a sob. Then she reached
                     out both hands to Dennison. "You were so good! I will never forget you—never! I
                     thank you with all my heart!"</p>
                  <p>He pressed the little cold hands kindly, and watched her out of sight. Then he
                     started at a rapid pace for his hotel.</p>
                  <pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6444-00000157"/>
                  <p>"So!" he thought; "an odd adventure, surely! I seem destined to be mixed up in
                     Madame Felicia's affairs. Will she be grateful, or the reverse, for this
                     night's work, I wonder? That girl's maternity is written in her face—although,
                     of course, she might be Felicia's sister. I wish I could get a hold upon her of
                     any sort, yes, of any sort, that would make her hear to reason about Dynely.
                     Come what may, I don't care how, <emph>he</emph> must be freed from her
                     thrall."</p>
                  <p>He had reached his hotel. It was past two now. But few lights burned—Eric's
                     rooms were in darkness.</p>
                  <p>Rather fagged, Terry made his way to his own sky-parlor, and soon forgot his
                     first eventful Paris evening in sound, fatigued sleep.</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                  <head type="sub">DONNY.</head>
                  <p>THE departure of Lord Dynely and Dennison was the signal for the departure of
                     the rest of madame's guests. Half an hour later and the lights were fled, the
                     garlands dead, and Felicia was alone in her own pretty, rose-hung, gas-lit
                     drawing-room. She lay back in the soft depths of her fauteuil, a half-smile on
                     her lips, too luxuriously indolent as yet even to make the exertion of
                     retiring. The picture "How the Night Fell" was the object upon which her long,
                     lazy eyes rested, while that well-satisfied smile curled her thin red lips.</p>
                  <p>"So he is coming," she was thinking; "and he is to be married. To be married to
                     France Forrester, one of the very proudest girls in England, as I have heard.
                     She knows all about my story, no doubt. And she thinks, and he thinks, and they
                     all think, I was killed in that railway accident so many years ago. Her mother
                     was a French Canadian; and she is of her mother's religion, so they tell me;
                     and even if her pride would permit, her religion would forbid her to marry a
                     man who is the husband of one living divorced wife. And this, then, is the form
                     my vengeance is to take after all. I have wondered so often, so often—it seemed
                     so impossible my ever being able to reach him, my ever being able to make him
                     suffer one tithe of what he has made me. But, 'I have him on the hip' now.
                     Through his love for this girl I will stab him to the heart. I will part them
                     and stand between them—ay, even if I have to make my history patent to the
                     world. If I have to confess to Di Venturini, to whom I have lied so long. I
                     will prevent <emph>his</emph> marriage if I have to do it by the forfeit of my
                     own."</p>
                  <p>She paused a moment to roll up and light a rose-scented cigarette, her face
                     clouding a little at her own thoughts.</p>
                  <pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6444-00000158"/>
                  <p>"It will be a sacrifice too, if I <emph>should</emph> have to make things
                     public, to confess to the prince. He knows nothing of my past life, except the
                     pretty little romance I invented for his benefit. At my worst he believes me to
                     be an outrageous coquette with more head than heart, not in the least likely to
                     be led astray by the tender passion, and with no false pride to stand in the
                     way of my accepting costly presents. Indeed, in the very fishy state of the
                     prince's own exchequer since I have known him, the diamond bracelets, etcetra,
                     were not at all obnoxious in his sight." She lifted her dusk, lovely arm, and
                     looked with glittering eyes at the broad band of yellow gold, ablaze with
                     brilliants. "What a fool that boy lordling is!" she thought, contemptuously;
                     "so great a fool that there is really no credit in twisting him round one's
                     finger. And he has a bride of six weeks' standing, they tell me—neglected and
                     alone for <emph>me</emph>—at the Louvre. Ah! these brides!" with a soft laugh.
                     "She is not the first whose bridegroom has left her to spend the honeymoon at
                     my feet. He is a relative of Caryll's, too. Will his neglect of her, and
                     besotted admiration of me, be another dagger to help stab him? If there were no
                     bracelets in question I think that motive would be strong enough to make me
                     hold fast."</p>
                  <p>She flung away her cigarette and began abruptly drawing off the many rich rings
                     with which her fingers were loaded. On the third finger of the left hand, one—a
                     plain band of gold, worn thin by time—alone remained—the only one she did not
                     remove. She lifted her pretty, dimpled brown hand, and gazed at it darkly.</p>
                  <p>"I wonder why I have worn you all this time?" she mused. "My wedding ring! that
                     for sixteen years has meant nothing—less than nothing. And yet by day and by
                     night, I have worn you in memory of that dead time—of that brief five months,
                     when I was so happy, as I have never, in the hours of my greatest triumph, been
                     happy since. Di Venturini says it is not in me to love. He is in love, poor
                     little old idiot! If he could have seen me then!"</p>
                  <p>Her hands fell heavily in her lap, she sighed drearily.</p>
                  <p>"How happy I was! how I did love that man! what a good woman I might have been
                     if he would have but forgiven and trusted me. But he spurned me, he drove me to
                     desperation, to death nearly. What did he care? I vowed my turn would come—for
                     sixteen years I have waited, and it has not. But the longest lane has its
                     turning, and my hour is now."</p>
                  <p>She arose and walked up and down, her floating muslin and laces sweeping behind
                     her. Once she paused before the picture, leaning over the back of a chair, and
                     looking up at it with a curious smile.</p>
                  <p>"What an agonized face he has painted," she said softly; "what anguish and
                     despair in those wild eyes. Did I really look like that, I wonder? and what was
                     there in him that I should wear that tortured face for his loss. Good Heaven!
                     if it comes to that, what is there in any man that women should go mad for
                     their loss or gain—selfish, reckless fools, one and all! Even he is ready to
                     paint his own folly and madness of the past, to make money of it in the
                     present."</p>
                  <p>She turned away with an impatient, scornful last glance and slowly left the
                     room. Up in her own chamber, she rang for her maid, and with a yawn resigned
                     herself into her hands for the night.</p>
                  <p>"If I can only make it all right with the prince," she mused, as the
                     Frenchwoman brushed out her thick, black hair. "I don't want to lose him,
                     particularly now, as he has come to his own again. Madame la Princesse Di
                     Venturini! My faith! a rise in life for the little beggarly singer of the New
                     York concert hall, for poor old Major Lovell's accomplice, for Gordon Caryll's
                     cast-off wife. No, I must not lose the prize if I can, and he is most horribly
                     jealous. Let the truth reach him—that I have had a husband, that I have a
                     daughter, and much as he is infatuated, I really and truly believe he will
                     throw me over."</p>
                  <p>Her thoughts wandered off into another channel, suggested by the incidental
                     remembrance of her daughter.</p>
                  <p>"What shall I do with the girl?" she thought, "now that Joan is dead, and
                     Joan's boor of a husband does not want her. He will be sending her to me one of
                     these days<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6444-00000159"/> if I do not take care. I
                     must answer his insolent letter tomorrow, and tell him at all risks to keep her
                     from coming here. From what Joan has written of her, I believe her to be quite
                     capable of it."</p>
                  <p>Madame's <foreign xml:lang="FRA">toilette de nuit</foreign> was by this time
                     complete. The maid had departed, and madame was in the very act of depositing
                     her loveliness between the lace and linen of the rose-curtained bed, when the
                     woman suddenly and excitedly reappeared, the packet in her hand. In a dozen
                     voluble sentences she related the cause of the disturbance.</p>
                  <p>"A tall, blond English monsieur—Deens-yong—it was impossible to pronounce the
                     name, but one of the English gentlemen who had been present this evening, and a
                     young lady with him, who insisted upon seeing madame, and Monsieur Deens-yong,
                     with his compliments, had sent madame this."</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Dennison," madame repeated, aghast, "and a young lady." She looked at the
                     superscription and turned white. "Mon Dieu!" she thought, in horror, "Joan's
                     writing! Can it be possible <emph>she</emph> is here?"</p>
                  <p>It was quite possible—the contents of the little packet left no doubt. It was a
                     rare thing for madame to turn pale, but the dusk complexion faded to a sickly
                     white by the time she had finished the letter.</p>
                  <p>"I will see this young person, Pauline, mon enfant," she said carelessly,
                     feeling the needle-like eyes of the waiting woman on her. "Show her up here at
                     once, and wait until I ring; I may need you."</p>
                  <p>The woman departed, marvelling much. And Felicia, throwing a dressing-gown over
                     her night robe, and thrusting her feet into slippers, sat down to await the
                     advent of her daughter.</p>
                  <p>It was two o'clock—what an hour to come, and with Terry Dennison, of all men.
                     What did it mean? How did the girl come to be in Paris at all, and what should
                     she do with her, now that she was here? She had not seen her for ten years.
                     Although Joan and her husband had removed to Scotland—she had never felt any
                     desire to see her. From what Joan wrote of her, she was a wilful, headstrong,
                     passionate sionate creature, whom love alone could rule, upon whom discipline
                     of any kind was lost, reckless enough if thwarted for any desperate deed. And
                     now she was here. What <emph>should</emph> she do with her? If the truth
                     reached the ears of Di Venturini! No, it must not—at any hazard it must not.
                     She must win the girl over by kindness, by pretence of affection, and, when
                     opportunity offered, get rid of her quietly and forever.</p>
                  <p>And then the door opened, and Pauline ushered her in. For an instant there was
                     silence while mother and daughter looked at each other full. A very striking
                     contrast they made—the mother in her mature and well-preserved beauty, her
                     loose robe of violet silk, her feet in violet velvet slippers, elevated on a
                     hassock, lying indolently back in her chair, the lamplight streaming across her
                     rich dark beauty. The daughter draggled and wet, her black hair disordered, her
                     pale, pinched face bluish white, her great dusk eyes half shy, half
                     defiant.</p>
                  <p>"Come here, child," said the soft silky tones of Felicia.</p>
                  <p>The girl advanced, still with that half-shy, half-defiant air and attitude,
                     ready to be humble or fierce at a moment's notice. Madame stretched forth her
                     hand, drew her to her, and kissed her cold, thin cheek.</p>
                  <p>"You are Gordon Kennedy?"</p>
                  <p>"And <emph>you</emph> are my mother!"</p>
                  <p>She made the answer with a certain defiance still—prepared to fight for her
                     rights to the death.</p>
                  <p>"Hush-h-h!" madame said, with a smile; "<emph>that</emph> is your secret and
                     mine. No one knows it here—no one must know it as yet. My marriage was a secret
                     in the past, is forgotten in the present. I was divorced long ago. But you know
                     all that."</p>
                  <p>"Of course I know; Joan told me everything. Look here."</p>
                  <p>She pushed up her sleeve, and showed on the upper part of her arm the initials
                     "G. C." in India ink.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>You</emph> did that, Joan said," went on the girl still defiantly. "She
                     told me to show it to you, and remind you of the day you sent her away and did
                     it yourself."</p>
                  <p>"I remember very well," Felicia said, still smiling, still<pb n="322-323"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000160"/> holding the girl's cold hand. "My child, how
                     chill you are, how wet. Here, sit down on this hassock and tell me how in the
                     world you come to be in Paris at this unearthly hour, and in charge of Mr.
                     Dennison."</p>
                  <p>Gordon Kennedy obeyed. The defiance was gradually melting out of her face, but
                     there was a visible constraint there still. With straightforward precision she
                     narrated her adventure of the night.</p>
                  <p>"I ran away from Glasgow," she said, boldly. "Joan died, and I hated
                        <emph>him</emph>. He was a brute, and he tried to beat me. I threw a plate
                     at his head and cut one cheek open. It was a horrid gash," said this young
                     virago, with a shudder; "but I didn't care; he <emph>was</emph> a brute; I had
                     to run then, and I came here. I had some money; Joan gave it to me; I have some
                     yet, and might have taken a cab when I got to Paris as well as not, and gone to
                     your theatre, but the streets were so bright and dazzling, the shops so
                     splendid, I thought I would walk. I was a fool for my pains. I don't know what
                     would have happened, only Mr. Dennison came. Ah, I like <emph>him</emph>—he was
                     awfully good."</p>
                  <p>"But surely, surely, child, you did not tell him who you were?" madame cried in
                     horror, as she listened to this out-spoken confession.</p>
                  <p>"I told him nothing," Gordon answered, proudly, "only my name, and where I came
                     from, and how I got lost, and that I wanted to find you. "He said he knew you,
                     and would take me to you, and here I am."</p>
                  <p>"It is the most extraordinary thing I ever heard of," madame said, bewildered;
                     "and you are the most extraordinary child. Surely there is a Providence that
                     watches over children and fools."</p>
                  <p>"I am no child, and I am no fool. I'll thank you not to call me either," cried
                     little spitfire, blazing up.</p>
                  <p>"No, no, certainly not. Why, child, will you be angry with me, your own
                     mother?" madame said, in her sugarest tone.</p>
                  <p>"You don't look very glad to see me, if you are my mother," retorts Miss
                     Kennedy, sulkily.</p>
                  <p>"You have surprised me so much, don't you see, and I don't want it known that
                     you <emph>are</emph> my daughter. It would be a very bad thing for me, and
                     create no end of talk."</p>
                  <p>"You are ashamed of me, I suppose?" the young girl cried. "I knew you would be.
                     You are a fine lady, and I am—yes, look at me. I am a miserable, draggle-tailed
                     object, am I not?"</p>
                  <p>"What a temper you have," madame said, still smiling, still holding her hands.
                     "Don't speak so loudly. I am not in the least ashamed of you. Properly dressed
                     you will be quite like me."</p>
                  <p>The black eyes lit.</p>
                  <p>"Do you think so," eagerly; "Joan always said I was like you, but you are so
                     beautiful, and I am so thin, and black, and pale. You will let me stay with
                     you, then, will you?"</p>
                  <p>"Certainly—that is for the present. I think I shall send you to school. You
                     would like to go to school, would you not, Gordon. By the bye, I would rather
                     not call you that."</p>
                  <p>"Joan called me Donny."</p>
                  <p>"Donny be it, then. I will dress you properly and send you to school, and you
                     are not to say a word—no, not a whisper—about our relationship. You can keep a
                     secret, I think, by your face."</p>
                  <p>"Try me," the girl said, proudly. "I'd die before I'd tell, if I promised
                     not."</p>
                  <p>"And you <emph>do</emph> promise. It would never do for me, Donny, at least not
                     just yet, to acknowledge you. People here do not know I ever was married."</p>
                  <p>"If you wish it—yes, I promise," the girl said, a wistful light in the great
                     eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Then for the present you shall remain here—for a few days, that is. You shall
                     sleep in my dressing-room, and I will tell my maid and the rest that you are my
                     cousin—yes, a cousin from Scotland. And now, as it is late, and have been
                     travelling and are tired, I will see you safely in bed myself."</p>
                  <p>"And may I see <emph>him</emph> again—the gentleman who was so kind to me?" the
                     girl asked, only half satisfied after all.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Dennison? Oh, well—yes—I suppose so. Tell him you are a cousin, and I will
                     indorse your story."</p>
                  <pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6444-00000161"/>
                  <p>"I hate telling lies," Donny muttered, rather sullenly; but madame prudently
                     took no notice. In her own mind she had resolved that long before Prince Di
                     Venturini's return to Paris, this obnoxious daughter should be safely out of
                     sight for good and all.</p>
                  <p>With her own hand she led her to the dressing-room, helped her to arrange the
                     little lace-draped bed there, and saw her safely in it before retiring to her
                     own room.</p>
                  <p>It had been a very unexpected and rather disagreeable ending to a pleasant
                     evening. Contretemps will occur, and must be made the best of. Madame had
                     reached that age when we learn the folly of disturbing ourselves for trifles. A
                     composing draught of wine and spices stood on the table. She rang for her maid,
                     and dismissed her, drank her sleeping potion, and went calmly to bed.</p>

                  <p>IT is twelve o'clock, more or less, by all the clocks and watches of Paris—high
                     noon by the broad brightness which is pouring a flood of golden light through
                     the blue silk curtains, over the glass, and silver, and china of a dainty
                     breakfast-table set for two, over two blonde English heads—Lord and Lady
                     Dynely.</p>
                  <p>They are breakfasting <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tête-à-tête</foreign>, and in
                     profound silence. His lordship hides a very sulky, dissatisfied and conscious
                     face, behind that day's <title>Moniteur</title>. Her ladyship, on the other
                     side of the big shining urn, droops over her teacup, pale as the dainty
                     cashmere robe she wears, with blue eyes that look jaded and dull from want of
                     sleep. She has not slept all night, and it tells upon her not used to "tears o'
                     night instead of slumber." In the garish morning sunshine, the pretty little
                     face looks wofully wan and piteous, poor child, and he sees it; how can he fail
                     to see it, and is in a fine rage with her and with himself in consequence. No
                     words have passed between them concerning last night—no words as yet. That
                     pleasant conjugal debate is still to come. He had found her feigning sleep, the
                     tears undried upon her cheeks, so peachily plump only five weeks ago—then like
                     the heart of a blush rose—now paler than the palest lily. This morning only
                     monosyllables have been exchanged, but the tug of war is to come, and although
                     he dreads it horribly—as he dreads and hates all things unpleasant to his own
                     super-fastidious selfishness—his lordship throws down the paper at last and
                     begins.</p>
                  <p>"I suppose," he says, in a voice he tries not to render harsh, but which
                        <emph>is</emph>. "I suppose you know Dennison came last night? Confounded
                     meddling prig! I suppose you<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC6444-00000162"/> know,
                     or will know, he followed me, and tried to play parson for my benefit. I wonder
                     now I did not knock him down for his impertinence—I will, by Jove, if he tries
                     it again. I hope, Crystal, you did not send him?"</p>
                  <p>She shrinks and shivers away at his tone—at his words. He sees it, and the
                     sting of remorse that follows and tells him he is a brute, hardly tends to add
                     to his good-humor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <emph>Did</emph> you send him?" he angrily repeats.</p>
                  <p>She lifts her eyes for an instant to his irritated face, then drops them,
                     shrinking into herself more and more.</p>
                  <p>"I sent no one," she answers, in a voice so low as to be hardly audible.</p>
                  <p>"Oh," Eric says, in a grumbling tone. "You saw him though. He was here?"</p>
                  <p>"He was here—yes."</p>
                  <p>"How did he know so well where to find me then? I told you I was going to dine
                     with some fellows at the Café de Paris."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, you told me," she repeats, in the same faint voice. Then she looks
                     suddenly up at him and her blue eyes flash. "We went to the theatre, Eric," she
                     says, boldly.</p>
                  <p>"To the—," so astounded is Lord Dynely that the last word fails on his
                     lips.</p>
                  <p>"To the theatre—yes," Crystal goes on quickly and gaspingly. "I wanted to go—it
                     wasn't his fault, poor fellow—I asked him to take me—I made him take me."</p>
                  <p>"And may I ask," says his lordship, with labored politeness, and turning quite
                     white with anger, "which theatre you honored with your preference? <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">Les Italiens</foreign>, no doubt?"</p>
                  <p>"We went to the Varieties. We saw that woman. We saw <emph>you</emph>," she
                     answers in the same gasping tone.</p>
                  <p>His lips set themselves with slow, intense anger—his blue eyes gleam with a
                     dangerous light.</p>
                  <p>"You saw <emph>that</emph> woman! Be more explicit, if you please, Lady Dynely.
                     You saw what woman?"</p>
                  <p>"That actress. That wicked, painted, dancing woman. And we saw you. You threw
                     her the flowers I gave you. She wore them in her hair. And then you were in the
                     box with her—as if—as if—"</p>
                  <p>But Crystal can say no more. At the recollection of his looks as he bent over
                     that woman, she breaks utterly down, covers her face and bursts into passionate
                     weeping.</p>
                  <p>He is white to the lips now—white with an anger that has something quite deadly
                     in it. She is his bride but six weeks, and she sits yonder sobbing her heart
                     out, but he never softens or relents. Who is to gauge for us of the
                     capabilities of evil that are within us? All his life Lord Dynely had been
                     taken by superficial observers for a kind-hearted gentleman, free of hand and
                     large of heart, who would not willingly injure a worm—all his life he had taken
                     himself to be a good natured fellow—tender-hearted, indeed, to a fault; and now
                     he sits watching his wife with a glance that is absolutely murderous. With it
                     all he is so astounded that it is a moment before he can speak.</p>
                  <p>"You did this?" he says at last, in a slow, cruel, suppressed sort of voice.
                     "You played the spy upon me—<emph>you!</emph> You gave your old lover the cue,
                     did you—you dragged him after me to the theatre to spy upon me. You're a fool,
                     Crystal; and, by Heaven, you'll live to repent it!"</p>
                  <p>She gave a gasping cry. He arose from his seat, flung down his paper, and stood
                     before her, white with rage.</p>
                  <p>"It is a thousand pities," he says with a sneer, that for the moment blots out
                     all the fair Greek beauty of his face, "that I did not let you marry Dennison.
                     He's in love with you yet—no doubt your old penchant too is as strong as ever.
                        <emph>It was not his fault, poor fellow</emph>. May I ask where you and Mr.
                     Dennison are going together to-night?"</p>
                  <p>She looks up at him—her eyes all wide and wild, with a bewildered sort of
                     horror. Eric has insulted her—<emph>insulted</emph> her. She tries to speak,
                     but only a gasping sound comes. Something in her eyes—in her face frightens
                     even him, in his blind fury, into remorse and relenting.</p>
                  <p>"Don't look like that," he says with a strident sort of laugh. "I didn't quite
                     mean what I said; but when a man finds his wife running about to theatres in
                     his absence, with her old lover—Well, sir! what do you want?"</p>
                  <p>For a servant has entered with a card upon a salver, and<pb n="328-329"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000163"/> presents it with a bow. Lord Dynely takes it up
                     and utters an exclamation.</p>
                  <p>"Miss France Forrester!" he exclaims. "The plot thickens. <emph>They're</emph>
                     here, too, are they? Where is the lady?" he demands of the man.</p>
                  <p>"In the salon, my lord."</p>
                  <p>"Very well, tell her we will be there in a moment." The man salaams and
                     departs. "Go to your room, Crystal," he says, less harshly; "and, for Heaven's
                     sake try and get rid of that face. You look like a galvanized corpse. You will
                     have them thinking here I adopt the good old British custom of beating my wife.
                     Put on rouge—anything—get your maid to do it, only don't fetch that woe-begone
                     countenance to France Forrester's sharp eyes."</p>
                  <p>With this pleasant and bridegroom like adjuration he leaves her and goes to the
                     salon to receive their guest. He is humming a popular Parisian street song as
                     he goes, a half smile on his lips, all his old sunny debonnaire self once more: <q>

                     </q> he sings as he enters. France sits in a great ruby velvet chair,
                     charmingly dressed, looking fresher, fairer, more brightly, saucily handsome,
                     Eric thinks, than he has ever seen her. "How blessings brighten as they take
                     their flight." <emph>What</emph> did he see in his faded, <foreign

                     brilliant, dark beauty? For my lord's taste has changed, and "black beauties"
                     are decidedly in the ascendant again.</p>
                  <p>"My dear France," he says, holding both her hands, "this is an astounder. We
                     knew you were coming, but not so soon. When did you arrive, and where are you
                     located?"</p>
                  <p>"We arrived late last night, and have apartments in the Faubourg St. Honore,
                     near the British Embassy. And with my usual impetuosity, and my usual disregard
                     of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">les convenances</foreign>, I ran the risk of finding
                     you still asleep, and rushed away immediately after breakfast. You
                        <emph>are</emph> up, I see, for which, oh, be thankful. And now where is
                     Crystal?"</p>
                  <p>"Crystal will be here in a moment. How well you are looking, France," he says,
                     half-regretfully; "being in love must be a great beautifier—better than all
                     Madame Rachel's cosmetics."</p>
                  <p>"Must be!" she laughs; "you don't know from experience then? I can return the
                     compliment—you are looking as if life went well with you— <q>

                     </q> quotes France, after her old fashion; "but then, of course, we are in the

                  <p>Eric laughs, but rather grimly. He is thinking of the honeymoon like <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">tête-à-tête</foreign> her coming ended.</p>
                  <p>"And how are they all?" he inquires—"the Madre and Mrs. Caryll? Mrs. Caryll is

                  <p>"Grandmamma is here—yes. And better than you ever saw her. And your mother is
                     well and dying to see you, and how matrimony agrees with you. Do you know,
                     Eric," laughing, "I can't fancy you in the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >rôle</foreign> of Benedick the married man."</p>
                  <p>He laughs too, but it is not a very mirthful laugh.</p>
                  <p>"Caryll is with you?" he says, keeping wide of his own conjugal bliss; "Of
                     course he is, though—lucky fellow! I needn't ask if <emph>he</emph> is
                     well?"</p>
                  <p>"You need not, indeed," France says, and into her face a lovely rose light
                     comes; "but you will soon see for yourself—they will all call later. What does
                     keep Crystal—I hope she is not so silly as to stay and make an elaborate toilet
                     for me?"</p>
                  <p>"No, no—she will be down in a moment. She has a headache—is rather seedy this
                     morning—late hours and dissipation will tell on rustic beauty, you know. By the
                     bye, apropos of nothing, do you know Terry Dennison is here—<pb n="330-331"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000164"/> at this hotel? We are quite a family party, you
                     see," he laughs again rather grimly.</p>
                  <p>"Terry here! dear old Terry! how glad I shall be to see him. When did he get
                     over?"</p>
                  <p>"Last night also. It appears to have been a night of arrivals. Ah, here is
                     Crystal now."</p>
                  <p>He looks rather anxiously as he says it. He knows of old how keen Miss
                     Forrester's hazel eyes are—he feels that she has already perceived something to
                     be wrong. That she has heard nothing he is quite sure. Her manner would
                     certainly not be so frankly natural and cordial if one whisper of the truth had
                     reached her.</p>
                  <p>Crystal has done her best. She has exchanged her white wrapper for a pink one
                     that lends a faint, fictitious glow to her face. The suggestion about rouge she
                     has not adopted—rouge, Crystal looks upon as a device of the evil one.
                     Something almost akin to gladness lights her sad eyes as she comes forward and
                     into France's wide, open arms.</p>
                  <p>"My dear Lady Dynely! My dear little Crystal!" and then France stops and sends
                     her quick glance from her face to Eric's, and reads trouble without a second
                     look. She is honestly shocked, and takes no pains to hide it.</p>
                  <p>Eric winces. <emph>Has</emph> Crystal so greatly changed then for the worse?
                     All his selfish, unreasoning anger stirs again within him.</p>
                  <p>"You have been ill?" she says, blankly. "You—you look wretchedly."</p>
                  <p>"I told you she had a headache," Eric interrupts, irritably. "I told you late
                     hours and Paris dissipation will tell upon rustic beauty. There is noting the
                     matter. Open your lips, oh, silent Crystal! and reassure Miss Forrester."</p>
                  <p>"I am quite well, thank you," Crystal says, but no effort can make the words
                     other than faint and mournful. Then she sits down with her face from the light,
                     and leans back in her great carved and gilded chair, looking so small, and
                     fragile, and childish, and colorless that a great compassion for her, and a
                     great, vague wrath against him, fills France's heart. She does not know what he
                     has done, but she knows he has done something, and is wroth accordingly. Why,
                     the child has gone to a shadow—looks utterly crushed and heartbroken. Is he
                     tired of her already?—is he—but no, <emph>that</emph> is too bad to think even
                     of fickle Eric—he cannot be neglecting her for a rival.</p>
                  <p>Her cordial manner changes at once—a constraint has fallen upon them. All
                     Eric's attempts at badinage, at society small talk, fall flat. He rises at
                     last, looks at his watch, pleads an engagement, and prepares to go.</p>
                  <p>"I know you and Crystal are dying to compare notes," he says, gayly, "and that
                     I am in the way. Only Crystal's notes will be brief, I warn you, France; she
                     has not your gift of tongue. Lady Dynely is the living exemplification of the
                     adage that speech is silver, and silence is gold."</p>
                  <p>"Shall you be in when your mother and Gordon call, Eric?" France asks, rather
                     coldly. "If not, I am commissioned to tender an impromptu invitation to dine
                     with Mrs. Caryll."</p>
                  <p>"Awfully sorry," Eric answers, "but we stand pledged to dine at the Embassy.
                        <emph>I</emph> must put in an appearance, whether or no, and Crystal will
                     also—headache permitting. Crystal rather shrinks from heavy dinner parties and
                     goes nowhere."</p>
                  <p>"I thought late hours and Paris dissipation were telling on her," retorts
                     France, still coldly. And Eric laughs and goes, with a last severe, warning
                     glance at his wife—a glance which says in its quick blue flash:</p>
                  <p>"Tell if you dare!"</p>
                  <p>It is a needless warning—Crystal has no thought of telling—of complaining of
                     him to any one on earth. She lies back in her big chair, her little hands
                     folded, silent and pale, while the sounds of ringing life reach them from the
                     bright, gay boulevard below, and the jubilant sunlight fills the room.</p>
                  <p>"How thin you have grown, Crystal," France says at last, very gently. "Paris
                     does not agree with you I think. We must make Eric take you home to
                     Dynely."</p>
                  <p>Her eyes light eagerly—something like color comes into the colorless face. She
                     catches her breath hard.</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" she says, "if he only would!"</p>
                  <p>France is watching her intently.</p>
                  <p>"You don't like Paris, then?"</p>
                  <pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6444-00000165"/>
                  <p>"Like it!" the gentle eyes for an instant flash. "I hate it."</p>
                  <p>There is a pause. France's heart is hot within her. Fickle, unstable, she had
                     always known Eric to be; selfish to the core and cruel in his selfishness; but
                     an absolute brute, never before.</p>
                  <p>"Do you go out much?" she asks.</p>
                  <p>"No—yes." Crystal falters. She hardly knows which answer to make in her fear of
                     committing Eric. "I don't care to go out—dinner parties <emph>are</emph> a
                     bore—I never was used to much society, you know, at home."</p>
                  <p>"I am afraid you must be very lonely."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no! that is—not very. I read and play—a little—and then, Eric—"</p>
                  <p>But her voice breaks, it is not trained to the telling of falsehoods, and the
                     truth she cannot tell.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," France says quietly, "Eric is out a great deal naturally—he is not a
                     domestic man; but once you return to Dynely all that will be changed. We must
                     try and prevail upon him to take you home at once.</p>
                  <p>The sad blue eyes give her a grateful glance. Then a troubled, frightened look
                     comes into them.</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps—perhaps you had better not," she says; "he will think you are
                     dictating to him, and he cannot bear to be dictated to. He likes Paris—I am
                     sure he will be angry if he is urged to go."</p>
                  <p>"We can survive that calamity," Miss Forrester answers, cynically; "and your
                     health—and, yes, I will say it—happiness, are the things to be considered
                     first."</p>
                  <p>"But I am happy," cries Crystal, in still increasing alarm, "indeed I am. How
                     could I be otherwise so soon?"</p>
                  <p>Her traitor voice breaks again. France looks at her in unutterable
                     compassion.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, how indeed!" she answers, "you poor little pale child! Well, I must
                     go—they really don't know where I am, and we are all to go sight-seeing to the
                     Luxembourg. Do come with us, Crystal; you look as though you needed it."</p>
                  <p>But Lady Dynely shakes her small, fair head.</p>
                  <p>"I cannot," she says, "Eric may return, and be vexed to find me out."</p>
                  <p>"Eric! Eric!" thinks France, intolerantly; "I should like to box Eric's
                     ears!"</p>
                  <p>"Besides, sight-seeing tires me," Crystal goes on, with a wan little smile,
                     "and I don't think I care for pictures. We visited the Luxemboug, and the
                     Louvre, and the Tuileries, and all the rest of the show places, when we first
                     came, and I remember I was ill all day with headache after them. I like best to
                     stay at home and read—indeed I do."</p>
                  <p>France sighs.</p>
                  <p>"My little Crystal! But you will be lonely."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no. Eric <emph>may</emph> come to luncheon—he often does—and Terry will
                     drop in, I dare say, by and by. You know Terry is here?" interrogatively.</p>
                  <p>"Yes; Eric told me. I wish I could take you with me all the same, little one. I
                     hate to leave you here in this hotel alone. It is a shame!—a shame!" says
                     France, in her hot indignation.</p>
                  <p>But Crystal lifts a pained, piteous face.</p>
                  <p>"Please don't speak like that, France. It is all right," she says, with a
                     little gasp; "I—I prefer it."</p>
                  <p>"Do come!" France persists, unheedingly. "We will leave you at home with
                     grandmamma Caryll, while we do the sight-seeing. You will love her, Crystal—she
                     is the dearest, best old lady in Europe. Then we will dine comfortably
                     together, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en famille</foreign>, and go to the Varieties
                     in the evening, to see this popular actress Paris raves about—Madame
                     Felicia."</p>
                  <p>But, to France's surprise, Crystal suddenly withdraws her hands and looks up at
                     her with eyes that absolutely flash.</p>
                  <p>"I will never go to the Varieties!" she cries; "I will <emph>never</emph> go to
                     see Madame Felicia! She is a wicked, wicked woman, and I hate her!"</p>
                  <p>She is trembling from head to foot with nervous passion as she says it. France
                     stands petrified. Then all in an instant Crystal recollects herself, and
                     piteously clasps her hands.</p>
                  <p>"I did not mean to say that!" she cries; "it is very wrong of me. Please don't
                     think anything of my angry<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC6444-00000166"/> words—I
                     did not mean anything by them—indeed I did not."</p>
                  <p>France stoops and kisses her as a sister might, holding her close for a moment;
                     and a little sob she cannot wholly repress breaks from the poor, jealous child,
                     as she lays her head on France's breast.</p>
                  <p>"My darling," France whispers, in that warm kiss, "keep up heart. Eric shall
                     take you out of this wicked, tiresome' Paris before the week ends, or I will
                     know the reason why."</p>
                  <p>Then, with profoundest pity for this poor little girl bride, she goes, her own
                     day's pleasuring totally spoiled.</p>
                  <p>"This is what Eric's love-match comes to," she think sadly. "Ah, poor little

                  <p>IT is close upon luncheon hour when Miss Forrester returns to the Faubourg St.
                     Honore. As she enters the drawing-room, still in her street dress, she sees her
                     lover sitting in an arm chair by the open window, smoking a cigar, and immersed
                     in the art criticisms of the <title>Revue des Deux Mondes</title>. He throws
                     down the paper and looks at her with lazily loving eyes. Happiness and
                     prosperity certainly agree with <emph>him</emph>—as Gordon Caryll, the accepted
                     suitor of Miss Forrester, he looks ten years younger than did Mr. Locksley, the
                     impecunious portrait painter. Handsomer, nobler, France thinks, than Mr.
                     Locksley, it is impossible for mortal man to grow.</p>
                  <p>"Well," he says, "you have returned. My thoughts were just turning seriously to
                     the idea of having out the detective police, and offering a reward for your
                     recovery. Is it admissible to ask, my child, where you have been?"</p>
                  <p>She comes behind him, lays her little gloved hands on his shoulders, and looks
                     down into the gravely smiling face resting against the chair back. They are not
                     demonstrative lovers those two, but now, rather to Mr. Caryll's surprise, Miss
                     Forrester impulsively stoops and leaves a kiss on his forehead.</p>
                  <p>"And to think," she says, drawing a tense sort of breath, "that I
                        <emph>might</emph> have married him!"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Caryll opens his handsome gray eyes. Both the kiss and the irrelevant
                     exclamation take him rather aback.</p>
                  <p>"You might have married him! You might have married whom? You have not been
                     proposing to any one this morning, have you? What are you talking about
                     France?"</p>
                  <p>"About Eric," she answers, absently.</p>
                  <pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC6444-00000167"/>
                  <p>"And with the most woe-begone of faces. Melancholy has evidently marked you for
                     her own this morning. You are regretting you threw Eric over for me—is that it,
                     my dear?"</p>
                  <p>"Nonsense!" is France's energetic answer. "I hate to have you say such things,
                     even in jest, Gordon. Thank Heaven, no! I liked Eric, certainly—one could
                     hardly fail to do that; but, I always had a most thorough-paced contempt for
                     him all the same. And if I had married him—but no, I never would, I never
                     could, if there had been no Crystal Higgins, no Mr. Locksley, in the scheme of
                     the universe. Gordon, I have been to see them this morning."</p>
                  <p>"So I inferred, my dear, from your very energetic language. And you found them
                     well, I hope?"</p>
                  <p>"Eric is well," France says, resentfully; "he will be, to the end of the
                     chapter. But, Crystal—"</p>
                  <p>"Yes?" Mr. Caryll says, interrogatively. "Crystal is well also, no doubt?"</p>
                  <p>"Well!" France cries, and then stops. "Ah! you should see her—wait until you
                     do. I never saw any one so changed in my life."</p>
                  <p>"For the better?"</p>
                  <p>"For the worse. She is the shadow of herself—poor little soul! Her sad,
                     heart-broken face and voice haunt me like a ghost. Eric is a brute!"</p>
                  <p>"Indeed! Husbands invariably are, are they not? What has Eric done?"</p>
                  <p>"I don't know what he has done," Miss Forrester answers, indignantly. "I only
                     know he is breaking his wife's heart. Why don't you say 'husbands invariably
                     do'? I daresay it is true enough."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Caryll takes one of the gloved hands and gives it an affectionate little
                     squeeze.</p>
                  <p>"My dear child, don't excite yourself. I intend to prove an exception.
                     Seriously, though, I am very sorry for little Lady Dynely. I am afraid the
                     rumors I have been hearing must be true."</p>
                  <p>"Rumors? What rumors? I never heard you allude to them."</p>
                  <p>"No; one does not care to talk about that sort of thing, and I knew it would
                     annoy you, and make his mother unhappy. But as you seem to be finding out for
                     yourself, well they <emph>do</emph> say he neglects the little one, and runs
                     about with—"</p>
                  <p>"With Felicia, the actress! Gordon, I am sure of it! With Felicia, the
                     dancer!"</p>
                  <p>"With Felicia, the dancer. But take it calmly, my love. How do you know
                     it?"</p>
                  <p>"I know it from Crystal herself. That is what she meant when I asked her to
                     come with us to the Varieties to see Felicia."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, what did she mean?"</p>
                  <p>"She said she hated the Varieties, she hated Madame Felicia; that she was a
                     wicked, painted woman. And you should have seen those dove-eyes of hers flash.
                     My poor, dear little Crystal!" The dark, impetuous eyes fill with tears and
                     fire with indignation. "Only six weeks married!" she says passionately.
                     "Gordon, I hate Eric."</p>
                  <p>"Now, France," he says gravely, "don't make yourself unhappy about this. Lady
                     Dynely must have known she ran no ordinary risk in marrying Dynely—the most
                     notorious male flirt in Europe. If she had had one grain of sense in that
                     pretty flaxen head of hers she must have known that matrimony would work no
                     miracles. A flirt he is by nature—there is not a grain of constancy in his
                     whole composition; and as she has taken him, so she must abide by her
                     bargain."</p>
                  <p>"He is a brute!"</p>
                  <p>"So you said before," answers Mr. Caryll, a half-smile breaking up the gravity
                     of his face. "Still, allowance must be made for him. He has been spoiled all
                     his life—he has never been thwarted—to wish has been to have, and ladies have
                     petted and made much of him for his azure eyes, and golden curls, and his Greek
                     profile, all his life long. Time <emph>may</emph> cure him. Meanwhile, neither
                     you nor I, Miss Forrester, can help Crystal. And they say this Felicia plays
                     the deuce with her victims."</p>
                  <p>"Have you ever seen her, Gordon?"</p>
                  <pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC6444-00000168"/>
                  <p>"Never. I was too busy last year when she was at the Bijou, and besides, I had
                     an aversion to theatres and theatre-going. I shall see her to-night,
                     however."</p>
                  <p>"She bought your picture, 'How the Night Fell,' didn't she?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes. Di Venturini purchased it for her. By the bye, I promised at the time a
                     companion picture. They say she's to marry Di Venturini immediately upon his
                     return from Italy."</p>
                  <p>"Marry him! <emph>That</emph> woman!"</p>
                  <p>"My dear France," Caryll says, laughing, "with what stinging scorn you bring
                     out <emph>that</emph> woman! There is nothing said against 'that woman' except
                     that she is a most outrageous coquette."</p>
                  <p>"But she is a dancer, and he is a prince."</p>
                  <p>"That goes for nothing. The best blood of the realm takes its wife from the
                     stage in these days. I shouldn't fancy it myself, but you know the adage, 'A
                     burnt child dreads the fire.'"</p>
                  <p>"Poor little Crystal!" sighs France.</p>
                  <p>"Poor little Crystal, indeed. Rumor says he is altogether infatuated. Let us
                     hope rumor, for once, is wrong. Are they coming to dinner?"</p>
                  <p>"No. Eric pleads a prior engagement, and she does not seem to have heart enough
                     left to go anywhere. Here is Lady Dynely. By the bye, I forgot to tell you
                     Terry is in Paris."</p>
                  <p>"Terry? Terry Dennison?" cries Lady Dynely, eagerly; "is he, really. Where,
                     France?"</p>
                  <p>"At the Hotel du Louvre. I stole a march upon you this morning, and made an
                     early call upon the happy pair."</p>
                  <p>Her ladyship's eyes light eagerly.</p>
                  <p>"And you saw them? You saw Eric?"</p>
                  <p>"I saw Eric, mamma."</p>
                  <p>"How is he looking? Will they dine with us?"</p>
                  <p>"Eric is looking well—never better. And they dine at the Embassy this evening.
                     No doubt, though, Eric will call."</p>
                  <p>"Here he is now," Caryll interrupts, looking from the window, and France
                     disappears like a flash. She feels in no mood at present to meet and exchange
                     pleasant commonplaces with the Right Honorable the Lord Viscount Dynely.</p>
                  <p>She goes to her room, throws off her bonnet and seal jacket, and pays a visit
                     to grandmamma Caryll, in her own apartments. Paralysis has deprived her of the
                     use of her limbs. She sits in her great invalid chair the long days through.
                     But in her handsome old face a look of great, serene content reigns.</p>
                  <p>The restless, longing, impatient light that for years looked out of her eyes
                     has gone—she has found what she waited and watched for. Her son is with
                     her—France is to be his wife—she asks no more of earth.</p>
                  <p>The luncheon-bell rings. Mrs. Caryll's is brought in, and France descends. To
                     her great relief, Eric has gone, and Terry is in his place. Terry, who is
                     changed too, and who looks grave and preoccupied.</p>
                  <p>"You were at the Louvre this morning, France," he says to her as they sit side
                     by side. "You saw <emph>her?</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Terry," and France's compassionate eyes look at him very gently. "I saw
                     her."</p>
                  <p>"And you have heard—"</p>
                  <p>"Everything—poor little Crystal. Terry, Eric must take her to England, and at
                     once."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, if he only would," Terry says with a sort of groan, "but he will not. That
                     is past hoping for. He is killing her—as surely as ever man killed woman. And
                     when he does," Terry sets his teeth like a bulldog, "<emph>my</emph> time of
                     reckoning will come."</p>
                  <p>"You must accompany us this afternoon, Terry," Lady Dynely says, after the old
                     imperious fashion. "France is quite as much as Gordon is capable of taking care
                     of. <emph>I</emph> want you."</p>
                  <p>Terry falls into the old groove at once. In his secret heart he is longing to
                     be at the hotel with Crystal, to cheer her in her loneliness; but that may not
                     be, may never be again. So he sighs and goes. They spend the long, sunny,
                     spring-like afternoon amid the lions of Paris, and return to dine, and dress
                     for the theatre.</p>
                  <p>"The whole duty of family escort will fall upon your victimized<pb n="340-341"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000169"/> timized shoulders, Dennison," says Mr. Caryll,
                     looking up from a letter that the post has brought him. "This is a note from
                     General McLaren—I served under him at the beginning of the American civil war.
                     He is at the Hotel Mirabeau; and as he leaves Paris to-morrow, begs me to call
                     upon him to-night. You won't mind, I suppose; and I will look in upon you about
                     the second act."</p>
                  <p>"I always told Terry he was born to be a social martyr," France says. "The
                     fetch-and-carry, go-and-come, do this and that <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >rôle</foreign>, has been yours from your birth, my poor, boy."</p>
                  <p>So it chances that when the curtain goes up, and the "Golden Witch" begins,
                     Gordon Caryll does not make one of the party of three who look down from the
                     front of their box, amid all the glittering "horse-shoe" of gaslight and human
                     faces. The pretty, bright theatre is very full; there is an odor of pastilles,
                     a flutter of fans, a sparkle of jewelry. Felicia is in great form to-night—she
                     has heard from Lord Dynely himself of the family party coming to view her with
                     coldly-critical, British eyes. They have laughed together over it in her little
                     dusk-shaded, perfumed, luxurious drawing-room, where his lordship has made a
                     much longer morning call than he made immediately before in the Faubourg St.
                     Honore.</p>
                  <p>She glances up now, swiftly and eagerly, as she comes forward to the
                     footlights, a golden goblet in her hand, her long hair floating loosely over
                     her shoulders, singing some wild bacchanalian, Theresa-like ditty. She is
                     gloriously beautiful in her scant drapery, and her rich voice fills the theatre
                     superbly. But as she tosses off her goblet, at the end of her drinking song,
                     she sees that the man she looks for is not in the box.</p>
                  <p>Will he know her? He has never seen her since that long, far-off night when
                     they parted in the darkening day by the shore of the lonely Canadian river. He
                     thinks her dead. Will he know her? A wild, fierce delight fills her soul,
                     flames up in her eyes, and burns in her cheeks. Will he know her? She will sing
                     to-night (if he comes) the song she ever sang for him, that first evening in
                     the cottage of Major Lovell. It will run very well with this play—that is much
                     more song and dance than drama. If he doubts her identity, surely, surely, he
                     will remember <emph>that</emph>.</p>
                  <p>She is wild with excitement, she surpasses herself. The audience applaud to the
                     echo—she flings herself into her part with a reckless abandon that sweeps her
                     listeners along with her. And still she watches that box, and still he does not
                     come. Will he not come at all? Amid a storm of excited applause, amid a shower
                     of bouquets, the curtain falls upon the first act.</p>
                  <p>"How well she plays." "How magnificently she is looking." "Never saw her dance
                     half a quarter so well in my life before." "By Jove! you know,
                        <emph>what</emph> a voice Felicia has." These and a hundred such
                     exclamations run the round of the theatre.</p>
                  <p>"She is beautiful!" France exclaims, "with a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">beauté du
                        diable</foreign> I never saw equalled. And she dances and sings like a very
                     Bacchante."</p>
                  <p>"Wish to Heaven they would burn her as a witch," growls Terry, under his ruddy
                     beard. "Such a woman should no more be let run loose than a leopardess."</p>
                  <p>"She sings very well," Lady Dynely says, languidly; "but there is something
                     fierce and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">outre</foreign> about her, is there not? I
                     don't like this sort of exhibition. A ballet is bad enough—this kind of thing
                     is positively indelicate. What is she looking at our box for? I caught her more
                     than once."</p>
                  <p>"She is looking for what she does not see. There is Eric yonder in the stalls,"
                     says Miss Forrester, in a tone of stony resentment.</p>
                  <p>"Is he, really?" Eric's mother puts up her glass and leans forward. "So he is,
                     and quite alone. Where is Crystal, I wonder?"</p>
                  <p>"Crystal is at home, and <emph>quite alone</emph> also, you may be very sure,"
                     answers France, still in that tone of strong, suppressed indignation.</p>
                  <p>"I wonder if he sees us? Oh, yes, he does. There he is rising. No doubt he will
                     call upon us directly. France, why don't you look? He is bowing to
                        <emph>you</emph>."</p>
                  <p>But France's bright, angry eyes are fixed steadfastly upon<pb n="342-343"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000170"/> the rising curtain—she will <emph>not</emph> see
                     Lord Dynely. And Lord Dynely looks away from her, feeling he has been snubbed,
                     and knowing very well the reason why.</p>
                  <p>He has come to the theatre to-night, partly because he cannot stay away, partly
                     out of sheer bravado.</p>
                  <p>What! shall he stay away because he is afraid of Terry Dennison, and France
                     Forrester? Is he still a child in leading-strings, to be dictated to? Not if he
                     knows it. So he leaves early the ambassador's saloon, and goes to the
                     Varieties, and sits out all the second act, directly under the lorgnettes of
                     the Gordon Caryll party.</p>
                  <p>Again madame surpasses herself—again the whole house rings with applause—again
                     bouquets are showered upon her. Lord Dynely adds his mite to the rest, a
                     bouquet of scarlet and white camellias. Again and again, the black, fierce,
                     restless eyes, flash their feverish light to that one box. And still the man
                     for whom she looks does not come.</p>
                  <p>He comes as the curtain falls for the second time, and France's eyes and smile
                     welcome him.</p>
                  <p>"Am I <emph>very</emph> late?" he asks. "McLaren and I had a thousand things to
                     say, and time flew. I say, France, how do you like it?"</p>
                  <p>"Not at all! She fascinates one, but it is a horrid and unhealthy sort of
                     fascination. Her mad singing and dancing throw me into a fever."</p>
                  <p>"Is there much more of it?" he says, standing behind her chair. "Is it all
                     over?"</p>
                  <p>"There is one more act. She is to be burned alive, Terry tells me, and I want
                     to wait and see her. I shall try to fancy the burning real, and enjoy it
                     accordingly."</p>
                  <p>"By Jove!" he says, and laughs, "what a blood-thirsty spirit we are developing!
                     Ah! Dynely, <emph>you</emph> here?"</p>
                  <p>For the door opens, and Eric, languid and handsome, saunters in.</p>
                  <p>"How do, Caryll? Late, ar'n't you? Well, France—well, <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >ma mère</foreign>, how do you like it? Superb actress, isn't she?"</p>
                  <p>He looks at France. With a certain defiance, she sees and accepts.</p>
                  <p>"If dancing mad jigs, singing drinking songs, and capering ing about like a
                     bedlamite, go to constitute a fine actress, then yes. A little of Madame
                     Felicia goes a long way."</p>
                  <p>His eyes flash, but he laughs.</p>
                  <p>"There is no accounting for tastes. She seems to please her audience, at
                     least."</p>
                  <p>"Where is Crystal?" France abruptly asks. "I thought you were to dine at the
                     Embassy."</p>
                  <p>"Crystal is at home. And you thought quite right; we <emph>were</emph> to dine
                     at the Embassy." The defiant ring is more marked than ever. "I have dined
                     there, and on my way home dropped in here, knowing I would have the pleasure of
                     being in the bosom of my family."</p>
                  <p>He looks at her steadfastly, and France turns her white shoulder deliberately
                     upon him. Her lover is leaning over the back of her chair—ah! how she loves
                     him, how she trusts him—how different he is from this shallow-brained young
                     dandy, with his Greek beauty, and callous heart! How differently her life will
                     be ordered from Crystal's, when she is his wife.</p>
                  <p>As she thinks it, the curtain goes up for the third time, and the "Golden
                     Witch" bounds on the stage.</p>
                  <p>She is singing as she springs to the footlights, a gleeful hunting chorus this
                     time. A troop of followers in green and gold come after, and join in the
                     chorus. Her costume is of green and gold also; a green hunting cap, with a long
                     white plume, is set jauntily on her raven tresses. She is dazzling in the
                     dress, she is radiant as she sings. Again her sweet, high voice, rings to the
                     domed roof. And it is the very song Rosamond Lovell sang for Gordon Caryll,
                     seventeen years ago, in the Toronto cottage.</p>
                  <p>She flashes one fierce electric look up at their box.</p>
                  <p>Yes, he is there at last—at last. Thank Heaven for that! if she can thank
                     Heaven for anything.</p>
                  <p>He hears her, he sees her; recognizes the song. He knows her.</p>
                  <p>Her hour of triumph is complete. Her excitement reaches its climax. As she
                     never played before, she plays to-night. She holds the multitude breathless,
                     spellbound. She sings her own death-song, wild, wailing, weird, unearthly<pb
                        n="344-345" xml:id="VAC6444-00000171"/> ly, so ghastly in its tortured
                     agony, that France shudders and turns pale. The mimic flames arise—surround
                     her, her uplifted face is seen above them, as the curtain falls down, her
                     ghastly death-song dies wailing away.</p>
                  <p>For a moment, so rapt and petrified are the audience, that they cannot applaud.
                        <emph>Then</emph>—such a storm of clapping, of calling, shakes the walls of
                     the theatre, as never shook it before. "Felicia! Felicia!" they shout, as with
                     one voice.</p>
                  <p>She comes out smiling and kissing hands. Another tempest of applause and
                     delight breaks forth. Then flashing up one last look, straight into Gordon
                     Caryll's face, she disappears.</p>
                  <p>There is a stir and commotion, an uprising and shawling of ladies.</p>
                  <p>"Ugh!" France says, with a shudder; "it is diabolical! it is like the
                     nightmare. I shall never come to see this <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >outre</foreign> spectacle again. Do <emph>you</emph> like it, Gordon?"</p>
                  <p>She leans back, and looks up at him. He does not seem to hear her, he does not
                     seem to see her—he is staring at the stage like a man stupefied.</p>
                  <p>"Gordon!" she cries.</p>
                  <p>His eyes turn slowly from the blank, green curtain to her, but his face still
                     keeps that dazed, stunned look. His bronzed skin, too, has turned of a dead
                     ashen gray.</p>
                  <p>"Gordon," France says once more, this time in terror, "what is it?"</p>
                  <p>Her question seems to break the spell. He makes an effort—a mighty effort, she
                     can see, and answers her.</p>
                  <p>"Nothing. Will you come?"</p>
                  <p>His very voice is changed—it is hoarse and low. He offers her his arm
                     mechanically, and watches her arranging her opera-wrap, without trying to help
                     her. She takes it and goes with him out, and all the while he keeps the dazed
                     look of a man who is walking in his sleep.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Gordon!" she cries out, "<emph>what</emph> is it? Do you know that
                     woman?"</p>
                  <p>He wakes then—wakes to the whole horrid truth.</p>
                  <p>"For Heaven's sake, don't ask me," he says, "to-night. Wait—wait until
                     to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>Her eyes dilate. They are out under the frosty, February stars. He puts them
                     into the carriage—Lady Dynely and France—but he makes no effort to follow them.
                     Eric and Terry make their adieux and turn away.</p>
                  <p>"Are you not coming, Gordon?" Lady Dynely asks in surprise.</p>
                  <p>"No," he answers, still in that low, hoarse tone. "Home," he says to the
                     coachman. And as they whirl away, France leans yearningly forward, and sees him
                     standing under the street lamps, quite alone.</p>

                  <head type="sub">"AFTER MANY DAYS."</head>
                  <p>HE knows her! From the first moment in which his eyes rested on her, from the
                     first instant he has heard her ringing voice, he knows it is his wife. The song
                     she sang for him in Major Lovell's dim drawing-room so many years ago, she is
                     singing again for him to-night, for him—he knows that, too. His divorced wife
                     stands yonder before him—this half-nude actress—his divorced wife whom for the
                     past ten years he has thought dead. He knows it in that first moment of
                     recognition as surely as he ever knew it in the after days.</p>
                  <p>She has hardly changed at all—in the strong, white lime light, she does not
                     seem to have aged one day in seventeen years. The dusk, sensuous beauty is
                     riper and more of the "earth, earthy;" the delicate outlines of first youth
                     have passed, except that she is even more beautiful in her insolent, voluptuous
                     womanhood than in her slim, first girlhood. He thinks this in a dazed,
                     stupefied sort of way as he stands and looks at her. And this is Rosamond
                     Lovell—the woman who was once his wife.</p>
                  <p>His wife! his wife! The two words echo like a knell through his brain, set
                     themselves to the wild, sweet music that is ringing about him, fit themselves
                     in time to her flying feet. His wife! Yonder creature, singing, dancing in that
                     dress, that <emph>undress</emph> rather—gaped at by all these people. His
                     wife!</p>
                  <p>The lights, the faces, the stage, seem to swim before him in a hot, red mist.
                     He grasps the back of the chair he holds, and sets his teeth. Great Heaven! is
                     the Nemesis of his mad, boyish folly to pursue him to the end?</p>
                  <p>And then France's cool, sweet voice falls on his ear. "Do you like it, Gordon!"
                     she is asking, with a smile. The fair pure face, the loving, upturned eyes, the
                     trustful smile, meet him and stab him with a pang that is like death. He has
                     forgotten her—in the first shock of recognition and dreadful surprise, he has
                     forgotten her. Now he looks down upon her, and <emph>feels</emph> without
                     thinking at all, that in finding his divorced wife he has lost his bride.</p>
                  <p>He cannot answer her—his head is reeling. He feels her wondering, startled
                     eyes, but he is beyond caring. He tries to answer, and his voice sounds far off
                     and unreal even to his own ears.</p>
                  <p>It ends. The curtain is down, the blinding stage-light is out, she is gone. He
                     can breathe once more now that fatal face is away. The whole theatre has
                     uprisen. Lady Dynely is moving out on the arm of her son—France is clasping his
                     and gazing up at him with eyes of wistful wonder.</p>
                  <p>They are out under the cool, white stars—he has placed them in their carriage,
                     seen them roll away, and is alone.</p>
                  <p>Alone, though scores pass and repass, although dozens of gay voices and happy
                     laughs reach him; although all the bright city is still broad awake and in the
                     streets. He takes off his hat and lets the cold wind lift his hair. What shall
                     he do, he thinks, vaguely; what ought he do first?</p>
                  <p>Rosamond, his divorced wife, is living—he has seen her to-night. And France
                     Forrester will marry no man who is the husband of a wife. They have spoken once
                     on the subject—gravely and incisively—he recalls the conversation now, word for
                     word, as he stands here.</p>
                  <p>"If she had not died, France," he had asked her, "if nothing but the divorce
                     freed me—how then? Would you still have loved me and been my wife?"</p>
                  <p>And she had looked at him with those clear, truthful, brave eyes of hers, and
                     answered at once:</p>
                  <p>"If she had not died—if nothing but your divorce freed you, there could have
                     been no '<emph>how then</emph>.' Loved you I might—it seems to me I must; but
                     marry you—no. No more than I would if there had never been a divorce. A man can
                     have but one wife, and death alone can sever the bond. I believe in no
                     latter-day doctrine of divorce."</p>
                  <pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC6444-00000173"/>
                  <p>They had spoken of it no more, he had thought of it no more. It all comes back
                     to him as he stands here, and he knows he has lost forever France
                     Forrester.</p>
                  <p>And then, in his utter despair, a wild idea flashes across his brain, and he
                     catches at it as the drowning catch at straws. It is <emph>not</emph> his
                     wife—he will not believe it. It is an accidental resemblance—it may be a
                     relative—a sister; she may have had sisters, for what he ever knew. It is not
                     Rosamond Lovell—the dead do not arise, and she was killed ten years ago. Some
                     one must know this Madame Felicia's antecedents; it is only one of these
                     accidental resemblances that startle the world sometimes. He will find out. Who
                     is it knows Madame Felicia?</p>
                  <p>He puts his hand to his head as this delirious idea flashes through it, and
                     tries to think. Terry Dennison—yes, he is sure Terry Dennison knows her, and
                     knows her well. He will be able to tell him; he will follow at once.</p>
                  <p>A moment later and he is striding with a speed of which he is unconscious in
                     the direction of the Hotel du Louvre. He finds his man readily enough. Terry is
                     standing in the brilliantly-lit vestibule, smoking a cigar. Eric is <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">bon garçon</foreign>, and has run up at once to his wife. A
                     heavy hand is laid on Terry's shoulder, a breathless voice speaks:</p>
                  <p>"Dennison!"</p>
                  <p>Terry turns round, takes out his cigar, and opens his eyes.</p>
                  <p>"What! Caryll! And at this time of night! What's the matter? My dear fellow,
                     anything wrong? You look—"</p>
                  <p>"There's nothing wrong," still huskily. "I want to ask you a question,
                     Dennison. Come out of this."</p>
                  <p>He links his arm through Terry's, and draws him out of the hotel entrance into
                     the street. Terry still holds his cigar between his finger and thumb, and still
                     stares blankly.</p>
                  <p>"There must be something wrong," he reiterates; "on my word, my dear fellow,
                     you look awfully."</p>
                  <p>"Never mind my looks," Caryll impatiently cries. "Dennison, you know Madame
                     Felicia?"</p>
                  <p>At this unexpected question, Dennison, if possible, stands more agape than
                     ever. Then he laughs.</p>
                  <p>"What! You, too, Caryll! Oh, this is too much—"</p>
                  <p>"Don't laugh," Caryll says, harshly. "Answer me. You know this woman?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, yes."</p>
                  <p>"Intimately?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, yes, again. I suppose I may say tolerably intimately."</p>
                  <p>"What is her history?"</p>
                  <p>"What?"</p>
                  <p>"Who is she? Where does she come from? What is her real name?" Caryll asks,
                     still in that same hoarse, breathless haste.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Dennison's eyes dilate to twice their usual size. He altogether forgets to
                     resume his newly-lit cigar.</p>
                  <p>"My dear fellow—"</p>
                  <p>"The devil!" Gordon Caryll grinds out between his set teeth. "Answer me, cannot
                     you?"</p>
                  <p>No jesting matter this, evidently, and Terry, slow naturally, takes that fact
                     in.</p>
                  <p>"Who is she? Where does she come from? What was the rest?" he demands
                     helplessly. "Good Lord! Caryll, how should I know? I'm not Felicia's father
                     confessor."</p>
                  <p>"You told me you knew her intimately."</p>
                  <p>"I know her as well as most people know most people, and that goes for nothing.
                     What do we, any of us, know of any one else? Don't grow impatient, old fellow;
                     all I know I'm willing to tell, but it's precious little. Now begin at the
                     beginning and cross-examine. You shall-have the truth, the whole truth, and
                     nothing but the truth. Only don't keep the steam up to its present height, or
                     you'll go off with a bang!"</p>
                  <p>There is a second pause. Terry resumes his cigar, thrusts his hands in his coat
                     pockets and waits. Gordon Caryll comes to his senses sufficiently to make a
                     great effort and calm down.</p>
                  <p>"I beg your pardon, Terry," he says, more coherently than he has yet spoken;
                     "but this is a matter of no ordinary importance to me—a matter almost of life
                     and death."</p>
                  <p>Again Terry's eyes dilate, but this time he says nothing.</p>
                  <pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC6444-00000174"/>
                  <p>"I never saw Madame Felicia before to-night," goes on Caryll; "and she bears
                     the most astonishing, the most astounding resemblance to another woman, a woman
                     I have thought dead for the past ten years. I want to know her history, and I
                     have come to you."</p>
                  <p>"Go on," says Terry, calmly.</p>
                  <p>"Was Madame Felicia ever in America?—ever in"—a pause—"in Canada?"</p>
                  <p>"She <emph>says</emph> not," is Terry's answer.</p>
                  <p>"Says not? Then you think—"</p>
                  <p>"I think she was. She has always been so vehement in denying it that I have
                     suspected from the first she lied. And since last night I felt sure of it."</p>
                  <p>"Since last night—"</p>
                  <p>"I don't know that it's quite fair to tell," says Terry; "but I don't see that
                     I'm bound to keep Felicia's secrets—I owe her no good turn, and if it's of any
                     use to you, Caryll—"</p>
                  <p>"Anything—everything connected with that woman is of use to me," Caryll
                     answers, feverishly.</p>
                  <p>Without more ado, Terry relates the episode of last night—the rescuing the girl
                     in the street, her inadvertent words, and the bringing her to Felicia.</p>
                  <p>"She asseverated again and again that Felicia had been in Canada. She said she
                     herself had been born there, in such a way, by Jove! that you could only infer
                     Felicia to be her mother. And she looked like Felicia. And she had Felicia's
                     picture. And Felicia received her at once. And I believe, upon my soul, that
                     she is Felicia's daughter."</p>
                  <p>Gordon Caryll listened dumbly. Felicia's child and—his. He knew there had been
                     a child—a daughter—had not Mr. Barteaux told him? And she too was here.</p>
                  <p>"She called herself—?" he began.</p>
                  <p>"She called herself Gordon Kennedy. <emph>Gordon!</emph> By Jove!" For the
                     first time a sudden thought strikes Terry—a thought <emph>so</emph> sudden, and
                        <emph>so</emph> striking that it almost knocks him over. "By Jove!" he
                     repeats again, and stares blankly at his companion.</p>
                  <p>There is no need of further questioning. Assurance is made doubly sure—Felicia
                     and Rosamond Lovell are one, and this girl picked up adrift in the Paris
                     streets is his daughter. No need of further questions, indeed. He withdraws his
                     arm abruptly and on the spot.</p>
                  <p>"That will do," he says. "Thanks, very much. And good-night."</p>
                  <p>Then he is gone, and Terry is left standing, mouth and eyes open—a petrified
                     pedestrian. It all comes upon him—the story of Gordon Caryll's Canadian
                     wife—the actress—the picture—the puzzling resemblance to Felicia—her eager
                     questions about him the evening before. Terry is dumb-founded.</p>
                  <p>"By Jove!" he says again aloud, and at the sound of that dear and familiar
                     expletive his senses return. "By Jove, you know!" he repeats, and puts his
                     cigar once more between his lips, and in a dazed state prepares to go home.</p>
                  <p>Gordon Caryll goes home too. He sees France's face at the drawing-room window
                     as he passes, looking wistful and weary, and at the sight he sets his teeth
                     hard. He cannot meet her. He goes up to his room, locks the door, and flings
                     himself into a chair to think it all out.</p>
                  <p>He has lost her—forever lost her. To-morrow at the latest she must know all,
                     and then—he knows as surely as that he is sitting here—she will never so much
                     as see him again.</p>
                  <p>It is no fault of his—she will not blame him—she will love and pity him, and
                     suffer as acutely as he will suffer himself. All the same, though, she will
                     never see him more. And at the thought he starts from his chair, goaded to a
                     sort of madness, and walks up and down the room.</p>
                  <p>The hours pass. He thinks and thinks, but all to no purpose—not all the
                     thinking he can do in a lifetime can alter facts. This woman is his divorced
                     wife—and France Forrester will marry no divorced man. The law can free him from
                     his wife, but it cannot give him France. The penalty of his first folly has not
                     been paid—and it is to be paid, it seems, to the uttermost farthing. His exile
                     and misery are to begin all over again.</p>
                  <p>He suffers to-night, it seems to him, as he has never suffered in the past. And
                     as the fair February morning dawns,<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC6444-00000175"/>
                     it finds him with his face bowed in his hands, sitting stone-still in absolute
                     despair.</p>
                  <p>The first sharp spear of sunshine comes jubilantly through the glass. He lifts
                     his head. Haggard and pallid beyond all telling, with eyes dry and burning, and
                     white despair on every line of his face. His resolve is taken. All shall be
                     told, but first that there may not be even a shadow of mistake, he will see
                     this woman who calls herself Madame Felicia—will see her and from her own lips
                     know the truth.</p>
                  <p>Early as it is he rings for his man, and has a cold bath. It stands him in the
                     stead of sleep. He makes a careful toilet, has a cup of coffee and a roll, and
                     goes out of the house before any of his womankind are stirring.</p>
                  <p>The bright sunshine and bustle of the streets help him. He smokes, and that
                     soothes him. As eleven chimes from all the city clocks, he is altogether
                     himself again, the excitement and agitation of last night over and done with.
                     He is very pale—beyond that there is no change in him.</p>
                  <p>He feels no anger against the woman he is going to see—he is just enough for
                     that. The fault has been all his—all his also must be the atonement. But he
                     will see her, and then—</p>
                  <p>He cannot quite think—steady as he has forced himself to be—of what will come
                     after. It is very early yet to make a call, but he cannot wait. It is not
                     difficult to discover the address of the most popular actress in Paris; he does
                     discover it, walks steadfastly there, and encounters madame's tall chasseur in
                     his gorgeous uniform of carmine and gold.</p>
                  <p>Madame sees no one at this hour, monsieur is politely told; it is doubtful if
                     madame has arisen.</p>
                  <p>But madame will see <emph>him</emph>, monsieur is quite certain. Will this
                     Parisian "Jeames De La Pluche" be good enough to forward monsieur's card to
                     madame.</p>
                  <p>The chasseur looks doubtful, but something in the English monsieur's face
                     causes him to comply. The card is passed onward, and inward, until it reaches
                     the hand of madame's maid, and by madame's maid is presented to madame.</p>
                  <p>Madame has arisen—early as is the hour, has even breakfasted. She lies back in
                     her dusk-shaded drawing-room, looking rather fagged after last night's unusual
                     excitement, with deep bistre circles surrounding her eyes. Her lady companion
                     sits near reading aloud. She lies back with closed eyes, not listening, but
                     thinking of Gordon Caryll's face as she saw it last night looking down upon
                     her.</p>
                  <p>"A visitor for madame—a gentleman," Pauline announces.</p>
                  <p>"I can see no one, it is too early," madame says crossly; "is it M. Di
                     Venturini?"</p>
                  <p>"No, madame. An English gentleman, tall and fair—who has never been here
                     before."</p>
                  <p>Madame sits suddenly up, and seizes the card. Her pale face flushes dark red as
                     she reads the name. She does not quite know what she has expected—certainly not
                     this. For a moment her heart beats fast.</p>
                  <p>"I will see the gentleman, Pauline," she says. "Mrs. Hannery, you must be tired
                     of that stupid book. The morning is fine—suppose you take Pandore [the poodle]
                     and go for a walk. It will do you both good, and I shall not need you."</p>
                  <p>Thus dismissed, the lady companion rises and goes; madame turns to her
                     maid:</p>
                  <p>"Where is my new protégée?" she asks. "Miss Donny."</p>
                  <p>"In her room, madame, reading."</p>
                  <p>"See that she does not leave it then, see that she does not enter here. Now
                     show the gentleman up."</p>
                  <p>The maid departs. Madame springs up, darkens the room yet a little more, looks
                     at herself in one of the full-length mirrors, and is back in her seat with
                     drooping, languid eyes before the door re-opens. But her heart is beating fast,
                     and her topaz eyes are gleaming savagely under their white-veiled lids.</p>
                  <p>The door opens, and he comes in. And so again, after many years, this man and
                     woman, once husband and wife—are face to face.</p>
                  <p>The first thing he sees in that twilight of the room is his own picture. It
                     hangs directly opposite the door, and the sunshine, as it opens, falls for a
                     moment upon it. Like that they parted, like this they meet again! He stands for
                     a second motionless, looking at it, and she is the first to speak.</p>
                  <pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC6444-00000176"/>
                  <p>"A very good picture, and very well painted; but I don't think, I can't think,
                     I ever wore <emph>such</emph> a face of despair as that. You ought to know,
                     though, better than I."</p>
                  <p>The slow, sweet voice was as smooth and even as though the heart beneath were
                     not throbbing at fever heat. A cruel, lingering smile was on her face, and the
                     yellow, stealthy eyes were watching him greedily. He turned as she spoke and
                     looked at her.</p>
                  <p>"Rosamond!"</p>
                  <p>She started at the name, at the low, even gentle tone, in which it was spoken.
                     The blood rose again over her face, and for a second she found no voice to
                     answer. Then she laughed.</p>
                  <p>"Ma foi!" she said, "how droll it sounds to hear that! I had almost forgotten
                     that once <emph>was</emph> my name, so long is it since I have heard it? Ah,
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Dieu!</foreign> how old it makes one feel."</p>
                  <p>A real pang went through her heart. Growing old! Yes, surely, and to grow old
                     was the haunting terror of this woman's life.</p>
                  <p>"You have changed," she said, looking at him full, "changed more than I have.
                     You do not resemble very greatly the slender, fair-haired stripling I knew so
                     long ago in Toronto. And yet I should have known you anywhere. <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">Mon ami</foreign>, will you not sit down?"</p>
                  <p>"Thanks," he answered in the same low, level voice, "I will not detain you but
                     a moment. Last night, for the first time since we parted at Quebec, I saw
                     you—"</p>
                  <p>"And the sight was a shock, was it not, monsieur?" she gayly interrupted.</p>
                  <p>"It was," he replied gravely, "since I thought you dead. Since I was sure of
                     it."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, yes! that railway accident. Well, it was touch and go—I never expect to be
                     so near death, and escape again. But I did escape, and—here I am!"</p>
                  <p>She looked at him with her insolent smile, her eyes gleaming with evil
                     fire.</p>
                  <p>"Here I am," she repeated with slow, lingering enjoyment; "and it spoils your
                     life for you—does it not? As <unclear>you</unclear> spoiled mine for me
                        <emph>that</emph> night."</p>
                  <p>She pointed to the picture—the vengeful delight she felt shining in her great
                     eyes.</p>
                  <p>"You were merciless that night, Gordon Caryll, and I vowed revenge, did I not?
                     Well the years have come and the years have gone; we both lived, and revenge
                     was out of my reach. I never forgave you and I never will; but what could I do?
                     Now we meet, and I need do nothing. The very fact that I am alive is vengeance
                     enough. It parts you from her—does it not? Ah, you feel that! Monseigneur, I
                     wonder why you have come here this morning? It is certainly an honor I did not
                     expect."</p>
                  <p>"I came to make assurance certainty," he answered. "I <emph>had</emph> no
                     doubt, and still—"</p>
                  <p>"And still you would stand face to face with me once more. Well—there is no
                     doubt, is there? I am Rosamond Lovell—Rosamond Caryll—the girl you married, and
                     whose heart you so nearly broke, seventeen years ago. Oh, don't look so
                     scornful! I mean it! Even I had a heart, and I loved you. Loved you so well
                     that if I had been able I would have gone down to the river and drowned myself
                     after you left me that night. Fortunately I was not able. I could laugh now
                     when I look back and think of my besotted folly. We outlive all that at
                     five-and-thirty."</p>
                  <p>"You were not able," he repeated; "that means—"</p>
                  <p>"That my child was born twelve hours after we parted," she interrupted once
                     more. "Did they tell you in Quebec that?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, they told me. And the child is with you now."</p>
                  <p>"Who told you so?" she demanded, sharply.</p>
                  <p>"I know it—that is enough. You ask me why I came here to-day—one reason was to
                     see her."</p>
                  <p>She laughed contemptuously.</p>
                  <p>"And do you fancy I will let you? Why, I meant that child from her birth to
                     avenge her mother's wrongs. And she shall—I swear it?"</p>
                  <p>"You refuse to let me see her?"</p>
                  <p>"Most emphatically—yes. When the time comes you shall see her to your cost—not
                     before."</p>
                  <p>He turned to go. She rose up and stood before him.</p>
                  <pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC6444-00000177"/>
                  <p>"What! so soon," she said, with a laugh, "and after so many years' separation?
                     Well, then, go—actions, not words, are best between us. But I think, Gordon
                     Caryll, <emph>my</emph> day has come. Miss France Forrester is a very proud and
                     spotless young lady—so they tell me. Have you told her yet who Felicia the
                     actress is?"</p>
                  <p>He made no reply. Without speaking to her, without looking at her, he passed
                     out of the greenish dusk of the perfumed drawing-room into the sparkling
                     sunshine, and fresh, cool wind of the fair spring day.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">A MORNING CALL.</head>
                  <p>IT is just one hour later, and France Forrester stands with hands clasped
                     loosely before her at the window of Mrs. Caryll's invalid room, gazing with
                     weary wistfulness at the bright avenue below, a strained, waiting, listening
                     expression on her face. For since they parted last night so strangely at the
                     entrance of the theatre she has not seen her lover, and when has
                        <emph>that</emph> chanced between them before? Something has happened!
                     Something wrong and unpleasant—she feels that vaguely, although she cannot
                     define her own feeling. How oddly he looked last night, how strangely he spoke,
                     how singularly he acted. Did he too know Madame Felicia? Then she smiled to
                     herself. Of course not—had he not said so a dozen times. Madame Felicia might
                     have power over the weak and unstable, such as Eric Dynely; over men of the
                     stuff Gorden Caryll was made, no more than the ugliest hag that prowled
                     Paris.</p>
                  <p>But why did he not come?</p>
                  <p>Last night, long after the rest had retired, she had waited up in the salon
                     wistfully anxious for the good-night she so rarely missed. And he had entered
                     very late, and had passed on at once to his room, although he <emph>must</emph>
                     have known she would wait. Had he not been belated times before, and had she
                     ever failed to wait—had he ever failed to seek her out? She had gone to bed
                     vexed and disappointed. But she was not one easily to take offence, and it
                     would be all right to-morrow. He <emph>might</emph> have looked into the salon,
                     but he did not—and—there was an end to it. To-morrow at breakfast he would tell
                     her, whatever it might be. So she rose happy and light-hearted, the fag-end of
                     a tune between<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC6444-00000178"/> tween her lips, with
                     no presentiment of all that was so near shadowing her happy girl's heart.</p>
                  <p>Breakfast hour. She ran down eagerly. Gordon was never late. He was always to
                     be found in dressing-gown and slippers reading Galignani at this hour. But his
                     favorite arm-chair this morning was vacant, and only Lady Dynely met her across
                     the crystal and the silver.</p>
                  <p>"Has Gordon turned lazy, I wonder?" the elder lady said, carelessly; "it is
                     something new to miss his face at the end of the table. Eric and his wife are
                     coming to-day. France and I had counted on Gordon for you. We are going to
                     Saint Cloud, and if Gordon does not return—"</p>
                  <p>"In any case I do not think I shall go," France answered, rather wearily. "One
                     grows so bored of perpetual sightseeing. I shall stay at home with grandmamma
                     Caryll."</p>
                  <p>She had no appetite for breakfast, and when it was over she ran up to say
                     good-morning to "grandmamma." No, Gordon had not been there either—his mother's
                     first question was for him.</p>
                  <p>"It is the very first day he has failed to pay me a before breakfast call,"
                     Mrs. Caryll said, with a half-laugh, and yet dissatisfied. "Can he have gone
                     out, or where is he?"</p>
                  <p>"I do not know," France answered, vaguely uneasy; "he was not down to
                     breakfast."</p>
                  <p>"Not down to breakfast?"</p>
                  <p>"He was absent rather late last night," Miss Forrester said, speaking lightly;
                     "no doubt he has turned sluggard, and overslept himself. Susan," she said to
                     Mrs. Caryll's nurse and maid, who entered at that moment, "do you know if Mr.
                     Caryll is still in his room?"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Caryll went out three hours ago, Miss France," the woman answered. "So I
                     heard his man Norton say."</p>
                  <p>There was a pause.</p>
                  <p>"How <emph>very</emph> strange," France was thinking, more and more uneasily;
                     "how very unlike Gordon. What can it mean?"</p>
                  <p>But there was no solution of the enigma. The morning wore on, bringing Eric and
                     Crystal—Eric handsome and debonnaire as ever, Crystal clinging to his arm,
                     silent, shadowy. And Lady Dynely alone was their companion in the day's
                     pleasuring at Saint Cloud.</p>
                  <p>"I wish you were coming, France," Crystal said, in a wistful whisper. Somehow,
                     in France's strength and sunny brightness, even this little wilted lily seemed
                     to revive.</p>
                  <p>"Not to-day, darling," France answered, kissing her. "It will not do to leave
                     grandmamma quite alone. Besides, Saint Cloud is an old story to me and rather a
                     tiresome one. We will all meet at dinner and go to the Opera aux Italiens
                     together."</p>
                  <p>"Has Crystal's eloquence prevailed, France?" Eric says in his languid way,
                     sauntering up. "No? Then," with a slight, half-contemptuous laugh, "the case is
                     hopeless indeed. When a woman won't, she won't. I suppose we must be resigned,
                     although your absence spoils our excursion. Come, madre, come, <foreign
                        xml:lang="ITA">sposo mio</foreign>. By-by, France—'we meet again at
                     Philippi.'"</p>
                  <p>And then they are gone, and France draws a long breath of relief. Gordon will
                     be here presently, and they will have a long, delicious day all to themselves,
                     and everything will be explained.</p>
                  <p>She goes up to Mrs. Caryll's room, takes a favorite book, seats herself by a
                     window, whence no one can enter unperceived, and tries to read. But so many
                     people come in and go out, so many carriages and fiacres whirl up and down,
                     that her attention is perpetually distracted. How long the hours are—how the
                     morning drags—will he <emph>never</emph> come? Eleven, twelve, one! Will he
                     return to luncheon at two? He hardly ever eats luncheon, but surely he will
                     come. How dazzlingly bright the sunshine is—her eyes ache. She rises with an
                     impatient sigh and closes the curtains. A brass band somewhere near is
                     thundering forth its music. They are playing one of Felicia's popular airs. She
                     wishes they would stop; the noise makes her head ache. Mrs. Caryll is dozing in
                     her chair. The brazen braying of the band is beginning to make France sleepy
                     too. Just as her tired eyes close, and her head droops against the back of her
                     chair, Susan taps softly and enters the room.</p>
                  <p>"Miss France." She has to repeat the name before the<pb n="360-361"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000179"/> girl looks up. "Miss France, there is a lady in
                     the salon to see you."</p>
                  <p>"A lady." For a moment her heart had bounded. But, only a lady!</p>
                  <p>"Susan," she impatiently exclaims, "<emph>hasn't</emph> Mr. Gordon come yet?
                     Surely he must be in his room or—"</p>
                  <p>"No, Miss France, he hasn't come yet. And the lady is waiting in the
                     salon—"</p>
                  <p>"Who is she? Where is her card? I am not dressed. I don't wish to see any
                     one."</p>
                  <p>"She would not give her name; she sent up no card. She said she wished to see
                     Miss Forrester at once on very important business."</p>
                  <p>"Very important business!" Miss Forrester rises, opening her hazel eyes.
                     "Important business!" Again her heart leaps—is it anything about Gordon? "In
                     the salon, you say, Susan? I'll go down at once."</p>
                  <p>She goes. In the long, cool salon, the jalousies are half-closed, and in the
                     dim, greenish light a lady sits. A lady very elegantly
                        dressed—<emph>over</emph>-dressed, it seems to France, her face hidden by a
                     close, black lace veil.</p>
                  <p>"You wished to see me, madame?" Miss Forrester says gently, and marvelling who
                     her veiled visitor can be.</p>
                  <p>The lady turns, rises. "Miss Forrester?" she says, interrogatively, and Miss
                     Forrester, still standing, bows.</p>
                  <p>"You wished to see me on important business—"</p>
                  <p>France does not finish the sentence, for the lady quietly removes her veil, and
                     they stand face to face. A very beautiful and striking face France sees, and
                     oddly familiar, though for the moment she cannot place it. Only for a moment,
                     then she recoils a step.</p>
                  <p>"Madame Felicia!" she exclaims.</p>
                  <p>"Madame Felicia!" the actress repeats, with a graceful stage bow and a coolly
                     insolently smile. "Now you know why I did not send up my name. You would not
                     have seen me."</p>
                  <p>Miss Forrester has recovered herself. Surprised excessively she is still;
                     intensely curious she is also, but outwardly she is only calmly, quietly
                     courteous.</p>
                  <p>"You mistake," she says, in the same coldly gentle tone; "I would have seen
                     you. May I ask to what I owe this unexpected visit?"</p>
                  <p>She seats herself at a distance, near one of the windows, and glances at her
                     watch as a hint to be brief. Madame Felicia takes the hint. The coolly insolent
                     smile yet lingers round the full, red lips, the yellowish black eyes (like a
                     cat's eyes, France thinks) have an exultant, triumphant light.</p>
                  <p>"I will not detain you long," she says; "and I think what I have to say will
                     not bore you. May I ask—although I <emph>know</emph> you have not—have you seen
                     Mr. Gordon Caryll this morning?"</p>
                  <p>France's heart gives one leap. It <emph>is</emph> something about Gordon after
                     all. Her dark face pales slightly; and she has to pause a second before she can
                     quite steady her voice.</p>
                  <p>"And may <emph>I</emph> ask," she says, haughtily, "in what way that concerns
                     you?"</p>
                  <p>"It concerns me much more nearly than you think," the actress answers. "You
                     shall hear presently. I know you have not seen him this morning, else you would
                     not be sitting here with me now. I thought I would be beforehand with him, and
                     I am. I thought he would hardly have the courage to come straight from me to
                     you."</p>
                  <p>The blood rushes in a torrent to France's face, to her temples.</p>
                  <p>"From me to you!" There is a great green tub of jessamines in full bloom
                     standing behind her. Is it the sweet, sickly odor of the flowers that turns her
                     so deathly faint now? "From you to me," she repeats; "I don't know what you
                     mean."</p>
                  <p>"I am quite sure you don't. Mr. Caryll has not been visible here this morning
                     because he has been with me. He left me just one hour and a half ago, and I
                     dressed at once and came to see you. You should hear the story from me as well
                     as from him. I was resolved I should have no more of your blame than was my
                     due. I saw you in the box last night at the Varieties. I saw you often last
                     spring in London. You looked good, and brave, and noble, and although I care
                     little for the opinion of the world, of its women particularly<pb n="362-363"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000180"/> ticularly," with a reckless laugh, "it is my
                     whim to stand as well as possible with you. I felt sure I would be before him.
                     Men do not hasten to tell such a story as he has to tell you."</p>
                  <p>Oh, the deathly faintness of these jessamine flowers. Oh, the horrible
                     clashing, crashing of the band, whose braying seems to pierce her head. For a
                     moment France turns so giddy and sick that she cannot speak. The actress half
                     rises in alarm.</p>
                  <p>"Miss Forrester! you are going to faint—"</p>
                  <p>But France lifts her hand and motions her to be still.</p>
                  <p>"Wait," she says, almost in a whisper. "You have frightened me. I am all right
                     again. Now go on."</p>
                  <p>She sits upright with an effort, clenches her hands together in her lap, and
                     sets her teeth.</p>
                  <p>"Go on!" she says almost fiercely, and looks Madame Felicia full in the
                     face.</p>
                  <p>The insolent smile, the exultant light, have died out of the dark face of the
                     dancer. In its stead a touch of pity has come. After all, this girl is to
                     suffer as she suffered once—and she remembers well what <emph>that</emph>
                     means.</p>
                  <p>"Miss Forrester," she says, gravely, "did you notice nothing unusual in Mr.
                     Caryll's looks or manner last night at the Varieties—last night, when he saw
                     me?"</p>
                  <p>Did she? Did she not? The ashen pallor of his face, the husky tone of his
                     voice, and his abrupt departure!</p>
                  <p>"Go on," she says, under her breath again.</p>
                  <p>"Let me ask you one other question," says Madame Felicia. "You are to marry
                     Gordon Caryll?"</p>
                  <p>"I am."</p>
                  <p>She seems to answer by no volition of her own. Even at this moment it strikes
                     her—what an odd thing that she, France Forrester, should be sitting here
                     answering whatever questions this dancing-woman chooses to ask.</p>
                  <p>"You know his story, of course—that he had a wife, that he was divorced. You
                     think, you all think, he is a widower."</p>
                  <p>"Yes," France says in the same mechanical way—slowly and dully, "he is a
                     widower."</p>
                  <p>"He is <emph>not</emph> a widower," Madame Felicia cries, with one flash of her
                     black eyes—"no more than I am a widow. <emph>He</emph> thought me dead, thought
                     me killed in a railway accident. I was not. For seventeen years we have not
                     met. Last night we did. Miss Forrester, I am Gordon Caryll's wife!"</p>
                  <p>"His wife!" France has known it before it is said. "His wife! his wife!" How
                     oddly it sounds. She is conscious of no acute pain—her principal wish, as she
                     listens almost dreamily, is that that horrible band would cease and that she
                     could get away from the smell of these jessamines.</p>
                  <p>"You do not seem to understand, Miss Forrester," Felicia cries sharply. "I
                     repeat, I am Gordon Caryll's divorced wife."</p>
                  <p>"I understand," France says, dreamily. "Go on."</p>
                  <p>"Does it not matter to you, then?" madame cries still more sharply. "Would you
                     marry a divorced man?"</p>
                  <p>"No. Go on."</p>
                  <p>There is a moment's silence. It is evident her quietude puzzles madame. It
                     cannot puzzle her any more than it does France herself. By and by, she feels
                     dimly, she will suffer horribly. Just at present she feels in the hazy trance
                     of the lotus eater, listening to the music of the band, looking at the sunshine
                     lying in broad, golden bands on the carpet, inhaling the scent of the
                     jessamine. To the day of her death those will turn her sick and faint.</p>
                  <p>"Go on," she says quite gently, unable to get beyond these two words, and
                     madame incisively <emph>goes</emph> on.</p>
                  <p>"He recognized me last night," she says, her voice hardening as she sees how
                     quietly the other takes it. "I had recognized him long before, since I saw his
                     picture at the Academy, 'How the Night Fell.' Well—last night he saw me, and,
                     naturally, knew me at once. I have not changed much—so they tell me."</p>
                  <p>There is a pause—madame watching her, half irritated by her profound calm. Miss
                     Forrester watching the flickering bars of light on the carpet.</p>
                  <p>"Is it her training, or is it want of feeling?" the actress wonders. "No, I
                     think not that. They are all alike—these aristocrats—ready to stand like a red
                     Indian and die game.<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC6444-00000181"/> I fancy his
                     slumbers were rather disturbed last night," she goes on, with a hard laugh; "he
                     looked like it this morning when he came to me."</p>
                  <p>Miss Forrester lifts her eyes from the carpet, and looks at Felicia. "Why did
                     he go to you?" she asks.</p>
                  <p>"Chiefly, I think, because he wanted to make certainty more than certain,
                     partly because he knew his child—<emph>our</emph> child—was with me, and he
                     wanted to see her."</p>
                  <p>A pang that is like a red-hot knife-thrust goes through France Forrester's
                     heart. <emph>Our</emph> child! Yes, this woman has been his wife, is the mother
                     of his child. She gives a little gasp.</p>
                  <p>"You—you let him see her?"</p>
                  <p>"I did <emph>not</emph> let him see her—I am not quite a fool. As I told him he
                     shall see her one day to his cost. She is mine, and I mean to keep her. His
                     name he took from me—his child he cannot."</p>
                  <p>There is silence again. The pity has died out of Felicia's face; it is hard,
                     and bitter, and relentless as she speaks again.</p>
                  <p>"All the evil he could work me he did. I loved him and he left me—he cast me
                     off with scorn and hatred. I swore revenge; but what can a woman—even a bad
                     woman—do? Look, here, Miss Forrester!" Her voice rose rapidly and her eyes
                     flashed. "In marrying me he fell a victim to a plot, an unscrupulous plot, I
                     don't deny. I was not Major Lovell's daughter; I was no fit wife for such as
                     he—I was taken from the lowest concert-room of New York city. When I was a baby
                     I was thrown upon the streets; I had to make my own living, and earn the crusts
                     I lived on. I knew no mother, no father, no God. To make money—to wear fine
                     clothes anyhow—that was my religion. Lovell came and took me, and Gordon Caryll
                     saw and fell in love with me. He asked no questions—he married me. And I loved
                     him with a love that would have been my earthly salvation, if he had let it. I
                     was true to him, in thought, and word, and action; I would have given my life
                     for him. Then Lovell died, and dying told his story. I fled, and hid myself
                     from his first fury; I knew he would take my life if we met. And then, months
                     after, he found me out, and spurned me as he would a dog, and showed me the
                     decree of divorce, and left me forever. Miss Forrester, I was a fool, I know,
                     but I fell down there on the sands where he quitted me like a dead woman. It
                     would have been better for him and for you today," with another reckless laugh,
                     "if I had died. But—here I am."</p>
                  <p>She broke off abruptly. In the dark eyes looking at her she read nothing but a
                     great and infinite pity.</p>
                  <p>"Poor soul!" France said, softly, "you loved him, and were his wife. It was
                     hard on you."</p>
                  <p>Madame shrugged her shoulders.</p>
                  <p>"I have survived it, you see. Men die and worms eat them, but not for love!
                     That night my baby was born. There is the story. You have heard it often
                     before, no doubt. He is divorced—I cannot stop your marriage. Do as you
                     will—only I had to come and tell you this."</p>
                  <p>She arose as she spoke. France stood up, too, and drew a step nearer.</p>
                  <p>"Madame," she softly said, wistful wonder in her eyes, "do you—do you love him
                     yet?"</p>
                  <p>Once more madame laughed.</p>
                  <p>"Love! Ma foi! it is years since I knew what the word meant. Only fools ever
                     love. Not I, Miss Forrester! I hate him as I do—well, not the devil—for I have
                     no reason to hate <emph>him</emph>. No, no! it would be strange, indeed, if I
                     did; I finished with all that forever the evening we parted by the Quebec
                     shore. I am to marry the Prince Di Venturini in a month; but marrying and
                     loving—well, they are different things"</p>
                  <p>"Does <emph>he</emph> know of this?" France asked, hardly knowing why she did
                     ask.</p>
                  <p>"M. Di Venturini? Not yet—not at all if I can help it. And I don't think he
                     ever will. Mr. Caryll will not tell, and I am quite sure I shall not."</p>
                  <p>She moved to the door; on the threshold she paused.</p>
                  <p>"Are you angry with me for coming?" she demanded, abruptly.</p>
                  <pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC6444-00000182"/>
                  <p>"Angry?" France echoed, wearily. "Oh, no; why should I be?"</p>
                  <p>Angry! No, she was angry with no one. She felt tired and sick, and worn out—she
                     would like to be alone, to darken her room and lie down, and get away from the
                     distracting music of that ceaseless band, from the dazzling glare of the
                     sunshine, from the heavy odor of the flowers. But, angry—no. A touch of pity
                     crossed again madame's hard, insolent beauty.</p>
                  <p>"I am sorry for you," she said. "You look good and gentle—you deserve to be
                     happy. Yes, I <emph>am</emph> sorry for you."</p>
                  <p>And then she had left the room, and her silks were rustling down the wide
                     stairway, and France was alone.</p>
                  <p>Alone! She leaned her folded arms on the table, and laid her face down upon
                     them and drew a long, tired sigh. It was all over; and the woman was gone, and
                     out of France's life all the happiness was forever gone, too.</p>
                  <p>Gordon's wife! How strangely it sounded. <emph>She</emph> was to have been
                     that—she never could be now. If he were dead and in his coffin, she could not
                     be one whit more widowed than she was. There was a dull sort of aching at her
                     heart—but no acute pain. She wondered at her own torpor.</p>
                  <p>The band was striking up another tune, She could <emph>not</emph> endure that.
                     She arose and toiled slowly and wearily up the stairs to her own room. The
                     great hotel was very still. She reached her chamber, lowered the blinds, threw
                     herself face downward on the bed.</p>
                  <p>"Gordon's wife! Gordon's wife!" Over and over, like some refrain, the words
                     rang in her ears. Then they grew fainter and fainter—died out altogether; and
                     in the midst of her great trouble France fell fast asleep.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
                  <head type="sub">"THE PARTING THAT THEY HAD."</head>
                  <p>THE last amber glitter of the sunset was gleaming through the closed jalousies,
                     and lying in broad yellow bars on the carpet, when France awoke. Awoke with a
                     great start, suddenly, and broad awake, her horrible trouble flashing upon her
                     with the vividness and swiftness of lightning, Gordon's wife was alive;
                        <emph>she</emph> could never be that; she must give him up at once and
                     forever. Then a passionate sense of desperation and misery seized her.</p>
                  <p>"I cannot! I cannot!" she cried out, clenching her hands and flinging herself
                     face downward among the pillows. "Oh, I <emph>cannot</emph> give him up!"</p>
                  <p>The yellow light flickered, faded, grew gray. One by one the golden bars aslant
                     the carpet slid out of sight. Ten minutes more and the closed room was almost
                     dark. And slowly the wild tempest of hysterical sobs was subsiding, too violent
                     to be long-lived, but France Forrester did not move. Presently it died away
                     altogether, and kneeling by the bedside, her face bowed in her hands, she was
                     seeking for strength to bear her bitter sorrow where strength alone can be
                     found.</p>
                  <p>"Thou whose life was all trouble," France's soul cried, "help me to bear
                     this!"</p>
                  <p>No thought had ever come to her that he was free—that legally she might become
                     his wife to-morrow in all honor before the world. Her French mother had reared
                     her in a faith which teaches that divorce is impossible—a faith which holds
                     marriage a sacrament, too holy to be broken by law of man, in which, "until
                     death doth ye part," is meant in the fullest and most awful sense of the words.
                     His wife lived<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC6444-00000183"/> —his wife, although
                     she were Princess Di Venturini within the hour—and she and Gordon, even as
                     friends, must meet no more. Friends! Ah, no, they could never meet as that; and
                     so they must meet just once, and say good-by forever.</p>
                  <p>She got up at last, utterly exhausted in body and mind. How still the vast
                     hotel was. How dark the room had grown. She drew up the blinds in a sort of
                     panic and let in the gray light of evening. It was almost night. Perhaps Gordon
                     had come and was waiting for her. She must go to him at once, at once.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, my poor dear," she thought, "you have borne so much—could you not have
                     been spared this last, bitterest blow?"</p>
                  <p>She went down stairs without pause. If he had returned at all, he would be in
                     the salon; he would not tell his mother until he had told her—that she felt.
                     She never stopped to think of her white cheeks and swollen eyes; he was alone
                     and in trouble, and she must go to him.</p>
                  <p>Yes, he had come. As she softly pushed the door open she saw him. He was
                     sitting where she had sat three hours ago. Three hours! was it only that? Three
                     years seemed to have passed since this morning. He sat, his folded arms on the
                     table, his head lying on them—his whole attitude despairing and broken
                     down.</p>
                  <p>He did not hear her as she entered and crossed the room, neither heard nor saw,
                     until she laid one hand lightly on his shoulder and spoke.</p>
                  <p>"Gordon!"</p>
                  <p>Then he looked up. To her dying day that look would haunt her, so full of
                     utter, infinite despair. Those haggard, hopeless eyes might almost have told
                     her the story, had Madame Felicia never come. Haggard and hopeless as they
                     were, they were quick even in this supreme hour to see the change in her.</p>
                  <p>"You have been crying?" he said.</p>
                  <p>In all the months they had been together he had never seen the trace of tears
                     on France's happy face before. The sight of those swollen eyelids and
                     tear-blotted cheeks struck him now as with a sense of actual physical pain.</p>
                  <p>"What is it?" he asked. "'Ill news travels apace,' but I hardly think," with a
                     harsh sort of laugh, "mine can have reached you already. France, my own love,
                     what is it?"</p>
                  <p>But she shrank away, drawing her hand from his grasp, and covering her eyes
                     with the other.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Gordon, hush!" she cried out; "I cannot bear it. I—," with a great gasp,
                     "I know all."</p>
                  <p>"All!" His face turned of a dull, grayish pallor, his eyes never left her.
                     "France, do you know what you are saying? What do you mean by all?"</p>
                  <p>"That—that—" No, her dry lips would not speak the words. "Madame Felicia has
                     been here," she said, with a quick desperate gesture, and walked away to the
                     window.</p>
                  <p>The bright street below was dazzling with gas-lights—golden stars studded the
                     violet February sky. Carriages filled with brilliant ladies flew ceaselessly
                     by—the brilliant life of the most brilliant capital of the world was at its
                     height. And France leaned her forehead against the cool glass and wondered,
                     with a dull sickness of heart, if only this time yesterday she had indeed been
                     happier than the happiest of them all.</p>
                  <p>Gordon Caryll had risen from his chair and stood looking at her, actually
                     dumbfounded by her last words. In whatever way she might have heard the
                     loathsome truth, he had never thought of this—that <emph>she</emph> would have
                     the untold audacity to force an entrance here.</p>
                  <p>"France!" he exclaimed, a dark flush of intense anger crimsoning his face; "do
                     you mean what you say?—that woman has dared come here?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," she said, wearily. "Ah, don't be angry, Gordon. What does it matter,
                     since I must know it?—what difference who tells the tale? She is not to blame,
                     poor soul, for being alive."</p>
                  <p>"Poor soul!" he repeats, in a strange, tense tone. "Do you mean Felicia—that
                     utterly vile and abandoned creature? Is it possible you pity
                     <emph>her?</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"With all my heart, Gordon—more, almost, than I pity myself, and I do pity
                     myself," France said, with a wistful sort of pathos in her voice. "I was so
                     happy—so happy!"</p>
                  <pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC6444-00000184"/>
                  <p>He stood for a moment silent—struggling, it seemed, with his own rebellious
                     heart. The angry glow faded from his face. In its place an infinite sadness
                     came.</p>
                  <p>"When did she come? Will you tell me what she said?" he asked.</p>
                  <p>"She came this afternoon—about three. It seems like a whole lifetime ago,
                     somehow," France answered, in the same weary way, passing her hand across her
                     eyes; "and she told me she was your—your wife."</p>
                  <p>And then suddenly her strength breaks down, her voice falters and fails, and
                     she clenches her hands together, and is silent.</p>
                  <p>"She is no wife of mine!" he says, fiercely. "Years ago the law freed me from
                     the maddest marriage ever madman made. France, why should we sacrifice the
                     happiness of our whole lives to her? Let us set her at defiance. She is no more
                     to me—and you know it—than any of the painted women who danced with her last
                     night. She shall <emph>not</emph> part us. She shall not blight your life as
                     she has mine. France, I cannot give you up—don't look at me like that—I tell
                     you I will not give you up. You shall be my wife."</p>
                  <p>She made no struggle as he held her hands. She stood and looked at him, in
                     grave calm.</p>
                  <p>"Let me go, Gordon!" is all she says, and with a sort of groan, he obeys. "I
                     can never be your wife now, and you know it. I am sorry for you, sorry for
                     myself, sorrier than I can say; only if we are to part friends, never speak to
                     me again like that."</p>
                  <p>He turned from her, his brows knit, his lips set.</p>
                  <p>"Forgive me," he said, bitterly; "I will not offend again. It is easy for you,
                     no doubt, to give me up; I was but a doubtful prize from first to last—no one
                     knows it better than I; but you see it is not quite so easy for me. I have
                     grown to love you, in the mad and idiotic way in which I have done most things
                     all my life; and that woman (whom you honor with your pity, by the way,) has
                     made such an utter failure of the best part of it, that now, when hope and
                     happiness were mine once more, it seems rather hard she should crop up to make
                     an end of it all. I have earned my retribution richly, I am aware—all the same,
                     it is bitter to bear."</p>
                  <p>She looked down at him with eyes of sorrowful wonder and reproach. Was this
                     Gordon—her hero, her "man of men?"</p>
                  <p>"Easy for me!" she repeated, her lips quivering. "You were but a 'doubtful
                     prize' from the first! Ah, I have not deserved that. I don't know whether
                     hearts break—I suppose not, but I feel as if mine were breaking tonight. See,
                     Gordon! I love you so dearly—so greatly, that there is nothing on earth I would
                     not do for you, suffer for you, only—commit a crime. And to marry a man whose
                     divorced wife lives, is to my mind one of the blackest, most heinous crimes any
                     woman can commit. All my life I will love you—I could not help that if I
                     would—all my life I will be true to you, all my life I will pray for you. Only
                     don't say bitter and cynical things any more—it is hard enough to bear without
                     that."</p>
                  <p>Her words, her tone, touch him strangely and tenderly. The anger, the fierce
                     temptation—each dies out, never to return. There is even the shadow of a smile
                     on his lips as he looks up. <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"'I could not love thee, dear, so much,</l>
                           <l>Loved I not honor more!'"</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q> he murmurs. "Forgive me, France; you are right, as you always are—you are
                     all that is brave, and noble, and womanly. Only—that does not make the losing
                     you any the easier."</p>
                  <p>And then there is silence, and both look out at the gaslit panorama below,
                     while the heavy minutes pass. So long the silence lasts, that France grows
                     frightened, and breaks it with an effort.</p>
                  <p>"You knew her last night?" she asks.</p>
                  <p>"At once," he answers, in a dull, slow way; "the very moment she appeared.
                     France, do you recollect the night of Lady Dynely's ball last autumn? I saw her
                     portrait that night—the vignette, you remember, on Di Venturini's waltzes; and
                     I recognized the face. But I would <emph>not</emph>believe<pb n="372-373"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000185"/> lieve it—it seemed too horrible to be true. It
                     was some one who resembled her, I said to myself—a relation, perhaps; but she
                     was dead—dead beyond doubt. It is easy to believe what we wish to believe. I
                     never thought of her again until she stood before me on the stage."</p>
                  <p>"I knew by your face something had happened," France says, softly, "but I never
                     dreamed of that."</p>
                  <p>"How could you? Oh, my poor child, it is not alone that she spoils my life, but
                     to think she should have power to spoil yours! To think that you should suffer
                     for my sins at this late day."</p>
                  <p>"We all suffer for the sins of others," France says, and somehow says it
                     bravely. "We might all safely take the battle cry of the strong old Crusaders
                     for our staff of strength, '<emph>God Wills It</emph>.' It is inevitable—don't
                     let us talk of it—since it is no longer a question of talking, but endurance.
                     You saw her this morning?"</p>
                  <p>"I did. I wished to make assurance doubly sure, as they say, before I came to
                     you. For I knew what you would say—that the decree of divorce, which freed me
                     seventeen years ago, would be no freedom in your eyes. And, my darling, the
                     thought of losing you was, and is, more bitter than the bitterness of
                     death."</p>
                  <p>"Don't!" she says, with a gasp, "don't! don't!"</p>
                  <p>"I saw her," he went on, "and I knew all hope was at an end. The girl I had
                     married seventeen years ago in Canada was before me—Madame Felicia. I lingered
                     but a few moments—it was her hour of vengeance, and I think even she was
                     satisfied. And the child is with her—did she tell you that?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes—she told me. Oh, Gordon! if she would but give her up."</p>
                  <p>"She <emph>shall</emph> give her up," Gordon Caryll said, his mouth setting
                     hard and tense beneath his beard; "if not by fair means, then by foul. She is
                     no fit guardian for any young girl. Terry Dennison will help me here; and, one
                     way or other, my daughter shall come into my keeping."</p>
                  <p>"Terry?" Miss Forrester said, in surprise.</p>
                  <p>As briefly as possible Caryll narrated the odd manner in which Terry had been
                     instrumental in bringing the girl to her mother.</p>
                  <p>"Dennison can keep a secret—I know no man I would trust as I do him. You will
                     not mind my telling him all, France? All?"</p>
                  <p>"No," she answered; "you may tell Terry, but—not Eric."</p>
                  <p>"Eric!" Caryll repeated contemptuously; "Eric is a fool! And my mother must
                     know."</p>
                  <p>"Your mother, of course. Ah, poor grandmamma! it will be a blow to her."</p>
                  <p>He caught at her words.</p>
                  <p>"Must I really go, France—really and truly—and leave you and my mother
                     alone?"</p>
                  <p>"Gordon, you know you must."</p>
                  <p>"I don't know it," he said, recklessly; "if you cannot be my wife, at least we
                     can be friends, and together—"</p>
                  <p>"We can never be together. You can do as you please," her head drooping, her
                     voice faltering; "it is your place to stay with your mother, of course. I will
                     ask Lady Dynely to take me back to England at once."</p>
                  <p>"Stay, France!" he said, rising hastily. "Forgive me once more. No, I will
                     go—it will be best so; and immediately—to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>Then again silence fell, and both stood apart, neither able to speak the words
                     that must come next. In five minutes they must say good-by and forever.</p>
                  <p>A carriage whirled up before the hotel. The door opened, and Eric, looking
                     unutterably bored by his day's "on duty," got out and assisted his wife and
                     mother to alight.</p>
                  <p>"Here they are," Caryll exclaimed, starting back. "I cannot meet them, any of
                     them. Make my adieux to Lucia to-morrow; tell her, if you like, I shall not see
                     her again. France—"</p>
                  <p>And then he was clasping both her hands hard, and looking in her face with that
                     straining gaze we look on the face we love best the instant before the
                     coffin-lid is shut down.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Gordon!" she cried out, "where will you go?"</p>
                  <p>"I don't know, I don't care—what does it matter?"</p>
                  <pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC6444-00000186"/>
                  <p>"You will write to—to your mother?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I will write. I will see her now and say good-by. I will see Dennison,
                     too, before I leave Paris. Oh, my France! my France! how can I give you
                     up!"</p>
                  <p>There were footsteps and voices in the hall—on the stairs. One moment and the
                     Dynelys would be upon them.</p>
                  <p>"Good-by, France! good-by! good-by!"</p>
                  <p>And then he was gone. And France, breathless, and white, had fallen upon the
                     sofa, feeling as though the whole world had come to an end.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
                  <head type="sub">"IF ANY CALM, A CALM DESPAIR."</head>
                  <p>IF they would not come in, if she could be alone—that seemed the only thought
                     of which France was conscious, as she lay there, utterly unable for the time
                     being to speak or move, knowing, in a dazed sort of way, what a ghastly face
                     the wax-lights would show them. Oh, to be alone—to be alone!</p>
                  <p>She had her wish. A swish of silk, a flutter of perfume, the saloon door flung
                     wide, and Lady Dynely's voice saying, impatiently:</p>
                  <p>"All darkness, and coldness, and solitude. Where can they be? where is
                     France?"</p>
                  <p>"With Mrs. Caryll, mamma," Crystal's soft voice suggests. "It looks dreary—that
                     great, gilded saloon; let us go up to your boudoir."</p>
                  <p>So they go, and France feels as though she had escaped some great danger. She
                     rises, feeling stiff and strange, and gropes her way out through the darkness,
                     and up to her own room. She has to pass Mrs. Caryll's door; she pauses a
                     moment, while a passionate longing to enter there, at all risks, to look on his
                     face once more, even to bid him stay, seizes her. Her wedding day is so
                     near—oh, so near—and they have been so infinitely happy together. What right
                     has that wicked, dancing, painted woman to come and tear them apart? For a
                     moment she listens to the tempter, then she clasps her hands over her eyes, and
                     rushes up to her room. Lights are burning here; she locks the door, and throws
                     herself on the bed, there to lie motionless, sleepless, all the long night
                     through.</p>
                  <p>The Dynelys dine alone. No one can tell, it seems, what has become of the
                     Carylls and Miss Forrester. Mrs.<pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC6444-00000187"/>
                     Caryll's room is forbidden—her mistress is ill to-night, the maid gravely tells
                     Lady Dynely. Even she cannot be admitted. Miss Forrester's door is locked, and
                     Miss Forrester may be deaf or dead for all the attention she pays to knocks or
                     calls. It is really very odd, and Lady Dynely wonders about it, all through the
                     rather dull family dinner, to her son and daughter.</p>
                  <p>Rather dull! It is horribly dull to Eric. He forfeits a banquet at Francetti's
                     this evening, with half a dozen congenial spirits, for this
                     "bosom-of-his-family" sort of thing, and worse still, forfeits his stall at the
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Variétés</foreign>, to do escort duty for his harem,
                     to the Opera aux Italiens. But since he is in for it, he does it with tolerably
                     good grace, and Crystal's wan, moonlight little face lights, and smiles come to
                     the pale lips. She says little, but she is happy. Eric has been her very own
                     all day—will be her very own until noon to-morrow. Beyond that she does not
                     look—"unto the day, the day."</p>
                  <p>Dinner ends, and they go to the opera. Patti sings, and the grand opera house
                     is brilliant with ladies in marvellous toilettes. If France were only here,
                     Eric thinks, as he struggles manfully with his tenth yawn, it would not be so
                     bad, but a man cast over wholly to the tender mercies of his mother and his
                     wife, is an object of compassion to gods and men.</p>
                  <p>About the time the Dynely party take their places in their private box on the
                     grand tier, Gordon Caryll opens the door of his mother's room, and passes
                     out.</p>
                  <p>He goes up to his room, where his valet awaits him, and gives his few orders. A
                     portmanteau is to be packed at once—he (the valet) is to follow with the rest
                     to Liverpool, before the end of the week. That is all—and the man listens with
                     an immovable, wooden face, outwardly, in direst, blankest wonder within.</p>
                  <p>"Blessed," he says, as his master departs, "if this here ain't a rum go! I
                     thought we was going to be married, at the British Hembassy; and now we're up
                     and hoff 'ot foot, with all our luggage, hover to Liverpool. I wonder where we
                     go hafter that?"</p>
                  <p>"We" were going to America once again—to California—Nevada—Oregon—all the wild,
                     new lands, whither "we" had never set foot yet. Not to forget—that could never
                     be! But life, it seemed, amid perpetual hardship and adventure, amid wild
                     regions and wilder men, would be more easily dragged out without hope than
                     elsewhere.</p>
                  <p>He had told his mother; and she had listened in such wonder, such pain, such
                     pity, as words cannot tell. She had set her heart on this match, and it was
                     never to be. Her whole happiness in life was wrapped up in her son, and he was
                     to be taken from her. He must go—since this woman stood between him and France
                     forever, better, far better, they should part.</p>
                  <p>"I would rather go," he had said; "not to forget, not to suffer less—I do not
                     hope that, I do not even wish it; but I cannot stay and face the wonder, the
                     scandal, that will ensue. I am a coward, if you like, but I underwent the
                     ordeal once, and—" he set his teeth hard and stopped.</p>
                  <p>"Yet, I will stay if you wish," he said, after a moment's pause. "I will stay
                     with you, and," another pause, "<emph>she</emph> can return to England with
                     Lucia Dynely."</p>
                  <p>But the mother, whose life was bound up in him, clasped her arms about his
                     neck, and answered:</p>
                  <p>"You must go, Gordon. France is right—she can never be your wife, while that
                     woman lives, and so parting is best for you both. You must go, and may Heaven's
                     blessing be with you."</p>
                  <p>And then there had been a parting, so sad, so solemn, last words so sweet, so
                     motherly, a parting prayer so earnest, so holy, that the fierce wrath and hot
                     rebellion had died out, and somehow calm had come. He had left the hotel, very
                     pale, very grave, a great sadness on his face, but otherwise unchanged.</p>
                  <p>He must see Dennison before he left. He went to the Louvre and found him,
                     providentially, lounging aimlessly about, and looking bored.</p>
                  <p>"De do, Caryll," Terry began, abbreviating the formula, and swallowing a gape.
                     "Awfully slow work this. Haven't seen a face I know since noon. Was at your
                     place, and<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC6444-00000188"/> found the family
                     invisible—dead or sleeping. Eric is doing the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >rôle</foreign> of Master Tommy Goodchild—trotting out the madre and
                     Crystal, and making a martyr of himself, I know. But I say, old boy, anything
                     wrong, you know? On my life, now I look again, you seem awfully seedy."</p>
                  <p>"We can talk in the street, I suppose?" Caryll answers, abruptly, and taking
                     his arm. "I have something of importance to say to you. Come this way.
                     Dennison, I'm off to-morrow!"</p>
                  <p>"Off?" Terry repeats the word and stares.</p>
                  <p>"Off for good and all—to return no more—to the other end of the world. It's all
                     up between me and—Terry, can't you guess? I thought you did last night. Madame
                     Felicia is my divorced wife."</p>
                  <p>There is a pause, a speechless, breathless pause. Mr. Dennison looks at the
                     moon, the stars, the sky, the streets, the gaslights, the people, and all spin
                     round. At last, "By Jove!" he breathes, and is still.</p>
                  <p>Caryll does not speak—his mouth is set rigid and hard behind his beard. They
                     walk on, and the silence grows uncomfortable. Terry in desperation breaks it
                     first.</p>
                  <p>"I thought she was dead," is what he says.</p>
                  <p>"So did I," Caryll answers; "so did they in Canada, so the papers said. She is
                     not, however. Madame Felicia seventeen years ago was my wife; the girl you
                     rescued on the streets two nights ago my daughter."</p>
                  <p>"Little Black Eyes! By Jove!" Terry aspirates again.</p>
                  <p>"I fancied you must have suspected something of this since last night. I
                     recognized her at the theatre. I visited her this morning. There is not a
                     shadow of doubt. The dancer, Felicia, is my divorced wife."</p>
                  <p>"By Jove!" once again is all Terry can say, in his blank amaze. "And France?"
                     he asks, after a pause.</p>
                  <p>"All is at an end there. In France's creed there is no such thing as divorce. I
                     am as much the husband of Felicia as though that divorce had never been."</p>
                  <p>There is another uncomfortable silence. What is Terry to say? Fluency and tact
                     are at no time his. But silence is better than speech just now.</p>
                  <p>"So I am going away," Caryll resumes, steadily; "and I leave my mother and
                     France in your charge, Dennison. I go to-morrow. When does your leave
                     expire?"</p>
                  <p>"In a fortnight."</p>
                  <p>"There will be ample time, then. My mother proposes returning to Caryllynne;
                     you will escort her thither. For the rest, Lady Dynely will be told the truth,
                     but no one else—least of all, Eric. There will be no end of conjecture, and
                     gossip, and mystification, no doubt, but since none of us will be here to hear
                     it, it won't greatly matter."</p>
                  <p>"But," Terry hazards, "will <emph>she</emph> keep the secret? They say women
                     never can, you know?"</p>
                  <p>A cold smile lights Gordon Caryll's lips.</p>
                  <p>"Trust them when it is to their own interest. Felicia has fooled M. Di
                     Venturini into offering to make her his wife. The wedding, I am told, is to
                     take place soon. <emph>He</emph> has no idea that she has ever been married—she
                     has lied to him from first to last. It is her interest to hold her tongue, and
                     now that her revenge is satisfied she will."</p>
                  <p>"It's a deuced bad business, Caryll, old fellow," Terry says, gloomily. "I'm
                     awfully sorry. Confound the woman! she seems born to work mischief and deviltry
                     to every man she meets."</p>
                  <p>"Another thing, Dennison," Caryll pursues, taking no heed; "what I principally
                     wished to speak to you about, is my daughter. By fair means or foul, she must
                     be taken from her mother and given to me. And, Terry, for this I look to
                     you."</p>
                  <p>"To me?" Terry repeats, blankly; "but how? I can't go to Felicia and demand
                     her, I can't watch my chance and steal her away. Hang it, no! She's a female
                     fiend, and I owe her no good turn, but still she is the girl's mother, and as
                     such has a right to her. I suppose she is fond of her?"</p>
                  <p>"She is not. Felicia never was fond of any human being but herself. She would
                     send the girl adrift to-morrow, only it adds to her revenge to retain her. She
                     will not treat her kindly, of that I am sure; and before the week ends the poor
                     child will need but the offer to fly. My mother will gladly receive and care
                     for her. Terry, you must see her for<pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC6444-00000189"/>
                     me. Let her know the truth. You have been of service to her and she will trust
                     you, Explain everything; tell her a better home and kinder relatives than she
                     has ever known await her. She will go with you of her own free will—take my
                     word for that."</p>
                  <p>"Well, I'll try. I'll do my best," Terry said. "Hang it, Caryll! there's
                     nothing I <emph>wouldn't</emph> do for you and France. I suppose they—your
                     mother and Miss Forrester—are awfully cut up."</p>
                  <p>"Naturally. Don't speak of it, Terry. I know I can trust you; and if anything
                     could help me now, it would be that knowledge. There is no more to be said, I
                     believe. Look after the mother and France—get the child away from Felicia—make
                     Eric leave Paris for his wife and mother's sake if you can. A multiplicity of
                     tasks, dear boy, and the last the hardest by far; but I know it will be no
                     fault of yours if you fail. I will bid you good-by and good speed here."</p>
                  <p>They clasped hands hard in silence, then, without one word more, parted, and
                     each went his own way. Terry lit a cigar, and with his hands deep in his
                     pockets made his way gloomily back to the Hotel du Louvre.</p>
                  <p>"And if ever the fiend incarnate came on earth to work mischief in human
                     shape," Mr. Dennison inwardly growls, "he has come in the form of Felicia the
                     dancer. Devil take her! is there no end to the trouble she is destined to
                     make?"</p>
                  <p>Next morning, Lady Dynely, to her surprise and annoyance, finds herself
                     breakfasting alone. Neither Gordon Caryll nor France Forrester is to be seen
                     when she enters. She waits half an hour—still they fail to put in an
                     appearance. Lady Dynely hates solitary breakfasts, and rather pettishly rings
                     the bell.</p>
                  <p>"It's <emph>very</emph> odd," she thinks annoyedly; "all day yesterday, and now
                     again this morning, neither Gordon nor France is to be seen. And both are such
                     preposterously early risers."</p>
                  <p>Her own maid answers the summons, and her ladyship impatiently sends her in
                     quest of the truants. Ten minutes, and Simpson returns.</p>
                  <p>"Miss Forrester has not yet left her room. She is suffering from headache, and
                     begs my lady to excuse her until luncheon. For Mr. Caryll—Mr. Caryll, my lady,
                     has gone."</p>
                  <p>"Gone!" my lady repeats with a blank stare.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, my lady. Norton, his man, received his orders last night to pack up and
                     follow him at once to England. Mr. Caryll left the hotel himself late last
                     evening, and has not since returned."</p>
                  <p>Lady Dynely listens to this in dazed incredulity. France ill!—Gordon gone! Now
                     what does this mean? Her first impulse is to go to Mrs. Caryll and inquire, her
                     second to eat her breakfast and wait quietly, until she is told. She acted on
                     the second, ordered in breakfast, and sipped her chocolate as best she might
                     for the devouring curiosity that possessed her.</p>
                  <p>An hour later, and Miss Forrester came down. The dainty morning toilet was as
                     fresh and unexceptionable as ever, the pretty rich brown hair as perfectly <hi
                        rend="i"/>coiffed. But out of the dark bright face all the color was
                     stricken, out of the clear brown eyes all the youthful gladness, all the
                     loving, happy light. She went to Mrs. Caryll's room. The elder lady sat in her
                     easy-chair, dressed for the day, waiting in an anguish of suspense. As France
                     came in she opened her arms, and without a word the girl went in to them, and
                     laid her pale face on the motherly bosom with a great, tearless sob.</p>
                  <p>"My child! my child!"</p>
                  <p>She held her to her, and there was silence. The eyes of Gordon Caryll's mother
                     were full of pitying tears, but the eyes of France were dry and burning.</p>
                  <p>"I sent him away—from you who love him so dearly. Oh, mother, forgive me. I did
                     it for the best."</p>
                  <p>She says it in a choked whisper, lifting her face for a moment. Then again it
                     falls on the other's shoulder.</p>
                  <p>"It was like death, it was worse than death, but I told him to go," she says,
                     again, in that husky undertone.</p>
                  <p>"My dearest," Mrs. Caryll answers, "you did right. Dearly as I love him,
                     precious as your happiness is to me, I would rather part with him forever,
                     rather see you as I see<pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC6444-00000190"/> you now,
                     than let you be his wife while that woman lives. I believe as you believe. No
                     law of man can alter the law of God. If she was his wife seventeen years ago—my
                     child, how you shiver! are you cold?—she is his wife still. It is right and
                     just that he should have put her away—that I believe; knowing her to be alive
                     now, it is right and just also that you should have sent him from you. But, oh,
                     my dear, my dear, it is hard on you—it is very hard on him."</p>
                  <p>"Don't," France says. "Oh, mother, not yet! I <emph>can't</emph> bear it. This
                     day fortnight was to have been our wedding-day, and now—"</p>
                  <p>She breaks down all in a moment, and the tears come—a passionate rain of tears.
                     The mother holds her almost in silence, and so on her bosom lets her weep her
                     anguish out.</p>
                  <p>She is crying herself, but quietly. Great self-control has always been hers—is
                     hers still. To part with her lately-found son has been like the rending of soul
                     and body—more bitter than the bitterness of death; but she has learned, in
                     weary years of penitence and waiting, the great lesson of life—endurance. So
                     she comforts France now, in a tender, motherly fashion, and France listens, as
                     she could listen to no one on earth, this morning, but Gordon's mother.</p>
                  <p>"It is not for myself," she says at last, after her old, impetuous fashion, "it
                     is for him. He has suffered so much, atoned so bitterly in exile, and
                     loneliness, and poverty, all the best years of his life for that mad marriage
                     of his youth, and now, when I would have made him so happy, when he
                        <emph>was</emph> happy, in one instant everything is swept from him—home,
                     mother, wife—and he must go out into exile once more. Oh, mother! help me to
                     bear it! It breaks my heart!"</p>
                  <p>The wild sobs break forth again. The mother's heart echoes every word. It is
                     retribution, perhaps justice—none the less it is very bitter. They both think
                     of him, leaving all things, and going back to outlawry and wretchedness; they
                     think of her in her insolent, glowing beauty and prosperity, the world going so
                     well with her, glorying in her vengeance, and it requires all the Christianity
                     within them to refrain from hating her.</p>
                  <p>But presently the storm of grief ends, and sitting on a low hassock, her head
                     bowed on Mrs. Caryll's knee, France listens to her sad plans for the future—so
                     different, oh, so different from all the girl's bright hopes of but a day
                     before.</p>
                  <p>"We will return to England, France," Mrs. Caryll says, gravely; "to Caryllynne.
                     It has been deserted long enough. There we will live quietly together, and
                     hope, and pray, and wait—"</p>
                  <p>"Wait," France repeats with mournful bitterness. "What is there to wait for
                     now?"</p>
                  <p>What, indeed! Both are silent. Unless this fatal woman dies—and in her rich and
                     perfect health she is likely to outlive them all—what can her son ever have to
                     hope for in this lower world? For France—well, as the years go on, the elder
                     woman thinks happiness <emph>may</emph> return to her. She is so young, there
                     may be hope for her—for him, none.</p>
                  <p>"Would you rather we went to Rome?" she asks, after a pause.</p>
                  <p>"No," France says. "Let us return to Caryllynne. It was <emph>his</emph> home;
                     I shall be less wretched there than anywhere else on earth."</p>
                  <p>So it is agreed.</p>
                  <p>"Terry will take us," Mrs. Caryll says. "Terry knows all. And Lucia must be
                     told, my dear—it is impossible to keep the truth from her."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, tell her," Miss Forrester assents, wearily; "the sooner the better. And
                     ask her to spare me—to say nothing of altered looks, or of—him. I will return
                     to my room, and you had best send for her at once. She was speaking of taking
                     Crystal to Versailles—let her know all, and make an end of it before she
                     goes."</p>
                  <p>Then France toils spiritlessly, cold and white, and wretched looking, back to
                     her room, and Lady Dynely is sent for, and the miserable sequel to Gordon
                     Caryll's early marriage is told her, as she sits surprised and compassionate,
                     beside Gordon Caryll's most unhappy mother.</p>
                  <milestone n="* * * * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>"Where is he now?" is France's thought, as she sits wearily down, and lays her
                     head on the table, as though she<pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC6444-00000191"/>
                     never cared to lift it again. He is whirling along in a French express
                     train—Calais-ward. To-night he will cross the channel; by the first Cunarder
                     that quits Liverpool he will sail for New York, and so begins the second exile
                     to which his fatal wife has driven him.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
                  <head type="sub">M. LE PRINCE.</head>
                  <p>A QUIET street near the Rue de la Paix. The hour, ten in the evening. Almost
                     absolute solitude reigning—only at long intervals the footsteps of some passer
                     by awakening the echoes. Dim and afar off as it seems, the turmoil of the great
                     city coming mellowed and subdued.</p>
                  <p>One house, large, unlighted, gloomy, standing in a paved quadrangle, has had a
                     constant stream of visitors for the past two hours. They are all men—men who
                     have a stealthy and furtive look, who pass on rapidly, who give a countersign
                     to a waiting servant at the gate, who do not spend more than fifteen minutes
                     within those gloomy precincts, who flit away and disappear, only to have others
                     take their places. So it has been for the past two hours, so it is likely to be
                     until perhaps midnight.</p>
                  <p>This house is the property of his Excellency Prince Di Venturini; and M. Di
                     Venturini is the leader and moving spirit of a secret political society. For
                     upward of two months he has been absent on a mission of grave import; this is
                     the evening of his return, and the members of the society—Italians all—have
                     been summoned to their headquarters to report progress to their leader.</p>
                  <p>Outside the gloomy and secluded mansion is wrapped in profound darkness;
                     inside, halls and passages are dimly lit—one room only, that in which M. Di
                     Venturini sits, being brightly illuminated.</p>
                  <p>He sits at a table strewn with papers, letters, pamphlets—small, spare, yellow,
                     with black, glancing eyes, sharp as stilettos, and thin, compressed lips. One
                     by one, his followers<pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC6444-00000192"/> come and go;
                     one by one, their reports are noted down and docketed.</p>
                  <p>With sharp, quick precision he conducts each interview, with imperious command
                     he gives his orders, with scant ceremony he dismisses each man of them all.
                     Business of a still more private and delicate nature awaits his
                     attention—business purely personal to M. le Prince—and he rather cuts short the
                     latest comers, and hurries the levee to a close.</p>
                  <p>A clock over his head chimes eleven. With an impatient gesture he dismisses his
                     last client, flings himself back in his chair pushes his scant black hair,
                     thickly streaked with gray, off his forehead with a weary air, and then sits
                     for some minutes <unclear>lost</unclear> in deep and anxious thought. His thick
                     brows knit, his lips set themselves in a tight, tense line, then, with a second
                     impatient motion, he seizes a silver hand-bell and rings a sharp peal.</p>
                  <p>"I shall speedily learn whether it is truth or slander," he mutters. "Paujol
                     and Pauline watch her well, and they belong to me soul and body. I may trust
                     their tale, and if she has played me false, why, then—let her look to
                     herself!"</p>
                  <p>The bell is answered almost immediately by the servant who has stood on
                     guard.</p>
                  <p>He bows and awaits.</p>
                  <p>"Have they all gone?"</p>
                  <p>"All, M. le Prince."</p>
                  <p>"Has Paujol come?"</p>
                  <p>"Paujol has been awaiting your excellency's commands, for the last hour."</p>
                  <p>"Let him enter."</p>
                  <p>The man bows again and disappears.</p>
                  <p>M. le Prince lies back in his chair and plays a devil's tattoo of ill-repressed
                     impatience on its arm. Then M. Paujol enters—a very tall man, in a gorgeous
                     uniform, no other, in fact, than Madame Felicia's huge chasseur in his robes of
                     state.</p>
                  <p>"Ah! Paujol. You have been here for some time, Antoine tells me. Have you
                     obtained leave of absence, then, from madame?"</p>
                  <p>"Madame is not aware of my absence, M. le Prince. Madame departed one hour ago
                     to the bal d'opera at the Gymnase—the instant she left the Varieties, in
                     fact."</p>
                  <p>"Ah-h!" the interjection cut the air sharply as a knife; "to the bal d'opera at
                     the Gymnase. With whom?"</p>
                  <p>"With the young milor Anglais—M. le Vicomte Dynely."</p>
                  <p>A moment's silence. An ominous flash, swift, dangerous, has leaped from the
                     eyes of the Neapolitan—his cruelly thin lips set themselves a little
                     tighter.</p>
                  <p>"It is true, then! all I have heard. He is the latest pigeon madame has seen
                     fit to pluck, this green young British lordling! He is with her at all times,
                     at all places. Paris rings with his infatuation—eh, Paujol? is it so?"</p>
                  <p>"It is the talk of Paris, monseigneur, of the clubs and the salons, of the
                     streets and the theatre. Does your excellency wish me to tell you
                        <emph>what</emph> they say?"</p>
                  <p>"All, Paujol. Word for word."</p>
                  <p>"They say, then, M. le Prince, that but the English noble has a wife already,
                     madame would throw over your excellency and marry milor Dynely. They say that
                     madame has fallen in love with his handsome face, and that while your highness
                     will be the husband and dupe, <emph>he</emph> will still remain the favored
                     lover."</p>
                  <p>The hand—thin, sinewy, strong—that clasps the arm of the chair, clutches it
                     until the muscles stand out like cords. A fierce Neapolitan oath hisses from
                     his lips—otherwise he sits and listens unmoved.</p>
                  <p>"Go on, Paujol," he reiterates. "Your report is most amusing, my friend. He is
                     at madame's constantly, is he not?—he is her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">cavalier
                        servante</foreign> to all places?—his gifts are princely in their profusion
                     and splendor?—again, is it not so?"</p>
                  <p>"It is so, Illustrissima—Pauline tells me the jewels he has given her are
                     superb. He is her nightly attendant home from the theatre, he is at all her
                     receptions, each day they ride in the Bois or the Champs Elysees, he spends
                     hours in madame's salon each morning. To none of the many gentlemen whom madame
                     has honored with her regard has she shown such favor as to M. le Vicomte
                     Dynely. Madame Dynely, it is said, is dying of jealousy. All Paris laughs,<pb
                        n="388-389" xml:id="VAC6444-00000193"/> monseigneur, and when your
                     excellency returns, wonders how the drama will end."</p>
                  <p>"Paris will soon learn," monseigneur answers grimly. An ominous calm has
                     settled upon him, the devil's tattoo has quite ceased now, his black eyes
                     glitter diabolically. "Thou hast watched well, Paujol, my friend; thou shalt be
                     well rewarded. Madame dreams not then of my return?"</p>
                  <p>"She does not, your excellency. I heard her tell M. Dynely only to-day that
                     your highness would not return to Paris for another week."</p>
                  <p>A smile curled the thin lips.</p>
                  <p>"It is well. And so safe in my absence, not dreaming that her chasseur and
                     femme de chambre are my paid and devoted spies, she takes as her lover this
                     pretty-faced English boy, and all Paris laughs at <emph>me!</emph> It is well,
                     I say. But I am not the husband yet, and the English say those laugh best who
                     laugh last. And so they assist at the bal d'opera to-night? Ah, what hour does
                     madame propose returning, Paujol?"</p>
                  <p>"An hour after midnight, M. le Prince. She quits early that she and M. Dynely
                     may start early for Asnières, where they spend to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>Again that threatening flash leaps from the eyes of the prince.</p>
                  <p>"What does madame wear?" he demands.</p>
                  <p>"A domino <foreign xml:lang="FRA">noir</foreign>, with a knot of yellow ribbon
                     on the left shoulder."</p>
                  <p>"And, Monsieur?"</p>
                  <p>"Monsieur goes in full evening dress, with a yellow rose in his button-hole,
                     and lemon gloves."</p>
                  <p>Di Venturini takes out his watch.</p>
                  <p>"Half-past eleven—ample time. A million thanks, friend Paujol! As I say, your
                     fidelity shall be well rewarded. Is your report made? If so, you may
                     depart."</p>
                  <p>"One moment, monseigneur. My report is not finished—the most important part is
                     yet to come. Is your excellency aware that madame has a daughter?"</p>
                  <p>"What!"</p>
                  <p>"That madame has a daughter—a tall English mam'selle of sixteen years, at
                     present stopping with madame?"</p>
                  <p>The yellow complexion of the Neapolitan fades to a greenish white. He sits and
                     stares.</p>
                  <p>"Paujol! A daughter! What is it you say?"</p>
                  <p>"The truth, M. le Prince. A daughter and a husband. The daughter is with her
                     now, as I tell you; the husband divorced her many years ago. The daughter was
                     brought to the house late one night by an English gentleman, a friend of M.
                     Dynely, Monsieur Dennison,"—Paujol pronounces the English names with perfect
                     correctness—"and has remained ever since. Before you return, however, madame
                     proposes sending her away. The husband came once, and once only. The interview
                     was brief. Here is his card."</p>
                  <p>He draws it out and places it before him. "Gordon Caryll," Di Venturini reads.
                     For a moment he is at a loss, for a moment his memory refuses to place him.
                     Then it all comes upon him like lightning. The picture "How the Night Fell,"
                     the mysterious resemblance of the woman's face to Felicia, her determination to
                     have it at any price, and the name of the artist—Gordon Locksley, then—Gordon
                     Caryll afterwards. In common with the rest of the world he has heard Gordon
                     Caryll's story—the mad marriage of his youth, the scandal, the divorce, the
                     prolonged exile from home and country, and now—and now Paujol stands before him
                     with an immovable face, and tells him gravely that Felicia, the woman he has
                     honored with the offer of his hand, is that fatal divorced wife.</p>
                  <p>He sits for a moment, petrified, and in that moment he believes. Paujol never
                     makes mistakes, never hazards rumors without proof. She had lied to him then
                     from the beginning, duped him from first to last, and Prince Di Venturini could
                     better endure anything than the thought that he has been fooled and laughed at
                     by the woman he has loved.</p>
                  <p>"So!" he says between his teeth, "this must be seen to! Proceed, Paujol—you are
                     indeed a treasure beyond price."</p>
                  <p>Thus encouraged, M. Paujol, still with a gravely immovable face, proceeds. In
                     detail he narrates how Dennison<pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC6444-00000194"/>
                     brought to madame at midnight this waif of the streets, how madame at once
                     received her, how Pauline faithfully did her part, overheard every word of the
                     conversation that passed between mother and daughter, and faithfully repeated
                     that conversation to him. He had taken it down in writing from her lips on the
                     spot, and would read it aloud to monseigneur now.</p>
                  <p>He unfolded the document as he spoke, and slowly read it over, that momentous
                     conversation, in which "Donny" had claimed Felicia as her mother, and Felicia
                     had acknowledged her as her child—the pledge of secrecy between them, and the
                     compact by which madame was to pass her off as a distant relative. In his cold,
                     steady, monotonous voice, Paujol read it, then folded, and handed it
                     respectfully to his superior officer and master. Di Venturini, his yellow face
                     still sickly, greenish white, waited for more.</p>
                  <p>"The girl—she is still there?" he asked.</p>
                  <p>"She is still there, M. le Prince. She is to be sent away in two days. She and
                     madame have had a quarrel."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! a quarrel! What about?"</p>
                  <p>"About M'sieu Dennison. M. Dennison came yesterday, came the day before, and
                     both times asked to see the young lady he had picked up on the streets. Madame
                     put him off with a falsehood. Mam'selle was ailing and had declined to see him.
                     This Pauline repeated to mam'selle, who, it would appear, is most anxious to
                     meet again with the gentleman who rescued her. Mam'selle flew into a violent
                     passion, sought out madame and taxed her with duplicity. Madame is not
                     accustomed to being arraigned for her actions, and possesses, as monseigneur
                     doubtless is aware, a fine, high temper of her own. Before five minutes madame
                     was boxing mam'selle's ears. Mam'selle became perfectly beside herself with
                     fury, and tried to rush out of the house, but was captured and brought back by
                     Pauline, who was, as usual, on the watch. Madame then informed Pauline that
                     mam'selle was mad, quite mad, that her madness consisted in fancying her her
                     mother, that she had run away from her friends under that delusion, and that
                     now she was under the necessity of locking her up, for a day or two, until she
                     could send her safely back to those friends. The passion of mam'selle was
                     frightful to behold, so Pauline says, but she was brought back and safely
                     locked up, and so continues locked up at this present moment. She refuses to
                     speak or eat, and lies like a stone. Madame has made arrangements to have her
                     removed the day after to-morrow—where, Pauline has not as yet discovered."</p>
                  <p>Paujol pauses. Di Venturini, his face still green, his lips still set, his eyes
                     still gleaming, looks up.</p>
                  <p>"And the conversation between madame and M. Gordon Caryll—did Pauline also
                     overhear that?"</p>
                  <p>"Pauline overheard every word, monseigneur, and, as before, repeated it to me.
                     As before, I took it down in writing upon the spot, and have it here. Shall I
                     read it aloud, M. le Prince?"</p>
                  <p>By a gesture Di Venturini gives assent. Immovably Paujol stands and reads this
                     second report; immovably his master sits and listens. It leaves no room for
                     doubt—Felicia has deceived him, as thoroughly and utterly as ever woman
                     deceived man. A husband—a daughter—a lover! and <emph>he</emph> the
                     laughingstock of Paris! His face for an instant is distorted with passionate
                     fury, as Paujol places this second paper before him.</p>
                  <p>"This is all?" he hoarsely asks.</p>
                  <p>"This is all, M. le Prince."</p>
                  <p>"The girl is still locked up, you say, in madame's rooms, and madame will not
                     return from the opera ball until one o'clock? Wait, Paujol, wait!"</p>
                  <p>He leans his forehead on his hand and thinks for an instant intently. Then he
                     looks up.</p>
                  <p>"I will go with you, Paujol, first to see this girl, then to the Gymnase. I
                     have no words with which to commend the admirable manner you and Pauline have
                     done your duty. Go and call a fiacre at once."</p>
                  <p>Paujol bows low and obeys. Di Venturini sits alone. He does not for one second
                     doubt the truth of all this he has heard. His two emissaries are fidelity
                     itself—their loyalty has been long ago proven. He has long doubted the woman he
                     has asked to marry him. To-night has but made conviction<pb n="392-393"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000195"/> tion doubly sure; and Cæsare Di Venturini is not
                     a man to let man or woman, friend or foe, betray him with impunity. His face
                     looks leaden in the lamplight, his black eyes gleam with a fury that is simply
                     murderous.</p>
                  <p>"A husband who divorced her—a child whom she has hidden—a lover for whom I am
                     betrayed!" he repeats through his set teeth, "and all Paris laughing at me.
                     Tonight at the bal d'opera, to-morrow at Asnières, and M. le Prince safely
                     absent for another week. Diavolo! it is like the plot of her own plays."</p>
                  <p>He laughs, a laugh not pleasant to hear, rises and makes ready for his drive.
                     The fiacre is already at the door, he enters and is rapidly driven away to the
                     lodgings of madame.</p>

                  <p>I HATE her! I wish she were dead! Oh, why, why, why did I ever leave Scotland
                     and come to this horrible place—to her? I will starve myself and die if I
                     cannot get my freedom in any other way! Oh, I wish I had died before I ever
                     came here!"</p>
                  <p>It was the burden of the moan "Mademoiselle Donny" had been making to herself
                     for the last two days. To Pauline, who brought her her meals, she scorned to
                     speak at all. She lay like a stone, asking no questions, answering none,
                     scarcely touching the food. Then again at times the fierce passions inherited
                     honestly enough from those who had given her life would assert themselves, and
                     her piercing cries would ring through the rooms. She would beat on the locked
                     door and barred window until her hands bled and she sank exhausted and
                     breathless upon the floor. It was known to all madame's household that the poor
                     child, raving so madly in that bolted and barred upper room, was hopelessly
                     insane, and in another day or two would be safely shut up in a <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">maison de sante</foreign>.</p>
                  <p>She lies now prostrate on the floor, her head resting against the side of the
                     bed. All day long at intervals, her wild cries have rung out, the little dark
                     childish hands have beaten against the unyielding door. Madame's nerves have
                     not been disturbed thereby. Madame has spent the long sunny day amid the wooded
                     slopes and sunlit glades of St. Cloud with her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">cavalier
                        servante</foreign>, Lord Viscount Dynely, and the pallid curate's widow. Now
                     it is past eleven at night, and she grovels prone here, spent, white,
                     exhausted, her dusk eyes gleaming weirdly in her pallid child's face,<pb
                        n="394-395" xml:id="VAC6444-00000196"/> her elfish black hair all tossed and
                     dishevelled over her shoulders.</p>
                  <p>"If <emph>he</emph> were here," she thinks with a great sobbing sigh, "he would
                     save me. Oh, if I had only stayed with him that night, and never come here! He
                     was good, he was kind; I would have been happy with him."</p>
                  <p>The face of Terry Dennison rises before her—the honest eyes, the frank smile,
                     the man's strength and woman's gentleness, and her heart cries out for him now
                     in her trouble, as though he had been the friend of her whole life.</p>
                  <p>"He asked for me," she thinks, with another long shuddering sob. "Twice he
                     asked for me, and each time she told him a lie—told him I was sick and did not
                     want to see him. And she struck me in the face. Oh, I hate her! I hate
                     her!"</p>
                  <p>Her folded arms rest on the bed—her face drops on them, and so poor ill-used,
                     ill-tempered, passionate Donny lies still. She falls into a sort of lethargy
                     that is not sleep, but the natural result of so much fierce excitement, and in
                     that half-doze dreams—dreams Terry Dennison is coming to her rescue once more,
                     the kindly smile she remembers so well, and trusts so entirely, on his
                     face—that his foot is ascending the stairs, that he is turning the key in the
                     door, that he is in the room. Then a light flashes through the darkness, and
                     she looks up with dazed dreaming eyes to see a man in the room, shading a light
                     and looking at her—a man who is <emph>not</emph> Terry Dennison.</p>
                  <p>"Hush-h-h!" this man says, putting his finger on his lip, and noiselessly
                     closing the door. "Not a word, not a sound, mademoiselle! I am a friend. I have
                     come to save you. But all depends on your being perfectly still."</p>
                  <p>She does not rise. She lies and looks at him, her wide-open, black eyes full of
                     silent wonder and suspicion.</p>
                  <p>"Who are you?" she asks.</p>
                  <p>He is a little yellow man, in a richly-furred coat, and with an air of
                     distinction, but Mam'selle Donny does not like his look.</p>
                  <p>"I am a friend, as I told you. I have been sent to save you. I have been sent
                     by him—the gentleman who brought you here—Monsieur Dennison."</p>
                  <p>She springs to her feet now, the sound of that name electrifying her.</p>
                  <p>"Take me to him," she cries, breathlessly. "Oh, sir! take me to him. He is
                     strong, and brave, and kind. Oh, take me from this dreadful house, from that
                     dreadful woman to him!"</p>
                  <p>"Hush-h!" he says again; "softly, mademoiselle—some one may hear. I have come
                     to take you to him presently, but first—madame is your mother, is she not?"</p>
                  <p>"Why do you ask that?" she impatiently demands; "what has that to do with it?
                     Oh! let me go away at once."</p>
                  <p>"It has everything to do with it, mam'selle. Monsieur Dennison told me to
                     ascertain. He would have come himself, but you know madame distrusts him and
                     will not let him see you, lest you should tell him the truth."</p>
                  <p>"I know! I know!" she impatiently interrupts. "She lied to him! She told him I
                     was ill, when he asked for me, and I was dying to see him. She slapped my face,
                     and locked me up here, and I hate her!" Her eyes flashed fire, her hands
                     clenched. "What is it you want to know?" she cried excitedly. "I'll tell you
                     anything—everything so that you take me from here, to him."</p>
                  <p>"Tell me your story—who you are. She is your mother, is she not? I see the
                     likeness in your face. Who is your father, and where is he?"</p>
                  <p>"I don't know; I wish I did. I would make Mr. Dennison take me to him. She is
                     my mother—oh, yes! and I was born in Quebec, more than sixteen years ago. My
                     father would not live with her, I don't know why, and there was a divorce. So
                     Joan told me. Joan was there when I was born, and my mother left me with her
                     and went away. Joan brought me up; now she is dead, and so I came here. I wish
                     I never had—oh! I wish I never had. Her name is not Madame Felicia—her name is
                     Rosamond. She called herself Mrs. Gordon when I was born, and my father's name
                     was Gordon Caryll. I don't know whether he is living or dead. Joan did not
                     know. That is all. And now I have told you, I want you to take me away."</p>
                  <pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC6444-00000197"/>
                  <p>But her visitor arose and put her gently back. One look into her face had
                     settled the question of her maternity.</p>
                  <p>"Not to-night, petite. It is late for you to be abroad. But you shall be taken
                     away, and that speedily—you may trust my word when I say so."</p>
                  <p>Then, before the bewildered child can quite realize it, the little man with the
                     yellow face and furred coat is gone, the key turned in the lock, and she is
                     alone in her prison once more.</p>
                  <milestone n="* * * * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>The bal d'opera was at its height. The vast building was one sheet of white
                     gaslight; perfumes, pastilles, and the rich odor of flowers made the atmosphere
                     almost overpowering. The orchestra, playing the sweet Strauss waltzes, filled
                     the air with quivering melody. And above the rich strains of the music arose
                     the shrill laughter, the shrill clatter of ceaseless gay voices, as dominoes,
                     white and black, flower-girls, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">debardeurs</foreign>,
                     gypsies, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">paysannes, coryphées, princes au
                        théâtre</foreign>, and men in plain evening dress, with masks off or on, as
                     the whim took them, flashed and flitted ceaselessly and noisily to and fro. A
                     gorgeous picture of one phase of Paris gaslit life—a glimpse of the Arabian
                     Nights—brilliant, intoxicating, wicked.</p>
                  <p>Among the maskers there came, quite alone and moving slowly, a short, slight
                     man, in a furred and frogged great-coat, which, despite the warmth, he still
                     retained, his mask concealing all but the glitter of two restless black eyes.
                     He made his way to the centre of the assemblage, and leaning negligently
                     against a statue of the Apollo, watched the brilliant phantasmagoria as it
                     flitted before him. Suddenly he started slightly and drew in his breath with a
                     sharp, sibilant sound. What he looked for he saw.</p>
                  <p>There flew swiftly past him, in the dizzy whirl of the half-mad waltzers, a
                     black domino, with a knot of yellow ribbon on her left shoulder. The tall
                     partner who clasped her so closely, was a gentleman in plain evening dress, a
                     yellow rose in his buttonhole, primrose kids on his hands. The wild laughter of
                     the lady reached him as she whirled by like a bacchante, laughter he knew well,
                     and had heard often. The hawk had sprung upon its quarry—from that moment he
                     lost sight of them no more.</p>
                  <p>The waltz ended. The domino <foreign xml:lang="FRA">noir</foreign> moved away
                     on her companion's arm to a distant corner, where the glare of gaslight was
                     less blinding, where tall tropic plants cast shade, where but few people were,
                     and where seats for the weary were placed. Quietly, stealthily, the gentleman
                     in the mask and furred-coat followed, unobserved. The lady threw herself into
                     one of the seats, and fluttered open her fan.</p>
                  <p>"Mon Dieu! but it is hot! Eric, mon enfant, have the common humanity to go and
                     fetch me a water ice. That last waltz was charming, and how well you have my
                     step. We must dance the Krolsbalklange valse together, and then—home. Eric, go
                     for the ice if you would not see me expire."</p>
                  <p>She removed her mask and showed the flushed, laughing, lovely face of Felicia.
                     Her companion rose to obey, whispering something that caused madame's shrill
                     laughter once more to peal out as she struck him with her fan. "<foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">Fi donc</foreign>, Eric, I know what your tender speeches are
                     worth. It is too warm, and I am too fatigued for love-making. Go for my
                     ice."</p>
                  <p>He departed. Five minutes after, as he was slowly making his way through the
                     revolving throng with madame's water-ice in his hand, a man in a furred
                     overcoat ran rudely against him, knocking it out of his hand and over his
                     immaculate evening suit.</p>
                  <p>"Mille pardons, monsieur," this personage cried, with a low bow, but a mocking
                     laugh. "But if monsieur <emph>will</emph> be clumsy! I regret exceedingly
                     having spoiled monsieur's best coat; but—"</p>
                  <p>A chorus of laughter from the bystanders, who were in the mood to laugh at any
                     mishap to their neighbors, however slight, cut him short. The next instant the
                     little man was flat on his back, sent thither by a well-directed blow straight
                     from the shoulder. As if by enchantment a crowd gathered. There is magic in a
                     "row" that speaks to the heart of men of all nations. The insolent gentleman in
                     the frogged coat leaped to his feet with a shrill cry of fury, but<pb
                        n="398-399" xml:id="VAC6444-00000198"/> before he fairly reached them he was
                     sprawling on his back once more.</p>
                  <p>"Come on," Lord Dynely said, with perfect coolness; "as my best coat
                        <emph>is</emph> spoiled, I don't mind spoiling it a little more. Get up and
                     I'll show you how to walk through a ball-room without running against your
                     neighbors."</p>
                  <p>"Mon Dieu, Eric!" cried the voice of Felicia, who had replaced her mask, and
                     now rushed to the scene; "what is the matter? Who is this?"</p>
                  <p>"I have not the honor of monsieur's acquaintance at present; but all the same
                     it affords me pleasure to teach him—"</p>
                  <p>He paused, for madame had clutched his arm with a cry of terror and
                     recognition. With eyes literally flashing flame, Di Venturini had sprung to his
                     feet like a tiger, torn off his mask, and confronted them.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, madame—it is I. You recognize me, I see. Tell your lover who I am. You
                     know me, if he does not. We shall be better acquainted before long. I have the
                     honor, have I not, of speaking to Lord Dynely?"</p>
                  <p>He hissed out his words in English that the crowd might not understand. Eric,
                     confounded himself by this sudden rencontre, bowed also.</p>
                  <p>"A friend of mine shall wait upon you, my lord, tomorrow morning," Di Venturini
                     said in a rapid whisper. "You have heard of me—I am the Prince Di Venturini.
                     For you, madame," with a low bow, "I shall see you later."</p>
                  <p>Before either could speak he turned, made his way through the throng, and
                     quitted the bal masque. For this purpose he had come—his end was
                     accomplished.</p>
                  <p>The crowd dispersed, rather disappointed at having, after all, been cheated out
                     of a free fight. Felicia and Lord Dynely looked at each other blankly for a
                     moment. Then madame broke into one of her shrill laughs.</p>
                  <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Ma foi!</foreign> Eric, my friend, but this is droll!
                     It is like one of our vaudevilles at the Varieties, where madame amuses herself
                     in monsieur's absence, and monsieur, furious and jealous, unexpectedly appears.
                     What a scene that will be to-morrow!—he is all that there is of the most
                     jealous— that poor little M. Di Venturini, and I <emph>did</emph> promise him,
                     before he left, never to coquet more. There is one waltz, mon cher—shall we
                     dance it, or—"</p>
                  <p>"We will dance it, of course," Lord Dynely answers; "a waltz with you is too
                     rare a treat to be lightly given up."</p>
                  <p>The soft, sweet strains of the Krolsbalklange float out, and they whirl away
                     with it, in perfect time. Felicia is a perfect dancer, her feet do not seem to
                     touch the floor. Dynely means what he says when he avers that a waltz with her
                     is a rare treat. Then it ends, and he wraps her in her opera cloak, and leads
                     her to her carriage. She leans forward, her witching face in the full glow of
                     the gaslight, a smile on the red lips, in the lustrous, topaz eyes.</p>
                  <p>"And Asnières, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon enfant</foreign>," she says, "do we
                     go tomorrow down the Seine as agreed, or do we—"</p>
                  <p>"We go!" he answered, his blue eyes flashing; "not for all the jealous Italians
                     in Christendom would I throw over to-morrow's excursion."</p>
                  <p>He stoops and kisses the jewelled, ungloved hand she extends. Once again she
                     laughs, that sweet, derisive laugh he knows so well. Then the carriage rolls
                     away. Circe has gone, and her victim stands alone in the cool February
                     night.</p>

                  <head type="sub">AFTER THE BALL.</head>
                  <p>HE stands alone under the cold, white stars, and as the chill wind sweeps about
                     him, as the chill dawn breaks, his senses slowly return. One way or other this
                     intoxicating flirtation of his has ended at least. To-morrow's excursion down
                     the Seine to Asnières is probably its closing act. For M. le Prince Di
                     Venturini, the affianced of Felicia, has been insulted, and M. le Prince is a
                     man to wipe out such insults thoroughly and well. He is a noted duelist—three
                     times has he killed his man; lighting his cigar coolly and walking away while
                     his adversary lay dying hard among the sweet summer grasses. He is a skilled
                     swordsman, a dead shot. More than once, since the beginning of his flirtation
                     with the fair Felicia, has Lord Dynely been told that. And he—of fencing he
                     knows next to nothing—a pistol he has not fired three times in his life. And "a
                     friend will wait upon him to-morrow," and the morning after, at the farthest,
                     he will meet Di Venturini somewhere amid the wooded slopes of Versailles.</p>
                  <p>Physically, Lord Dynely was the farthest possible remove from a coward. Life
                     may be tolerably pleasant, and still a man may face the possibility of leaving
                     it with good grace, if his conscience lie dormant. (To fear death, one must
                     fear what comes after death.) Of that, like most men of his stamp, wholly given
                     up to the pursuit of pleasure, Lord Dynely never thought. After all, taken with
                     all its dissipations, even at its best and brightest, here in Paris, life was a
                     good deal of a bore—not so desirable a thing to keep, by any manner of means,
                     that one should make much of a howling at resigning it. And that the day after
                     to-morrow, when he stood face to face with Di Venturini rini, under the
                     leafless trees of Versailles, or the Bois de Vincennes, he must resign it, he
                     was as certain as that he lit his cigar now, and strolled slowly homeward under
                     the white, shining stars. Yes, life was a bore; a man tired of all things. A
                     pretty face with two blue eyes bewitches him, he marries it, and is wearied to
                     death or satiety in a fortnight. One grew tired of women, of wine, of horses,
                     the rattle of the dice, the croak of the croupier, the shuffle of the cards,
                     the whirl of the ball-room, the glare of the gas-light, of all things in
                     this-wearisome, lower world. Even swarth-skinned, topaz-eyed actresses pall
                     after a few weeks, after a few thousand pounds spent upon them in presents, for
                     which "becks and nods, and wreathéd smiles" are but a flat return. <foreign

                     There would be the trip down the Seine to-morrow, sunshine above them, music
                     around them, a golden blue river below them, and two yellow, black, lustrous
                     eyes smiling languidly upon him. The morning after, in the gray, cold dawn,
                     there would be that silent woodland meeting, the sharp report of two pistol
                     shots, a yellow, Neapolitan prince flying in haste out of the imperial
                     dominions of Napoleon the Third, and a man lying stark on the blood-stained
                     grass, his dead face upturned to the sky. As in a vivid picture before him he
                     saw it all. And then there would be a wedding in Italy a few weeks later, and
                     the topaz eyes would smile for life on the Neapolitan prince. For the dead
                     man—well, for him, in the creed of the man himself, the best of all
                     things—annihilation!</p>
                  <p>He walked home very slowly, smoking and half dreamily, thinking all this. He
                     must keep the matter from his womankind, and he must find a friend. There was
                     Boville—yes, Boville would do—he would see him the first thing to-morrow, and
                     refer Di Venturini's second to him. Under ordinary circumstances, Terry
                     Dennison would have been his man, but under present circumstances Dennison was
                     not to be thought of. For a second quarrel had taken place between the two
                     men—a quarrel bitter and deep;<pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC6444-00000200"/> and
                     for the same cause—Dynely's neglect of his wife. It had occurred three days
                     after the sudden and somewhat surprising departure of Gordon Caryll. Eric still
                     held fast, body and soul, by Felicia, Crystal still drooping with that
                     pathetic, heart-broken face. By command of Lady Dynely, <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >mère</foreign>, Terry had taken Crystal for a drive in the Bois, and there,
                     face to face, in the yellow afternoon sunshine, they had come upon the
                     glittering little equipage of Felicia the dancer. Lying back in her silks and
                     sables and seal skins, her "flower face" smiling behind a little lace veil, her
                     English cavalier, Lord Dynely, beside her, so Lord Dynely's wife had come upon
                     them full. For a second, four pairs of eyes met—then the bright carriage of the
                     danseuse flashed past, and Felicia's derisive laugh came back to them on the
                     breeze.</p>
                  <p>"Mon Dieu! Eric, a pleasant rencontre for you?" she cried, unaffectedly amused
                     by the situation. "What is the matter with Mr. Dennison? He gave me a look
                     absolutely murderous as we passed."</p>
                  <p>Crystal had fallen back with a gasping cry as though a brutal hand had struck
                     her.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Terry! take me home," she had sobbed, as once before, and Terry, in
                     silence, with flashing eyes and lowering brows and compressed lips, had
                     obeyed.</p>
                  <p>Four hours later and there was a "scene" in the salon of the Dynelys. Crystal,
                     sick heart and soul, was alone in her room; Eric, waiting for dinner, was
                     reading the evening paper, when Dennison strode in and confronted him.</p>
                  <p>"Dynely!" he passionately demanded, "how is this to end?"</p>
                  <p>Lord Dynely looked up, the conscious blood reddening his transparent, girl-like
                     face.</p>
                  <p>"How is what to end? May I request you to take a somewhat less aggressive tone
                     in addressing me, Mr. Dennison?"</p>
                  <p>"Your neglect—your shameful neglect of your wife. It is brutal, it is
                     murderous—you are killing her by inches, before our eyes!"</p>
                  <p>The flush faded from the blonde face of Viscount Dynely, The livid whiteness of
                     deadly anger took its place. He laid down his paper and spoke with ominous
                     calm.</p>
                  <p>"May I inquire if my wife has sent you here to tell me this?"</p>
                  <p>"Your wife knows nothing of my coming—that you know as well as I. But I swear,
                     Eric, this must end! You are breaking, brutally breaking your wife's heart. All
                     Paris is talking, is laughing over your besotted infatuation for that old
                     woman—Felicia the dancer! You spend your time, you lavish your gifts on that
                     painted Jezebel, while Crystal dies day by day before your eyes. And only seven
                     weeks since you married her!"</p>
                  <p>Eric rose to his feet—the light of deadly rage filling his eyes, but before he
                     could speak Dennison interposed:</p>
                  <p>"Stay!" he cried, lifting his hand, "hear me out! I pledged myself once never
                     to quarrel with you, do what you might, say what you would. That promise I mean
                     to keep. It is the farthest possible from my wish—the thought of quarrelling
                     with you. But, Eric, I say again this must end."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed! You speak of my very pleasant platonic friendship with the most
                     charming woman in Paris, I presume. May I ask <emph>how</emph> you propose to
                     end it?"</p>
                  <p>"For Heaven's sake, Eric, don't sneer! I speak to you as a friend, as a
                     brother. You cannot be quite heartless—you cannot have quite outlived your love
                     for Crystal. Don't you see you are killing her—poor, little soul, don't you see
                     she worships the ground you walk on, the least thing your hand has touched. She
                     would die for you, Eric; and you—you neglect her more shamefully than ever
                     bride was neglected before; you insult her by your devotion to this worthless
                     woman. If you had seen her after you had passed to-day—" he stops suddenly and
                     walks away to a window. "Don't let us row, Eric," he says hoarsely; I have no
                     wish to interfere with or dictate to you, but in some way I stand pledged to
                     Crystal since her happiness is at stake. Our friendship of the past has given
                     me the right to be her protector at least."</p>
                  <p>"The right of a jilted lover!" Eric returns, that bitter sneer still on lips
                     and eyes. "Let us understand each other,<pb n="404-405"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000201"/> Dennison. This is the second time you have
                     interfered in this matter. I warn you now, let it be the last. I have listened
                     to your insolence, because I wish to drag my wife's name into no public
                     scandal, or quarrel with you. It is the last time I will be so forbearing. Be
                     kind enough to quit these rooms at once, and enter them no more! Be kind
                     enough, also, to discontinue your acquaintance with Lady Dynely. If I were
                     inclined to take umbrage easily, I might with reason object to you, her jilted
                     lover, as I said before, playing the rôle of attendant cavalier, but I let that
                     pass—this once. I shall order my wife to receive your visits no longer, and I
                     think she will hardly venture to disobey. After to-day, Mr. Dennison, you will
                     understand our acquaintance is at an end."</p>
                  <p>And then, before Terry could speak, his lordship had quitted the salon, and
                     nothing was left but to obey. And the only result of his interference was
                     frigid coldness on the part of Lord Dynely to his wife, and increased devotion,
                     if that were possible, to Felicia. They had met more than once since, and
                     Dynely had cut him dead. So matters between those two, who had grown up as
                     brothers, stood to-night. Verily, a woman is at the bottom of all the ruptured
                     masculine friendships of this lower world!</p>
                  <p>The early dawn was breaking before Lord Dynely reached his hotel. Crystal, pale
                     as a shadow, wasted and wan, lay asleep. A pang of something like actual
                     remorse shot through him as he looked at her, so changed in those few brief
                     weeks.</p>
                  <p>"Poor little soul!" he thought, "if—if the worst does happen to-morrow, it will
                     be hard lines on her."</p>
                  <p>Of no use going to bed, he thought; he could not sleep. He threw himself on a
                     sofa in the dressing-room adjoining, still in his evening suit, and in ten
                     minutes was fast as a church.</p>
                  <p>The breakfast hour was past when he awoke, and Crystal was seated beside him,
                     watching him with eyes of unutterable pathetic yearning. She started up
                     confusedly, as he opened his eyes, coloring, as though caught in some guilty
                     act.</p>
                  <p>"Waiting for me, Crystal?" he said, rising on his elbow, with a yawn. "You were
                     asleep when I came home, and I would not disturb you. What is the hour? Ten, by
                     Jove! Is breakfast ready? I have an engagement this morning, and must get off
                     at once."</p>
                  <p>Breakfast dispatched hurriedly, his dress changed, a note sent in hot haste to
                     Boville, Lord Dynely was waited upon by a tall, fiercely-mustached, soldierly
                     Frenchman. The interview was brief, and strictly private. Boville sauntering
                     lazily in, encountered monsieur swaggering out.</p>
                  <p>"Who's your military friend, Dynely?" he inquired, "and what the deuce do you
                     want of a man in such a hurry as this?"</p>
                  <p>"My military friend is Monsieur Raoul De Concressault, Captain of Zouaves; his
                     business here, to bring me a challenge from Prince Di Venturini; and I have
                     sent for you in such a hurry to be my second in the affair. Take a seat,
                     Boville, and a cigar."</p>
                  <p>"By Jove!" cried Boville, taking the seat, but not the cigar. "I thought it
                     would come to this. Of course Felicia is at the bottom of it?"</p>
                  <p>"Of course—is not her charming sex at the bottom of all the mischief and murder
                     on earth? Also, of course everything is strictly <foreign xml:lang="LAT">sub
                        rosa</foreign>—it won't do to let it get wind."</p>
                  <p>"Certainly not," Boville answered gravely. "Tell us about it, Dynely. I thought
                     M. le Prince was safely away for another week."</p>
                  <p>"So did I—so did Felicia," Dynely said, with a slight laugh. "He turned up in
                     most dramatic fashion at the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bal masque</foreign> at
                     the Gymnase last night, however."</p>
                  <p>And thereupon his lordship briefly, and not without humor, sketched the
                     rencontre at the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bal d'opera</foreign>.</p>
                  <p>"And the result is to be a duel?" said Boville, still very gravely. "Dynely,
                     are you aware Di Venturini is the best swordsman, the deadest shot, in
                     Europe?"</p>
                  <p>"To be sure, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ami</foreign>. All that is a matter of
                     history. Light up, old fellow; I can recommend these Manillas."</p>
                  <p>"And you?" Boville inquired, obeying.</p>
                  <p>"I? Oh! well, I know next to nothing of fencing, and never fired a pistol half
                     a dozen times in my life."</p>
                  <pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC6444-00000202"/>
                  <p>"But—good Heaven! Dynely, you have no chance at all then, if the prince means
                     mischief! And he mostly <emph>does</emph>, I can tell you, when he fights.
                     Don't you know he has killed three men already?"</p>
                  <p>Lord Dynely shrugged his shoulders.</p>
                  <p>"I can't show the white feather on that account. I've got into this scrape, and
                     I must take the consequences. I've referred De Concressault to you. You'll act
                     for me, old fellow, I know?"</p>
                  <p>"I shall be helping to murder you," Boville answered, with a groan. "Is there
                     no way, Dynely, by which—"</p>
                  <p>"There is no way by which this matter can be settled, except by a meeting,"
                     Dynely answered, impatiently. Di Venturini came to the ball for no other
                     purpose than to insult me. He did it, and I knocked him down twice. You must
                     perceive there can be but one ending to such a thing as that."</p>
                  <p>"Devil take Felicia!" growled his friend. "I wish you had never seen the
                     sorceress. She is fatal to all men. She reminds one of those fabled
                     What's-their-names, mermaids—sirens—Lurline—who lure poor devils with their
                     smiles and songs, and then eat them up, and crunch their bones. It's a deuce of
                     an affair, and I never served a friend so unwillingly before in my life. By the
                     way, was the prince masked? How did you know him?"</p>
                  <p>"He tore off his mask in a fine frenzy after the second knock down.
                        <emph>I</emph> never saw him before in my life. And now I come to think of
                     it, he didn't see <emph>me</emph> at all. I kept my mask on through the whole
                     fracas—never thought of it once. By Jove!" Eric cried, laughing, "the idea of
                     going out with a man he never saw!"</p>
                  <p>"It's no laughing matter, let me tell you," Boville growled again; "it's an
                     infernal business, and I wish you had chosen any one else to act for you in the
                     matter. However, if you insist that it is inevitable—"</p>
                  <p>"It is most decidedly and emphatically inevitable; so be off and arrange for
                     to-morrow morning, there's a good fellow. I've an engagement that I would not
                     be late <choice>
                        <sic>for for</sic>
                        <corr>for</corr>
                     </choice> worlds."</p>
                  <p>"And pistols or swords—"</p>
                  <p>"Are equal to me. Of the two I prefer pistols, as quickest and most decisive.
                     You understand. I have no doubt the result would be the same with either
                     weapon, for I think his excellency means mischief, as you say, only pistols
                     conclude things with dispatch."</p>
                  <p>The two men shook hands and separated. Boville, reluctantly, to settle
                     preliminaries with De Concressault, and Lord Dynely to keep his last
                     appointment with Madame Felicia down the Seine, to Asnières.</p>

                  <head type="sub">CHEZ MADAME.</head>
                  <p>HALF AN HOUR later Madame Felicia and Lord Dynely had fairly started upon their
                     excursion—their last, they both knew, and the knowledge gave the forbidden
                     fruit fresh zest, even to their jaded palates. You <emph>must</emph> feel an
                     interest in a handsome and devoted young cavalier, lying in the sunshine at
                     your feet, who, this time to-morrow, for your sake, may be lying with a bullet
                     through his heart. As well as Lord Dynely himself, Felicia knew what would
                     inevitably take place in the light of to-morrow's dawn, and, though his
                     youthful and impassioned lordship was beginning seriously to bore her, she had
                     never before been one-half so sweet, so witching, as to-day.</p>
                  <p>Half an hour after their departure, there rattled up to madame's door a fiacre,
                     from which alighted M. le Prince. That she would be awaiting his coming, with
                     more or less of impatience and anxiety, he did not doubt. He absolutely stood
                     dumb, when the tall chasseur, indorsed by Mam'selle Pauline, announced madame's
                     departure, and with whom.</p>
                  <p>"Gone for the day to Asnières, and with Lord Dynely!" he repeated, staring at
                     them blankly. The extent of the defiant audacity absolutely took his breath
                     away.</p>
                  <p>"But, yes, M. le Prince," Pauline answered, with a shrug, "not to return until
                     barely time to dress for the theatre."</p>
                  <p>"And she left no note, no message of any kind for me?"</p>
                  <p>"None, M. le Prince."</p>
                  <p>"How did they seem, Pauline? in good spirits, or—"</p>
                  <p>"In the very highest spirits, M. le Prince. She dressed with much more than
                     usual care, and so, evidently, had milor. I heard her tell him, as they went
                     away, laughing together, that he was looking handsome as an archangel and
                     elegant as a secretary of legation, and that she looked forward to the
                     pleasantest day of her life."</p>
                  <p>He set his teeth with a snap, his eyes aflame.</p>
                  <p>"And he—what said monsieur?"</p>
                  <p>"That all days must be the pleasantest of <emph>his</emph> life spent in her
                     company. Then they drove off side by side."</p>
                  <p>The yellow complexion of the prince had turned dirty white, with jealous rage.
                     If one chance of life had remained to his rival, he lost it in that moment; if
                     one chance of setting herself right had remained to the woman who slighted him,
                     she lost it in that hour.</p>
                  <p>"And, mademoiselle?" he asked, "the little captive—what of her?"</p>
                  <p>"Is still captive, monseigneur. She is to be removed to-night, after midnight,
                     safely out of Paris, for the present. Madame holds a little reception after the
                     play to-night. When it is over, Paujol and Mam'selle Donny quietly leave
                     Paris?"</p>
                  <p>"Ah! Madame holds a reception, does she?" the Prince said, grimly. "Very well,
                     Pauline, I will trouble you no further. I will do myself the honor of being
                     present at madame's little reception after the play. Who knows when she may
                     hold another?"</p>
                  <p>He laughed inwardly—a laugh that might have warned madame had she heard it.
                     But, drifting down the sunny Seine to the music of the band of the National
                     Guard, madame heard nothing except the full-blown flatteries of her English
                     knight.</p>
                  <p>It was a charming day—all that there was of the most delightful. With the
                     abandon of a child, madame threw herself into the pleasure of the moment, and
                     lived, while she lived, each hour to the utmost. "Eat, drink, and be merry, for
                     to-morrow you die," was the key-note of her life. There was nothing new, and
                     nothing true, but the sun shone with summer warmth, and the band played
                     sweetest music, the champagne and truffles were of the best, and her companion
                     was the handsomest man in Paris. To-morrow the Prince Di Venturini would shoot
                     him or run him through—it was<pb n="410-411" xml:id="VAC6444-00000204"/> well;
                     there were other adorers left; but the knowledge added spice to the wine of
                     life to-day.</p>
                  <p>"Thou art absent, Eric, mon ami!" she murmured, tenderly. "Of what art thou
                     thinking, then? Tired already of our <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fête</foreign>
                     day—which I am enjoying like a child, since I am with thee?"</p>
                  <p>He awoke with a start.</p>
                  <p>In very truth, as they wandered here arm in arm, his thoughts, marvellous to
                     relate, had strayed backward to—his wife! How madame would have laughed had she
                     known it. Poor little soul—poor little Crystal! When the end came to-morrow,
                     would not the shot that finished him kill her also? One creature at least of
                     all the women who had smiled upon him for his azure eyes, and golden hair, and
                     Greek face, had loved him. Well, in this world, where there is so much of empty
                     glitter, so little real gold, even that was something.</p>
                  <p>The brief, bright February day wore on, grew gray and overcast. Madame shivered
                     in her wraps, and turned fretful and cold. They hurried back to the steamer and
                     reembarked for Paris.</p>
                  <p>"We will have a storm to-morrow—dost thou not think so, Eric?" madame asked,
                     wrapping her rose-lined seal-skins closer about her, and looking up at the
                     gray, fast-drifting sky.</p>
                  <p>He followed her glance, dreamily. To-morrow! Where, this time to-morrow, would
                     he be? In this world or the next?—if there be a next—he thought.</p>
                  <p>"Still dreaming, mon cher?" Felicia said, with an impatient shrug. "I begin to
                     think you have not enjoyed our excursion after all."</p>
                  <p>He answered her, as he knew she expected to be answered, in words of empty
                     compliment, but still with that absent, dreaming face. His wife haunted him
                     like a ghost, to-day. Poor little Crystal!</p>
                  <p>Yes, Dennison was right—he had been a brute to her. Only seven weeks a bride,
                     and to-morrow a widow! Ah, yes; it was hard on her!</p>
                  <p>"Shall we see you at my rooms to-night?" Felicia asked again.</p>
                  <p>"Yes—that is, no, I think not. I have an engagement for to-night that will
                     prevent my having that pleasure."</p>
                  <p>She shrugged her shoulders. They stood together in the chilly twilight at
                     madame's door.</p>
                  <p>"Then this is really good-night?"</p>
                  <p>"This is really good-night."</p>
                  <p>She gave him her hand, in its perfectly fitting gray glove, and looked at him
                     in silence for a moment. There was a half smile on her lips—so, without a word,
                     black eyes and blue met, in one long, farewell glance.</p>
                  <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Ma foi!</foreign> It is a thousand pities to kill
                     anything half so handsome!" madame was thinking. "Well—he has helped to amuse
                     me for four weeks. What more can one ask?"</p>
                  <p>"Does she know?" Eric was musing, "but of course she does. Also, of course,"
                     rather bitterly this, "she does not care. It is only one more lover, growing
                     wearisome, and safely out of the way."</p>
                  <p>"Good-night, then, mon ami," madame said, softly, "and au revoir!"</p>
                  <p>"Good-night, Felicia," he answered, "until we meet again!"</p>
                  <p>And then he was gone, a smile on his blonde face, and those two had looked at
                     each other for the last time on earth.</p>
                  <p>Four hours later, and the glittering rooms of Madame Felicia were filled with a
                     very brilliant throng. The best men in Paris, the handsomest and wittiest women
                     met there. And there, when the reception was at its highest, the conversation
                     at its gayest, the music and laughter at their liveliest, came M. le Prince Di
                     Venturini.</p>
                  <p>Not unexpected. "Who has been here, Pauline?" madame had demanded, when under
                     the hands of her maid, at the dressing-room of the Varieties; and the answer
                     had been prompt, "M. le Prince, madame."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! and you told him—"</p>
                  <p>"That you had gone to Asnières for the day, with milor, madame."</p>
                  <p>Madame laughed.</p>
                  <p>"How truthful you grow, petite. And M. le Prince—what said he?"</p>
                  <pb n="412-413" xml:id="VAC6444-00000205"/>
                  <p>"Nothing, madame; but that he would see you later at the reception."</p>
                  <p>So madame knew he was coming, and was prepared for all chances. War or
                     peace—she was equal to either fate, only a trifle curious. Others were curious,
                     too; that little contretemps at the bal d'opera, quiet as it had been kept, was
                     known, and people shrewdly suspected that Di Venturini, noted duelist and
                     fire-eater, would not let the matter drop there. How would he meet madame?</p>
                  <p>He made his way slowly through the rooms, and met her with suave and polished
                     courtesy, told her of his journey, of his health, hoped she had amused herself
                     well in his absence, lingered half an hour among the guests, and then, with an
                     elaborate apology for his early departure, went away.</p>
                  <p>By one o'clock the rooms were empty, the lights out. Madame valued her good
                     looks and lustrous eyes too highly to keep very late hours. Paujol had quitted
                     his post, Pauline had disrobed her mistress of silks and laces, and substituted
                     a dressing-gown. In her room Felicia sat, smoking two or three nerve-soothing
                     cigarettes before going to bed. In the boudoir without Pauline sat, waiting,
                     half-asleep, with her mistress' night draught of spiced wine and eggs on the
                     table before her. Madame often sat dozing and dreaming over her cigarettes for
                     an hour at a time, while the girl waited. So to-night she lay luxuriously back
                     in her chair, her eyes closed, the rose-scented smoke curling upward, when a
                     man made his way noiselessly into the boudoir from the street. He glanced at
                     the sleeping Pauline, at the waiting night draught, and passed on into the
                     dressing-room, into the bedroom, and so came, still noiselessly, upon
                     madame.</p>
                  <p>He stood for a moment looking down upon her. She had not heard him, but some
                     baleful, mesmeric influence warned her he was there. She sat up suddenly,
                     opened her eyes, and looked full into the yellow face of Prince Di
                     Venturini.</p>
                  <p>For a second there was silence. She was a plucky little woman, without a nerve
                     about her, and uttered no word or sound. She looked at him straight, silent,
                     then: "Monsieur the prince."</p>
                  <p>"At your service, madame. I trust I have not too greatly disturbed you?"</p>
                  <p>A mocking smile was on his lips. She looked at him disdainfully.</p>
                  <p>"You have not disturbed me at all. For a moment, I confess, I took you for a
                     burglar, but my nerves are good. What was Paujol about that you entered
                     unannounced?"</p>
                  <p>"Paujol was asleep in his loge."</p>
                  <p>"And, Pauline?"</p>
                  <p>"Pauline is asleep also in your boudoir. It is past two, madame."</p>
                  <p>"And a very late hour for M. Di Venturini's visit. Could it not have been
                     deferred until to-morrow, I wonder?"</p>
                  <p>"It could not, madame. By to-morrow I shall be across the frontier, and very
                     far from Paris."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, I understand!" she looked at him unflinchingly. "You mean to kill Lord
                     Dynely?"</p>
                  <p>"I mean to kill Lord Dynely. Such an insult as he offered me can only be wiped
                     out in blood. I regret that madame must lose her lover, but—"</p>
                  <p>"Pray, no apologies, M. le Prince!" madame answered, with perfect sang-froid;
                     "he was beginning to bore me. Grand passions are always in bad form, and poor
                     boy, he was ludicrously in earnest. Well, monsieur, as you depart to-morrow, I
                     suppose I must give you an audience, even at this improper hour, and in this
                     apartment, or—shall we adjourn to the boudoir?"</p>
                  <p>He laughed derisively.</p>
                  <p>"It shocks madame's delicacy then, that I have intruded here. A thousand
                     pardons, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ma belle</foreign>. Where, may I ask, when he
                     paid his last visit, did you receive the painter, M. Gordon Caryll?"</p>
                  <p>She never flinched. He knew that then.</p>
                  <p>"He was your husband, was he not? And one does not stand on ceremony with one's
                     husband. You see, madame, I know all!"</p>
                  <p>She smiled—a smile that fanned his jealous anger into fury.</p>
                  <p>"And madame's daughter, that she keeps caged up like a<pb n="414-415"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000206"/> wild animal—what of her? You see I know that
                     also. And all the lies madame has been telling me from the first—what of
                     them?"</p>
                  <p>"Nothing of them. And lies is an ugly word to use to a lady."</p>
                  <p>"Diable! do you sit there and mock at me! Do you sit there and deny this?"</p>
                  <p>"I deny nothing, monsieur. I affirm nothing. M. le Prince will believe
                     precisely what he pleases."</p>
                  <p>"And do you think—do you for a moment think, I will marry you after all this?
                     You, the cast-off wife of this man Caryll. You, the mother of this girl—"</p>
                  <p>"Stay! M. le Prince," Felicia said, with one flash of her yellow black eyes.
                     "You have said quite enough! No, I do not think you will marry me. I would not
                     marry you, with your diabolical temper and jealousy, if you were king of Italy,
                     much less owner of a beggarly principality. I don't really think I ever meant
                     to marry you at all—you are much too old, and, if you will pardon me, too ugly.
                     I adore handsome men—Gordon Caryll and Lord Dynely are that, at least. And De
                     Vocqsal—you remember the Austrian marquis, I think, prince? Yes—well, De
                     Vocqsal is coming to Paris next week, and is more urgent than ever that I shall
                     become Madame la Marquise. He is young, he is handsome, he has fourteen
                     quarterings, and a rent-roll that is fabulous. He never calls me ugly names,
                     and is much too gallant a gentleman to intrude into a lady's chamber at two in
                     the morning on purpose to insult her. Here is your ring, prince; it never
                     fitted from the first, and I am glad to be rid of it. It is the only present
                     you ever gave me, so I have, happily, nothing to return. Now let me say
                     good-night and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bon voyage</foreign>, for I am really
                     very sleepy."</p>
                  <p>She yawned aloud, as she removed the heavy diamond from her finger and held it
                     out to him.</p>
                  <p>"Good-night, prince; and a pleasant trip to you both—he, <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">pauvre enfant</foreign>, to the next world, and you—to Italy,
                     is it? Take your ring, monsieur, and go."</p>
                  <p>He took it, and stood looking at her, his face cadaverous, his eyes like coals.
                     "You tell me this? You mean to marry De Vocqsal?"</p>
                  <p>"I am growing tired of the stage. Even <emph>that</emph> palls. Yes; I shall
                     marry De Vocqsal, prince, and become a fine lady."</p>
                  <p>"This is the end, then?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, mon Dieu! yes, if you ever mean to go. How can there be an end while you
                     loiter here? Go! go! I insist."</p>
                  <p>He laughed.</p>
                  <p>"I go, madame; pray do not say it again. Thanks for your good wishes. Accept my
                     congratulations beforehand. It is a brilliant destiny to be Madame la Marquise
                     de Vocqsal. Good-night, and adieu."</p>
                  <p>He bowed low, and was gone—through the dressing-room, and into the sitting-room
                     beyond. Here, Pauline, still guarding the wine, and fast asleep now, sat in the
                     dim light. He went to the table, something between his fingers, a shining
                     globule, and dropped it into the glass. The bell rang sharply at the moment.
                     Pauline started up, with a cry, and Di Venturini vanished through the outer
                     door.</p>
                  <p>"Madame never misses her night draught, so Pauline tells me," he said to
                     himself, with a sardonic smile, as he leaped into his waiting cab; "she will
                     not miss it to-night; and once drank, there is a longer journey before her than
                     a bridal trip to the imperial court of Francis Joseph. So good-night to
                        <emph>you</emph>, madame, and bon voyage!"</p>

                  <p>FROM the window of her room, Crystal, Lady Dynely, watched the twilight of that
                     overcast February day close down. She lay on a broad, low sofa, half buried in
                     cushions, her small face gleaming out like marble against their rose tints, the
                     large blue eyes, so brilliant with happy love-light a few brief weeks ago, dim
                     with watching and much weeping now.</p>
                  <p>Outside the wind was rising. The trees rocked in the gale, the darkness
                     deepened, the first heavy rain-drops began pattering against the glass. Inside
                     the gloom deepened also, until the little, pale face was barely visible. All
                     day long she had been alone, sick in body, sick in soul, crushed of heart. Now
                     she was straining her ears, for the first sound of that familiar step on the
                     stairs, for the first note of that gay whistle, with which he was wont to
                     herald his coming. To her this twilight hour was <emph>the</emph> hour of the
                     twenty-four, for it almost invariably brought Eric, to dress or dine.</p>
                  <p>Her maid entered to light the lamps, but the soft little voice sent her away.
                     "Not yet," she said, gently. "I like the dusk. Has—has my lord come home?"</p>
                  <p>"No, my lord has not come home," the Frenchwoman answered, with a compassionate
                     glance at the drooping figure. Alas! was not my lord's defection as well known
                     in the servants' hall as in salon or chamber?</p>
                  <p>Where was he to-day?—the child wondered. Where was he now? Was he with
                        <emph>her?</emph>—that wicked, beautiful, brown woman? Oh! to be able to win
                     him back, her very own, her husband, and hold him from them all! Was God
                     punishing her for loving too greatly, for worshipping the creature instead of
                     the Creator? She did not know—it might be wicked—this unreasoning worship of
                     hers; but wicked or worthy, it would last until her life's end. She could see
                     her face now as she lay—the room was lined with mirrors. What a pitiful, pale
                     face it was! And he liked rosy bloom, peachy, plentiful flesh and blood. The
                     dancing woman had these—<emph>she</emph> had nothing left but the moonlight
                     shadow of her pearl face, and her true and tender heart. Good and pleasant
                     things, but not likely long to hold a sensuous, changeful, beauty-worshipping,
                     thoroughly selfish man. Dimly she knew this, and with a half sob, buried that
                     poor, wasted face in her hands. He had fancied her from the first, only for her
                     pretty, flower-like looks; let her lose these charms, as she was losing fast,
                     and her last hold on her husband's heart was gone.</p>
                  <p>She lay thinking this—thinking so intently, that she did not hear the door
                     pushed gently open, and a tall figure come in. It came softly over, and knelt
                     on one knee beside her, and so, in the dusk of the room, looked down upon the
                     colorless, wasted face, the locked hands, from which the wedding ring hung
                     loose. Suddenly her eyes opened.</p>
                  <p>"It is I, Crissy," he said.</p>
                  <p>The bewildered look changed to one of electric surprise and joy. She flung her
                     arms around his neck, and held him as though she would never let him go.</p>
                  <p>"Poor little soul!" he said, more moved than he cared to show. "You have been
                     alone all day, and have got the horrors. Were there none of them here—my
                     mother—France—all day?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, both. Your mother stayed an hour, and then went to make some calls with
                     Terry. France stayed and read to me all the morning. She is so good—my own dear
                     France. They are all good, but—but," the clinging arms close together, he can
                     feel her passionate heart beat: "Oh, my love! I only want you.</p>
                  <p>"Poor little Chris!"</p>
                  <p>It is all he can say. He lays his face beside hers for a moment, and is still.
                     He is thinking of this time to-morrow—he knows as surely as that he rests here,
                     that the bullet that kills him will end her life. And it is for that dark<pb
                        n="418-419" xml:id="VAC6444-00000208"/> daughter of Herodias, he has
                     forsaken her. All at once a loathing of Felicia, of himself, comes upon him.
                     What a black and brutal wretch he is! how utterly unworthy of this spotless
                     wife, whose heart he is breaking. If the past could but come over again! if
                     what is done could be undone, how differently he would act, how happy he would
                     make her. But it is too late for all that—the end has come.</p>
                  <p>"Crystal," he says gently, "I've not been a very good sort of husband, I'm
                     afraid—I never was a very good sort of fellow at any time. I've done enough to
                     forfeit all right to your love, but—you care for me still?"</p>
                  <p>"Care for you!" she whispered. And then the clinging grasp tightens, and she
                     can say no more.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I know you do," he says, with a stifled sigh; "it's awfully good of you,
                     Chris, for I <emph>have</emph> been a brute, that's the truth. And look here, I
                     don't mean this really, you know, but if anything happened; if"—with a slight
                     laugh—"I chanced to die, for instance—"</p>
                  <p>But she interrupts him with a shrill cry, like a child that has been
                     struck.</p>
                  <p>"Eric!"</p>
                  <p>"Foolish child! Do I look like dying? It is only a suppositious case—let me put
                     it. If I chanced to die, say to-morrow, you would forgive me all my wrongdoing,
                     my neglect? You would not have one hard thought of me, would you?"</p>
                  <p>She half raises herself, and tries to look at him. But, still laughing, he
                     holds her so that she cannot see his face. "Answer, sweetheart—would you?"</p>
                  <p>"I never had one hard thought of you in all my life, Eric, never, so I could
                     have nothing to forgive. If you died"—she catches her breath with a sort of
                     gasp as she says it—"do you think I could live? Oh, love, that is all past. I
                     can never have any life now apart from you!"</p>
                  <p>"You think so," he says, uneasily; "but you are young, and—you only think
                     so."</p>
                  <p>"I know so," she answers, under her breath; and instinctively he knows it
                     too.</p>
                  <p>"Well," he says, at length, after a long pause, "regrets are useless, but I
                     wish with all my soul the past three weeks could come over again. I ought to
                     have made you happy, little wife, and I have not. If—if the time is given me, I
                     swear I will. Now, let me go; I have letters to write, and much to do this
                     evening."</p>
                  <p>"You"—she pauses, and looks at him with oh, such wistful, longing eyes—"you are
                     going out, as usual, Eric?"</p>
                  <p>"No," he says, smiling down upon her. "I am going to remain in, as
                        <emph>un</emph>-usual, Crystal. Lie here until dinner is announced; I will
                     write my letters in your boudoir. You know I must always be alone when my
                     epistolatory attacks come on."</p>
                  <p>He unlooses the clasping arms and goes. And Crystal nestles down among her
                     pillows, and shuts her eyes to keep back the joyful tears that come to women
                     alike in bliss and in pain. Just now her bliss is so great, that it is almost
                     pain; she cannot, cannot realize it.</p>
                  <p>He passes through the dressing-room, into the pretty, mirror-lined, satin-hung
                     nest beyond, that is Crystal's sitting-room, leaving both doors ajar. He lights
                     the lamps himself, draws pens, ink, and paper before him, and sits down to
                     write. He must leave a few parting lines with Boville for his mother and
                     Crystal in case of the worst. He wishes he had made a will to-day instead of
                     going to Asnières, but it is too late for that. The title and estate go to a
                     distant cousin of his father's, unless—yes, there is one unless. It is
                     something Crystal has never spoken of—he thinks himself it is unlikely.</p>
                  <p>"By Jove!" he says, under his breath. "I hope so, for her sake, poor little
                     soul. It will console her; and dead or alive, a fellow likes to perpetuate the
                     title."</p>
                  <p>He begins his mother's letter first. It will be the easier. He writes, "Hotel
                     du Louvre, February 26, 18—. My dear mother," and there he stops, and gnaws the
                     gold handle of his pen, and pulls his amber mustache, and stares at the blank
                     sheet with troubled blue eyes. What <emph>shall</emph> he say? It will almost
                     go as hard with her as with Crystal. Absolutely these preliminaries are worse
                     than the thing itself.</p>
                  <p>The minutes tick off—still he sits and stares at the white<pb n="420-421"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000209"/> paper. What shall he say—how shall he word it?
                     Some fellows have a knack of writing things—he has none—never had. Beauty and
                     brains don't, as a rule, travel in company. Eric, Lord Dynely, never felt the
                     want of the latter—that refuge of the destitute, before. By Jove! What shall he
                     say to her? Then, as he plunges the pen in desperation down in the ink,
                     determined to say <emph>something</emph> or perish, the door is burst suddenly
                     open, and Terry Dennison comes impetuously in. Terry Dennison, flushed of face,
                     excited of eye, and strides up to him at once.</p>
                  <p>"Eric, what is this? Is it true?"</p>
                  <p>Eric lays down his pen, and flushes also with haughty amaze and anger.</p>
                  <p>"Dennison! again! and after what passed between us the other day."</p>
                  <p>"Do you think I would let that stop me now?" Dennison bursts forth, excitedly.
                     "Do you think I would heed anything you may have said at such a time as this?
                     Is it true?"</p>
                  <p>"Is what true?" still in haughty anger.</p>
                  <p>"Your duel with Di Venturini. I met De Concressault out yonder, and he dropped
                     a hint, but would not speak plainly. I know that Di Venturini is back, I heard
                     of your rencontre at the bal masque, and I feared something of this. But I did
                     not think you would be so mad—yes, so mad, Dynely, as to accept his challenge.
                     Tell me, is it true?"</p>
                  <p>"It is quite true. May I inquire in what way it concerns Mr. Dennison?"</p>
                  <p>"In what way! Great Heaven! he can talk to me like this. In what way—his
                     murder—for it is nothing less. Eric, I say, this must not go on."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed!"—with a sneer. "How do you propose to prevent it?"</p>
                  <p>"I will give information to the police. I will—I swear! If I can stop it in no
                     other way, the gens-d'armes shall be on the ground before you. Eric, you shall
                     not fight Di Venturini!"</p>
                  <p>Eric arose to his feet, that lurid light of anger the other knew so well, in
                     his eyes.</p>
                  <p>"You dare to stand there and tell me this! Meddler! Fool! If you are a coward
                     yourself, do you think to make me one? Begone! and interfere, tell the police,
                     at your peril. By George, if you do, when the prince and I have met elsewhere,
                     whichever of us survives shall shoot <emph>you!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>There was a moment's silence—Eric livid with passion, Terry's eyes aflame, his
                     breath coming quick and hard—then:</p>
                  <p>"You mean to tell me, Dynely, that if I prevent your meeting to-morrow you will
                     meet Di Venturini elsewhere?"</p>
                  <p>"So surely as we both live I shall meet Di Venturini when and where he
                     pleases."</p>
                  <p>"But, Heavens and earth, Eric, don't you know he means to kill you? Don't you
                     know he is a dead shot, and that you don't stand a chance. No, by Jove! not the
                     shadow of a chance. A duel! why this will not be a duel, it will be a
                     cold-blooded murder."</p>
                  <p>"Call it by what name you please, only be kind enough to go."</p>
                  <p>"Eric, you shall not—you <emph>shall</emph> not meet the prince. He means to
                     take your life; you haven't a shadow of a chance, I repeat. Oh! dear old
                     fellow, stop and think. I don't mind what you say to me—I don't mean to be
                     meddlesome—I don't mean to quarrel with you. Dear old boy, stop and think. It
                     is not you alone Di Venturini will kill—it is your mother—it is your wife."</p>
                  <p>"This is all nonsense!" Eric cried, angrily and impatiently—"a waste of time. I
                     have letters to write, and I want to get to bed early to-night. If you talked
                     until the crack of doom you couldn't alter things one iota. Let it kill whom it
                     may, I can't and won't show the white feather. Di Venturini has challenged me,
                     and I am to meet him at day-dawn to-morrow—that is as fixed as fate. He means
                     to shoot me, I haven't the slightest doubt; but that has nothing to do with it.
                     The Dynelys have never been noted for rigid virtue of any sort, or an overstock
                     of brains; but at least none that I ever heard of were cowards. I won't be the
                     first to disgrace the name. Have we palavered enough over this, or has more to
                     be said? I warn you, I won't listen. If you will not leave me, then I shall
                     leave you."</p>
                  <pb n="422-423" xml:id="VAC6444-00000210"/>
                  <p>He gathered up his papers angrily to go. Dennison advanced and laid his hand on
                     his shoulder.</p>
                  <p>"Eric! if you have no mercy on yourself, have mercy on your wife and mother. It
                     will kill them—that you know as well as I. Let me meet this Italian cutthroat
                     in your place. I'm a better shot than you, and he'll never know the—"</p>
                  <p>"You're a fool, Terry!" Eric cried, throwing off the hand. "You talk like a
                     puling baby. Let <emph>you</emph> meet Di Venturini in my place, and I sneak at
                     home like a whipped school-boy, behind the petticoats of my wife and mother!
                     For Heaven's sake get out, and stop talking such infernal rot!"</p>
                  <p>Terry drew back, and folded his arms.</p>
                  <p>"It is inevitable then, Dynely? You mean to meet the prince?"</p>
                  <p>"It is inevitable, Dennison. If your head had not been made of wood, you might
                     have known that from the first. I shall meet Di Venturini as surely as the sun
                     will shine in the sky to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>A sort of smile crossed Dennison's face at the simile. The rain was pelting
                     against the windows hard.</p>
                  <p>"The sun will <emph>not</emph> shine in the sky to-morrow," he said, under his
                     breath. Then aloud: "And you are quite sure, old boy, that you know the prince
                     means to kill you?"</p>
                  <p>"I am quite sure he means to try," Eric answered, coolly; "I am not at all so
                     sure that he will succeed. Now, then, Terry, I'll forgive you
                     everything—everything on my word, if you'll only take yourself off at once, and
                     stop being a confounded bore! When a man expects to be shot at break of day, he
                     naturally has no end to do the night be—"</p>
                  <p>He never finished the sentence. With a face of white horror, Dennison was
                     pointing to the door of the dressing-room. Eric whirled round, and a cry broke
                     from his lips. There, in her wrapper, her face likes now, her eyes all wild and
                     wide, her lips apart, his wife stood. She had heard every word.</p>
                  <p>"Great Heaven! Crystal!" Eric cried.</p>
                  <p>He sprang toward her. She was swaying like a reed in the wind, but at the sound
                     of his voice the blind, bewildered eyes turn toward him, the arms instinctively
                     outstretched. It was the doing of a second—before he could reach her, she had
                     fallen heavily forward on her face, a stream of bright red blood flowing from
                     her lips.</p>
                  <p>The two men stood petrified, horror-stricken. It was all so sudden that for an
                     instant it stunned them. Then Eric awoke. With a horrible oath he sprang
                     forward, seized Dennison by the throat, and struck him with all his might
                     across the face.</p>
                  <p>"It is all your doing, you fool! You meddlesome, thick-witted fool! If you have
                     killed her, by — I'll have your life!"</p>
                  <p>He flung him from him like a madman. By laying hold of the wall Dennison alone
                     saved himself from falling. The onslaught had been so swift, so unexpected,
                     that he had had no chance to defend himself at all.</p>
                  <p>Now he was forced to stand for an instant to regain his breath. The flush had
                     faded from his face, leaving it ghastly, only where the red, cruel mark of the
                     brutal blow lay. Then he plunged blindly after his assailant, but in that
                     instant Eric had stooped, raised his wife in his arms, and passed with her into
                     the inner room.</p>
                  <p>Dennison drew back, laid his arm against the wall, and his face upon it. So he
                     stood for a moment—a moment that was an age of agony. Then he turned, and
                     silently and swiftly went out into the melancholy, rain-beaten night.</p>

                  <head type="sub">"LOYAL AU MORT."</head>
                  <p>STRAIGHT to the Faubourg St. Honore, straight to the rooms of Lady Dynely,
                     Terry went. Crystal might be dying—was, no doubt, and he would be before any of
                     Eric's messengers to break the news to Eric's mother. His teeth were set, his
                     fists unconsciously clenched, his blue eyes aflame. The blow, that for a moment
                     had blinded him, burned on his face still, like a brand of fire—the savage that
                     is latent in all men, in far better and deeper-cultured men than this big
                     dragoon, was uppermost now. Eric had struck him, basely and dastardly struck
                     him. If by lifting his finger, he could have saved Eric's life, in this first
                     blind fury he would not have lifted it.</p>
                  <p>He strode into her private sitting-room, and inquired for Lady Dynely. Yes, my
                     lady was at home, had but just come, was on the verge of again going out, but
                     was at home. She would be with Mr. Dennison directly.</p>
                  <p>She was with him as the servant said it. She came rustling in, her pale,
                     flowing silks sweeping behind her, a cloak of velvet and fur falling off her
                     shoulders. Her dainty Parisian bonnet was on her head, a flurried, wild look on
                     her ever pale face, an excited sparkle in her light blue eyes. As she entered,
                     Dennison thought, with a thrill of recollection, of the very first time he had
                     seen her as she entered the Irish cabin in the wet twilight, to change all his
                     life for evermore. Had she changed it for the better? If she had left him to
                     grow up ignorant, and poor, and unlettered, among his mother's people, there in
                     the wild Claddagh of Galway, might he not have been a happier man to-night?</p>
                  <p>"Terry," she cried, coming excitedly forward, both hands outstretched, "what is
                     this I hear? I was just starting for the Louvre as you were announced. Half an
                     hour ago I was at Lady Clarendon's reception, and there the rumor reached me of
                     this horrible affair. Oh, Terry! speak and tell me, it is <emph>only</emph> a
                     rumor, that he will not be so mad, so wicked, so utterly reckless, as to risk
                     his life."</p>
                  <p>So! that was told! He drew in his breath hard. All must come out now.</p>
                  <p>"Of what do you speak, Lady Dynely?"</p>
                  <p>"Do you not know? Oh, then it must be false. If it were true you would be the
                     very first Eric would tell. Wretched boy! he is always worrying me to death of
                     late—yes, ever since his return last August. And now his neglect of his wife,
                     poor little creature, and his running after this horrible dancer. Oh! what a
                     trouble sons are to mothers. Terry, I heard a shocking story whispered about at
                     Lady Clarendon's. Captain de Concressault dropped in there for ten minutes, and
                     it seems he set the ball going. But, it cannot be true."</p>
                  <p>"Captain de Concressault is a good one to keep a secret," thought Terry,
                     grimly.</p>
                  <p>"What was it De Concressault said?" inquired he, aloud.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! a most scandalous thing. It would break my heart if I thought it true.
                     That Eric went to a masked ball, at one of those places here, with that woman,
                     Felicia; that there he met Prince Di Venturini, who had followed to watch them,
                     that a dreadful quarrel ensued, and that Eric knocked the prince down again and
                     again. Every one was horrified—naturally. And I left immediately and came here,
                     to change my dress and go direct to the Louvre. Terry, you are silent; you
                     look—oh! good Heaven! Terry, don't tell me it is true!"</p>
                  <p>But Dennison stood silent, his head bent down, his eyes averted, his hat, which
                     he had not yet removed, shading his bruised and discolored face.</p>
                  <p>"Terry, I command you! Speak and tell me—is this story true?"</p>
                  <p>"Lady Dynely—I am afraid it is."</p>
                  <p>She laid her hand over her heart, turning ghastly pale.</p>
                  <p>"And Eric went there with that woman, his wife ailing at<pb n="426-427"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000212"/> home—went to that wicked dancing-place, and
                     insulted Prince Di Venturini?"</p>
                  <p>"My lady—yes."</p>
                  <p>He spoke reluctantly, each admission dragged from him. Falsehoods came never
                     readily to Dennison, and then, of what use were falsehoods here? She
                        <emph>must</emph> know.</p>
                  <p>"He insulted Di Venturini, a man who fights duels upon the smallest
                     provocation—who will take no insults from any one. Terry, tell me—tell me the
                     truth, I command! Has Di Venturini challenged Eric?"</p>
                  <p>"Lady Dynely, I am sorry, sorry to have to say once more—yes."</p>
                  <p>Her blue eyes dilated, the last trace of color faded from her face.</p>
                  <p>"And Eric?" she said, in a sort of whisper. "Eric has—"</p>
                  <p>"Accepted. There was no alternative. I am very sorry," Dennison said again.</p>
                  <p>She sat down suddenly on a sofa near, so ghastly that he drew close in
                     alarm.</p>
                  <p>"Lady Dynely, good Heaven! you are going to faint. Shall I—"</p>
                  <p>She motioned him to be still, the sick, giddy faintness that was like death,
                     holding her speechless.</p>
                  <p>"Wait," she said, with a gasp. "I—I won't faint. Oh, Terry! What is this? Oh,
                     my Eric! my son, my son."</p>
                  <p>She buried her face in her hands and was still, whether crying or praying Terry
                     could not tell. He stood uneasily looking at her, feeling horribly
                     uncomfortable, not knowing in the least what to do or say.</p>
                  <p>She looked up after a moment. Her eyes were red and inflamed, but she was not
                     crying.</p>
                  <p>"When do they meet? The truth, I insist."</p>
                  <p>"To-morrow morning at daybreak," he answered, almost under his breath.</p>
                  <p>"And they fight with pistols?" she shuddered, convulsively, from head to foot,
                     as she said it.</p>
                  <p>"With pistols."</p>
                  <p>"And Di Venturini will kill him!" she cried out, rising up. "Oh, I see it all!
                     I see it all! They will meet there in some lonely place at day-dawn, and my
                     boy, my darling, my Eric, will be foully murdered. Oh, Heaven, have mercy on me
                     and on him!"</p>
                  <p>She flung herself once more upon the sofa, her whole body convulsively
                     quivering.</p>
                  <p>"He will kill him! he will kill him. This time to-morrow my darling will be
                     dead! Oh, I cannot bear it! I <emph>will</emph> not bear it!" She started up
                     madly. "This is murder!" she cried shrilly; "foul, cold-blooded murder. It must
                     be stopped."</p>
                  <p>He stood silent, thrilled to the soul by her agony. But again—what could he
                     say, what could he do?</p>
                  <p>"Terry!" she cried, seizing him by the arm and shaking him in her passion, "why
                     don't you say something? Why don't you do something? Why don't you tell me what
                     to do? Oh, you don't care! No one cares. You stand there like a stone and tell
                     me that to-morrow at daybreak my boy is to be murdered. I asked you to take
                     care of him, to keep him from danger, and you promised, and this is how you
                     keep your word. You stand here safe and well, and to-morrow—oh, my heart!
                     to-morrow Eric is to be shot! Go!" She flung him from her with passionate
                     strength. "You are a coward and a traitor! You swore to me, and you have broken
                     your oath. You might have prevented this, and you have not. Terry Dennison, I
                     hate you!"</p>
                  <p>He put out his hand blindly, as though to ward off a blow.</p>
                  <p>"For God's sake, mother!" he said, hoarsely.</p>
                  <p>"Don't call me mother!" she cried, in her insane frenzy. "I wish I had never
                     seen you. I wish I had left you there, in Galway, to live and die. Oh! you
                     might have saved him—you might—you might—and you would not. You come here and
                     tell me that to-morrow you will stand by and see him shot. But you shall not!"
                     she shrieked. "I will go myself—now—this instant, to Eric, to Di Venturini, and
                     on my knees I will beg for my darling's life. I know the prince—he will listen
                     to me—to me, a most wretched<pb n="428-429" xml:id="VAC6444-00000213"/>
                     mother." Her horror, her fear, had driven her for the moment absolutely
                     distraught. She would have rushed from the room but that Dennison caught
                     her.</p>
                  <p>"Lady Dynely, you must not go. For pity's sake stay a moment longer. Eric will
                     never forgive you if you do this."</p>
                  <p>"He will not be alive to-morrow morning if I do not do it! Let me go, Terry
                     Dennison! You will not lift a finger to save him—your own brother—so I must.
                     Let me go."</p>
                  <p>But he held her fast.</p>
                  <p>"Wait a moment," he said; and something in his tone, in his face, even through
                     all her madness, made her stop.</p>
                  <p>She looked at him with eyes all wild and wide with terror, and for the first
                     time saw the bruised and swollen disfiguration of his face. She snatched off
                     his hat and looked at him full.</p>
                  <p>"Terry!" she exclaimed, "what is this?"</p>
                  <p>He turned crimson—a burning, shameful crimson, from brow to chin. In those
                     supreme moments of life, the perceptive faculties are preternaturally
                     sharpened—like a flash the truth burst upon her.</p>
                  <p>"Terry!" she cried out in new horror, "Eric has done this!"</p>
                  <p>He did not speak—he could not. Like inspiration, something of the real truth
                     came to her.</p>
                  <p>"You and he have quarrelled, and he has struck you! Terry!—you—you have not
                     struck him back?"</p>
                  <p>"No," he said, hoarsely and breathlessly, "I did not strike him back. Mother,
                     be silent! the devil has been in me strongly enough once to-night. Let me
                     forget this blow if I can."</p>
                  <p>She flung her arms around his neck, and kissed the brutal mark of her darling's
                     handiwork.</p>
                  <p>"Forgive him, Terry!" she said. "He is your brother—your only brother, and he
                     does not know what he does. Forgive him, have pity on me. In some way you can,
                     you must, prevent this duel. He is all I have. I have loved him so fondly—oh!
                     with more than mother's love—I have been so proud of him, of his beauty, of his
                     grace, of his talents. Everywhere he has gone people have loved and admired
                     him. He is all I have—all I ever had. My heart is wrapped up in him. He worries
                     me—he troubles me, but I could not live if I lost him. Terry! Terry! pity
                     me—pity him. He is so young—life is so bright for him. Pity his wife, whom you
                     love—and in some way—oh, in <emph>any</emph> way! save his life."</p>
                  <p>Her arms held him close—her pale passionate face, over which the tears poured,
                     was upheld to his. So in the supreme selfishness of mother love, she pleaded.
                     In some way she instinctively felt that her only earthly hope was in Terry
                     Dennison.</p>
                  <p>He stood still—a horrible struggle going on within him. He had gone to Eric in
                     all good faith and fellowship, ready to take his place to-morrow before Di
                     Venturini's pistol. And Eric's answer had been a blow. No man had ever struck
                     him before—no man ever was likely to again. It burned like a brand at this
                     moment. And he was called upon to forgive this—this and the hundred other
                     insults Eric Dynely had offered him, and at all risks save his life.</p>
                  <p>"Terry," Lady Dynely said, still holding him close, "do you remember that
                     afternoon last August? We were alone together at Dynely, and I told you your
                     story. I need never have told you—who was there to make me? You knelt at my
                     feet, and I put my arms around you, and kissed you for the first time. I loved
                     you then—I have loved you since, but not—oh, no! not as I loved
                        <emph>him</emph>. Do you remember what I said to you that day? Do you
                     remember what you promised me?"</p>
                  <p>He does not answer. She does not know what she is asking him to do. She does
                     not know of the struggle that is going on in the heart, beating in such hard
                     throbs against her own.</p>
                  <p>"I recall it all, as though it were this moment," she softly went on. "I said
                     to you, 'Be a friend, a brother to my boy. He is not like you—he is reckless
                     and extravagant, easily led, self-willed, and wild. He will go wrong, and you
                     must be his protector. Let nothing he ever says, nothing he ever does, tempt
                     you to anger, tempt you to desert him. Promise me that.'"</p>
                  <pb n="430-431" xml:id="VAC6444-00000214"/>
                  <p>Still silent—still with that strange, rigid look on his face, that half
                     frightens her in the midst of her supremely selfish pleadings, and which she
                     does not understand.</p>
                  <p>"You knelt down, "she went on, "you kissed my hand; and kneeling there, alone
                     with God and me, <emph>this</emph> is what you said:</p>
                  <p>"'Nothing Eric can ever say, can ever do, will tempt me to anger—that I swear.
                     For his sake and for yours, I will do all mortal man can do. You have been the
                     good angel of my life—I would be less than man if I ever forgot it.' You
                     promised that, Terry—the time has come now for you to keep your word."</p>
                  <p>Still silence. Oh! if he would but speak, if that dark, strange, rigid look
                     would but leave his face.</p>
                  <p>"My Terry! my Terry!" she whispered, "you have been brave and noble in the
                     past. For sake of him and me, you gave up name, fortune, love—for sake of him
                     and me, I call upon you now in <emph>some way</emph> to save his life."</p>
                  <p>He drew a long, hard breath, and looked down upon her. Did she know what she
                     asked? No, he saw she did not. All the same though, so that he saved Eric, it
                     didn't much matter.</p>
                  <p>"Terry, speak to me," she pleaded, "don't stand and look at me like this. Oh!
                     if you ever loved me, if you ever loved Crystal, save him who is the life of
                     our lives. Terry, I call upon you—save Eric!"</p>
                  <p>He stooped and kissed her.</p>
                  <p>"Say no more, mother. If mortal man can do it, I will save Eric."</p>
                  <p>She gave a great sob of unutterable joy and relief, laid her face on his
                     shoulder and was still.</p>
                  <p>"You need have no fear," he went on; "Eric shall not fight Di Venturini. And
                     now, too much time has been spent here already. You must go to the Hotel du
                     Louvre at once. Crystal is ill."</p>
                  <p>"Ill?"</p>
                  <p>Rapidly and concisely he narrated his visit to Eric, only suppressing Eric's
                     own insulting language—how Crystal had overheard, and the result. At any other
                     time Lady Dynely would have been unspeakably horrified—now the greater horror
                     had swallowed up all lesser.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes, I will go to her at once. Oh, poor child! Terry, will you tell
                        me—<emph>how</emph> do you mean to save Eric?"</p>
                  <p>He smiled.</p>
                  <p>"You will learn later. At present do not in any way let Eric suspect that you
                     know anything. And—that my plan to save him may succeed—you must give him an
                     opiate to-night."</p>
                  <p>"An opiate?"</p>
                  <p>"He must be made to sleep beyond the hour of meeting, else, not even Crystal's
                     death could keep him away. To steady his nerves for to-morrow some sleep will
                     be necessary—he will, therefore, probably retire early. In fact, you must see
                     that he does, and induce him to take a glass of wine, or beer, and administer
                     an opiate in the drink that will hold him for eight hours at least. All depends
                     upon that."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, I can do that. I have done it often before."</p>
                  <p>"Very well; that is all you are to do. Now go quickly to the Louvre, and
                     perform your part. In about two hours I will call to see how Crystal is. I have
                     other business of importance meantime. For the present good-by."</p>

                  <p>The last act of "La Sorcière d'Or" is over, the ballet has begun, and a group
                     of gentlemen are loitering about the vestibule of the theatre, not quite sure
                     whether they will return to their stalls for the great display of legs and
                     lime-light, or go virtuously home to bed. Mr. Boville is among them, and Mr.
                     Boville is debating within himself the advisability of a little game of
                     lansquenet, as a soothing preparation for slumber, when a man strides hurriedly
                     up and lays his hand heavily on his shoulder.</p>
                  <p>"Boville! I thought I would find you here. Will you leave the theatre and come
                     with me?"</p>
                  <p>Boville swings round and faces his interrogator.</p>
                  <p>"You, Dennison! Certainly, my dear fellow. But what the deuce is the matter? On
                     my word you look like your own ghost."</p>
                  <p>"Come with me," Dennison replies, hurriedly, and Boville links his arm through
                     the dragoon's and goes.</p>
                  <pb n="432-433" xml:id="VAC6444-00000215"/>
                  <p>Without a word, Terry leads him away from the glare and gas-light glitter of
                     the thronged boulevards to some distant, dimly-lighted, deserted street.</p>
                  <p>Without a word Boville follows. This is something serious, he feels. Has the
                     duel got wind? Dennison and Dynely are relatives, Boville hazily
                     recollects—relatives of some sort; he is not quite clear about it. No doubt
                     Dennison has come to speak of the duel; but why with <emph>that</emph>
                     face?</p>
                  <p>"Boville," Terry abruptly begins, "Lord Dynely and Prince Di Venturini fight
                     to-morrow, do they not, and you are Dynely's second?"</p>
                  <p>"Weluctantly—yes. It's a bad business, old boy. Dynely hasn't a ghost of a
                     chance, and so I've told him. But a wilful man—you know the proverb. Besides,
                     weally, you know," Mr. Boville has a rooted objection to the letter R, "I don't
                     see how he is going to get out of it. The Prince—confound him! would bwand him
                     as a coward far and wide, and Eric's not that. My dear Terry," they are passing
                     under a street lamp at the moment, and the light falls full upon his
                     companion's face, "what <emph>have</emph> you been doing to yourself? There is
                     a bwuised swelling the size of an egg between your eyes."</p>
                  <p>Dennison's face turns crimson, a deep, burning, tingling crimson once more. He
                     pulls his hat far over his eyes, and tries to laugh.</p>
                  <p>"An accident, Boville. Never mind my face—I've no beauty to spoil. I've come to
                     talk to you about this duel. At what hour do they meet?"</p>
                  <p>"At first peep of day, between half-past six and seven. It won't do to be
                     later. But who told you? De Concressault or Dynely himself?"</p>
                  <p>"Both. Boville, this meeting must never take place!"</p>
                  <p>"Delighted, I'm shaw, to hear it," drawled Mr. Boville, opening two very small,
                     very sleepy blue eyes to their widest; "never was accessory to a murder in my
                     life—don't want to begin now. But, at the same time, how do you pwopwose to
                     pwevent it?"</p>
                  <p>"You can refuse to act for Eric."</p>
                  <p>Boville shrugged his shoulders and inserted his glass in his eye.</p>
                  <p>"And have my bwains blown out for my pains. Haven't got many bwains, thank
                     Heaven—never was in our family—still, the few I've got I pwopose to keep. That
                     dodge won't work, Terry, twy something else."</p>
                  <p>"It will be downright slaughter, Boville—nothing less."</p>
                  <p>"Know it, dear boy—told Dynely so; but what's the use of telling? He's got into
                     this infernal little scwape, and must take the consequences. He's had his three
                     weeks' flirtation with Felicia—now he's got to pay the penalty. <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">Apwopos des bottes</foreign>, she was in capital fawm
                     to-night—at her loveliest. If it were she that was to be shot to-morrow, I'd
                     assist at the cewemonial with the gweatest pleasure."</p>
                  <p>There is a moment's silence, and the two men walk on in the rain. Then Dennison
                     speaks in an altered voice.</p>
                  <p>"There is one way, Boville—only one."</p>
                  <p>"Vewy pleased to hear it, dear boy. Give it a name."</p>
                  <p>"I must go out in Dynely's place."</p>
                  <p>It is the proud boast of Herbert Boville's life that since he was in pinafores
                     he has never felt surprise or any other earthly emotion. But now—he actually
                     stops in the rain, and stares at his companion, aghast.</p>
                  <p>"Go out in—My dear Dennison, I <emph>don't</emph> think I can have heard you
                     awight. Will you kindly wepeat your last wemark?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh nonsense, Boville—your hearing's all right. I must go out in Dynely's
                     place; such has been my intention from the first, and I call upon you to aid
                     and second me."</p>
                  <p>Boville fixed his glass in his eye, and tried in the darkness to see his
                     friend.</p>
                  <p>"I always thought," he said in a helpless tone, "that I had less bwains myself
                     than any other fellow of my acquaintance. Now I know I was mistaken. Pway,
                     Terry, <emph>when</emph> did you take leave of your senses?"</p>
                  <p>Terry muttered something forcible and strong.</p>
                  <p>"Look here, Boville," he cried impatiently; "don't let us waste time chaffing.
                     As surely as we both stand here, I mean this. Dynely hasn't a ghost of a
                     chance, as we<pb n="434-435" xml:id="VAC6444-00000216"/> both know; for him to
                     meet Di Venturini would be sheer murder. Now with me it is different. I may not
                     be the same dead shot the prince is, and I haven't had his experience with
                     living targets, but my pistol hand is tolerably sure for all that. And I mean
                     to meet Di Venturini to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>He said it with a dogged determination that convinced Boville at last.</p>
                  <p>"By Jove!" he said, "this is a rum go! Do you mean to tell me, Terry, that Eric
                     will stand by and allow this?"</p>
                  <p>Eric knows nothing about it—will not until all is over. He is the last man on
                     earth who <emph>would</emph> allow it. The devil himself is not more obstinate
                     or more plucky than Dynely."</p>
                  <p>"You must be awfully fond of him, Terry, old boy! Gad! I never heard of such a
                     thing in all my life. Knocks Damon and the other fellow into a cocked-hat. By
                     Jove! it does. At the same time you stand no more chance before the prince than
                     Dynely."</p>
                  <p>"I don't think so," Dennison responded, coolly; "as I tell you, I'm a very fair
                     shot and can hold my own with most men."</p>
                  <p>"With most men, perhaps—not with the prince. And, then, it's impossible—oh,
                     utterly impossible! You don't suppose, now, Dennison, you <emph>don't</emph>
                     suppose Di Venturini will fight you instead of Dynely?"</p>
                  <p>"I don't suppose he would, if he knew. It is not my intention to let him
                     know."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, how will you help it?"</p>
                  <p>"Simply enough. Di Venturini never saw Eric in his life."</p>
                  <p>"But he <emph>has</emph> seen you, dear boy, and De Concwessault knows Eric
                     like a book. How do you propose to baffle two pair of eyes?"</p>
                  <p>"Boville," said Terry, earnestly, "this thing has to be done, that is the whole
                     amount of it. Even if I were sure—which I am not at all—that Di Venturini would
                     shoot me, I would still meet him. It will be the early dawn of a dark and rainy
                     morning. I shall wear this slouch hat, which, to a great degree, will hide my
                     face. And in figure and general air Dynely and I are alike—have often been
                     accosted for each other. They will never suspect—how should they? They will
                     take it for granted that I am Lord Dynely, and the duel will be fought, and
                     there will be an end of the matter."</p>
                  <p>"An end of the matter! Ah! very likely. And where, all this time, will be
                     Dynely?"</p>
                  <p>Terry reddened.</p>
                  <p>"Dynely will be asleep—drugged. I have taken care of that."</p>
                  <p>Again Boville paused—in genuine, unfeigned amazement.</p>
                  <p>"Dennison! drugged! By Jove! And who will drug him?"</p>
                  <p>"His mother. At my request."</p>
                  <p>"By Jove!" exclaimed Boville again, and laughed softly. "if this isn't the
                     wummest go. By Jove, Terry, <emph>how</emph> fond you must be of Eric!"</p>
                  <p>Once more Terry reddened violently in the dark.</p>
                  <p>"Look here, Boville," he said again, "it isn't that. It isn't altogether for
                     Eric's sake. I—I don't mind telling you, it's for the sake of his mother and
                     wife. Their very lives are bound up in him—if he is killed it will kill them.
                     And I owe his mother everything—everything, I give you my word, Boville. I
                     stand pledged to her, solemnly, pledged to save her son. And I mean to keep
                     that pledge. There, you have it."</p>
                  <p>"And you expect me to aid and abet you in this Quixotic—yes, Dennison—Quixotic
                     scheme? By Jove! I'll see you shot first!"</p>
                  <p>"You will probably see me shot <emph>at</emph>, at least," Terry answered with
                     a slight laugh. "Come now, Boville, I rely upon you in this. It's for the best
                     all round. Di Venturini will shoot Eric as dead as Queen Anne—now I don't mean
                     to let him shoot me. I flatter myself my chances are as good as his. I will not
                     break my word to Lady Dynely. If you refuse to aid me, I will go to
                        Argyll—<emph>he</emph> will not, I know."</p>
                  <p>"Has Lady Dynely asked you to meet the prince in her son's place?"</p>
                  <p>"Of course not—she would be the last to permit such a thing. All the same; I
                     have promised to save him, and<pb n="436-437" xml:id="VAC6444-00000217"/> there
                     is no other way. As I tell you, she has been my benefactress all my life. If
                     Dynely were killed, his mother and wife would break their hearts. And," Terry
                     drew his breath in hard, "there is no one to care for me."</p>
                  <p>Boville looked at him suddenly. In the dim light the tall figure was curiously
                     like Eric's—he noticed it for the first time. Was his relationship to handsome
                     Eric nearer than the world knew?</p>
                  <p>They had come close upon the Hotel Louvre—the brilliant boulevards almost
                     deserted this wet night. Dennison stopped, and grasped his companion's
                     hand.</p>
                  <p>"You will do this for me, Boville? I can depend upon you?"</p>
                  <p>"Not with my will, I swear, Dennison! But if you insist—?"</p>
                  <p>"I do insist. What is the hour?"</p>
                  <p>"Before seven. But your scheme won't wash. I warn you, Di Venturini and De
                     Concressault will know."</p>
                  <p>"They will <emph>not</emph> know. Until six to-morrow, then, Boville, old
                     fellow, good-night, and sound sleep."</p>
                  <milestone n="* * * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>In Crystal's room the light burned dim. Pale, motionless, she lay, Lady Dynely
                     watching by her side. It was close upon midnight, when a servant came in and
                     softly announced Mr. Dennison.</p>
                  <p>"Terry!" She started up and went to meet him in the outer room.
                        "<emph>Well?</emph>" she whispered, breathlessly.</p>
                  <p>"It is all right," he answered, in the same tone; "and Crystal?"</p>
                  <p>"Crystal is asleep and—safe. It was but a small artery ruptured, and she will
                     be about in a few weeks, so the doctors say."</p>
                  <p>"Thank Heaven!" she heard him murmur. Then "where is Eric?"</p>
                  <p>"Eric is asleep, too. I have done as you bade, Terry. He has had the glass of
                     port, and the opiate in it. He took it as quietly as a child."</p>
                  <p>Her lip quivered. He took her in his arms for a moment, and kissed her.</p>
                  <p>"Keep up heart, mother. I will keep my word. All will be well with Eric. And
                     now," with strange shyness, "before I go—may I go in for a moment and look at
                     Crystal?"</p>
                  <p>She motioned him to enter, remaining outside herself. He went softly in, and
                     knelt reverently down by the little white bed. Like a lily she lay, so cold, so
                     white, so pure.</p>
                  <p>"My little Crystal," he said, under his breath, "my little love, if by the
                     sacrifice of my own life I can bring happiness to you, then I resign it
                     willingly. My own little one! good-by, and God bless and keep you always."</p>
                  <p>Lady Dynely had quitted the dressing room for a moment to glance at her
                     slumbering son. He lay deeply asleep, his head pillowed on his arm, his fair
                     Greek profile turned to the faint light. Then she hurried back to say one last
                     word to Terry, but Terry was gone.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">HOW THE MORNING BROKE.</head>
                  <p>THE rain fell softly and ceaselessly all night—it was falling softly and
                     ceaselessly still when morning dawned. The gray, ragged light was struggling
                     wanly through the leaden sky when a fiacre drove rapidly toward the Bois de
                     Boulogne, and three men got out. They were Dennison, Boville, and an English
                     surgeon, resident of Paris.</p>
                  <p>"You will wait here," Boville said to the cabman; and the three men hurried
                     rapidly along to a secluded and distant spot, where, under the waving trees,
                     scores of "meetings of honor" had taken place before.</p>
                  <p>They were a very silent party. Boville looked perplexed and gloomy, and gnawed
                     his mustache uneasily.</p>
                  <p>"I feel as though I were helping to slaughter you, Dennison," he had groaned as
                     they first started. The band of comradeship between him and Terry was one of
                     many years' standing, and the settled conviction was upon him this dreary
                     morning that Terry was going to his death. The miserable weather, perhaps, had
                     something to do with his forebodings, also the unearthly hour at which he had
                     been obliged to get up, but most of all Di Venturini's reputation as a dead
                     shot.</p>
                  <p>"Wish to Heaven I had never got mixed up in the infewnal business," he growled,
                     inwardly "Eric was bad enough, but this is worse. Nevew heard of such an
                     awangement before—nevew. If Dennison's shot, as he's sure to be, I shall feel
                     like a murdewer all my life."</p>
                  <p>They strode silently on together now, beneath the dripping trees.</p>
                  <p>"We're wather ahead of time, I think," Boville remarked drearily, once, as they
                     passed swiftly over the short, wet grass.</p>
                  <p>"It's always well to err on the right side," Dennison answered cheerfully. "Di
                     Venturini isn't the sort to keep any one waiting when this kind of thing is on
                     hand."</p>
                  <p>He was looking pale and rather jaded. He had slept little or none all night. He
                     had written a brief note to Lady Dynely and another to Eric, and intrusted them
                     to Boville, to be delivered in case of the worst. And the worst would happen,
                     that he felt as surely as Boville himself. The quarrel between Di Venturini and
                     Dynely was of that deadly sort that admitted of no half measures. As surely as
                     he walked here he knew that the prince meant to kill him—if he could.</p>
                  <p>He had altered himself greatly during the preceding night. All his profuse,
                     flame-colored beard had been shaven off, his great, ruddy, trooper mustache
                     trimmed down, and waxed at the points, to resemble Eric's dandy, golden, facial
                     adornment. It deepened the faint likeness between them incredibly—even Boville
                     was genuinely surprised. That impurpled swelling between the eyes had been
                     reduced by judicious applications; the slouched, felt hat, pulled far down, hid
                     it altogether. His coat-collar was turned up, naturally, to exclude the rain,
                     and with the vague, general air of resemblance in their figure and walk, it
                     would really have required a suspicion of the truth to make either Di Venturini
                     or his second suspect the exchange.</p>
                  <p>They reached the spot chosen. It was deserted. Boville looked at his watch.</p>
                  <p>"A quarter of seven. They ought to be here. It won't do to loiter about
                     after—"</p>
                  <p>"Hark!" Dennison interrupted, lifting his finger. Footsteps and voices were
                     approaching rapidly. "I thought his excellency would not keep us waiting long.
                     Here they are."</p>
                  <p>They came in view at the moment. Terry pulled his hat a little farther over his
                     brow, and busied himself in lighting a cigar. Di Venturini bowed to him
                     profoundly, with all the debonnaire grace for which his highness was justly
                     famed. Dennison, like a true-born Briton, returned it<pb n="440-441"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000219"/> stiffly and distantly. De Concressault
                     approached Boville with profuse gesture and apologies for the brief delay.</p>
                  <p>"A million pardons. He was disgusted at having necessitated their waiting in
                     the rain. It was all the fault of their most infamous pig of a driver. Would
                     they proceed to business at once? There was no time to lose."</p>
                  <p>Terry was turned, his face averted, still absorbed by his cigar and refractory
                     Vesuvians, which, dampened by the mist, refused to light. Di Venturini,
                     buttoned up to the throat in a tight black coat, no speck of white anywhere
                     visible, stood leaning against a tree some forty rods distant, a half-smile of
                     devilish malignity and triumph on his face.</p>
                  <p>The preliminaries of the duel were soon arranged; great practice had rendered
                     M. de Concressault an adept in these nice matters of honor. The combatants were
                     to fire simultaneously, at fourteen paces, at the dropping of a handkerchief
                     and the old "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">une, deux, trois</foreign>."</p>
                  <p>"Stand here, M. le Prince, if you please," Boville said, marking the spot; and
                     the prince, with that smile of demoniacal malice and triumph still in his
                     yellow face, bowed and obeyed.</p>
                  <p>"You'll take your place here, Dennison," Boville continued, in an undertone;
                     "and for Heaven's sake fire the very instant I say three."</p>
                  <p>Dennison nodded, threw away his cigar, received his pistol, and took his place.
                     His heart beat fast, with absolute terror, lest he should be recognized. But
                     the shaven beard, the hat pulled down, the coat collar turned up, concealed him
                     effectually. A shapely nose and a ruddy mustache were alone visible; for the
                     rest, the general figure and bearing were sufficiently like Eric's to pass
                     muster in that dull light.</p>
                  <p>There was a moment's pause—Boville held out a white handkerchief.</p>
                  <p>"Ready, messieurs?" Then a pause, "One—two." Another pause, a quick, warning
                     glance at Dennison, "<emph>Three!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>The white handkerchief fell, and simultaneously two shots rang sharply out on
                     the still morning air.</p>
                  <p>Again there was a pause, brief, terrible. The smoke cleared away—both men stood
                     as they had been placed. The prince's left wrist hung broken. Boville's eyes
                     were fixed on Terry. Was he untouched? <emph>No</emph>. As he looked he saw him
                     sway blindly forward, wheel half-round, and fall like a log on his face.</p>
                  <p>Boville and the surgeon rushed forward, the latter first, and turned him over
                     and raised his head. The face was ghastly, the eyes closed, and from the breast
                     in the region of the heart a small stream of blood was making its way through
                     his clothes.</p>
                  <p>"Is he dead?" Boville asked, himself almost as white as the fallen man.</p>
                  <p>"No—fainted, but—"</p>
                  <p>He tore open coat and shirt and examined the wound. A small, livid hole beneath
                     the heart was there on the broad, marble-like bosom, from which that slender
                     red stream yet trickled.</p>
                  <p>"It doesn't look very bad, it doesn't seem to bleed much," Boville cried, in an
                     agony of impatience. "For Heaven's sake, Jackson, speak out! What do you
                     think?"</p>
                  <p>The doctor looked grimly up from his manipulation.</p>
                  <p>"I think there is internal bleeding, Mr. Boville. This young man won't live two
                     hours."</p>
                  <p>Boville rose suddenly, and turned away.</p>
                  <p>"His highness, the prince, does his work well. It's a pity, too—it's the finest
                     physique I ever saw in the whole course of my life. The torso of a Hercules, by
                     George. In the ordinary course of things this poor fellow would have lived to
                     be ninety."</p>
                  <p>"Can he be moved?" Hubert Boville asked, in a stifled voice.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes! he must, I suppose. It may hasten the end, but won't alter it. Where
                     are you going to take him?"</p>
                  <p>"To the Hotel du Louvre. His friends are there."</p>
                  <p>"Poor lad! By Jupiter, <emph>what</emph> a bust!" the doctor cried, lost in
                     professional admiration.</p>
                  <p>At this moment the prince and the captain of Zouaves sauntered up.</p>
                  <p>"See if he's dead, De Concressault," they heard Di<pb n="442-443"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000220"/> Venturini say nonchalantly; "my right hand must
                     be losing its cunning if he is not. I certainly meant to kill him."</p>
                  <p>"Oh! <foreign xml:lang="FRA">il est mort</foreign>," De Concressault responded,
                     with equal carelessness; "he's shot through the heart, and the sooner you are
                     over the frontier the better, M. le Prince. Messieurs, <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >bonjour!</foreign>" He lifted his hat, bowed profoundly, and without
                     another look at their victim, both hastily quitted the ground.</p>
                  <milestone n="* * * * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>Seven! by the great booming bell of Notre Dame. Seven, by all the steeples of
                     Paris. Seven, by the little Swiss clock in the chamber where Crystal lay,
                     feverishly asleep, and Lady Dynely, senior, sat pale and worn, watching. In the
                     adjoining dressing-room, on the broad, soft sofa, Eric lay still, in deepest,
                     dreamless sleep. Safe! and the fatal hour past.</p>
                  <p>Where was Terry? What was he doing? In what way had he stopped the duel? Lady
                     Dynely's heart was beating anxiously and fast—some dim, prophetic prescience of
                     the truth was trying to force its way upon her, but she would not listen. No,
                     no! Terry would never be so insane as that. He was not reckless and foolish
                     like Eric—he would never think of keeping his word in <emph>that</emph> way.
                     Only—as she had never longed for any one's coming in her life, she longed for
                     Terry's now.</p>
                  <p>Half-past seven. She arose from her place by Crystal's bed and went into Eric's
                     room. Still asleep—soundly, sweetly—like a little child, his blonde, handsome
                     head still pillowed on his arm, a placid expression of profound rest on his
                     face. She stooped low and kissed him—a prayer for him in her heart. He was the
                     idol of her life—he always had been. And but for Terry he might be lying dead
                     out there in the rain somewhere, even now—yes, even now. How good he was, how
                     generous, poor Terry!—few would have resigned life's best gifts as he had to
                     his younger brother, for her sake. She would show him in the future how
                     grateful she was, how noble she thought him.</p>
                  <p>Eric stirred in his sleep—he murmured a word. She bent low to catch it—was it
                     hers, was it his wife's name? He turned and spoke again, more loudly.</p>
                  <p>"Felicia," he said, "Felicia, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ma belle</foreign>, I
                     will meet you tomorrow."</p>
                  <p>She recoiled with a sudden revulsion of feeling. Even in his sleep it was of
                     that wicked sorceress his thoughts were—that fatal woman, who had so nearly
                     compassed his death. She turned without another look, and hurried from the
                     room.</p>
                  <p>Eight o'clock. Still Terry did not come. Oh, what detained him? Surely he must
                     know how anxious she was.</p>
                  <p>A quarter past. She arose impatiently to quit the room, and on the landing,
                     ascending the stairs, she came face to face with Hubert Boville.</p>
                  <p>At the first glance, before he opened his lips, before a word had passed, she
                     knew something had happened. His clothes were wet with rain, his high boots
                     splashed with mud, his face pale, his eyes excited. He took off his hat as he
                     saw her, and she instinctively recoiled.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Boville!" she gasped. "Oh, what is it?"</p>
                  <p>"I was coming in search of you, Lady Dynely," he said. There was an instinctive
                     coldness in his courteous tone—had not <emph>she</emph> in some way sent
                     Dennison to his doom? "I am the bearer of very sad and shocking news. Poor
                     Terry Dennison—"</p>
                  <p>He stopped. With a cry he never forgot—a cry whose exceeding bitterness made
                     him pity her even in that hour—she staggered back against the wall, and put out
                     her hand to ward off the blow that must come.</p>
                  <p>"I see you suspect the truth," he said, more gently. "I am very sorry—sorrier
                     than I can ever say—that I, in any way, have had a hand in this. But the duel
                     has been fought; he met him in Lord Dynely's place; and—we have brought him
                     here. He is below in the cab. Will you have a room prepared at once, Lady
                     Dynely—there is no time to lose."</p>
                  <p>She stood literally gasping for breath. Her hand over her heart. Oh! what was
                     this?—what was this?</p>
                  <p>"There is no time to lose," Boville repeated again. He had little sympathy for
                     the hysterics of the woman who, to<pb n="444-445" xml:id="VAC6444-00000221"/>
                     shield her own son, had, he knew, urged Dennison to save him at any cost. "I
                     must beg of you, Lady Dynely—"</p>
                  <p>She came a step forward, and grasped his arm.</p>
                  <p>"Is he dead?" she asked, in a voice no one would have recognized as her
                     own.</p>
                  <p>"No, my lady; not yet."</p>
                  <p>The answer seemed to inspire her with galvanic life. "While there is life there
                     is hope." He was not dead. Oh! Heaven be praised!—he might not die after
                     all.</p>
                  <p>"Bring him up," she cried, starting forward, "at once—at once, to this
                     room."</p>
                  <p>She pointed to it, and hastened forward to prepare it with her own hands.
                     Boville departed. She summoned her maid, and together, with feverish haste,
                     they made ready the bed.</p>
                  <p>They carried him up between them—a stark, rigid form—and laid him on the
                     bed.</p>
                  <p>As she looked upon the bloodless, awfully corpse-like face, the closed eyes,
                     the blue rigid lips, a sudden stillness came over her. Was that Terry—Terry
                     Dennison?—whom only eight hours ago she had seen in all the strength and vigor
                     of youth and powerful manhood? That Terry?—Terry, who never, in all the twenty
                     years she had known him, had had one sick day? That Terry, lying there cold and
                     motionless—so awfully white, so awfully still?</p>
                  <p>"My dear Lady Dynely," said Boville, with real compassion, touched by the
                     ghastly horror of her face, "come away."</p>
                  <p>She turned to him.</p>
                  <p>"You told me," she whispered. "You told me he was not dead."</p>
                  <p>"Neither he is—only insensible. Come with me—you <emph>must</emph> come for the
                     present. The doctor is going to try to find the ball. The moment the operation
                     is over you shall return."</p>
                  <p>He led her from the room, her face still fixed in that look of white
                     horror.</p>
                  <p>"Where is Lord Dynely?" he asked.</p>
                  <p>"Asleep," she whispered; "<emph>he</emph> told me, and I—for my son's sake, I
                     made Terry do this—for my son's sake I sent him to his death. It is I—I—who
                     have killed him. Oh, Heaven! this is how he meant to keep his word."</p>
                  <p>She fell down upon a fauteuil, her face hidden in her hands. He could say
                     nothing—do nothing—she only spoke the truth. He had a man's natural dislike to
                     scenes, and so left her.</p>
                  <p>He returned to the chamber he had quitted. The surgeon rose at his entrance
                     from his work.</p>
                  <p>"Well?" Boville asked.</p>
                  <p>"I cannot extract the bullet, and he is dying. You may as well tell them so. He
                     will be a dead man in an hour."</p>
                  <p>"Poor fellow!" Hubert Boville stood with folded arms, an expression of bitter
                     regret on his face, looking down upon his friend and comrade. "Yes, death is
                     imprinted here. And when the last great muster roll is called," he said, with
                     unconscious pathos, "no truer friend, no braver soldier, will ever answer than
                     Terry Dennison."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">"WHILE IT WAS YET DAY."</head>
                  <p>HALF AN HOUR had passed. Lady Dynely knew that Terry Dennison was about to
                     die.</p>
                  <p>The truth was broken to her by France Forrester. Miss Forrester; coming early
                     and hastily to relieve her ladyship's watch by the sick bed of Eric's wife, had
                     heard the first version of the truth from the whispering servants of the hotel.
                     Pale with wonder and terror she had asked for Mr. Boville, and Mr. Boville had
                     come forward and told the whole truth. So! he had crowned all the sacrifices of
                     the past for Lady Dynely and her son by yielding up his life. Surely he had
                     paid his debt.</p>
                  <p>"Is he conscious?" she asked, with strange, mournful calm. Her own great sorrow
                     had left its traces on her worn, pale face, but still more in the unnatural
                     quiet and gravity of her manner.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, he has been conscious for the last five minutes."</p>
                  <p>"May I go in?" she pleaded. "I will not disturb him. I will be very quiet."</p>
                  <p>"Certainly," Boville said, "and Lady Dynely must be told, too. I—I wish
                        <emph>you</emph> would tell her, Miss Forrester. I hate breaking things to
                     people."</p>
                  <p>"I will tell her. How long will he live?"</p>
                  <p>"Half an hour perhaps. Certainly not more."</p>
                  <p>"Have you sent for a clergyman? No. Then do so at once."</p>
                  <p>She passed into the room. The blinds were up, the full light of the gray, rainy
                     morning streamed in. She bent over the bed. The face was still and colorless as
                     marble, the eyes closed. Her own filled.</p>
                  <p>"Does he suffer?" she whispered to the doctor across the bed.</p>
                  <p>"Very little, if any. The hemorrhage is internal. There is faintness, but no
                     pain."</p>
                  <p>The low whisper reached him. He opened his eyes, and a smile of recognition
                     came over his face.</p>
                  <p>"France!" he said, faintly.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Terry." Then all at once a great choking seized her and she could say no
                     more.</p>
                  <p>"Don't cry," he said, still faintly, smiling, "it will—be—all right."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, dear old fellow, I think it will." She stooped down with infinite pity
                     and tenderness and kissed him. "You—you are going, Terry—do you know it?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes. It's all right, France. Don't cry so. It's awfully good of you to
                     come."</p>
                  <p>His strength seemed to rally for a moment. He looked anxiously around.</p>
                  <p>"Where am I? This isn't my room."</p>
                  <p>"Don't make him talk too much," the doctor said. "Here, sir, drink this."</p>
                  <p>He swallowed the spoonful of liquid and still watched France with anxious
                     eyes.</p>
                  <p>"You are in one of Eric's rooms."</p>
                  <p>"Eric," his eyes lighted, "where is Eric?"</p>
                  <p>"Asleep. Would you like to see him?"</p>
                  <p>The light faded from his face. All at once he recalled the livid bruise between
                     his eyes, and averted it even in that hour.</p>
                  <p>"He—might not—care to come," he said with difficulty. "How is—Crystal?"</p>
                  <p>"Crystal is recovering. Oh! don't think of her, of him, of any one, dear old
                     Terry, but yourself. We have sent for a clergyman. He will be here in a moment.
                     You will see him?"</p>
                  <p>He nodded assent.</p>
                  <p>"Where is the madre?" he asked.</p>
                  <p>"In the next room—broken-hearted. Shall I go for her?"</p>
                  <pb n="448-449" xml:id="VAC6444-00000223"/>
                  <p>"Poor mother! Yes."</p>
                  <p>She turned at once to go. As she did so the door opened and the clergyman came
                     hastily in.</p>
                  <p>"I will leave you with him for ten minutes," France whispered, "then we will
                     all return."</p>
                  <p>She hurried from the room and into the presence of Lady Dynely. As she had
                     fallen down half an hour ago, Lady Dynely still lay in a sort of stupor of
                     dull, infinite misery. France lifted her head.</p>
                  <p>"Rouse yourself, Lady Dynely," she said: "he has asked for you, poor boy. You
                     must go to him."</p>
                  <p>To her dying day France never forgot the utter wretchedness of the face
                     uplifted at her command.</p>
                  <p>"He is dying, France, and I—I have killed him. I made him swear to save Eric,
                     no matter how, no matter how, and he has given his life for my son. And, last
                     night, Eric struck him, struck him full in the face. No, I cannot go to him—I
                     can never look upon him again."</p>
                  <p>"This is folly, Lady Dynely!" exclaimed the girl, her eyes kindling. "Are you
                     altogether heartless? He has asked for you—your absence will embitter his last
                     hour. You <emph>must</emph> go to him, Eric must go. Oh!" France cried, "have
                     you not made him suffer enough, you and Eric, that you are so ready to make him
                     suffer still at the last?"</p>
                  <p>Lady Dynely arose wildly to her feet.</p>
                  <p>"I will go to him! I will do anything! I will go to him at once."</p>
                  <p>"Not quite at once. A clergyman is with him. Leave them alone for a little. But
                     rouse up Eric; fetch him with you; tell him all."</p>
                  <p>"Tell him all!" Lady Dynely repeated. She stood, a strange, excited expression
                     crossing her face. "Yes," she said, under her breath, "I will tell him all—ALL.
                     It is time."</p>
                  <p>She ran from the room, and into Eric's. He was moving and muttering restlessly
                     now, the opiate beginning to lose its effect. She seized him by the arm and
                     shook him roughly.</p>
                  <p>"Awake, Eric!" she cried; "awake at once."</p>
                  <p>He opened his eyes immediately and stared up at her in a dazed way.</p>
                  <p>"What's the matter, mother? Have you gone mad? Crystal—"</p>
                  <p>He half rose on his elbow with a look of alarm.</p>
                  <p>"Never mind Crystal—wake up!"</p>
                  <p>"I <emph>have</emph> woke up. What's the matter with you? What's the hour?"
                     Then, like lightning, memory rushed upon him; his face flushed, turned pale. He
                     pulled out his watch and looked at the time. A quarter of nine. "Great Heaven!"
                     he exclaimed, and fell back among the pillows.</p>
                  <p>"Ay!" his mother cried, bitterly, "look at the hour. The time for the duel is
                     past, is it not? And the duel has been fought, and your honor saved. Oh, my
                     heart! such honor. You are safe here, and he lies dying there—for you. Your own
                     brother, Eric—your elder brother!"</p>
                  <p>He sat and stared at her, thinking she had gone mad, quite speechless.</p>
                  <p>"No," she said, "I have not lost my senses, though you look as if you thought
                     it. The duel has been fought; Terry took your place, and he lies dying in
                     yonder room now, for you, and for me, and for Crystal—the friend whom you
                     struck last night—the brother whose birthright you have usurped all your
                     life!"</p>
                  <p>Still he sat speechless—still he was staring at her, not comprehending a
                     word.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, you don't understand—you won't understand, and time is flying and every
                     moment is precious. I must go to him. Eric, rouse yourself! try to comprehend
                     what I am saying. Terry met Prince Di Venturini this morning, and fought your
                     duel for <emph>you</emph>. I made him! I nearly went mad when he came to me
                     last night and told me of Crystal's accident first, and of your challenge. I
                     don't know what I said, I don't know what I did, only I made him promise to
                     save you, and he has, he has!"</p>
                  <p>He was beginning to understand now. His face turned white, his lips set
                     themselves.</p>
                  <p>"Go on," he said, speaking for the first time.</p>
                  <p>"I gave you an opiate and you slept while he went out<pb n="450-451"
                        xml:id="VAC6444-00000224"/> and met the prince in your place. He is dying in
                     that room, and he has asked for you and for me; and he is your brother, Eric,
                     your own brother."</p>
                  <p>"My brother! Mother, are you mad? I have no brother."</p>
                  <p>But he grew whiter still as he said it. The resemblance between them—the vague,
                     unsatisfactory story of his relationship to them—all flashed upon him; and then
                     he knew what manner of man his father had been.</p>
                  <p>"He is your brother—your very own; your father's son. Oh, not as you think,"
                     seeing the expression of his face; "his mother was Lord Dynely's wife. I have
                     all the proofs, and he was three years old when you were born."</p>
                  <p>He rose up.</p>
                  <p>"His mother was Lord Dynely's wife—his <emph>wife!</emph> And Terry is three
                     years older than I am. Mother, what is this?"</p>
                  <p>"The truth! And Terry Dennison is your father's elder son and heir! I knew it
                     since the night of your father's death; he confessed all, dying, whilst I knelt
                     by his bedside. You never for one moment have had a right to the title you
                     bear. Terry Dennison is Lord Viscount Dynely!"</p>
                  <p>He fell heavily back on the seat he had quitted.</p>
                  <p>"And you concealed this?" he said, in a hoarse whisper.</p>
                  <p>"No—I told him. I told him last August. When he wanted to go down to
                     Lincolnshire and ask Crystal Higgins to be his wife, I detained him. I could
                     not let him go in ignorance. I kept him and told him all—all, Eric! I thought
                     he would have ousted you and claimed his own. That was why I wanted you so much
                     to marry France Forrester and her fortune. But he gave up all, Eric—name,
                     title, wealth—for the love of you and me."</p>
                  <p>He buried his face in his hands and turned from her—stunned.</p>
                  <p>"He might have won Crystal—she was his before you came—she was all he had, and
                     you took her from him. He might have taken from <emph>you</emph> title and
                     fortune, and he did not. Last night he came to you in all good faith and
                     brotherly love, and—and," a great gasp, "you struck him, Eric! I kissed the
                     brutal mark on his poor face last night. This morning he went out in your place
                     and met the prince, and was shot down as <emph>you</emph> would have been. And
                     he lies dying there; he will be dead before the hour ends."</p>
                  <p>He put out his hand with a fierce gesture to stop her.</p>
                  <p>"Cease!" he said, hoarsely. "Oh, God! I <emph>cannot</emph> bear it!"</p>
                  <p>She obeyed—a rain of tears pouring over her face. He lay mute—quivering through
                     all his strong young frame.</p>
                  <p>"Leave me," he said, in the same hoarse voice, "I want to be alone."</p>
                  <p>She turned to go, but on the threshold she stopped.</p>
                  <p>"You will come, Eric," she said, "when we send?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes. Go!"</p>
                  <p>She went. France stood waiting for her at the door.</p>
                  <p>"He has asked for you again. He is sinking fast. Come."</p>
                  <p>She led her into that other room. The clergyman's last offices were over. On
                     the face, lying among the pillows, the cold dews of death already stood. She
                     fell down on her knees by the bed and took the dying head in her arms. He
                     opened his heavy eyes and smiled—a smile of great content.
                     "<emph>Mother</emph>," he said, and lay still.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, my Terry! my Terry!" she cried out, "forgive me before you go."</p>
                  <p>"There is—nothing—to forgive," he spoke, slowly and faintly, but clearly. "You
                     were always good to me. I loved you all my life, mother. Don't cry—it's better
                     so. Eric," his eyes looked wistfully toward the door, he sighed wearily, "Eric
                     won't come?"</p>
                  <p>"Eric will come." She bent down and kissed him, and in that kiss whispered: "I
                     have told him all."</p>
                  <p>"All!" He looked up at her quickly, almost in reproof. "That was wrong."</p>
                  <p>"It was right. I should have told him long ago. Oh, my boy! my own Terry! how
                     good you are."</p>
                  <p>He smiled—Terry's own amused smile. Then he closed his eyes wearily, and lay
                     still again.</p>
                  <pb n="452-453" xml:id="VAC6444-00000225"/>
                  <p>Obeying a motion of her hand, France had gone to fetch Eric.</p>
                  <p>He came in—white as death itself, an agony of remorse, of sorrow, upon his
                     face, changing it beyond all telling. He knelt down on the opposite side of the
                     bed, and laid his face on one of Terry's hands, without a word.</p>
                  <p>"Eric! dear old boy!" The old, glad, loving light lit the dying eyes. "I'm glad
                     you've come. You don't mind what I did this morning? Di Venturini will never
                     know. It's all right, isn't it?"</p>
                  <p>He was watching him wistfully.</p>
                  <p>Was Eric angry? But Eric only lifted his face for a minute, and laid it down
                     again.</p>
                  <p>"All right! Oh, Terry! you break my heart."</p>
                  <p>What was it fell on Terry's hand? Tears, and from the eyes of Eric Dynely! For
                     a moment Terry himself could not speak.</p>
                  <p>"It is all right, then," he said, under his breath. "Dear old boy, I'm glad of
                     that."</p>
                  <p>Then there was stillness. He lay in Lady Dynely's arms, his face pillowed on
                     her breast, his eyes closed, his breathing coming quick and hard. On the other
                     side knelt Eric, never moving or looking up. The dull, melancholy light stole
                     in and fell upon him, stricken down there, in the glory and strength of his
                     manhood. France Forrester watched him mournfully, from her post at the foot of
                     the bed.</p>
                  <p>"And his sun went down, while it was yet day," she thought. "My own dear Terry!
                     as clean of heart, as brave of soul, as loyal a knight as any Arthur or Galahad
                     of them all."</p>
                  <p>Suddenly his eyes opened, and he looked up in Lady Dynely's face.</p>
                  <p>"I—have—kept my promise," he said, slowly. "I never quarrelled—with Eric."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, my boy! my Terry!" she could only answer through her tears.</p>
                  <p>He moved a little.</p>
                  <p>"Eric," he whispered, and Eric lifted his pale face and red, tear-wet eyes.
                        "Good-by—<emph>brother</emph>," he said, so low that Eric had to lay his ear
                     to his lips to catch the words; "be good—to—Crystal."</p>
                  <p>He closed them once more, exhausted, and lay still. There was a sudden, short
                     convulsion of the limbs—it passed, and he was quiet. So he had lain for fully
                     five minutes, his head resting a dull weight in Lady Dynely's arms. A sharp
                     terror seized her—she looked helplessly around.</p>
                  <p>"Is he asleep?" she piteously asked.</p>
                  <p>Hubert Boville came forward and bent over him. He laid his hand on his heart
                     for a moment, and listened for his breathing. Then he stood up.</p>
                  <p>"Not asleep," he said, very gently; "dead."</p>

                  <p>IN <title>Galignani's Messenger</title> of next day there appeared this
                     paragraph:</p>
                  <p>"FEARFUL DUEL.—Yesterday morning, at seven o'clock, a meeting took place in the
                     Bois de Boulogne between a certain princely personage, well known in the
                     Italian political world, and an English lieutenant of dragoon guards. His
                     excellency the prince was attended by Captain De C—cr—lt, of the —th Zouaves,
                     and the other combatant by the Hon. H. B—ville, attache of the British Embassy.
                     As usual there was a lady in the case. The duel was fought with pistols, at
                     fourteen paces. The first fire proved fatal—the Englishman being shot through
                     the heart. The police are on the track of the noble fugitive, but up to the
                     present without success."</p>
                  <p>In the same column another paragraph appeared which created a far wider and
                     deeper sensation.</p>
                  <p>"SUDDEN AND MYSTERIOUS DEATH.—It is with deepest regret we announce to our
                     readers the awfully sudden and most mysterious death of the charming actress
                     whose beauty and versatility have crowded the Varieties for the past four
                     months—Madame Felicia. Last night she gave one of the delightful receptions for
                     which she has ever been justly famed, and appeared in her usual excellent
                     health and spirits. She retired about midnight, still seemingly perfectly well.
                     In the morning her maid found her dead in her bed. Suspicion of foul play is at
                     work, and a post-mortem will probably discover the cause of this death, which
                     all theatre-going Parisians will deeply regret.</p>
                  <milestone n="* * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>It is the close of an exquisite June day. The old, long-deserted deserted
                     gardens of Caryllynne glow in the warm rose light. Down one of the paths an
                     elderly lady, with snow-white hair, is being wheeled in an invalid chair by a
                     dark damsel, with black sombre eyes and a look of prophetic melancholy on her
                     face. The elderly lady glances over her shoulder with tender, kindly eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Are you not tired, Donny?" she asks, gently. "You must be. You have been
                     wheeling me for fully an hour. Do call Esther, my child."</p>
                  <p>The black, melancholy eyes light.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! no, grandmamma—I never grow tired when with you."</p>
                  <p>"My dear, how mournful you look, though. Do we not make you happy, little one?
                     Tell grandmamma what it is."</p>
                  <p>"Happy!" she clasps her hands almost with passion. "Oh, so happy!—so happy that
                     I grow afraid. It is like Heaven to be with you, and papa, and mamma France. No
                     one was ever good to me before since Joan died—except that
                        night—<emph>him</emph>."</p>
                  <p>"Poor Terry!" Mrs. Caryll sighs; "he was good to all things. And so it is
                     excess of happiness that makes you sad? A paradox, surely, but I am glad it is
                     no worse."</p>
                  <p>She takes her in her arms and kisses her fondly.</p>
                  <p>"I want you to be happy, my child—I want to make you happy, to atone in some
                     way for all the unhappiness I have given your father. Love him, Donny, for his
                     past life—oh, my own dear Gordon has been dreary and loveless enough."</p>
                  <p>"I <emph>do</emph> love him," the girl answers, her great eyes shining. "Who
                     could help it? So noble, so handsome, so good he is. And he is happy now—who
                     would <emph>not</emph> be happy with Mamma France? And to think that to-morrow
                     is their wedding day, and that I am to be one of the bride-maids! How strange
                     it seems."</p>
                  <p>"It is a happiness he has waited for long—poor Gordon," his mother answers.</p>
                  <p>"And I have been thinking, too, grandmamma, of—of <emph>her</emph>," she drops
                     her voice, and the great eyes dilate; "it was all so sudden, and so dreadful.
                     Oh! I wonder what it was!—what made her die like that? Did they ever find
                     out?"</p>
                  <pb n="456-457" xml:id="VAC6444-00000227"/>
                  <p>"Not for certain, Donny, dear. Ah! don't let us talk about it to-night—on this
                     happy bridal eve. Poor soul! it was a terrible fate." She shudders as she says
                     it. She will not tell the daughter she was poisoned. Poisoned—whether by
                     herself, maid, or whom, has never been discovered. There are those who have
                     strong suspicions of the truth, but—in Naples, Prince Di Venturini reigns in
                     the halls of his forefathers, and in this world at least justice does not seem
                     likely to reach him.</p>
                  <p>On the terrace above, Gordon Caryll walks, France by his side, and both pace to
                     and fro in the roselight of the summer sunset, with hearts too full of bliss
                     for many words. France looks down at the pair below, the pink flush of the sky
                     kindling into brightness Donny's dusk face.</p>
                  <p>"She will be very handsome," Miss Forrester says; "and—very like her
                     mother."</p>
                  <p>His face clouds for a second.</p>
                  <p>"Poor child!—yes. Let us trust the likeness will end there. How fond my mother
                     seems of her. They are never happy apart. France!" he looks at her suddenly,
                     and a smile that is more radiant than the sunset lights his grave face, "this
                     time to-morrow you will be suffering agonies of sea-sickness crossing the
                     channel. You always <emph>are</emph> sea-sick, you know."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I know." She smiles back for a moment, then grows grave. "Don't let us
                     visit Paris, Gordon, I never want to see Paris more. I can never—no,
                     never—suffer again in this life as I have suffered there."</p>
                  <p>"We will go wherever you please, my own France."</p>
                  <p>There is silence again. The rose light is fading from the sky—its last rays
                     fall on one of the many painted windows of the old manor, the motto of the
                     house, cut in the panes, shines out:</p>
                  <p>"<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Post tenebræ, lux</foreign>," she reads. "Oh, Gordon!
                     the past has been very dark for you—if my love can lighten the future there
                     will never be another dark hour."</p>
                  <milestone n="* * * * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>In her dower house Lady Dynely, the elder, dwells alone. She has never quite
                     recovered from the shock of that deathbed in Paris—she never will.</p>
                  <p>"From first to last my own selfish love for my son spoiled his life," she ever
                     says; "<emph>he</emph> did not know what selfishness meant. I and mine blighted
                     his existence—brought him to his death. <emph>He</emph> forgave me—Heaven may—I
                     never will forgive myself."</p>
                  <p>So she lives on, quietly doing good to all. No one can accuse her of
                     selfishness now. Her son is a better son than he ever was before, but she knows
                     that he, who died that rainy February morning, loved and honored her, as no
                     human being ever did before, ever will again. They brought him home, and the
                     great vault of the Dynelys was opened, and he was laid to sleep with them.
                     People wondered at it a good deal—but then Lady Dynely had always been a little
                     eccentric since her husband's death. They wonder still more as they read the
                     inscription above him. It is a slab of plain gray granite, with gold lettering,
                     and it says this: <q>
                        <p>SACRED TO THE MEMORY<lb/> OF<lb/> TERENCE DENNISON,<lb/> WHO GAVE HIS
                           LIFE TO SAVE ANOTHER'S,<lb/> FEBRUARY 29TH, 18—.<lb/> ÆTAT 25 YEARS.<lb/>
                              "<hi rend="i"/>Greater love than this no man hath:—That he lay down
                           his life for his friend."</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <milestone n="* * * * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>In this same rosy sunset, Crystal, Viscountess Dynely, sits alone, fair and
                     sweet, and youthful, as this time last year when she walked about the
                     Lincolnshire lanes and waited for Terry Dennison to come and ask her to be his
                     wife. She is alone, dressed for dinner in the crisp white muslin and blue
                     ribbons that become her childish fairness best, and which her husband best
                     likes to see her wear. And if that husband fancied hodden-gray or sackcloth and
                     ashes, be very sure this exceptional wife would never have donned other array.
                     She is waiting for him now to come to dinner, listening with love's impatience
                     for the first sound of the footstep<pb n="458-459" xml:id="VAC6444-00000228"/>
                     step, the first note of the gay whistle she knows so well. For she is happy
                     once more, poor Crystal, and Eric is all her own again.</p>
                  <p>She knows the whole story. Weeks after, when strength had come back to the weak
                     frame, and light to the dim blue eyes, sitting side by side, his arm around
                     her, Eric had told all—all. Nothing had been hidden, and she learned at last
                     how noble was the heart she had refused, the heart stilled forever. The blue
                     eyes dilated, the lips parted and quivered, the tender face grew very pale, and
                     she flung her arms about her husband wildly, and strained him to her.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Eric!" she cried out; "to think it might have been you!"</p>
                  <p>Oh, selfish human heart! To the depths of her soul she wondered at the brave
                     generosity of him who was gone; to her inmost heart she bowed down in
                     reverence. She wept for his loss, real and passionate tears—dear, brave, noble
                     Terry! her playmate and friend,—but her first thought was for her own idol, her
                     first impulse one of unutterable gladness that it had not been he. She caught
                     her breath; with the horror of it, and while her tears fell for Terry, she held
                     the man for whom Terry had died, close to her impassioned little heart, and
                     cried, again and again:</p>
                  <p>"Oh, my darling! my darling! to think it might have been <emph>you!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>As Eric never had, never would, she knew Terry had loved her. She was grateful
                     to him; she strewed his coffin with flowers; she wept her pretty eyes red,
                     again and again, over his grave; but she loved Eric, and she never thought of
                     that dreadful morning under the dripping trees of the Bois de Boulogne without
                     a prayer of trembling thankfulness that it was <emph>he</emph> who was taken,
                     and not her beloved.</p>
                  <p>And Eric is very good to her, very gentle and tender with her, very
                     affectionate, after the manner of men and husbands. And she does not ask much;
                     she gives so greatly that a small return suffices. That small return, let me
                     say, the Right Honorable Lord Viscount Dynely gives willingly and from his
                     heart; and Crystal is happy—and the curtain falls to universal felicity? Well,
                     as the leopard cannot change his spots, nor the Ethiop his skin, so men of Lord
                     Dynely's stamp do not change their nature. Kind he will be to her always—Terry
                     Dennison's dead face would rise from the grave to haunt him if he were
                     not—affectionate, too, after his light, for in a sultan-like, off-hand way,
                     lordly Eric is fond of his little wife; faithful, also, with a fidelity that
                     will include more or less admiration and attention for every pretty woman he
                     meets; but for Crystal, or France, or one of us all, to be perfectly happy, is
                     not given to any one born of woman. <emph>This</emph>, Crystal knows—that all
                     the happiness that is hers, all that ever will be hers, has come to her across
                     Terry Dennison's grave.</p>
