BY NED BUNTLINE   NEW  YORK: NO. 24 ANN STREET.  &#xD;<pb n="0" xml:id="VAC6983-00000002"/> ENTERED according to Act of Congres, in the year 1859, BY CAULDWELL, SOUTHWORTH &amp; WHTNEY, in the Clerk's Offioe of the District Court for the Southern District of New York.   SEA WAIF   OR,   THE TERROR OF THE COAST    CHAPTER I. ' I'd -like to know your history, Captain Sea- waif-I'd like very much to know your history, sir!t- I think I've a right to sir- a right, yon understand. Andif there is any one thing which I stick out for more peremptorilythan another, it is right,sir-right! That is why I, Phineas Cringle, merchant, et-cet-era, et-cet-e-ra, am an open and avowed patriot, sir, - Old Eng- land is wrong, and Young America is right- Therefore , I'm with her. You are a young man, yet you come so well recommended to me as a skilltul seaman, a fearless- man and an honest one, withal, that I like you, though you're not so rough in the figure-head as good sea-dogs ge- nerally are. I have given yot .command of the ' Tyrannicide,' as good a craft as floats on salt water-well manned, well officered, well armed, et-cet--ra-et-cet-'e-ra-; and I know that she'll be well commanded. Butyour history, sir, your historyI ." "At present, I have no history worth listen- ing to, Mr. Cringle; but I will tryto write one with my sword which all the world can read Ir The conversation with which I open this story occurred at about the time of the com- mencement of that revolution which gave free- dom to the United Colonies of America, in the store of the first speaker, Mr. Phineas Cringle, "merchant, ett-cet ra," as he always called himself. he was a curious, but a good old manl-very eccentric in his ways, but as sound at heart as a young, unshaken oak.  His age was full sity, and his long, natural hair was white as snow, and-hung in masses down about his neck; * but his elose-shaven face ws as smooth and as rosy almost as -that of Kate Cringle, is  blooming and beautiful daughter, who was just eighteen. 'His eyes, too, were bright -and laughing, almost too much for. abusiness man -which he was, in the striotest sensee.  Mr. Cringle' short, thick-set figure wa    dressed in a claret, shad-bellied coat, buff waistcoat, long-according to the then fashion -knee-breeches, (claretlike his coat), white cotton long hose, with immense silver biecles in his shoes. Upon his head he wore the tri- cornered continental hat of the dtay with a red wlite and blue- cockade placed so con- spicously on it, that all who looked might see that he did not fear to wear the sign of a pa: triot American. The person whom he spoke to was a young man, probably twenty-five years ot age-a per- son wit a .pale and student-like face, a face expressive of intellect, but sad-looking, though well featured, Hise eyes were large, dark blue, and shaded by long, brown lashes; his flowing hair and soft, glossy beard (which never had known the contaminating touch of a razor) was of a rich, dark brown; his figure 'was slight, yet very graceful ; his entire appearance quiet, and exceedingly genteel. But when his eye looked upon you, there was a something in its cold, clear depth-a something in the ex- pression of his curved lip, that told you, that when manhood was needed, he was there, in, spite of the delicacy of his appearance. His dress was a naval frock-coat, with -epallet straps, upon the shoulders, plain pantaloons and boots, and a blue naval cap. He wore no weapons there-yet he looked like one who could wear a sword gracefully, and uise it skill- fully." "You can at least tell me where you was born, sirl" said Mr. Cringle, pursuing his ob- ject. "' You must excuse my curiosity--it is a natural failing of mine ; from my ehildhood up, I have always been a seeker into the his.- tory of everything and its why and wherefore. I have no distinct recolletion of it, but I have . no doubt that, whie I was eta suckling in my' mother's arms, I instituted a philosophical re. search into the nature of'milk; and as I grow older, I get more and more curioust  -   ,     X ,!  ',-  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6983-00000003"/> "I cannot tell where I was born, or even who my father or mother was," replied the young captain. "As my name indicates, I am literlly 'a waif of the sea. Drifted ashore from a wreck upon a little island at the south- west corner of Nantucket Shoal, I was taken from a chest into which I had been laid by the hands of a noble and good old man who had left the world to live a hermit life there. He named me Edward Seawaif-the first name his own; the latter, in remembrance of the manner in which I came to him. Though dead bodies and vast quantities of goods also drifted ashore from the wreck,no living thing but myself reached the land. That good old man, Edward Zane, was more than father or mother to me- he hated a world which had wronged him much; but he loved me all the more that I had seen nothing of it. To him I owe my education, everything, and more than all, the armor of his experience-bought advice, which makes me avoid the wolves and perils which wronged and wrecked him!" "You had no history, you said, sir? No history, indeed 1" cried Mr. Cringle, "Why, sir, already you are a hero of romance. I must find out who your father and mother were, et-cete-ra, etcct e-ra! Was there nothing beside you in the chest: when the good old man found you?" "Yes, sir-a Bible, a quantity of clothing and jewels-some of it evidently belonging to a lady of rank and fashion; for it was rich and costly. The rest was just such clothing as an infant like I would need-for I was'pro- bably not over ten or twelve months old." "Any name in the Bible, on the jewelry or clothing, et-cet-e-ra?' "No, sir, none-except a crest and coat-of- arms that were on a seal ring, and also engraved on various articles of jewelry which I still possess; for when the good old hermit died, she begged me through all vicisitudes, to keep, them-in hopes that eventually they might lead to the discovery of my family." "Yes, he was right.-very right. What was this crest and coat-of-arms?" asked the mer- chant, taking out a pencil and note-book. "Two arms and. hands grasping crossed swords overa coronet, formed the crest-a shield with diamonds andfleur de lis formed the coat- of-arms." "UXmph-noble blood: the fleir de is 'is French, or was once!" said the old merchant, writing in his memorandum-book. "I've got *something to do-I'll find out who, your pa- rents were or are (for they may yet be living), if Phave to hunt over the heraldry of all the world. But, come up stairs, captain, we'l take a glass of punch of daughter Kate's brew- ing; and then we'll go aboard of the ' Tyran. nicide,' and see how matters go there. Isup- pose you'll go to seawith the ebb in the morn- ing-the tide turns at eight, to a minute!" "Yes, sir," said Seawaif, following the mer- chant to the dwelling part ot his house, which   was in the upper part of his store and ware- house-a thing very common in those days. CHAPTER II. "Isn't she a beauty? Taut and neat aloft, trim and saucy below, et-cet-e-ra!" said Mr. Cringle, as he and the young captain stood upon the wharf, and looked at a craft which lay at anchor in the little harbor. She was, for that era, astonishingly clipper- ish, raking in spars, sharp in hull, and calcu- lated to carry an astonishing quantity of can- vas. Her rig was that of a two-topsail schooner -her lower masts being very long and heavv, so as to carry lare fore-and-aft sails on "a wind, and square-sail, top-sail, top-gallant and royal yards above, to set the' square canvas when the helm was put up, and she eased off with flowing sheets before it. Her tonnage appeared, from a glance at her size, to be about three hundred tons. She was pierced for eight twenty-four pound carronades on a side; and a long brass thirty-two'pounder, working on a pivot, shone bright as gold between her masts, mounted high enough to work above her ham. mock nettings, Around her masts could be seen the gleam of boarding-pikes and battle- axes. At her main-mast head a blood-red flag floated out, bearing the motto: 4' Death to Tyrants and their Tools!" At the fore-truck, another red flag bore the name of the schooner " lIE TYRANNICIDE." Her figure-head was a serpent striking its fangs into the heart of a man who wore a crown. Taking her altogether, she was indeed a saucy and dangerous-looking craft, calculated to both sail and fight well. Upon her deck many men could be seen, show- ing that, if she had "teeth," she had also strength to use them., The young captain did not reply to the proud owner's remarks, but, with an equally exulting eye, looked at the handsome vessel, while a boat which he had signaled rapidly approached the shore. It was surf-built, pulled by eight sturdy young men, and an officer, also young, but a bold and handsome boy, steered her. In a few momnnts, she was at the pier. The young off- cer touched his hat, and said: "If   ou please, Captain Seawaif, you had better hasten aboard. " Why, Mr. Morley, what is the matter there?" asked the captain, as he and Mr. Cringle sprung into the boat, which was immediately pushed off, and started toward the schooner.  "The surgeon, sir, Dr. La Motto, has had a quarrel with Mr. Doolittle, the first officer, sir, and has challenged him to a duel. I believe they were getting arms to settle the matter when I left, sir." "Ah  quarreling already? I'll give them a- chance to fight our country's foes, not her friends, soon 1" said Cantain Seawaif. "Give-   way with a will, men," he added, to those at the oars; "put me along side in a hurry-I hear the clash of steel 1" "Can you inform me, my young friend, what they quarreled about, et-cet-e-ra?" asked Mr. Cringle, coolly, of Mr. Morley. Something about frogs, I believe, sir. I -was not, however, present when the quarrel commenced," replied the young officer. . The worthy merchant had not time for fur- ther questioning, for the boat had reached the schooner's gangway.  The captain scarcely touched the man-ropes which were extended by the side-boys, but leaped over the side, with a frown on his pale brow, and an angry light in his dark eye. And he came just in time; for one of the combatants, his first officer, was tremendously hard pressed by his opponent, who, using a long, slim rapier of matchless steel with con- summate skill, was far superior to the other, who had the short, curved cutlass, much used by seamen at that day. While the amazed, yet amused crew of the vessel looked on, the Frenchman had made lunge after lunge at the officer, making remarks at each lunge, which brought shouts of laughter from the men. "Al, ha I Monsieur Do-leetle; I make' you do somesing now, eh?" he would cry, as he made a lunge, which the officer, standing solely on the defensive, barely succeeded in parrying. "' How you like ze frog-stickare, in ze hands of ze frog-eatare, eh?" he would add, as his keen blade, doubling over the stiff one of his ad- versary, narrowly escaped a sheath in the bo- som of the latter. "Hold here, HOLD I cried Seawaif, sternly, as he stepped between the combatants, who instantly lowered the pointsiof their weapons. "What means this breach of discipline in offi- cers, and upon my quarterdeck, which should and shall be as inviolate as a church to all who belong upon it!" The attitude and look of the combatants at this instantwas worthy the notice of any ar- tist. The Frenchman, who was very lean and tall, had cast off, not only his cap, but his wig, leaving his perfectly bald head exposed. He was in his shirt-sleeves, also, and wore the tightest kind of black breeches and .stockings, 'miking his very active, but diminutive legs look even smaller than they were. His mous- tache, which was thick and heavy, was twisted ferociously over toward each' ear, which it nearly touched. Mr. Doolittle was equally long and lank; but le wore a seaman's loose trowsers, which, thingh they fitted at the waist in spider-like tightness, spread out Ttrkishy below, and there concealed the slender shanks of bone and skin. His loose shirt, bulging out above his slim waist, gave an idea that there was an expansion of chest and body there; but in vain had the rapier of Doctor La Motte, in several passages through the garment, sought for more solid material than cotton shirting. His face   was smooth, and his long, straight hair seemed to have been plastered to his cheeks with talb low; or some other such substance, of its own dirty-white color. "What means this quarrel  Speak, gen. tlemen, I will permit no trifling here 1" ' I guess it wouldn't have been a tifle, if the doctor had run his tarnal toad-sticker through my gizzard!" said Mr. Doolittle. "But, cap'n, I reckon I was in the wrong! The doctor ordered somne fried frogs on the table, and I said I'd rather eat stewed kittens. 'He twitted me about eating pork and molasses, and I talked back rather saucy; and he wanted to fight, and I accommodated him. That'sall sir-I'm the one to blame!" "No, Monsieur Dooleetle, 'souse me if you shall please-you are tout genereuse. 'I, sare, am ze shentilhomme zat is to blame. Monsieur le Capitaine, I shall make one grande apology to your quartere-deek-tres grade to Monsieur Dooleetle, and more zan zat toyou, sare! I vil make once more frents wiz Monsieur Doo- leetle; and if at anytime he have a shot in ze leg, or ze arm, I vill take zem off as easy as pull a toot!" "Thank ye; I hope you'll not have any chance for such operations," said the officer; "but here's my hand, and if the cap'n will only excuse us this time, we'll drown malice in a noggin of old New England, and be as fast friends as ever." "Eh! bien--zat is one grande idea, Mon- sieur Dooleetle. I nevare shall observe if you eat pork wiz molasses any more," said La Motto, grasping the extended hand. "And you may eat frogs till you croak, doc- tor, before I find fault with you again," said the naturally good-hearted mate. The captain smiled, and went down into the cabin with Mr. Cringle; whither, after the doc- tor had recovered hIs wig, cap, and coat, they were followed-by him and Mr. Doolittle. "Gentlemen, this has been the first difficulty on board; let it be the last, and it shall be ex- cused," said the young commander, as he poured out a glass of wine. "Misconduct in an officer will ever be more severely punished ,by me than in a man before the mast ; for from the former I expect and shall exact exemplary conduct, which the men .can respect and fol- low. Save your strength and'your steel for America's foes-I will soon place you where you'll have work enough to do with them." "iEh-bien, I sall be excessively delight yen zat day shall arrive. My instruments are all ready for ze amputat, ze ball-extract, ze every- sing," cried the doctor, rolling up his sleeves-- as if a subject for oeration lay before him, in. stead of a glass of wine.  ",The sooner we're away, and at work a makin' somethin', the better I'll be pleased," said Mr. Doolittle. "They dosay there's a powerful sight o' transports and the like a crossin' over, and their cargoes must be worth a mint o' money to our government folks just  i . . . ....: .M   ..  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6983-00000004"/> now, when powder, and lead, and shootin'-tools are so scarce 1" "We will sail as soon as ebb-tide makes in the morning, sir," said the captain. "You had better take another pull at the lower rig- ging, the laniards may have stretched some. Also, set up the stays once more; our spars are heavy, and will strain them in a sea-way. See that everything is-ready for sea, below and aloft." "Ay, ay, sir-this is the beet news that I've heard in a coon's age I And the men are just as imlpatient as I am." "- It is well; I look to you to see that all thngs are ready-nothing forgotten. I shall now go on shore with Mr. Cringle to receive his last orders. Send a boat for me to the pier at ten to-night, precisely." "Ay, ay, sir!" replied the officer. "Can I do anything for you on shore, doc- tor " inquired the captain. "Nossing, sare-nossing, I sank you. Ah I pardon me-zere is one sing I 'ave forgot. I vish, sare, if you please, two or tree pound of snuff, ze Mackaboy, for tickle my nose. I 'ave forgot him." Promising not to forget that most neces- sary dirt-powder for the excitable doctor, the captain entered the boat, which had been ordered to be ready, and with Mr. Cringle was rowed- to the pier, from which they both re- turned to the store. CHAPTER III. It was early morning. The red sun had just come up out of the Atlantic, and now nrightced the slightly-rippled waters of Sa- lem harbor. The sails of the "Tyrannicide" had been loosed, her cable hove short, and she only waited for the change-of tide to have her sails sheeted home, her anchor hove up to the bows, and her cruise would be commenced. All of her boats had been hoisted but that which the captain used as his gig, and her offi- cers, excepting him only, were watching the tide very impatiently for its change. He had been summoned to the shore by a signal from the flag-staff over Mr. Cringle's store, very soon after daylight, much to his surprise-for he had, as lie supposed, received his final di- rections when he parted with Mr. Cringle the night before. When lie reached the store, the merchant met hinl, and said: "Go up stairs to Kate, my dear captain, she has got some errand for you. I tried to find out, but she would only tell you; and so I had to send for you-for women will have their way, or theres trouble brew- ing, et-^ce-ra, et-cet-c-ra!" The captain, who was in a hurry to return to his vessel, hastened up stairs into the parlor, where Miss Kate Cringle waited for him. She was not what might strictly be termed a vEry handsome girl, but yet was pretty. She   had a fine, plump, well-shaped figure; her hair was a glossy brown, almost black; her eyes of a bright hazel-' at times laughing and full of light, then liquid with deep and true womanly feeling; her features very good; and her complexion as clear red and white as a pink in full bloom. There was no lack of strong, bold intellect in her expression; but she was modest almost to a fault-if modesty could be faulty; for her blushes came and went like the flushes of the -Aurora Borealis across a pale northern sky. "Your good father said that you wished to see me, lady," said Seawaif, as he stood before her, actually blushing as much as she did-for a brave man-is often timid before a lady; only fops, fools, and cowards are apt to be - brave" in woman's presence, where danger only exists in her love-darting eyes. Such as they are protected by shields of brass, while true men go there with open hearts and naked bre ats. "Yes, sir," said Kate, while her eyes were downcast, not with shame, but modesty. "You are about to leave us on an expedition where death will be hovering above, below, and all around you, and I could not sleep all the night for thinking of it; and so I spent my wakeful hours in making for you a little token which might remind you, when far away, that there was one here who would pray for your safety, watch for your safe return, and tremble at every storm-eloud that appears." Thus saying, she produced a small, white, silken banner, upon which was worked, in rich gold embroidery, the identical coat-of-arms which he had described to her father on the day before. "Forgive me," she said, as she sain with what surprise he looked upon the work. "I did not mean to play the spy; but accidentally, yesterday, I overheard the sad story which you told to my father-for I was in his counting- room, copying some invoices for him, as I fre. quently do. And it remained in such full possession of my mind, that I could -not rest; and so I  made this little banner, not as a flag to use in battle, but as a token of re-. membrance from one who feels a deep interest in your success and happiness."  She ceased to speak, and timidly raised her eyes to his, as she handed him the pretty flag. "I thank you, lady," said Seawaif, while his voice trembled with emotion. "I am grateful for your kindness, which I shall not forget." And he took the little flag, and placed it in his bosom, next to his heart; and, after press- ing her small, white hand to his lips, said: "Excuse me that I do not tarry-my sails are loose, the anchor almost apeak, and the tide will serve by the time I can get back to my vessel. Heaven bless you, and adieu!" He was gone. And the pretty maiden stood and looked at the hand on which he had printed his last burning kiss-a salute, it is true, of respect only-ooked at it as if the kiss had left a visible impression, a sign which   the could look upon for all time when she thought of him. And a still, soft sigh came up from her heart, seeming to linger on her red, sweet lips, as if loth to part with them. She stood thus dreamily, until she heard the sound of men cheering and then she went to the window, which fronted toward the harbor, and saw that the ," Tyrannicide" wa under way. CHAPT1ER IV. When' Seawaif left the presence of fair Kate Cringle, he met. ler father, who accompanied him down to his boat, in vain trying to find out what Kate had wanted him for, *' et-cet-e- ra"--but it was no use-he was ".a stupid pump," and could not raise anything from such deep water. The young captain sprung into his boat amid the murmured good wishes of hundreds of citizens who had gathered there to see the privateer go to sea, and in a few moments lie was on board of his vessel. With a clear, bugle-like voice, which needed no trumpet, the young commander shouted: Man the capstan bars, lads, and run the anchor up with a will. Stand by the jib and flying-jib halliards-lay the headyards aback!" Iis orders were obeyed readily; and in a a few moments, the second officer, who stood on the forecastle looking over the bows, cried: "She's broken ground, sir!" "Very well, sir--run up the jib and flying- jib, and haul the sheets to starboard-man the top-gallant and top-sail sheets and hal- liards I Round with the capstan, men, and run the anchor up to the bows!" 'A moment later, and the head-sails up, the veering bow of the schooner proved her to be all away, and then came the order: "Sheet home, and hoist away top-sail and top-gallant sails 1"  This washone and as the fore-and-aft sails, already up,tilled, the schooner began to gather headway. Then, as she fell off before the wind, which was fair out Qf the harbor, her square sails filled, and she shot ahead with in- creased velocity. The crowd on shore looking with delight upon- the splendid vessel, and gladdened l, too; at the thought of her errand, rent the air with cheers; while Mr. Cringle, taking upon himself the part of gunner, fired an impromptu salute from a single gun, which was kept upon the wharf to be used as a warn- ing-signal fI the British approached to bur the town-as had by them been more than once threatened. The "Tyrannicide" replied to this by a salute of seventeen guns-her whole compliment- which, having harbor-loads, without shot, were thus sealed by Seawaif, preparatory to the re- ception of service charges. "That's awhat I call a darned waste o' powder " said a pinch-faced, dried-up ana- tomy of a man, whose thread-bare clothes, lit-   tie eyes, and long, greedy talons of fingers, spoke the miser out and out. ' It isn't your powder, Moses' Gelson," said Mr. Cringle, rather sharply. "If it was, it wouldn't be likely to be in a vessel destined to fight for liberty!"  "Tnsh--tush  What is this- 'liberty' to us?-the war is ; ining trade, and soon we'll all be as poor as rats!" said the miser, pet- tishy. "It is a pity that sueh mean curses as you weren't poor; you're too stingy to live I Not satisfied with begrudging the really poor the very crusts they eat, you must growl at whatr a man who is well off chooses to do for 'his country. If you only had your due, you'd get a good dueking in a horse-pond!" cried Mr. Cringle, so angrily and so loudly, that his words were heard by the crowd, and probably found echo in their hearts; for they instantly shouted: * "Let't duck the. old miser --to the goose- pond with the old tory-!" And seizing the terrified wretch, they drag- ged him roughly toward a pond of muddy water near the residence of the merchant, and soon would have put their intention into ex- ecution, had not Kate Cringle, who saw their actions, stepped out upon the balcony, and cried out, mi a clear, musical voice, which reached every ear: "Shame men-shame! to treat an ol mans so. He is weak and helpless; let him go, and save your strength for i nobler purpose!" Her timely appeal and her beauty-for in her excitement she really looked. handsome-- had the desired effect; and the old miser was released, much to his ow*n gratification, and rather to the disgust and anger of her father, who would have been really glad to have seen old Gelson gt a lesson-4or he hated him heartily, not only for his lack of patriotismn but his miserly meanness, which wa s- opro- verbial in the place, that any nmn who did a dirty or stingy action was called one of "Gel" son's babes".-though the old man had never wedded.- "I'll remember her --I'll remember that girl, bless her!" muttered the old miser, as he hobbled away from the crowd as fast as he could-not stopping until he reached his own residence, whilc was also a kind of a store- house, in which a vast variety of all kinds of truck and trash were stowed-old junk, second- hand anchors, sails', cordage, fishing tackle, nets, harpoons, and a thousand other things. A large and fierce-looking dog was chained ,near the door as a sentinel; and lying asleep on a bale of rags was a one-legged, one-eyed negro, whom the miser roused with a kick, as he entered . "What are you sleeping at this time o' day for, Jim, you lazy imp " :growled the old man.  "'Cause eitn sleepy, Massa Gelson-gueas you'd be sleepy, if you had as much runnin' of errands and workin' as you make mc do i'  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6983-00000005"/> "Tush H-You've only one eye to sleep with, and only need half as much as folks with two eyes!" ," Don't I? Den you see i've only got one leg, and oughtn't to do but half as much goin' about as folks that's got two legs l'! said the darkey, opening his mouth from ear to ear, and showing two reefs of ivory, as he laughed at his own wit. "Tush-one of your legs is a wooden one, and can't get tired!" said the miser. "Take these three pence, here, and go to the market, and buy meat for us and the dog!" he added, with a sigh, and a sad look at the departing three pence. "For the dog and us-for he gets the most of it," said the negro, in a low tone, as he took the money, and stumped away upon his errand. "It costs a dreadful sight to live!" sighed the miser, as soon as he was alone. "Three pence a day for meat, and two pence for bread!" And he sighed as if his heart was breaking. CHAPTER V. Never was a craft in better trim on deck, below, or aloft, than the Privateer, after Sea- waif had got her rigging stretched, her new sails fairly filled, and her crew properly sta- tioned, and he had been a few days at sea. Until this was done, he had dodged up along the coast of Maine, among the islands, through many an intricate channel-with which, how. ever, he was perfectly acquainted. But now, conscious that he was ready to meet any foe of his tonnage and weight ol metal, he boldly headed off from the coast for the inward-bound vessels from England. One morning soon after, he was at breakfast in his cabin, with the first officer and the doe- tor-young Morley being in charge on deck. The doctor was glorying in a cup of strong coffee prepared by himself, and a piece of halibut fritsseed according to his directions; the first officer was enjoying some cold pork and beaus; and the captain was looking at a chart which lay near, while he sipped his cof- fee now and then. But each of them bounded from the table as they heard the shout "sail ho t" from the look- out, at the top-gallant cross-trees. "Where away, and what does she look like?" cried young Morley, in reply. Seawaifand his companions held their breath, and listened for the answer. "I see three sail, sir, dead ahead; they seem square-rigged, and coming down right before i the windP was the reply. . "Englishmen, and mnrning for the coast, I'll wager my first prize-money P1 said the captain, as he hurried on deck.    "John-Bull-Men's, be gar-I shall get my instruments ready for amputat!" cried the de- lighted Frenchman. "So will I!" said Mr,. oolittle, as he bucklcd on his sharp, but short cutlass, and followed his commander on deck.  The breeze was fresh, and the schooner, with only her lower sails and top-sails set, was going off to the eastward on a taut bow-line, her top-gallant and royal yards pointed to the whind, and her larboard tacks aboard. There was quite a heavy sewa rolling; and as she pitched into and through it, she threw the snowy foam over her prow almost as high as her fore-top. "See all clear for action, fore and aft-reeve preventer stays and braces--have the spare spars cleared away! Gunners, look to your children; they may have play soon. Boarders and pikemen, see that your tools are in their places!" cried the captain cheerfully, as he cane on deck; and then he seized a spy-glass, and went aloft to a perch on the fore-top-gal- lant yard, where, seated, he scanned the vessels in sight. "What do you make out, sir, if you please?" asked Mr. Doolittle, whose hopes for work and prize-money were now on the rise. "I see six vessels; but they are yet too far off to make out whether they are armed or not!" was the reply. "Shall the gunner open the magazine, sir?" "Yes, after all the galley-fires are put out!" The men went to their work, and their re- spective stations quietly, but with a cheerful look, which betokened a perfect confidence mn their vessel, and especially in their officers. They were two hundred in all,'and nearly all of them Americans, reared in that noblest of all our national naval schools, the coast fishing business, which tries the hardiest, and proves the best of men. An hour passed, and the vessels were now hull- up ahead, yet Captain Seawaif gave no orders either to alter the course or shortjn sail. "What about our colors, sir?' asked the lieutenant.               I "You can runs'em  up in rolls* to their places, ready to pull out when I order it, Mr. Doolittle," said the captain, still keeping his glass directed toward the approaching ships. "Messieur le capitaine, if you please, are zem sheeps John-Bull-Men's?" asked the doc- tor, now, in shrill, falsetto voice. "Yes, doctor, five merchant-men or trans- ports, conveyed by one sloop-of-war. There will be work for you by-and-by," said the cap- tain, closing up his glass, and descending to the deck.  * It is a common thing to roll Up the flag, signals, penants, etc., on board of a man-of-war, and hoist them to the truck with a slipping-loop, so that a slight twitch will loosen them when desired, and4 unfurl them to the breese.   "Ben Dieu! I am so much delight- I sal 'ave ze pleasure to amputat a great many of zem I hope!" cried the doctor, almost dane- ing withjoy.  :  The enemy were now risingfast, not more than four or five miles off; but the merchant- men, obeying signals from the sloop-of-war, which had evidently discovered the nationality and character of the schooner, by her rig, hauled on a wind and shortened sail, while the man-of-war held her coturse under a cloud of canvas. "Take your stations for working shi!" cried Seawaif, taking charge again, and sending Mr. Morley to his post, on the forecastle. The men bounded to the sheets and braces. "Hard up the helm--eas off the sheets, and round in the weather-braces!" cried the cap- tain. "Tarnal thunder! you're not 'goin' to run from one sloop-o'-war, are you, sir?" asked the lieutenant, in agonized wonder. '"Get out and rig two spars, with iron enough on them to sink them, for drags; drop one over each quarter, and ask no impertinent questions, Mr. Doolittle," said the captain, quietly.  "I beg your pardon, sir, a hundred times- I thought you was a goin' to run!" said the now delighted officer, as he hastened to obey the order. "Double-shot tith grape and canister-gun- ners to your stations!" cried the captain, now. "Steward," he added, to his own servant, "go into the cabin, and get some of that old brandy of mine, and serve out a glass to every man that wishes it. Men, make no noise when Il announce it, but within an hour that sloop-of- war shall strike her flag, or we'll go down with ours flying! When she is taken, the merchant- men will be easy prizes." Had they not been cautioned, the men would have cheered so loudly as to have been heard on board of the sloop-of-war; but they obey- ed the order, and remained silent. After the drags were rigged and lowered over the side, held by stout hawsers, and not seen because sunk -beneath the water, the schooner did not go more than three knots, al- thQugh-under a full spread of canvas-she seemed to be running away from her antagon- ist, which now could be seen coming up hand over hand, her decks crowded with men, and her ports showing a battery of twenty-four guns.   .  On she came, the red cross of St. George flaunting from her peak, until she was within nearly a mile of the schooner, when she fired ^a shot from one of her bow guns. "Show them our /colors and name!" cried the young captain, while his pale face flushed with a smile of terrible joy.  It was done in an instant; but the vessel's head was not changed, nor a sail touched. Rapidly the Englishman closed up, heading   a little to leeward, so as to range under her larboard beam. "Crouch well behind the bulwarks, men; stand by youir larboard gusil, but do not touch a match until the order comes from my'lips;' depress your guns, so as to take her between wind and water! Sail-trimmers, stand to your sheets and'braces, and be ready for orders." These orders given, Captain Seawaif took his position on the larboard side of the quar- ter-deck, and with ill-concealed delight saw the Eiglishman range along until he was al; most abeam.  "Haul down your colors, or 'lll sink you I Strike, you Yankee rebel, strike!" shouted the English captain, who stood on the poop of his vessel in full uniform, steadying himself by holding on to the mizzen rigging. "I'm just going to strike-not miiy colors, but you!" cried Seawaif, sarcastically, and in- stantly giving the order to pour in his whole broadside. It was done with terrible effect, for the Brit- ish had ncit anticipated resistance from a rebel whom .they supposed to be using his best efforts to escape, and were huddled along the deck on the side next the schooner, and were cut down in fearful swaths. And as the sails were little injured, the sloop-of-war shot- ahead, so that she was past the schooner before she could return the broadside. "Cut. away the drags, spring to your star- board battery-throw in chain-shot as well as grape-and cut her sticks away!" eried Sea- waif. Then ordering the helm up, as the schooner's headway increasedl; he veered off athwart the stern of the sloop; and as the guns camne in range, delivered a raking 'fire, which' not' only swept her decks, but cutting away her masts, crippled her completely. He then hauled:on a wind, determined to pepper her until she should strike," and not" wishing to'lose any men at close quarters, if. he could help it. But he had no occasion to use his guns any more; for, suddenly, with a shock, which shook the sea and the air like an earthquake, the ill-fated craft was seen to fly in fragments, amid a cloud of smoke, into the air.    .           , /Whether by accident or design, no one could tell, but, in some way, the powder in 'her ma- gazine had been ignited, and she was blown to atoms. Prompted'by humanity, Captain Seawaif in- stantly ordered the helm up, ahnd steered for the spot where the sloop-of-wai had been, in hopes to save somes surviving prsops of her crew.     , '  '     "', But not a living soul could be seen. A few blackened spars and timbers only met the eye.. "Moni Dieut Mon Dieu I ziis is too- bad! Not one man to amputate-4not:one ball for ex- tract!" said the doctor, with a sOigh and a piteous grimace, as he looked in the water.  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6983-00000006"/> "You may have better luck another time, doctor," said Seawaif, as he gave orders to trim sails and haul on a wind again; for the transports--haeng seen the fate of their pro- tectoir--were now. crowding sail, and trying, like a flock of frightened sheep, to make their escape from an opponent which had done such. fearful damage in so short a time. But the schooner had no lumbering cargo, and was ready for combat or a race, as occasion re. quired. CHAPTER VI. Tt was two weeks to a day from the time when the "Tyrannicide " had weighed her anchor. Tihe hour was about noon, and most of the etcady-habited citizens-of Salem were at din- ner, when- the heavy boom. of the alarmrgun was heard fpom. the wharf, starting every one to their feet. Confusion instantly took the place of order. lMen, women, and children rushed, into Uie streets, some pale with. fright-all startled and excited. The principal men of the place hurried down to the pier where the -gun was, to ask of the look-out, who occupied a small watch-tower there, what was the cause of alarm. Among the first to, roacohthe spot wazsPhineas Cringle, merchant, ct-cet-e-ra; and close, in his wake followed the, old miser, Moses Gelson. And before'they had time to ask many questions touching, the cause of alarm, thiir eyes became their informants. Five large ships were seen. entering the harbor,. and. leading, them, Mr. 'Cringle saw his beautiful sehooner,.the 4"Tyran- nicide:' But he gnashedhis teeth and wept with rage and vexation, as he -saw that every vessel wore the English flag, "It is too bad-Too bad.!" he groaned. '"Ob, if I only had a battery-of big guns here to sink the cursed ships before-they cast an anchor. Wouldn't I do it? Indeed I would!" "You. won't have toQ wate your powder, neighbor, ha, ha I he, he. I ho, ho!"' laughed i old Moses. Gelson, drily          I "' Shut up, you cursed old mummy, or rn  ram you into this gun, and fire your old car-  case at them!" cried the angry. merchant. And. then, a sudden change in the oelors of the vessels mae Aim change in bhis temper, for i he fairly danced and yelledwith delight. From  above every Englilsh flag an American ensign suddenly flatteredt out of its roll, and the bat.-  tcry of. the gallant. schoone opened with a salute which made the old town ring again, and every patriot ear tingled with joy at the sound.                   9 "That's wasting powder, You devilish old j   'miser, isn't it? That schooner is mine, an0d them ships are her prizes, and worth more than you'll be if you live longer than Methusa- lem did, et-cet-er-a!" shouted the overjoyed merchant to old Gelson, who actually groaned'  at the thought. "They're worth a powerful sight of money,"' muttered Gelson; and he groaned' again, as he' thought that none of that money was his. "I. reckon you'd. like to own a share or two in the privateer, even if she does fight for lib- erty, et-cet-e-roa"' continued the merchant,. saircastically. The miser looked more and more troubled, and' groaned again. "The war is rufnous to commerce, eh, old stingy?. Ruiaous to British conimerce; but it will fill my store-house, andf a dozen more that I mean to build!" continued Mr. Ciingle. The schooner now took in sail, rounded to, and'came to anchor. The ships in line fol- lowed her example.. Then, in a' very few' minutes, a boat was lowered away from the quarter-davits of the schooner, and young Seawaif springing into it, was rapidly rowed to: the landingplace. "Are them ships your prizes?" asked Mr. Cringle, at the top of his voice, when the boat, was still a. hundred yards from the pier. "'Yes, sir; andc taken without the loss of a. man on our side, though we've sunk a- sloop- of-war for the enemy!" cried Seawaif,'in reply. "Powder wasted, eh, you old mutton-head' -powder wasted?" cried Mr. Cringle to old' Gelson; and' he danced around like a very' child, for Joy. In a moment, the surcessful and worthily- exalted young captain reached the pier, and. as he sprang upon it, he was elasped in the' arms of' the merchant, whose eyes now over- flowed with the sweet water of joy, instead of' the bitter tears of vexation which he had shed' while the British flag only was flying. And Seawaif was completely surronnded,. literally taken by the citizens, who sought with' Cringle to know all the etceteras of-the action. And they would not let him' go until he had promised that evening- to relate the whole affair at the town hall; after which they resolved to give him, hia officers, and' such of his crew as could'come on shore, such a supper as would' at least show their pride and'good'fmeling over' the first triumph of the Tyrannicide. Then, and then only, did they permit himr maad the proud' and happy merchant to emerge' from their midit, and proceed to the residence- ,of the latter, where the young-captain received' a welcome from the lovely Kate, which con- fised him far more than had"the questions and' presence of the crowd. Kate was her father's housekeeper, as well. as occasional clerk-for he had been awidower- nauy, year.   CHAPTER VII. lThat evening, with the diffidence and yet the 'candor which almost always characterizes a brave man, Edward Seawaif related to the multitude which had assembled at, and liter- ally crammed the town hall, all of the partic-. ulars of his recent action with the sloop-of- war, her fate, and his chase and successive capture of the five transports, which were laien with military stores and munitions of war, which were very much needed 1by Wash- ington and his brave army just at that time. He was frequently interrupted with shouts' of applause; and when, at the close, he congrat- ulated his audience that they had not on this occasion cause to mourn the loss of any of their brave townsmen who were with himn, their cheefs rung loud and long. Warming with his theme, he urged upon all to enlist and act man . fully in freedom's cause. "Success," said lie, "ever waits upon the justly brave!" And he inveighed bitterly'against those who hoped, not only for the success of tyranny over ithe struggles of men who would be free, but who sided with them In actions as well as in words. ," The soldiers of Britain are- hired murderers," said lie, in conclusion,t but the tories of Ame. eia are willing fratricides!"After liis brief nar- rative and patriotic and telling speech was over, Capt. Seawaif and the only two officers who could be spared, even temporarily, from 'duty-- Mr. Doolittle and Doctor La Motto-were es- corted with a large, but select body of guests, led by a band of music to a large empty ware- house, in which the banquet had been spread. Brief as had been their time for preparation, impromptu it might have been justly said, the feast was worthy of the fame of New England, of the motives of the givers, and the merits of those who were to enjoy it. There were huge joints of beef, saddles of fat mutton,. roasted geese, turkeys, and chick- ens. Nor were the "pork and beans," since so famous in Beverly, close by, forgotten--noir yet the pumpkin pies and Johnny cakes, so peculiarly Yankee dishes. Let no one deride themn because they are such; but try them first, and then do it if they can. With .the eatables so abundant, it n5e-a, not be supposed that bibibles were lacking.' There were not only coffee and water, but beer, cider, brandy, wine, and any quantity of famed "i New England rum," redolent of molasses, and fiery with strength. After full justice lind been done to the eat- ables, and the guests began to warm' with the bibiblcs, songs were sung, and many a patriotic speech made, which would have shiocked a ser- vant of King George, had he heard it. Mr. Phineas Cringle- being called upon, de- livered an oration full of fire andi et-cc-e-ras, in which he declared that he was ready at any time to lay down his life and fortune for his beloved country.   The doctor was called upon for a speech, and he delivered one so unique and so very rich, that I cannot refuse it room in my nar- rative. He' was considerably elevated, so much so, that his ey es danced like stars mir- rored insa rippling fake, and his talking tackle ran as merrily as a well-rosined bow over a good violin. "Shentilhommes!" said he, "shentilhomnies, i salute you" several, all, and singulare, each one I Nevare before 'ave I been so happy as now I Not alone because ze Yankee-doodle mens have wheep ze John-Bull mens; not alone because ze aigle of triumph 'ave perch himself upon our bannnre, but, shentilhommes,; because our services 'ave beqn appreeiat by you! When we fight for kings, if we 'ave vie' tory wiz, us, zey say nossing, do nossing--but when we fight for ze people zat will be free, zey reward us!" Loud cheers for a moment interrupted him but in a few moments he was allowed to proceed. "Shentilhommes, I sank you from ze lower part of my heart to ze top of' ze same I To begin again vere I was before. When men die for kings, ze kings nevare cry, nevare sigh, nevare care I No, shentilhommes, zpy care no more for ozzare men's lives zan if zey were snakes, or zat lectle animale vich my frient Messieur Doolittle does not like, ze frog. But yen men die for ze people, ze people put zeir memory in zeir hearts aid zecre preserve 'it-- preserve it-preserve iV like-like"--' The Doctor was in trouble for a comparison. "Like beef in pickle!" said Mr. Doolittle, coming to the rescue. "Tank you, sare--preserve it like one beef in peckle " said' the doctor, amid roars of laughter and shouts of applause. "Shentiliommes, again I sank vou. Zis is not yet a grand countree, but ven'it shall be- gin for to devil-up itself' [he meant develop, undoubtedly], "zen, shentilhommes, it shall be one grand countree as nevare was. "Shentilhommes, La Belle France is one grand distance from here; but ven her people s'all hear how you fight ze John-Bull mens, zeir- sympathy will come to you wiz ze wings of ze wind, and zey will send mcns to help you fight! Oui, es I 'mean, shentilhommes, zey will come to dance wiz you ovare ze grave of tyranny! Mark -you zat. I 'ave done. J' 'drink viz you, I eat viz you;i and if ever any of you shall need amputat, I will do him as 'ay as pull one toot!"        I The doctor's speech, coiming from his heart, if not clothed in the most elegant language or spoken unbrokenly, contained many fine truths and thoughts, and was fully appreciated by 'the listeners, as they attested by their raptur-  ous applause. Lieutenant Doolittle was called upon for a speech, but he bluntly and honestly said, that he had eaten and drank so much that he was "too full for utterance," thus saving his credit --as I have often wished that some of my ad-  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6983-00000007"/> qunaitatces had, when bored by long and s-tpid dinner-table speeches. At a late hour the guests retired from the festal board delighted, alike the entertainers and the entertained. CHAPTER VIII. It took a few days only to arrange matters in regard to the sale of the prizes and their cargoes (for the government wanted both, for Mr. Cringle acted as agent); and, as I said at the conlmencemrent of the story, with all of his eccentricities, he was strictly a businessman. The crew of the "Tyrannicide" were allowed a short run on shore, after the English prisoners had been transferred to the charge of the ar- my then encamped around Boston, and then orders were ioven to be ready for another and a longer cruise; that is, uniless it should be again shortened by such success as they had already met with upon their first trip. Whether it was by request or not, or inten- tional in one, or both, we cannot positively say; but one thing is certain, on the morning of the day set for the sailing of the schooner, Edward Seawaif was in the same parlor where he had blushingly received the silken banner from the hands of Kate, and that lady was also present And though both looked as inno- cent as two spring' lambs in a field of clover, they were blushing like a pair of peonies. And of the why and wherefore of that, we are also ignorant. And if we-knew, we wouldn't tell.; for the secrets of young folks don't be- long to everybody. "I am sorry that you are going away, Cap- tain Seawaif-.that is; I mean that I am sorry you are going again into peril!" said the blush- mig maiden. "The more peril for me, the more profit is there likely to be for your father," said Sea. waif. "My father and myself would care little for profit which was gained with the loss of life or limb by you; for we-that is, he is very much attached to you," said&amp; the maiden, blushing more than ever. "I am grateful, very grateful, for the inter- est and for the confidence which he places in me to give me so important a comnmi'd; and I hope to prove my gratitude more by active deeds thanidle words," replied Seawaif. "But, lady, pleasant though it is to linger here and converse with you who have extended to one who never knew a sister, such sisterly kind- ness, I must not stay. My vessel must be un- der way in a half hour more--a parting word with your father, and then I must go. Fare- well, most kind lady--we may meit again, or we may not; but rest assured that you will never be fvrgotten by my grateful heart."   He went, and she stood alone. He bad pressed her hand, but not this time to his lips, as he had before. "Gratitude'! Asisterlykindness!" she mur- mured, as she stood where he had left her, "If Edward Seawaif thinks that I feel no more than a sisterly kindness, he must be blind- blind, indeed I O God I it is hard to love and find no love in return!" And tears started in her dark, expressive eyes, as she went to the window to look again at him, as he went on board his vessel. "So Captain Ned parted with daughter Kate, and all ready for a start, et-cet-e-ra, et. cet-e-ra?" cried Mr. Cringle, as Seawaif came down stairs. "'Yes, sir-the tide will serve soon," replied the latter. "And you still think of cruising down to- ward the West Indies?" ", Yes, sir; they will not expect our cruis- ers'far away from our own coast, and therefore English men-o'-war will be more scarce, and merchantmen more plenty in that direction. By using disguise, and proper caution, I may cut out valuable prizes from some of their own ports. If that latitude becomes too hot after I've woke them up, I'll run over to the very coast of England--the last place in the world where they'd expect an American cruiser; and, before they know it, take as many prizes as I can man and send home!" "It is a bold idea, but a good one!' said the merchant, after a moment's thought. ( I know I've no need to caution you, so far as the safety of the schooner is concerned, but do take care of yourself! I'd rather lose a dozen vessels than harm should come to you! And, if you should chance to take any prison- era of rank,be sure to find out what their coat- of-arms is I I feel certain that you'll find out, some day, who your parents were, and that you belong to some noble family." "If they are in favor of King George and tyranny, I had rather never find them .!' said the young captain, with spirit. "But, fare. well, Mr. Oringle 1" "Good-bye -good-bye-bye God bless you, and give you luck, et-cet-c-ra!" siid the warm- hearted merchant, wringing the hand of the young seaman warmly. Seawaif started for his boat, which lay at the pier waiting for him; but, from some un- known impulse, he raised his eves to the win- dow, where Kate stood. And, as he did so, he saw that she was weeping. But, before lie could take a second glance, she had shrunk back from his view, and he walked on, won- dering what in the world she could be grieving for. He was too blind, indeed, to be able to read the secrets of her heart. He soon reached the boat, and it, rowed by willing hands, flew swiftly over the water to the side of his vessel. In a few moments, the boat swung at the davits; five minutes later,. the anchor was at its cat-head, and the whte   vanvas was spread to the breeze. And; while the citizens on shore 'uttered many a cheering shout, the beautiful vessel moved from her place of anchorage-and, like a snowy bird reed from bondage, sped away toward her ocean-home. CHAPTER IX. Mr. Cringle, most probably, would have gone with Seawaif so far as the pier, had not loses Gelson, the miser, approached at the moment that the young captain was coming down stairs, and said that he wished to see him upon business. That was a magic word with Phinucas Cringle, let it come from the lips of friend or foe, and he never refused its call. Mr. Gelson did not receive a particular de- scription, when we first introduced him to the reader-more the pity, for he deserved it; Although really not so old as Mr. Cringle, by eight or ten years, he looked much older. /is ftece, or what could be seen out of the dirty, white beard, which he was too stingy to have shaved, was cadaverous, wrinkled, and thin, as if worn with care and starvation. His very thin hair was almost gone - entirely so froin the top of his head, leaving a kind of wretched fringe down about, his gaunt neck. The thread-bare frock-coat, which he wore tightly-buttoned to the throat, leaving 'it doubtful whether he wore a shirt or not-- for none could be seen-was of a snuff-brown color, not calculated to show dirt; very greasy at the wrists, and darned and patched at the elbows with threads and shreds' of many colors. Its skirt descended to his knees. The lower limbs, from the knee downward- shrunken ones they were, indeed-weroe en- cased in a pair of -brown stockings, and the buckles in his shoes were of brass. Upon his head he wore a small kind of skull-cap. His tall, slim figure was bent over so much, that his back looked to be humped. No one, to look at the old wretch, would suppose that he had laid up over fifty thousand pounds sterling,' yet it really was so; and, when he was sure of making cent per cent in return, he would very quickly produce his thousands on " the best of security." He was a safe operator; he would never have skinned a flint for its 'hide and tallow, if he had to spoil his oin jack-knife in doing it-not he. The nose of Mr. Moses Gelson has not yet been poked into, our description, yet it occu- pied so prominent a position that to neglect it would be almost criminal. It was a great nose, an Israelitish nose-a nose narrow it bridge, bulging out', amidships, and bending over into' a bill-hook, the point of which seemed intent on reaching and transfixing his chin, below. It was a. wide-nostrilled, snuff-   inviting nose. But the miser was too mesh to indulge even in that abomination of abomina- tions. "Well, Moses Gelson, what's YouR busi- ness?" asked Mr. Cringle, rather tartly,' after he had shaken hands and said "good-bye " to Captain Seawaif. "My dear Mr. Cringle, I called to pay my dutiful respects, and to--L' '"Don't dear me, Gelson, don't dear me!" said the merchant, sharply, "You always cheat them that you hold most dear on your tongue             ,  "But, Mr. Cringle, hear me. You know I wouldn't cheat you--albeit, making a good bargain isn't cheating-- wouldn't cheat you, Mr. Cringle 1" "Not without you got a good chance, and I'll not tempt you with one! But to your business, et-et-e-ra. Let us have that without any compliments." "You asked me a question, the other day, Mr. Cringle, that I have been revolving in my mind ever since, and now I am ready to answer it"            . A' What was it?" "When your schooner came in with her prizes, you asked me if I wouldn't like to own a few shares in. her, didn't you?" "if I did, it was only iii sarcasm; but now I'll repeat thequestion. Would you?" "Yes!" said the old miser. "Made and provided that she's insured to her full value. I'd like to own all yoI'll sell of her;' for I see that, in the hands of that smart young fellow, she'll make a whole mint of money I' "Most likely shewill!" said the merchant, dryly. "By the way, Gelson, in a matter that will pay, you' have considerable money you can invest, have you not?" "Yes-or no; that is, I am a poor man, but I can get a few thousand pounds, from- friends, to invest 1" "From friends? Mose Gelson, you haven't a friend in the world. Your very dog would feed on your carcase, lean as it is, if you didn't feed it well. And when a man is so mean that even his dog hates him, he must be meaner than dirt!" "You are severe, Mr. Cringle; but I forgive you! Will you sell a few, shares in your schooner? I came on business, and I want to talk business!" said the miser, rather sharply, for him.              ; "Well, I'l talk business," said Mr. Cringle. "-My sohooner cost me about five' thousand pounds, and her fit-out a couple of thousand more!  That is seven thousand pounds-isn't. it P?" i Yes;i and she can be insured for all that," said Gelson, anxiously. ("And you could raise from your only friend, and that's' yourself, full fifty thousand pounds, I believe I' "* Well, well, Mr. Cringle, oome to the point -to the pointl"'  ' '       9  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6983-00000008"/> "My sliare in the prizes she has taken will nearly double fifty thousand pounds, Moses Gelson i" The miser groaned, but his anxiety to invest rose instantly a hundred per cent. "How many shares will you sell me?" he asked. "Not one, you infernal flint-hearted, sponge- headed old scoundrel I Not one to save your twopenny soul from the bottomless pit! You are a tory at heart-a thief where you've cour- age to steal; and if you're ever killed by a bullet, there will be 'a waste of powder!' Leave my store, before I get mad and kick you, et-cel-c-ra, et-cet--ra!' cried the mer- chant, letting out the passion which he had kept in for the last fifteen or twenty minutes. The old miser saw the dangerous mood of the merchant, and left. CHIAPTER X. "By ginger! we're in a hobble, now, cap'n"' cried Mr. Doolittle, to the commander of the Tyranniei e," on the fourth morning after she had sailed on her second trip, as he aroused him from slumber and dreams of-- we'll say not what or who. ' We haven't had this head-wind four days for nothing. I reck- oned all the while there was bad luck a brewin' for us!' "What's the matter? 'What time is it?" asked the captain, as he sprung from  his swi,!!gig COt. "It's broad daylight, sir; and matter enough. 'A dead calmn, with the land on one side of us, and a whole fleet of British men-o'- war on t'other!" "What land is it?" asked the captain, as he hurried on his clothes. "Nantricket, I reckon!" said the lieutenant, looking dreadfully wobegone. In a few moments, the captain was on deck, where the most of the crew and all of the other officers had ayead gathered. The officer of the deck, Mr. Morley, handed him the spy-glass; but he scarcely needed it, for there were a dozen of the enemy's ships ranged along on his eastern sea-board, none of them more than five or, six miles off, and sev- eral almost within cannon-range. They were ine-of-battle ships, frigates, and corvettes, probably composing a fleet sent to Boston or New York. There they lay, rising and filling on the long swell of the ocean, like hungry beasts, lazily waiting for a victim to come athwart theum. They evidently had seen and made out the character of the "( Tyrannicide," for several of them were headed in toward her with all sail set; but, as not 'a breath of wind rippled the water,they made no headway. Dut   a great danger still threatened . If the calm continued, they might get out their boats;. and, by sheer strength of numbers, carry the schooner by boarding. The young captain thought of all this, while he coolly scanned the squadron; but no change in his color, not the slightest agitation of nerve, gave a hint of it. After a thorough scrutiny of the vessels, he turned his glass toward the shore. And his eyes flashed with a strange, glad light, as he looked at the land. "There is the first of earth which I can re- member to have looked upon i" said he, to Mr. Doolittle, pointing to a small island, nearly covered with stunted pines, and all roclk- bound, except one spot of a cable's length of white, sandy beach. "On that little beach I was drifted on shore, a waif of humanity, to live-for Heaven knows what. That island once seemed to me the most lBeautiful spot on earth-it was the home of my childhood!" "It's a dreary-looking place for a child's play-ground," said the lieutenant. "My play was, my study'; and, under, such a good lod man as I had for a teacher, study was a pleasure. My lessons learned, then I used to come out upon the beach, and watch the great blue waves of the Atlantic, as they rolled landward, and think how terrible must have been the storm which wrecked the ship which bore me to that spotr!" "I believe those Englishmen are going to ask us to hoist our colors, sir!" said Mr. 'Mor- ley, pointing to a wreath of white smoke', which issued from the bow-port of the nearest vessel. A moment later, and the dull report of the gun reached their ears, coiming with a sullen uand bull-doggish boom over the still waters. 1"Let them see our bunting ; I'm not so un- courteous as to refuse them that pleasure," said Seawaif, with a smile. In a few minutes, all of the colors of the schooner were hoisted, but the lazy air scarce- ly lifted them out clear of the spars on which t'hey hung "They are signalizing each other-they are concoetinng some devil's work to annoy us, probably," said the eartain, as he glanced again at them through his- glass. "Isn't that a cloud-bank rising far away in Athe East, sir?" asked Mr. Doolittle. "Yes, but it comes up very slowly, If it brings a breeze, they will get the first breath of it, and close up, while we're crippled in the calm!" replied the captain. Again lie raised his glass to his eyes, nnd scrutinized the movements in the hostile squadron. And, as he did so, his eyes flashed and his cheeks flushed, as the men had seen them do once before, when he was about to engage the English sloop-of-war. "Beat to quarters!" he cried. "Get out the boarding nettings and tries them up. Put a   bag of muriket-buliets in each of the earron- sades! Load all the small *.arams! Boarders, axe-men, and pike-men to your stations!" " "Messieur e -Gapitaine, will ze John-Bull mens come in zeir boats?" asked the doctor, taking off his hat, and bowing gracefully. "Yes, doctor; that seems to be their inten. tion. Boats are! being lowered from all of the nearest ships, and large crews are crowding into them." "Sank you, sare-sank you! I am   very much delight! It is possible now zat I shall 'ave ze grand pleasure to amputat somesing ,or somebody "  And the worthy-doctor hurried below, to get huis instruments ready.  We will now, for a moment, go on board of the flag-ship of the, squadron, the "Bristol," Commodore Sir Peter Parker, which vessel bristled with fiftiy guns. CHAPTER XXL The commodore was a veteran of many years' service-his white hair and his bronzed face told that, almost as well as the many de- corations he proudly wore upon his breast, He was well-advanced in years, yet the fire of youth was in his eyes and vigorin his step, as lie , paced to and fro upon his deck at day-dawn, pausing once in a while to look through his glass at the schooner that had just been dis- covered, clote in -with the land, to the -west. "She is evidently a Yankee, armed and fully manned, Sir Peter!" said his senior offi- cer, who had also been examining the schooner through a glass, "She takes our vicinity very quietly. I wonder if she will dare to show -her colors? Give her a gun and seel" The guwas fired, with an effect which the reader already knows. "There goes her bunting to the gaff-Yan- kee of course--and flags with names or mot-, toes up to the fore aind main! It's a pity we hadn't wind enough to blow them out and move us tp in range 1" said the officer. "Bettetr as it is. If she had a breeze, she is so close in with the land, that she'd creep away from us in some unknown channel-bet- ter as it is, for we can take hler with our boats!" "Perhaps, with a very heavy loss of men, Sir Peter."  "Loss or no loss, she must be talkn. She is one of that class which so annoys us on this coast by slipping out of the little :harbors and pouncing upon our transports. More than twenty ships, long since due at New York, are nissm-g, and we've heard of -several that have,   been taken by these cursed privateers--li- censed pirates. She must be taken, sir, MUST." The face of the tommidore, usually very pale and thoughtful, now flushed up with ex- citement. After pacing hurriedly to and fro *-for a few minutes, he again said to the officer : 4' Captain Morris, make signal for a division of armed boats to come alongside, from eaet - vessel in the saquadron, ready for duty!"!" 4"Ay ay, sirP' replied the officer; and call- ing the signal officer, he gave' the' necoesary orders. "If the calm lasts, we'll have the saucy scoundrel in an hour or two!" said the- ol'f commodore, as he saw- the armed boats hurry- ing toward his ship. "He is getting ready for us, sir. There go his boarding nettings up, sir!" said Captain -Wilson.- "So much the better-there is no fun in fighting an antagonist which won't strike back. Have our own boats manned, sir, a car- ronade in the bows of the launch, and plenty - of grape and canister in it- I -"Ay, ay, sir!" "And," continued the commodore,  have my barge lowered and manned-- will leacd the attack myself!" "Sir Peter, do not be offended, but permit me to. beg you not to think of that. In the first place, as your executive officer, it is my right, according to naval usage, to lead any, ex- pedition which is sent from the ship, as much as it is my right in action to fight her under your orders. Next, your life is too, precious to your country to be risked, perhaps lost, ill a trifling affair sueh as this will be!" said Wilson. "A By your remark, a little while ago, I judged that you did not think it would be a trifling affair "' said the commodore, rather se- verely. "I said that many lives might be lost, and I say so still; for meci who fight with their nccks in a halter fight desperately. But from'- no word of mine,-sir, could yon infer that I either disapproved of the attack, or would hesitate to lead it. On the contrary, Sir Peter, Voi sh6uld, by this time, after the many years I have served under and with you, have known that I would not shrink from engaging the en- emy, if I knew I wouldlbe blown froer time to eternity the next moment!" said Morris, \with deep feeling.  Forgive me, captain; I was too hasty. I always am!" said the old cominodore, tender- ing his hand , You shall leadthe expedition; and I will stay here and see how you do it." "A thousand thainks, Sir Peter-a thousand thanks. Now, the schooner shall be ours in less than two hours, or I will yield that which. is most precious to me on earth-the claim, which you have given me upon your orphan ward's hand 1" cried Morris. , "Take the schooner, and you shall carry  &#xD;<pb n="16-17 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6983-00000009"/> her a prize into Bermuda, and see my fair ward, and to do what you can to place your- self as high in her good graces as you are in mine," said the commodore, with a pleasant smile. "She shall be taken, or I'll soon fill a sail- or's winding-sheet!" said Morris, as he huri ried into the cabin to arm himself By the time'this was done, and he had re turned to the quarterldeck, the boats were ready, and the crews impatient fo; their work. Wihy it is that men about to engage in dead- ly coltlict arc always eager to be led on,even thiougli tliy know that many of them will go to the cold embrace of death, it is hard to tell --but that it is, we know I ;Perhaps, like a trapped bachelor, who has dreaded matrimony all Ins life, because they are engaged, they are in a hurry to have it all over, as he is with the wedding ceremony. The leader of the expedition was received wih a cheer, as he passed over the side of his ship and into his boat; and then the boats were ranged off into three divisions and col- iumns, and rowed away steadily toward the schooner. CHAPTER XII Every movement of the boats and men of the British fleet had been closely watched by Edward Seawaif, and not without anxiety, for he saw that he would be attacked by at least three or four times his number. Ana his ves- sel was utterly helpless without a breeze, and boats approachin to board him, from over ither the bow or stern, would be unharmed by his carronades. But in his countenance no (ne could see the least trace of anxiety-the least sign of distrust, as to the result of the coming action, "Iadn't I better brail up the fore-sail, and lower the main-sail out of the way, sir?" asked the first officer, as lie saw the boats in column loving out from the side of the British flag- "Yes, it will be as well; but keep the rest of the canvas as it is, and a man at the helm fall the tilne; for, if I'm not mistaken, the wi'il out of the clouds in the east there, will re aeli us before the boats do. If it does, we S::. alte; for there are channels in beyond t!ts, ihlands well known to me, where it would be dlcst ruction for them to try to follow me." The boats were now seen to form for attack,  nn I to pull steadily on toward the schooner. "**Stewar, serve out a glass of grog to every IOln," said Seawaif, only acting in accordance with the custom of that era; in fact, omitting to do what the English generally did, to put gunpotwder in the liquor. "Men," he added,   "you must stand firm and work shar! It will never do to be taken; for, at the best, a prison-ship, with all its terrible horrors, is be- fore'us. We shall surely beat them off, if you but do your duty-your. motto ,flies above your heads, and it, like our flag, shall wave till we-ink i" 4 Ah, ha! Messieur le Capitaine!" said the ' delighted doctor, coming on deck without his coat, his shirt-sleeves rolled-up, a white apron on, a Turkish cap on his head, and an ampu- tating knife in his hand, looking more like a cook than a surgeon. Ah, ha I Messieur le Capitaine, I sink now zat ze John-Bull mens will give me some work, eh? I am all ready for ze amputat, ze ball-extract, or ze fight, ven I 'ave nossing else for to do." 't Ready for a glassof brandy, too, doctor?" "ertainement, mon cher Capitaine-eer- tainement, I am always readyifor zat." And he accepted the captain's signal to go in the cabin and take aglass of brandy with him, for the boats were yet a couple of miles distant, and there was no pressing necessity for his re- pairing immediately to his station. When the captain again came out. of the ca- bin, le addressed the gunner, who stood at the long amidship pivot-piece, and said: "You may as' well try and weaken their number, Mr. Brownell; I think you can get your piece to bear over the larboard quarter, so as to at least bother them some." The old gunner, a man who had seen more experience mn that line than any other one on board of the vessel, very carefully trained his gun, whioh was the only one in the schooner's then position which could be brought to bear upon the line, or rather the lins of boats. Having elevated it to suit his ideas, he applied the match, and its double-shotted charge sped away on its errand of death. "A little too high; but you've made them scatter and separate," said the captain, who had been watching the shot with his glass. "You'll have to pick them out singly now; they're spreading so as to take us bow and stern." , The mortified gunper, who seldom missed his aim, caused his piece to be reloaded carefully, and again sighting it with precision, fired an- other shot. "That is better; though not lnite the thing yet," said the aptain, approvingly. "You took all the oars from one side of one of the boats clean, and made the rowers turn sotner- sets over the thwarts like dancing monkeys I I'll rake men instead of oars next time!" said the gunner, as he took a fresh quid in his cheek, while the gun's crew reloaded the piece. And true to his word, with the next shot he hove the heavy ball fairly into or through one of the largest boats, sinking it, and evidently killing or crippling many ot the crew; though the survivors were picked up by another boat. "Hurrah I that's the way to do it; give 'em ginger!" cried Mr. Dooittle.  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6983-00000010"/> "Ah, mon Die! if I was only zere to am- ptat!" sighed La Motte. "You'll have chances enough here before long, I fear 1' said the captain, in a low tone. "Ali, mon Dieu! no such good fortune, I fear, captaine! Before ze boat come, ze wind or somesing will occur which shall deprive me of ze pleasure!" And even as if the worthy and zealous doc- tor were a prophet, a slight breeze began to rip- ple the water, and to lift the flags and fill the sails of the English fleet, And just as the gunner had sunk a second boat, and the whole advancing line was yet a mile away, enough of the breeze reached the schooner to barely give her steerage-way, so that she could lay her broadside to the advancing boats. "No fear now, my lads. I wish every boat i from their fleet were on their way to attack us. Stand by the carronades, and they shall have enough of fun to last them one while 1" cried Seawaif. Then the crew of the privateer replied with hearty cheers; and, as their gallant craft be- gan to move, and the main and foresails were once more set, they felt invincible, even though 1 the heavy ships of the enemy were beginning to close ullp. In a few moments, another of the enemy's boats was disabled; and, as they were now almost in carronade range, the men at the bat- t teries began to sight their pieces. But sud- denly signals of' recall were made from the flag-ship, which, with the other vess61e- now showed signs of having received a fresh breeze, and yery rapidly began to lessen the distance 9 between them and the schooner. Coolly ordering the gunner to put a single round shot over a full charge of powder in his long gun, Captain Seawaif bade him keep its range on the leading ship ; and then, ordering the helm up, and every sail set that would draw, headed his vessel directly for the point of the small island, which he had spoken of as the lady-ground of his youth to Mr. Doolittle. Slowly the schooner moved on; but very rapidly the leading English ship gained upon him. She wal delayed a few minutes in picking ulp her boats, but in less than a half-hour she was so near, that sle,threw a shot close under the stern of the schooner, from one of her bow-chasers. "That is a compliment which must be re- turned. Send him our card, Mr. Brownell!" cried the captain, with a quiet smile, to the old gunner. "I think your messenger is the ; longest winded 1" 'the old gunner smiled grimly, carefully elevated his piece for a long shot, watched the roll of the sea for at least three or four min- utes, and finally applied the match. "Jupiter and f lars, but you did that well! The splinters flew from his bow-port, and I shouldn't-be surprised if you had dismounted a gun for him,"-said the captain, as he looked through his glass. "Try again, Mr. Brownell I              --   -try again, and see if you can't trouble his spars-his three masts range in one, now!" With the same care that he used before, the gunner again prepared his piece and fired. At the same moment that he did so, another wreath of smoke came from the enemy's ship, and the ball ricocAetting .from the water close astern, took off the head of the man at the helm as neatly almost as if it had been done by a headsman's axe, and then pitching through both the main and foresails, dropped into the sea over the bows. with a sullen plunge, as much as to say: "I've done my work, and want rest now!" "Mon Dieu! ze John-Bull-mens take from from me my privilege!" said the doctor, angrily. "Zey anputat my own mens! Nevare mind--nevare mind-I pay zeom for zat before soon P" "That last shot of yours did the work---see, they're taking in head-sails to ease their fore- mast. You have evidently weakened it," said the captain, who, noticing that another manL had sprung to the wheel in place of him who had fallen, had not removed his glass from the enemy for an instant.  "I'll give them more work to do," said the delighted gunner. "Load. lively, my hearties -load lively!" Again a shot came from the enemy, but this time if fell short, proving that the schooner was gaining with the now freshening breeze, and the other losing by taking in sail. "One more shot, Mr. Brownell, and then I'll run in behind the island, and let them follow me if they dare. By Jupiter I her foremast is going now, your last sho must have plummind it!" The gunner did not reply to the captain- he was tdo busy in sighting his favorite. Scarcely had he fired hi third shot, when the tall foremast of the enemy, with all of its upper spars, was seen to reel and fall, and the ship, all in confusion, to come up in the wind. An involuntary cheer burst from lhe crew of the "Tyrannicide," which was so echoed fronm the rocky cliffs ot' the little island which they were approaching, that it seemed to be re- turned bya hundred throats on shore-though there was no living soul'upon the islet. I wish I could pay more attention to that gentleman'sw wants," said the captain. "But I cannot-his consorts are coming up hand over hand, and I must turn pilot for our own dear barkie now!"  ' Taking, his station by the man at the helm, he conned the vessel and gave the course, while under a full press of sail, without further damage; the schoonershotaround the point of the island, and was soon threading a narrow and intricate passage among other islands, still further to the westward, where Seawaif would only have been too glad to see the British try to follow him. Thus, for the present, we will leave him and return to the ' Bristol."  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6983-00000011"/> CHAPTER XIn. When the commodore, Sir Peter Parker, saw the way that his boats were being handled by the long gunon board the Yankee schooner, his rage knew no bounds. "Pull, you devils, pull, and board her, and hang every cursed rebel to his own spars " he shouted, although the boats were beyond hearing. As the breeze reached his vessel, he ordered every sail crowded on, in hopes to get within gun-shot of the schooner, and to sink her be- fore she got the wind. But when he saw that the breeze had reached the schooner sufficiently to give her steerage- way, and bring her whole broadside to bear upon the boats, he immediately ordered the signal for their recall to be made; for he knew well, that if the schooner was now carried, it could only be done at an immense loss of life. "Poor Morris!" he murmured, as he gave this order. "It would have been a glorious chance for him, and he might have won an ' order' by it. But while man proposes, God disposes ; and he must take luck as it comes!" As the ship had now gathered headway, her boats were soon alongside, crews on board, and hoisted up. "I'm glad that you are safe, Morris-how many men have you lost?" said the commo- dore to the mortified captain, as he appeared on the quarter-deck. "Twenty men killed-more disabled; and two launches and a cutter sunk, sir! Fortu- nately, none of them belonged to this ship-- unfortunately, perhaps; for I had about as willingly have been ki!led as to have failed in my objectt!' "Pshaw, Morrisi-it was no fault of yours. No man can conquer fortune-your intention was gallant, and would have succeeded but for this wind coming up!" "It will enable us to take her yet," said the captain, observing, joyfully, that the distance - between the vessels was rapidly shortening. "When we once get her under our guns, we'll pay her off. If you please, sir, I'll go forward and see to training the bow guns on her!" "Do so, my dear Morris, but remember the promised voyage to Bermuda, and don't crip- ple her spars or damage her hull so that we'll have to destroy her," said the commodore, with a pleasant laugh; for he felt so confident that the schooner would soon be taken, that he ordered the steward, who announced that breakfast was rc-ady, to keep it warm until the Yankee had been captured. It is singular how all commodores and cap- tains wi!l swear! They seem to esteem it as an inalienable, peculiar, and self-only-possessed right. I sailed with one once, when I had the honor to hold a commission in our gallant navy, who used to cursen till nil was blue-ves bcik--aound hi:m; but i! he heard an oath   from any other officer on board, a reprimand reached the offender instantly. The commodore now took his position on the top-gallant forecastle of his ship; and with his spy-glass, carefully'prepared to watch the effects of his shot in "humbling Ynnkee pride, and crushing Yankee insolence," as he said. When he saw that his first shot fell short, he shouted: "More powder there, you monkeys, more powder!" But when, a few moments later, a shot came from the schooner, crashing in over the edge of the bow-port, killing and wounding near a dozen men, he fairly turned white with rage. His next shot pleased him better. "I can see daylight through his canvas!" he shouted. ,* "See if you can't hull her next time!" But even while he was speaking, a shot passed his side, not three feet from him, and striking the foremast directly in the centre, passea through it, and dropped on the deck beyond. "A thousand curses on the luck-in with the head-sails quick, or the mast is gone-the cursed rebel will escape!" he shouted, now redder than his own cross, and crosser than a sore-headed bear. The reader knows the rest-how, after one more shot, the spare of the proud Englishman came tumbling down, and she was utterly dis- abled. I have too many thrilling incidents, scenes, and adventures to tell in this story, to permit myself to linger over any point not full of in- terest; therefore, I will close this chapter by saying, that after the commodore saw the schooner pass beyond his reach, he made ar- rangements for transferring his flag to another ship, and sent Captain Morris e ith the "Bris- tol" to Bermuda, to repair damages.

On the broad, breeze-swept, shaded and vine-embowered piazza of a large house, which overlooked the reef-locked harbor of Bermuda, stood as lovely a girl as one could well dream of, or wish to look upon, even if he were a painter or a sculptor in searchof a study or a model. She was not very tall, in truth, rather  petite; but never was a figure more exquisitely proportioned. Her foot small, ankle exqui- sitely turned; her hand gracefully shaped, and arm swelling out above the delicate wrist, so round, and white, and velvety soft, that one could not but deem it heavenly to be hugged to 'death by a pair of such-" capital punish- nient," one might say; form, full and plump as if made for life and fove, her features also were fine, expressive of delicacy and intellect; her eyes large and blue as a cloudless morning   sky; her hair a golden brown, tossing in ring- lets over a neck and shoulders as white and soft as the lily which opens on the lakes in summer-time. The scene upon which she stood and looked was not iacking in beauty, to harmonize with her own.  Before her was a large garden, teeming everywhere with fruit, and flowers of that rich and gorgeous nature which only a southern clime can bring forth and nurture.. Beyond this, lay the pale, green water of the harbor, danicing to the touch of a light breeze amid the sun-rays, like animated emeralds- beyond it still, the purple loom of the coral- reefs could be seen; and yet further out, the azure of the deeper water of old ocean. A few houses only were scattered here and : there around, looking like the villas of wealthy people; but near a fort, or rather a protected battery, which commanded the harbor, were many cottages, apparently those of working sand poor people, for pigs and children were plenty about the doors-rather a certain sign, Ibelieve. There was also a spar yard, and buildings evidently adapted to use for making naval repairs; and several vessels lying near, some disabled and others fitting out, justified the supposition that this was a kind of naval rendezvous.- The nationality of. the place was attested by the English flag, which floated' from a tall staff inside of the battery-works, and a smaller one which waved from over the house which we' first named in this chapter1 and which, we may as well say, was the then residence of Sir Humphrey Dorset, the gov- ernor of the island-a pompous, beef-fed, liquor-loving baronet, who wanted much to serve his country in some capacity where it would pay something-for youthful extrava- gance had not only devoured a considerable patrimony, but so encumbered that which he had left, that a quiet residence abroad was preferable to a bailiff-troubled one at home. Sir Humphrey judged of men only by their money and will to spend it, and their love of liquor and capacity to hold it. Beyond this, he had scarcely an idea, if we except one thifg, an inordinate love for his only daughter, Ve- nona--a delicate, slender, spirituelle, beautiful creature,in everything so much his opposite, that one might well doubt her being his child. Certainly, she in no wise resembled him ; but' she might have resembled her mother, who had been dead many years; in truth, she' died before Venona was at an age to remem- ber her beauty or appreciate her goodness. Venona's great, dark eyes, her pale and thoughtful face, so full of soul, only animated when some fresh and beautiful thought came like a sun-ray upon her mind-her hair hang- ing in wild, glossy, night-like tresses over her neck and shoulders-her dreamy look--her lithe, tall, and swaying figure, all uall of grace, made a great contrast to the beauty of Lizzie Egerton, the one whom we first described, and who was none other than the orphan ward of   Sir Peter Parker, before alluded to, in connec- tion with the name of Sir Peter's friend; Cap- bain Morris. While Lizzie was thus standing where we first saw her, on the piazza, looking out upon the beautiful scene before her, and enjoying the cool, delicious breeze, which, coming from over the water and-through the groves of fruits and flowers, bore to her their sweet aroma, Venona Dorset stole softly up behind her, and Iputting her arms about her round, small waist, im- printed ,lkiss on her white shoulder. Lizzie started, uttering a low cry ; btMt when. she looked around and saw whose was the arm that embraced her, whose the lips thait had touched ler soft skin; she ismiled sweetly; and passing her arm around Venona's slender waist, and drawing her to her bosom, imprinted a sisterly kiss upon her white forehead. Is not this a lovely evening, Venona?" she said. "I am watching to see the fires of that great, red, -blazing sun, put out in the blue bath ofthe ocean, in the far west. How slowlyl, grandly, it seems to go down to its couch, canopied above by those clouds of purple and gold 1" *"It, is beautiful-but, like all things beauti- ful, it will not last-but is passing, fading away!" sighed Venona. "Going, like a great and victorious chief, dying on his last battle-field, in the' blaze of his own glory!" said Lizzie. "What is that, far away, right where the- lower edge of the great fiery orb is touching the blue water?" asked Venona. "It looks like a white bird, a swan afloat between the sky and water!" "Why, child, cannot you tell a sail from a bird? It is a vessel.-probably some of my uncle's fleet!" said Lizzie, with a laugh. "I am not the niece of a commodore, and should not be expected to know a vessel from a bird when it is fifteen or twenty miles away," said Venona, rather nettled at being laughed at. "Don't be offended, dear Venona--I did but jest," said Lizzie; and this time her kiss was pressed upon the fair girl's pouting lips. "Perhaps it is your uncle himself, who comes to bring you the lover whom he writes so often about-the gallant Captain Morris," said Venonua, in a bantering way, instantly banishing the shadow that had flitted over her brow. "The detestable Captain Morris!" if you please, my dear " coz," said Lizzie, addressing Venona as if she were a relative, though, in truth, there was very slight, if any relationship between the Parkers and Dorsets, though Sir, ,Humphrey insisted that there had been an in- termarriage between them somewhere in the- thirteenth century. "Ah, how can you say so, Lizlie! Forimy- part, though I have only seen him two or three times, I think him very much a man., Something of. a martinet, perhaps--amellingi  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6983-00000012"/> too, a little of tar; yet, for all that, a pretty good creatnre, who'd be apt to let his wife lavc her own way-and what more does a wo- man want?' "What more, Venona?'"I am astonished to hear you, who are so full of heart, soul, in- tellect, speak so lightly-so unlike yourself! A woman wants a man whom her heart tells her that she can love-a man, a true man, with high courage, honor, truth' noble impulses; thoughts which tend upward toward the sky, not down upon the earth-one whom she can trust, revere, respect, worship next to her GOD!" "r There, there, dear Lizzie, I have succeeded in what I wished to do-I have aroused vour dreaming heart into life-into speaking what I feel. Dear Lizzie,I hope you will get such a man, for you are worthy of it i" "Thanks, dear Venona-thanks! I might have understood you, but I am growing stupid, I believe. When fny uncle sends us back to the bold, wild, but ever-loved shores of our native land, its clear, strong air may strengthen my brain. I feel as if this lazy clime and sleepy atmosphere were lessening the nerve of all my system--mental and physical!" "Ially-hot Tally-ho! So i've itruck the scent nial found ye atlast, young blossoms, have I?" cried Sir Humphrey, coming forward at this moment from the door which opened out upon tHe piazza. He was like a French novel in one sense- full as broad as he was lono, and the costume of the day, knee-breeches, long waistcoat and broad-skirted coat, showed his rotundity of leg and body fully.  A full-dress wig and small-sword helped to set him off, while the small, black tri-colored hat sat upon the pow-I dcrced wig, like a very small darkey doubled up on a big pile of cotton. His very small noseo  set in between his great, puffy cheeks, like a? ruby between two immense carnations-his little eyes looking out over them; like stars just peeping over a couple of clouds. His upper story (that where the brain is located) seemed rather scant of room, and had not the appearance of being crowdedly furnished. i So my blossoms!" said this jolly gentle- man of sixty or thereabouts, "you're snuffing the sea breeze, are you? I feel as lonesome here as a pig in a strange meadow-not a soul to drink with, not a person to talk to, but the deaf doctor or the fame parson. Can't you come in and sing a few staves to warm up my old lheart? I wish your uncle would come, young gipsy; he can stand his four bottles without winking; but that pet of his, Morris, is a iuilk-sop. He always gives in at two!" '-Ilow singular, dear father! We were both talking of those very two individuals, just before you found us-and Lizzie don't think any more of Captain Morris than you do; while I think ho is a very proper, agreeable, nice' man 1"   "You do, hussy? Why'he's a rgiilar milk- sop of a man. lie don't know good liquor from bad-I do believe he'd light a cheroot at the big end! He a man, and can't go his three bottles!" "I Did you notice that sail in the offing, Sir Humphrey?" asked Lizzie, who had too often heard his estitnmate of what made a man, to be much amused'at it. "No-a sail? The look-outs have not re- ported any!" "(Yet there is one; look right where the sun is going down-do you not see a white speck?" "Why, yes-by Bacchus, I believe I do! I hope whoever comes will know how to drink. This is a very lonesome place. I'd about as well be-a gquger in Ireland. as a governor here, for all the company and cumfort I see!" "!How long will it take for that vessel to get in, Sir Hump)hrey?" asked Lizzie. "Maybe half the night, my blossom! She's a long way off, and the wind is light and dying away 1" "I am sorry that we have no moonlight, to- night," said Venona ; -it would be so pleasant to sit here and watch the white speck as it grew, and grew out into the distinctness of a noble vessel, whose throne is on the mighty deep, whose battles are fought with the ele- ments, and whose path is trackless!" "Well, there is no moon, blossom, so come in and sing a ballad or two for your old gov'nor, while he puts a bottle of good sherry under his jacket, and smokes a pipe or two! Comte gipsies, an old man is better company than none at all-come along!" And taking an arm of each under his own, he marched in with his laughing prizes. CHAPTER XV. When Seawaif ran in among the islands be- low Nantucket, he knew well that no vessel of the enemy would follow him there; but as there was every appearance of having the wind out fresh from the northward and westward by night-time, he stood in toward the main, so that when he caught the favorable wind, he might run down the coast in smooth water, in- stead of pitching and rolling in a heavy sea further out. It was but a short time before he lost sight of the British fleet-much to his own joy and that of his crew--for'hard knocks and precious little prize-money is all that a privateer can expect from a man-of-war. But the doctor was really unhappy. "No amputat!  No ball-extract I  No nos- smg!" he muttered, as he walked up and down   the deck. "I Be gar, zis is not war, it is play, babee play." "You shall have work rather than play, all in good time," said the captain, laughing at the doctor's complaints.   -   ' "Ah, Messieur le capitaine, I fear nevare, sare, nevare!" sighed the doctor. "Two times we 'ave fight the John-Bull-mens-two times, sare, and nevare once yet I stain my instru- ments. It is too bad-too bad!" And the doctor retired to his state-room, to test the, consolatory power of some cognac which he kept there for private uee. A strong north-west gale setting in .on the night that followed her escape from the fleet of Sir Peter Parker, drove the "Tyrannicide" down the American coast rapidly, until she had reached the latitude of the Savannah 'River, or about ,82 degrees south; and in all this long route she had not seen a single vessel, except some small American coasters, off ports neither in possession of, nor blockaded by,the enemy.  Tired of this do-nothing work, Seawaif de- termined to run off the land, and strike the track of some of the homeward-bound Wcst- Indiamen; and with the last of his north- weqterly' gale, he hauled out to the eastward. The wind began to lessen as he receded from the land, and when he was about two hundred miles out, the night of the third day found the vessel in a dead calm. The sails were flapping idly against the spars, the watch half asleep, and the lazy waves heaving slowly to and froi like breathings of a vast star-gemmed breast, beneath the cloudless but moonless sky.' It was midnight. Young Morley was on watch; and like many young officers, felt so careless and easy in sucha night, that he could scarcely keep his eyes open. Even when a very slight breath from the south'ard filled the sails, steadied them in their flapping, and taking them aback, gave the schooner stern-board, he /did not notice it, nor did the man at the helm -for men will never watch when the eye of the officer droops, on duty. It was such a sleepy, quiet night, that after the hard work and anxious watches of previous nights, it seemed almost excusable to be care- less. Suddenly, however, a man more' wakeful than the rest came aft, and touching the young officer on the arm, said, in i low tone: "II heard the creaking of a block and the rattle of running rigging, or something like it, just now, to the eastward, sir!" The young officer sprang from the coil of rigging against which he had been leaning, rubbed his eyes, and asked the man to repeat bis remarks. "There's a v'essel somewhere away on our   larboard bow, or ahead of 'is, sir," said the The officer looked away in the direction pointed out, but could discern nboiing in the uim, hazy atmosphere of the niglit. "You must be mistaken, I caii see nothing," said the officer, after a second glance all around tthe vessel. "I'll take my oath, sir, that I heard the sounds; and they were not aboard of this ves- sel," said the man. "' Shift your helm to port there," said, the officer to the man at the helm. And liv wiss about to give an order to the watch to tend the braces, and trim the yards in his uru::l loud tone, when his ear caught sounds that made 'him pause and listen. Distiinctly he heard the order: "Braneo in tlhe head-yards  - brac up the after-yards! Shift your helm there, you lubber, don't you see we're aback?" And following this order, he distinctly heard the sound of running cordage, the creak of the' bracing yards, and knew that a vessel was but a short distance away; but as she could not be seen, of course her size, class, or nation was unknown. Without permitting any noise to be made on deck, he had the entire crew aroused as si- lently as possible, and sent for the captain. Every light was hidden, and the men quietly' sent to theirsquarters, while the vessel, through. the action of the helm, fell off so that her sails filled, and very slowly; but wi':h full steerage- way she moved through the water. When Captain Seawaif reached the deck, lie found that the Vessel in this' perfect silence had been fully prepared for action, and he warmly commended the' young officei- for his prudence and good conduct --for he aid not know how near the poor fellow had been to that greatest of military offences, being caught asleep on post.  Are you sure you heard the sotinds of a vessel near us?" asked the captain. "Yes, sir, positive! And now, sir, look for yourself;" and suddenly the dim, ghost-whil outlines of a ship were seen- close on their weather-how, standing the same way that thOy were, but under less canvas'than tlicinscmlv-s. "Stand to your guns, min, anid be ready to throw open your ports and act. JBrownell, slew long Tomi silently to bear upon  the stranger," said tlme eaptailn,in a low tone. "( Be silent, fore and aft." But in the movement of tihe large gun, or something, a noise was made which attracted the attention of the dull watch on board the other vessel; a bustle was heard there, :ind then a hail came from her in a gruff, heArty voice: "Schooner ahoy! What vessel is that!"  "His Britalnic Majesty's Schoone'r 'Co- quette!' Who are you and where from '?' re- plied Seawai; without the slightest hesitatin.  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6983-00000013"/> "His Britannic Majesty's Sloop-of-War ' Electra,' last from Jamaica, on a cruise! Keep company if you please till daylight, and I'll send an officer aboard for news!" replied the other. We'll keep company as long as you like, sir," replied Seawaif--" there are Yankees in these waters! There was one in sight of us at sunset," said Seawaif, at'the eame time saying "ready" to his gunners, and "put your helm aweather," to his helmsman. "Whereaway?" asked the unsuspecting Englishman. "Hereaway!" thundered Seawaif, as he gave the order to pour in his whole larboard broad- side upon the enemy. Then lufling short up across the stern of the sloop-of-Vwar, his star- board battery came in range, and completely raked her from stem to stern. Then shifting her helm aport, her bow fell to leeward, and as he shouted : "Boarders and pikeine away!" the vessels closed, and with his own hanndshe helped to lash them together; and the next instant, at the head of his men, close followed by Doolittle and Morley, he sprang to the deck of the Englishman. The latter, though entirely surprised, was not disposed to yield; and though the two broadsides had fearfully weakened his crew, and his deck was covered with the dead and dying, he made a most gallantdefence. Only one watch-half the crew-had been on deck when the action opened, and now fresh men came up from below. But they were confused, and knew not whom they met as they came up the hatchways; and this gave the Americans an advantage which they needed, for they were not so many as those whom they so boldly strove to conquer. Seawaifs voice and hand now heard and striking in the van, cheered on his desperate men. Doolittle, saying little, but clearing a wide path with his keen cutlass; and young Morley as active and fierce as a tiger-now fairly awake-drove the enemy gradually aft, until they had but narrow space of deck to fight upon. But two or three officers, gather- ing and cheering their crew, here made a most gallant stand. One was the commander of the ship, young, and therefore, probably a lord, to have attained rank so early; he fought with the recklessness of despair. "Sweep the Yankees from the deck!" he shouted. "Sweep them away, my brave lads, for the honor of old England!" "Ah--ha!" cried a shrill, glad voice, at this moment. "Ah-ha! I shall have plenty of amputat zis time!" and the doctor, with his lung rapier in his hand, bounded to the side of his voung commander, who at that moment was attacked by two of the enemy's officers- their leader being one. Shentilhommes, take partners for zis dance, if you please," said the doctor, as he quietly stepped in and engaged the British captain a attention, by a small eylet-hole in his clothes,   in making which, his point grazed th'e Britouhn ribs. "t Down with the frog-eater!" criedf the Eng- lishman, as he recognized the doctor's nation- ality by hjis words.      ,  "In wiz ze frog stickare!" cried ILa Motto, ' gayly, as, with a skillful parry'lie evaded a Werce blow from  the 'heavy cutlass of the other, and then, with; a deadlj lunge, passed his sword through the unfortunate captain's body until the very hilt struck heavily on his breast-bone. Seeing their leader gone, and but two offi- cers left, and they both wounded, the English crew became disheartened; and, after a few solitary and stubborn struggles,/between single combatants, yielded; and the battle was over-- the victory won, "Now for ze amputsat-now for ze ball ex- tract! Ali-ha! zis is glorieuse!" cried the doctor, as lie piit his rapier away, and rushed after his instruments. "Divide our crew  and prepare to take charge of this ship as prize-master, Mr. Doo- little!" cried Seawaif. "Mr. Morley, you will see to putting all the prisoners ir irons for the present, until we are secured!" he added, in a low tone. "Gentlemen," he continued to the British'officers who had handed him their swords, "you will be pleased to accompany me on board the American privateer, ' Tyran- nicide!'" "Taken by a privateer schooner, and ours one of the best sloops in his Majesty's service!" groaned the oldest officer, who had been, first lieutenant of the prize. "It is all the better that Lord Stansbury fell, for his proud spirit never could have survived the disgrace of being cap- tured by a Yankee privateer!" "Our baggage?" said the other officer, as they followed Seawaif to the schooner's deek. "Shall be sent for as soon as I have shown you to your quarters, gentlemen!" said Sea- waif, politely. "The accmmodations on board of a Yankee privateer," he added, with a marked emphasis on the words, "may not be as elegant as those on board of his Majesty's vessels of war (our republican simplicity hard- ly demands it) but we will ever be delighted' to tender our hospitalities to his Majesty's offi- cers!" And he led the way into a cabin more elegantly fitted up than that which they ihad re- cently left; for Mr. Phineas Cringle, thougli a business man, was a'man of taste, and not nig- gardly in anything. "If Yankee privateers look this way, and fight so well, what must we expect from their men-of-war?" said the eldest officer, paying an involuntary tribute to his captors. "Gentlemen, let me beg you to feel your- selves at home!" said the captain, pointing to seats. "Steward, get wine, liquor, andqfood for these officers. Excuse me, for a little while. gentlemen, I have duties to attend to on deck. and will then be at your service. I will also send the surgeon to you, directly."   ,tHow deuced polite the Yankee, is - like ' that cursed Frenchman, calling partners for a I dance before he ran poor Stansbury through!" t said the elder officer, as he watched the form 1 of the gallant American passing up the com- panion ladder to the deck.   '1 '- CHAPTER XVI.          t The first thing which Seawaif did, after dis- 4 posing of the captured officers, was to see per- i sonally to the security of his other prisoners and the state of the wounded of both vessels. a The killed, of course, were past caring for, and only waited a sailor's windinding-sheet-the wave,. The doctor was in his'glory, for the surgeon of the sloop-of-war had been slain, and he had the wounded of both vessels to attend to. "How do you get along, doctor?" asked the captain, as he approached him. "Ah! capital, men cher Capitaine-capital!" said he, rubbing his bloody hands together. "I am up to ze eyes in fun! Plenty ze armpu- tat, now!" And he gleefully turned to -a poor English- man, whose leg, shattered close up to th6 thkigh, had to come off. The captain turned away to Mr. Doolittle, 'who, fortunately, as well as 1Mr. Morley, had come off without receiving any serious wound, and asked if he had selected his prize crew. (How many shall I take, sir?" asked the lieutenant. It will take at least seventy-five men to work the, ship into Salem and take care of the prisoners, for I shall' only keep the officers with me," said Seawaif. "I will give you our boatswain and another good man to act as first and second mate for you. If you are chased, run into the nearest American port you can Take; if you find you cannot escape with the vessel from a superior force, put your crew and prisoners into boats, on rafts, or any way you can, and blow up the ship before you al- lhw her to be retaken. If possible, take her into Salem and tell Mr. Cringle that I will be there myself, after I've taken a few more prizes What 'll I do with such of their fellows as are hurt--we've only one doctor?" asked Doo- little. "I'll take all that imperatively require sur- gical care," said the captain. "J ut we must hutrry upmatters and get the vessels apart-the wind' is freshening, now, and by the way the air c!eurs- up, I shouldn't be surprised if we had a heavy blow trom the southwaard. It will be a fair wind for you, and you may keep ahead of the heaviest of it, but my course lies east and s.5Juth yet, for I m in a lucky track, now, and ' mean to keep it!" Everything was hastened as much as possi   ble now. Mr. Morley having secured the pris- oners, aided in having the daimaged rigging of the sloop put in order, and in fitting' her for her northern voyage. From  her magazine, Captain Seawaif took all the, ammunition Which ,he needed, and, also secured her. colors, signal- books, nmid the uniforms of her captain and' other officers, intending, if occasion required,, or a ruse y'as demande , to assume'.the charae-  ter of an Englishman.' He also ,ook from her ' all the stores tvhch he required, and when the two vessels were ready to separate, he was- much better off for provisions, ammunition, and stores than he had been when he started from Salem. It was nearly noon before the wounded were all on board the schooner and Doolittle ready to make sail on the corvette, and by that time the breeze was quite fresh' from the south. With a hearty cheer exchanged between the crew of the "Tyrannicide" and the prize crew on the other craft, the two vessels separated, and long before night, were out of sight of each other. "Well, doctor, how do you feel?" asked Seawaif, in the evening, when La Motte, pale with his day's exertions, entered the cabin where lie sat in company with the English officers. "Very much fatigue, but very much de- light!" said the doctor, helping himself to a glass of brandy. "I 'ave amputat eleven leg, sixteen arm, and one neck " "One neck?" asked the captain. "Yes sare-one neck. Ze man 'ave had his head all smash to pieces, it look so ragged, so very bad, zat I amputat it smooth, and make heem look tout comme ii frat, all nice! I do not like to see a job all botch up, mon. cher capitaine!" "How is it that you, who are a Frenchman,' are on board of our enemy, when France is at peace with England?" asked one of the Brit- ish officers. "You ask because you wish an answer, eh, Messieur?" asked La Motte, while his eye twinkled mischievously. "Of course, sir; that is what questions are generally asked for!" said the officer, rather touchily. "Zen, sare, it is just because La Belle France is not at war wiz England zat I amn here. My fazzar, when he died, left me one very rich heritage-a property zat I have ac- cept and retain wiz alf *ily heart. It was ze hatred of ze John Bull mens. He died while fighting wiz yon. I hope to 'ave ze honor to do ze same! Shentilhommes, I drink you bon voyage!"   , The Englishmen did not ask the doctor any more questions; for they saw that he was only too ready to answer them. ?  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6983-00000014"/> CHAPTER XVII. It was a week later, and the saucy privateer did not look quite as gay and nice as she did when she came out of port, for she had jnst come out of. a tremendous hurricane, in which, had it not been for management of the most consummate skill, and a nerve in the comman- der, and perseverance under peril and hard- ship, exhibited as well by the men as himself, which was wonderful, she would have gone to the bottom, He did not dare to put her away before the gale, for she lay so low in the wa- ter, and was so heavy with stores and metal, that the great seas would have swept her fore and aft. As it was, her bulwarks were consid- erably shattered, her upper works badly strained, both top-masts sprung, her rigging stretched, sonime of the sails blown away, and she neeodd refitting. "I will not go back to Salem without an- other prize, but what port it is' best to make, bothers me!" said Seawaif. in a conversation with young Morley, on the morning after the gale had broken. "What is the nearest land, sir, by your reck- oning?" asked the officer. "Bermuda, by a long way!" "But that is an English station, sir!" "Yes; but with English colors, signals, and uniforms on board, I don't know but we could go in there to refit. I find, by a naval regis- ter which I took from the 'Electra', that there is a schooner on the East India station of ex- actly our tonnage and rig, even our number of guns, also, called the ' Tartar '-it will be also easy for us to assume the names of her officers, for she is far away, and our detection will be improbable. Thus I think we can refit at Eng- lish expense, and no one but ourselves be the wiser, until we choose to enlighten them." *"The officers that we have on board would endanger us." "Not if they give their honor not to do' so- especially when they know that double irons, a berth in the hold, and gags in their mouths, would be the result of their refusal to keep si- lent!" "Ihlther harsh usage for gentlemen in his Ma- jesty s service, sir; but yet such as they would rather endure than aid in imposing upon their couutrymen!" said the eldest English officer, who. being nearer than they supposed, had overheard their conversation. "Have it as you will, sir!" replied. Seawaif, stemly. "-I go into Bermuda to refit, and if my prisoners wish to endanger me in any way, Lsh..ll taike means to prevent it, harsh or not! c Yotu and your companion can remain as com-  fortable as vyon now are, on giving your words  of honor not by any sign, word, writing, or act, to betray us; but if you refuse, the convcrsa- t tion you have listened to named the alterna- o tive! "For my part, I accept the altnaiove rV'   said the officer. "My copanion can choote for himself-captivity levels rank, and I can- not order him to follow my example!" r "I do not require orders to {make n:e per- Iform my duty-I shall not shrink from fol- lowing your example!" replied the other Eng- "Very well, gentlemen, I will make vou ag comfortable as 1 can, consistent with His own safety; but when we nmake the land, which I am now steering for, your present comforts and liberties will be much abridged!" said the captain. And he went into the cabin to consult his chart. CHAPTER XVIII. The dwellers at Bermuda were surprised, and' pleased also, when, on the morning succeed- ing the day-or, rather, the evening-which emnibraced the incidents of our fourteenth chap- ter, they found that, during the night, a vessel of war, bearing the English flag, had entered their harbor, and come to anchor; for the ad- vent of every visitor was, to so small. a place, quite a godsend-especially if there were officers and men to spend their money on shore, and render the monotony of Bermuda life less than it was. If the old governor, Sir Humphrey, found any   companions of his stripe, all of his subordinates had holiday ; for he gave himself utterly up to enjoyment when he had company to suit his own ideas. That this visitor, a fine large war-schooner, meant to tender all of the civilities, was seen at once by the fact that, soon after sunrise, she tliun- dered off a salute to the Governor; which he, in due time, returned, from the battery. In about an hour or so, allowing time for him to have breakfasted, the comrmander of the schooner-a fine-looking, but 'rather pale and delicate young man, who announced him- self as Arthur Sinclair, Lieutenant Command- ing II. B. Majesty's schooner " Tartar," latelv from  the East, but now ordered on thl Wcht India station-cainme on shore, dressed superb- l   min a rich uniform, to pay his respeect to the governor. The latter had waited, with anxiety, to fCC what manner of man he was, and whether he would be likely to be a good bottle companion or not-for, beyond that quality, he had but little conception of the requirements of a nian. As the young officer advaneed to the spot where the governor, in front of his house, 'ac- companied by his secretary, awaited him, Sir IIumniphrey remarked to the latter, before the officer was in hearing: "  The fellow is as white as my shirt! Two, to one he can't tell port from sherry; five to one he can't bear brandy; ten to one he's au milk-sop b" Not by the flash of his eye," said the see-   retary,'in a low tone ; for he was a better judge of true humanity th thn the, governor, even though he was a poor sevenitli or tenth cousin of the latter, and only held a secretary's post. When Lieutenant Sinclair announced him- self, the governor started, and seemed to eye him with an astonishment which betokened recognition; in fact, he was so confused, that lie hardly made a proper reply to the officer', when the latter told his name and rank. "You speak and look as if you had seen me  before; yet I am not aware of ever having had the honor to meet Sir Humphrey Dorset previous to this occasion," said the young officer, stiffly, in reply to an incoherent ex- clamation of the governor's. "Excuse me, captain-that is, lieutenant- but you resemble so strongly a very dear fricnd of mine, whose daugl-ter is .f present :indcr my roof, that, at first, I almost felt as if he lived again, though he has been dead for years. But likenesses are often accidental; ehcre were never any Sinclairs connected with the Egertons or Dorsets, that I ever heard of. But, come in, sir;. come in. Do you ever im- bibe in the morning?" Judging, from the "( signs," that the governor did, the young officer had the good sense and proper knowledge of human character to niake a good. impression on Sir Humphrey's mind, by replying that he did " imbibe " occa- sionally, and should be most happy to go in and join him in a friendly glass, "Come' in-come in, sir ; we'll take a little- stimiulant, by way of appetizing for lunch, and then I'll introduce you to my daughter and the Honorable Miss Isgerton, wlio looks almost enough like you to be a sister, though her hair, skin, and eyes are all lighter," said Sir Humphrey, leading the way. "First of all, after having christened your hospitable side-board, sir, Imust must mak un- quiries about your means of enabling me to refit some spars that were carried away id Jr late hurricane and also making some few other repairs." "Oh, we've lots of spars in our spar-yard- rigging to spare, and riggers. There is nothing which you want that shall not be done!" said Sir Humphrev-believiing that a man who was so willing to take a drink couldn't be quite a , milksop." "You will dine with me to-day, will you not?-your officers, also?" asked the governor. "I Ihave some old port that's as crusty as sea- foam, and as rich as blood! I suppose that you can tuck a bottle or two away, after a long cruise?" "I am not a very f st hand with the bottle; but my surgeon makes up for all deficiencies on my part, He is a Frenchman, and volun- teered in place of my regular surgeon, whlom I lost by siceknes. lle will be but too happy to accept yoar excellency's invitation." "And I, only too happy to make his ac- quaintance. My dear sir, in this lonely spot,   one. can hardly estimate the value of a ecn- vivial companion. Where there is plenty of society, a ride after the hounds now and then, or a steeple-chase-why, one can exist without quite so much stimulant. But here, sir-here one must drink or die!" The lieutenant smiled. He .evidently knew his man; and deeming 'it best to please him, so far as lie could, not only took a good nip of his liquor, but praised its quality; and 'also entered into a dissertation upon liquor generally, in which, 'either from reading, or otherwise, he was able to mention so many more kinds than the old baronet had knowhi of, that the latter set him down, in his Bown mind, as one of the' nost learned men in the world. After tasting several varieties of the Gov- ernor's wine and liquor, the lieutenant haviing hinted that he must return on board 'to ar- range for his repairs, Sir Humphrey at last consented-insisting, however, upon a previous introduction to the ladies. "Lieutenant Arthur Sinclair, my blossoms I 'My blossoms, Lieutenant Sinclair, of the ' Tar- tar!' You've heard of catching Tartars, haven't you? Well, here is a chance!" said the jolly governor, as he led the lieutenant into the' ladies' drawing-room. The lieutenant started, whei he saw Miss Egerton, for he seemed to have met an old ac- quaintance; her face seemed strangely fami- liar to him. Yet, to' speak truly, about the only/female acquaintance that lie hnd on earth, before that moment, was Kate Cringle; for his early life had been spent in solitude and study--his later days in hard and active duty at sea. The lad', too, started and blushed; perhaps because his eager look iwas fixed so intently on her; perhaps from some unknown sympathy, some electric affection which we often feel, yet cannot account for. I-ave you never felt, young reader, upon meeting one who was an utter stranger, an un- ,accountable, but not unpleasant thrill shoot through your heart and system, and a kind of soul-intelligence that the spirit of the stranger is akiri to that within yourself? I have, if' you have not. But both were too well-bred to 'long exhibit a confusion for which neither could account; and the lieutenant, bowing as gracefully to the ladies as if heohad been bred a courtier, rather than a rude sailor, entered into an easy and pleasant conversation with them, which soon made him and them feel as if they were not strangers. The governor, having gone out to give his personal orders in regard to dinner-a matter of vast importance to him--Vcenona was .n- abled to give the lieutenant an introduction to their names, which the " blossom" idea of the governor had neglected; and, with a daugh- ter's fondness and a lady's delicacy, she en- deavored to apologize for her father's eccen- tricities. And Lieutenant Sinclair quite won  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6983-00000015"/> her goo3 graces by declaring himself delighted with the raluraicruss of her fither, and his lack of ostentatious affectation. And he established himself with both as a pleasant and gallant gentleman, by the declaration that he regretted that his detention for repairs would be brief; for it would be hard to tear himself away from such charming society. Having gone suffi- eiently far to produce, evidently, a very favor- able impression, the young officer toolk his leave -remarking that, having engaged to dine with the governor, lie should soon again have the happiness to meet them. CHAPTER XIX. "Isn't he ' a treasure trove'-isn't he angel- ' ent to us, lonely 'blossoms' on this desert isle?" said Venona to Lizzie, when the lieu- tenant had gone out. The only answer which Lizzie' made was a sigh. And though the color canme and went upon her face, like shadows of light, rosy clouds over a field of flowers, her eyes were bent upon the floor, and she seemed to be in a dream. - What is the matter, coz? Why, really, I believe you're in love!" "Perhaps I am!" siged Lizzie, abstract- edly, as it she scarcely knew what she was saving. 'Venona burst out in a gay laugh, and cried: "Well, here is a case of love at first eight in reality. i always thought that such things existed only in the ideality of a poet or novel-writei's brain! What will become of your uncle's pet, poor Captain Morris?" "I know not, care not; I only feel, and I cannot account for it-a wild, uncontrollable sympathy-perhaps it is love for this officer, stranger though be be!" "Well, he's a handsome man, at an)y rate I By the way, though his eyes and heir are darker, his features greatly resemble yours, and there is something in his expression greatly like your own when you are thoughtful, and a little inclined to have the blues I I've often heard that husband and wife are found to look alike, if well matched!" "He will never be my husband-I shall never marry!" said Lizzie, with a deep sigh. "Pshaw I how long since you turned pro- phetes?"' said Venona, with another smile. nd as Lizie made no answer, she added : "I hope there is some other handsome young officer on board of Lieutenant Sinclair's ves- e1 for mt to fall in love with, so that I can echo your sighs. I am sorry that I did not make the inuiry ; and if there was, had not asked him to bnrng him ashore with him!" Well blossoms, how did you like the young officer?" asked the governor, who, havy-   ing given his dinner'commands, now felt con.- tented. "t Very well, dear father-Lizzie--" A look of entreaty friom Lizzie checked Venona jut in tinmej and she added : "Lizzie don't think he's half as interesting as Captain Morris!" "Tut, tut! Morris is a milk-sop. Gives in over'a single bottle I The lieutenant is worth ten of him. You'll see at dinner-time. Why, he knows more about wine than I do! Dress yourselves up nice, blossoms-his surgeon is a Frenchman, and used to the modes, de Paris, I suppose!" "A French surgeon on board of an English man-of-war? Is not that strange?" asked Lizzie, who, in her relationship to a commo- dore, had become pretty well acquainted with the customs of the ksrvice, and the class of officers in it. "He is a volunteer; the regular surgeon died somewhere on their cruise!" said the go'v- ernor, by way of explanation. "Are there any other young and handsome officers on board besides Lieutenant Sinclair?" asked Venona, demurely. "Why, blossom, why?" asked the gover- nor. "Only I thought the more the merrier!' said the pretty one, gayly. "Yes; so far as it goes! But no falling in love, blossom-no falling in love, mind ye! For, you know, I've made up my mind nCever to part with ye-never--NEVER! Why, I'd be as lost without you as a parson without a clerk or a -" "Governor without his bottle of old port!" said the laughing daughter, interrupting him with a kiss. CHAPTER XX. "Well, captain, how do things look ashore -any danger of detection?" asked young Morley (now acting as first, officer of the "Ty- rannicide," whichl vessel, under the assumed name of the "Tartar," now lan in the hiarbor of' Bermuda) of Seawaif, alias Lieutenant Sin- clair. "Everything is right there, my dear Bever- ly!" said Seawaif, addrossing Morley by hi s proper alias, according to' the register foundl on board of the "Electra." "The gover:nor of the island is a jolly old soul, whose cldmif end is the emptying of bottles. We can r*efit without danger, but it is best to be in a hu'rry. for we know not who or what may enter the harbor; and our time is too precious to 'our- selves and our country to be wasted in idle- ness!" "True, sir; as soon as spars can be got, I am ready to refit them. I have got gangs of men at the rigging now!"   "So I see I Your diligence is most com- mnendable!" replied Seawaif. "How do the prisoners like confinement?" "Ill enough; but there is no help fdr it. I would not trust them now, sir, on their honor! I have put a double guard over them, because I detected them in the attempt to bribe one of our men to convey a note on shore 1" "Ha! Did they try that?  Then we can- not be too rigid. Let none but the most faith- ful men be put on guard over them. H did in- tend that you' should accompany the doctor and myself to dine with the governqr to-day i but 'either you or I must remain constantly on board. I will have our repairs hurried all that I can; for we are too close under their battery in case of discovery, for safety or com- fort!" "Yes, sir, that is true!" "Where is the doctor?" asked the csptaini "Here, at your service, mon cher capitaine .!" said La Motte, at that instant coming oa deck;' "I have an invitation for you to dine with the governor-lhe is a jolly old gentleman- keeps good wine; and has a' pretty daughter!" &amp;aid Seawaif, with a smile. "Eh bien, I 'shall dine wiz him, pay parti- cular attention to his wine, and lay myself at ze feet of his daughtare!" '"Look out that you do not lay yourself at the feet of his table--he thinks nothing of drinking three or four bottles!" "Ah, I fear not zat, Messieur le capitaine; I 'aVe very strong head for ze wine-but very weak heart for ze ladies! I forget when I see zem zat zey are not all angels, and I sink zat ze more soon I fall down on my knee to wor- ship zcm, ze more near am I to heaven!" "One thing you must not forget, doctor!" said Seawaif. "We are now representing a British man-of-war-I am Lieutenant Sinclair, Mr. Morley is Beverly, and we were last from the East Indies!" "Certainement, I shall remember all zat, mon cher Messieur Sinclaire. I shall not for- get ze ' Tartare,' nor nossing else. But, by gar, I do not like to wear ze John Bull uni- form-it feel like I 'ave ze ecch on my back, and I sink all ze time I must scratch, scratch, like did ze Duke of Argyle in ze old times!" "( You'll not have to wear it long, doctor; we will be at sea again in a few days, if no- thing happens!" said the captain, who could not avoid laughing at the itchy idea of La Motte.  The foreman of the spar-yard now came off, by, the orders of the governor, to see what the schooner required; and the young' captain busied himself until the dinner hour in super- intending matters on board. He also took oc- casion, by careless questioning,- to find out all that he could about the, governor, so as the better to be enabled to know how to keep on his right side, without attracting any particu- lar attention., He found out that the young lady with golden ringlets and blue eyes was a   ward and niece of Commodore Sir Peter Parker, that her father had been a British peer, and that she was heiress to considerable property; also; that she was expecting soon t6 return to England--for such matters as these are ever in some way known to the lower class of people; probably through the loqua- city of servants, who, like their superiprs, must talk and carry news. They'd 'hardly be human if they did not. CHAPTER XXL The doctor proved a most delightful and ac- ceptable guest to Sir Humphrey, for he left no heel-taps, and filled to his host as freely a half-hour after' the ladies, accompanied by Sea- waif (or Sinclair, as theyknuew him) had le't the table, as he did when the first glass had been filled for him.  When the good baronet rather animadverted upon the haste with which the lieutenant had left,' to evade the bottle, the doctor said : "You must excuse Messieur Sinclaire, if you please, Governare --, he has an affection' of ze heart zat forbid his drink very much ze wine! But, sare, wiz a great deal pleasure I will drink for him and for myeclfl It give me one grand delight to drink w'iz such an amia- ble shentilhomme as yourself." And the doctor verified his words by emp- tying his glass (quite( as frequently as did mlis delighted host.  Meanwhile, engaged in ploeasant conversation, the lieutenante  and the ladies walked out into' the lovely' garden and the adjacent grove, where a soft breeze and agreeable shade made the atmosphere delightful. After having led the way to a romantic bower which overlooked the sea, Venonas sud- denly declared that Mr. Sinclair must hear her friend, Miss Egerton, sing; and, hastening to the house to get a guitar, left the lieutenant and Lizzie seated alone in the vine-embowered place. "The sea is very beautiful-though I could not bear to live 'upon it always, yet I should like to dwell where I could look upon it, when I should most dread to be upon it, wyhen lashed into furious grandeur by a storm!" said Lizzie, as together they glanced upon the waters now dancing in the sunlight. "It has been my fate always to live within- sight of or upon it," said Seawaif; then, as if he feared that such a statement -might lead to further and embarrassing questions regarding his place of nativity, parentage, etc., he sud- denly changed the theme, and asked: "Are you fond of music, lady?" "I am, sir-who that has a soul is not? It is the poetry of sound which moat enohants i our senseas"  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6983-00000016"/> "Most true, lady," said lie, " yet as natures differ in regard to all things, so do tastes in music. For instance," he added, with a non- chalance which would have implied lhim quite an adept in telling a "white lie," " the East Indians whom I lately left, thought that there was nothing more musical or pleasant than the clangor of a hundred brazen gongs. Upon one occasion, when our squadron was at Cal- cutta, the Admiral sent the full band on shore to serenade a Rajah. They played their most exquisite pieces, and after they'had at last re- tired, a European gentleman, who had been with the Rajah during the performance, asked which piece had most pleased him." ' Oh! that which they played when they firat entered the court-yard," said the Rajah. "he had been most pleased with the discord- ant noise made by tuning the instruments!" Venona, who had been absent, Lizzie thought, much longer than was necessary after the gui- tar, now returned; and, handieg her the in- strument, asked her to sing and play. The young lady, with that true gentility which scorns the mawkishness of unnecessary excuses and hesitations, took the guitar. and, after placing its strings in chord, sung to a pleasant accompaniment these words: "Oh! were I a bird, all lightly and free I would spread my glad wings over the sea; I'd play with the surge and skim o'er the foam, I would love the old ocean--make It my home- When weary at night I'd sink on its breast, And let its low murmurs lull me to rest! II. "And if in darkness a storm should arise, And enveloped be both the sea and the skies, Away I would fly to some flowery isle, And there would I tarry in safety the while, Till the clouds were gone by out of the sky, And the rainbow's arch shone brightly on high. - Ill. "No ocean too wide for the spread of my wing, No clime, whose praises I'd falter to sing, No bower, whose sweets I would not inhale, No beauty on earth I'd not strive to unveil, Not a blossom below or a star up above, That I'd not look at, and cherish, and love." N'othing could be more exquisitely rich and soft than the voice of Lizzie, when she sung this. song of her own composition, and Seawaif was not only delighted with it, but so expressed himnself, and begged her to continue. She, wishing to have the accomplishments of Venona, also, known and appreciated, now re- quested the latter to join her in a favorite duetto, which she did, and the young officer, who was passionately fond of music, was grati- fied to his leart's content. Hours thus flew unheeded by, and it was sunset cre they thought of returning to the house. After leaving the ladies in the drawing-room, the young commander thought of returning to his vessel, and inquired of a servant where the doctor was, Being told that the latter and the   ,baronet were still in the dining-room, and hear. ing a clatter of glasses and shouts of laugh-. ter in that direction, he went upon sound, aud opening the door, saw a sig!ht worthy thec sketchy pencil of a Hogarth, with a Levur t u describe it. The doctor and the baronet, both as " tighl' as men could be and keep their legs, were dancing around a pile of empty bottles, which proved their valor and capacity as bottlhe knights. The doctor had put his wig on top of the pyramid, and sans coat and vest, looked strangely thin and lean to hold so much liquid unaided by any process of evaporation-for ho was not fat enough to sweat. The baronet had also taken off his coat pand wig; and,'being in bulk the opposite of the doc- tor, he made a rare sight, the reader may rest assured. Thus leaping, the one like a wild Camanche, the othelr like a fat and fanatical Shaker, now reeling into each other's arms and embracing, then staggering off in" eccentrics," singing each a different song to a different tune, they were ending their carousal when tho young otficer entered.  . La Motte, who was not so far gone as the baronet, rather sobered down when Seawaif appeared; but Sir Humphrey, with a ," view halloo," rushed forward and seized him, shout- ing: "You're my prisoner, Sinclair-you're my prisoner; yield ye, and'ransom yourself over a fresh bottle. Come, no resistance-- me and the doctor have tucked away a dozen bot- tles, and are good for more yet-ain't we, doe- tor?" "If we can hold more; yes, sare, certiaine- ment. If not, I 'ave one leetel emetic which we can partake, zcn we can begin- again!" "  It is sunset, and we must go on board," said the captain, quietly, but firmly. "Ah! yes, certainement; I 'ave forget my patients. I must go to ze board of zo ' Tar. tare,' " said the doctor. "  Ong bottle before you go-one, just to give you an appetite to come again!" said the bar- onet. With great difficulty, the urgent solicitations of the baronet were evaded; and, at last, in thie dusk of the evening, Seawaif succeeded in excusing himself and the doctor, and went on board. Not, however, until he had promised to make his visits frequent at the house of the governor-a promise which hhe had fair reasons for intending to comply with. CHAPTER XXII. A few moments after the two officers last spoken of had gone on board of their vessel, Vcnona, who had gone as usual to coax her father to retire, to sleep away the effects of hits potations, returned from the consummnation of her objeot, and found Lizzie standing where   we first saw her, on the piazza, looking off toward the dark-hulled vessel, as she 'seenied to lie sleeping on theC still water of the' harbor. "Love's young dreamn-love'syoning dream!" she said, playfully, as she catne up behind the, pretty blonde, and kissed her white neck. '"Do you like the lieutenant as well upon a longer acquaintance as at first sight? Do you think- he will uwear well?"    / Again Lizzie's only answer was a sigh. "Has the dear clhild lost her tongue, as well a, her heart?" asked the bantering girl. "You can talk enough for both, dear Ve- none!" said Lizzie, with a quiet smile. "If H did not answer whatever question you asked, 'it was 'bedause I was so lost in thought that I did not understand you!" Lost in thought, sweet coz'? Ten to one, :., father says, I can tell of whom and what you wer6 thinking?" 'Well, tell ne!" "Well, you was thidcnking of this Arthur Sinclair?" "Right so far, fair tease; but what were the nature of my thoughts?" "You was thinking, Lizzie,' whether lie would give you his heart in exchange for yours!" "Wrong there, imy gentle lady I I feel as if I had somewhere met him before-I cannot chase away the thought-he does not seem like a stranger to ame!"  "Did you question him as to his where: froms and where-he-has beens?" "No-I feel so embnirAssed in his presence- there is such a strange fluttering about my heart when lie is talking to me, thatI -cannot think of anything! lie must deem me very stupid!" '"Anything but that coz, to judge front the compliments that lie paid you, and the rapt attention with which lie listened to your songs " "That was no more than any courteous gen- tleman would do, I am sure!" - "But Lieutenant Sinclair feels mole than every.' courteous gentleman' would-lie loves yol, coz!" "I)Do you really think he does, Venona?" a sked Lizzie, with a sigh. "Really and truly I do, fair coz ; but why slioiuld you look gloomy about that?" i" ecause, in candor, dear Venona, I bgin to fear that I love him; and yet a strramge prcsentimnent fills my heart that our love will me unfortunate! Even if he loves me, some- thing tells me that lie can never be may hus- band!"     ' "Pshaw, dear coz! Drive such foolih fan- cies from your mind-I sihall dance at your welding soon!" "You may weep at my. funeral sooner!" sighed Lizzie.' "You shall not talk such gloomy nonsense!" said Venona, affectionatcly, as she kissed the ;sadl girl. "Come, let us go up to my room and prac-   tice some music. If you will, when all is still to-night, I'll get cousin Torm, pa's secretary,' to row us off in thie harbor, and we will sere- nade your new beau! Tom can play upon the fluteadmirably, you canm touch the light guitar, and we Will sing him some of our sweetest songs! Do you not like the idea?" "If it plesses you, dear Veniona, yes!"  "Well, it shall be done. Go to your room. and I'll go and speak to Tonm. ,He is a good soul, and will do anything to please me, though I tease him sadly sonmetimes 1" CHAPTER XXIIL ' A moonlit night in a southern cliume is ever more beautiful than in the drearier regions of the north. The balny softness, the' pellucid clearness of the atmosphere, seem to brighten everything. And even when the moon has waned, if there' are no clouds to hide their 'faces froml. the flowery earth or mirroring waters, the stars send'down great floods of silvery light, and seem to glory in the absence of their queenly rival. Starry, cloudless, soft, and dreanmy, was the first night on which the "' Tyrannicide," under a' tyrant's flag and a tyrant's mask, lay in the little harbor of Bermnnuda. Warned to be upon the alert, her, treble anchor-watch were awake, while all of the regular watch slept on deck, with their we:n pons by their side, rmeady to IL, graspedat a morment's notice. Below, watch- ful sentinels were guarding those who, like chained beasts, groaned for the power to rend their captors. Young Morley, lulled by the sighing breeze which made the rigging its harp-strings.; the gentle waters, which tinkled a silvery syrm- phiony, and thie almost quiet of all arouiid fhim, though not sleeping, was dreaming dreanms of fairy-land. Suddenly asn old tar, with a weaselish eye, who stood hear hIim, touched his shouller, and pointed to a smnall boat, which seemed to he creeping noiselessly tow'ard the vessel; that 9 there were three persons only in it, lie coull easily discern; also that two of them   r-ware dressed in the kind of apparel usually worn by females. What their errand was' atthat nid'. night hour was beyond his knowledge ; hut re- solving to speedily know, he was about to hail the boat, or rather its crew, when thm low , soft wail of a flute arost so sweetly on time still air, that lihe almost held' his breath to listen. Ris- ing, falling, like the voices of the spirits of the air, all full of melting harmony, the liqnid notes rolled over the water. Nondbut a nnias-t, of the art which "soothea the savage," and readers man one-binlf divine, could make maIh1 music. -The crew, like their' officer, listeied as if spell-bound. No wonder that we read of old  &#xD;<pb n="32-33 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6983-00000017"/> l w\v syr ns charned poor mariners from their course -- als! woe'A mec, they've done it in imore modern days than those f Suddllely the prelude of the flute was hushed, anil two delicious female voices, alto and sopra- no, sung these words: "Slumber sweetly-slumber while you may; The calm will not exist alway- The storm that sleeps may soon awake- The spell that binds, an hour may break.

Voung Morley, whose soul was full of music and po(-try, seemed inspired, tand in a voice rich with manly harmony, he improvised and sang this reply: " ho can slumber, who can slumber When the angels are awake?

Seawaif, still only known to her as Arthur Sinclair, was seated with Lizzie Egerton, andi while he held her hand in his, hl e was )our:;g- out the torrent of his new-born love in a gush- ing fountain of words. And lil:e the music ,f sweet waters falling uponD the ear of a thilsty traveler, those words; carhe to herl, and she drank them in, ' Lady, sweet lady," sail he, " this clnfe.- sion of feelings. which I cannot restlrain, hlas been altogether unDremeditated-lhad I let rsa- son, rather than feeling p'rop;I)t me. the words which I have uttcred had .et; )been mlsaid- for I know not but that youl wiil scorn, loathh, hate me!" "Hate you? Oh, never, never!"' she said, while blushes came all over her face like sun- light on a bed of roses. And  she did not offer to take from her the hand which he so warm- ly pressed. "I am not what I seem, lady," said he, ab- ruptly. 'I cannot decive you-I am an American!" "And false to your country, which is strug-- gling for freedom?" she askcl, while she nla.,L.-. and offer to withdraw her hand from his. "No, lady--no!" he replied, loudly. - ':v, n if the confession should endanger ry li. o-r  lose what is dearer still, the hope of your hIos l, --I will not deny it.

I must soon sail-may I go with  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6983-00000018"/> the knowledge that I am not unloved by you, and the hope that at a more auspicious day 1 can claim the hand which I hold?"- "You can!" said Lizzie, gently, but firmly. One kiss, pure as it was fond, given and re- ceived, sealed that promise, and perhaps more would have been added, had notMr. Morley been seen advancing with Venona leaning upon his arm in a most confiding; if not in an affec- tionate manner. In a few moments they had reached the bower, where they were about to sit down, when the governor approached, and, speaking to Seawaif, said: ". The look-out reports a sail in the offing, lieutenant--he says she looks like a large ship- of-war under jury masts!" "I must look for m-stelf-this port is rather near the Yankee coast-excuse Mr. Bevrley and myself, ladies," said the officer addressed  and accompanied by the governor and Morley, he walked away. Beverley is nothiis name!" said Venona, abstractedly. o"He has deceived me-he is a rebel, and yet how I loive him!" "Be cautious, then, how you betray his se- crets," said Lizzie, as she gently passed her arm around Venona's waist. "Do you know that the 'Tartar' is not the 'Tartar?' That both of our lovers are Amer- icans?" asked Venona. "Yes, and glory in it!" replied Liszie. "They are far more northy of our love, be- cause they dare to resist wrong and oppose tyranny.'"  .  Venona said no   more, but threw herself upon the bosom of her friend, and wept tears of Joy. CHAPTER XXV. Seawanif and Morley, after visiting the look- out tower upon the roof of the governor's house, and tal-ing a long look at the vessel which had been reported, made their exceises to Sir Humphrey, and as quickly as they could do it without exciting notice by thenl haste, started for their vessel. "Did you recognize the ship outside, sir?" asked the younger officer. "I think she is the ship wlieh we engaged off Nantucket. Her foremast is gone, only a topmast in its 'place for a jury mast; 'her other spars have suffered probably in the gale which troubled us, and being further out, she has been longer getting in!" replied Seawaif. "The same idea struck ne, sir, the moment that I looked at her. Will there not be danger that her officers will recognize our vessel?" "It is possible, and we must be ready to act upon any emergency that occurs. She is now too near the mouth of the harbor for us to run out without- oming under her guns, ,       ^* !   and so heavy a battery as hers would speedily s ink us, if the suspicions of her officers once I aroused should subside into a certainty. We must brazen the matter out to the best of our ability, and be ready to fight or run, as neces- sity or prudence dictates. Of one thing I am very glad-we are completely refitted, and are ready for sea at a moment's notice!" ' Thatm is so, sir!" said the officer, with a sigh. You sigahbecause you will have to leave the beautiful Venonal?" said Seawaif, with a smile. "I confess it, sir; but I shall not be soli- tary in my regrets!" said Morley, with an arch look at hle companion. "That is true-but this war will not last for- ever. When our country has gained her inde- pendence, we will probably find an opportuni- ty to lose our own!" The officers having now arrived at the land- ing, were met by the boat for which the had signaled, and soon were on board of their ves- sel. There, quietly, without iany action which would betoken an intention to get underway, which could be noticed from shore, every pre- paration was made to slip the cable at a mor ment's notice. The sails had been furled with slippinn gaskete which in an instant could lhe cast adrift, without even sending a man aloft. With a proper breeze, the schooner 'could have been got underway and linder fill 'sail in less than three minutes. Her guns, also, had been double-shotted from the time whelu the salute had been fired; and she was ready at any time for an immediate and desperate defence. The moment that Seawaif got on board, he took his glass, and kept it fixed upon the ap-  preaching ship, which was now slowly coming mn through the narrow and crookZcd ehanel made by the coral reefs which gmuirdcd the harbor. "There is the old friend that you peppered off Nantucket, Mr. Brownell!" said the younq  captain to his gunner, as the dismastel ship advanced. "So I see, sir!"' replied the gunner. "I should like to have a half-dozen craclks at her in this smooth water-I'd put her out of the way of propelling; even under jur vrasts ." "Doubtless, if she had not a cfhae of throwing twenty shots to our one.. We are not out of her range, now!" The crew of the." Tyrannicide" were all on deck now, looking at the huge fifty-gun shij that approached, and occasionally glancinig at the face of their captain, to see if he felt more secure in his disguise than they did. But, as ever, even in the 'hour of darkest peril, he was so calm, quiet, and confident in his look, that no new fears arose in their breasts. If he, who knew so much, saw no cause of alarm, why should they, more igno- rant, find reason for fear?  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6983-00000019"/> In a short time, the British ship stood along close under the stern of the schooner, and there, taking in all sail except the eplanker and buiizzen top-sail, put her helm hard-a-lee, and luffing to itli. win]d, brought up for anchorage. ceawaif had for soine tilme observed that the attention of scveral officers oil board of the EnzliMh vessel was very nmuch devoted to his schooner, and he expected-in truth, rather wished-to be hailed fron  the ship as she passed hin. But he was not; and, to speak truiv, lie did not feel perfectly easy when she anchored within listol-shot of him, having a lbroad.-ide of twenty-five guns bearing directly uponi him. But lie did not allow his face to express the least sign of apprehension, and wheln thei In'n w-re furling sails on board of the other sMhip, seemed to look at their work with an eye only professional, and as calm ah a breeze- less sea. CHAPTER XXVI. When 11. II M B  ship "Bristol" first sighted th. harbor of lermuda and t lie vessels thereiin, Captain Morris, sv-gla,-s in haut1, took hirs po- sition fo'rward. to "-see how the laind lay," and to reconnoitre. His eye had not long rested upon thie rakish-looking schooner, which now, all right below and aloft, ltv at her single an- chor, when he called an officer to his tiefl, who had been with him in in the boat expedition started off Nantucket, and handing him the glass. asked him to look at the schooner, and say if he had ever seen anything like her be- fore. "The officer, after a long, steady look, re- plied : "She is under English colors, but she is American built!" "That is not what I asked you!" said Cap- tain Morris. "Have vot evcr seen a vessel that looked like her before?" "Yes, sir!" said the officer after another steady look at her. "The craft that engaged us it Nantucket was aliout the same in size and build-looked like her in rig!" "I believe it is her," said Morris. 'Can sonmeic of our cruisers have been so lucky as to take her already?" "Of course, or how else should she be here, and under our flag! I would have given a year'. pay to have taken it myself!" She doesn't look as it she had suffered any in action--every spar is in its place, and she looks as neat below and aloft as if she'd just been launched and rigged," said the officer. 'All hands" were now called on board the "Bristol," to make ready for working ship and coming to an anchor, and the men and officers to)ok their stations for the purpose; while the captain walked aft to his proper place on the quarter-deck. In a short time, as stated in the foregoing   chapter, the ship came to, and her sails were furled. As soon as this was done, a boat was lowered, and a inidshipnman dispatched with the compli- itints of Capt. Morris, to ascertain when and where tcevessel had been taken. When the young officer boarded the schoon- er, lie found Seawaif, alias Sinclair, in his full dress and elegant unifprin, on the'point of get- tting into his gig to be rowed on shore; for the latter wished to defer, as long as he could, an interview with the British commander - hoping to avoid an cclaircissevicnt until night- fall, when, with a little aid from Bonne Fortune, lih mighl slip out of danger. "What does Captain Morris mean by askin  such a question? Is he crazy or drunk?" asked Seawaif, with well-assumed ianger. "Tell him this is his Brittanic Majesty's Schooner (Tar- tar,' Lieut. Arthur Sinclair commanding; an d that after I have fulfilled an engagement to dine with the governor on shore, I shall take occasion to visit him, and ask the n, an- ing of such questions. Tell him that, if he nitiis thcnt for a joke, I think such jokes deuced impertinent, and know how to resent them!" Thus saying, he flung himself angrily into his boat, and was rowed to the shore, having previously given Morley orders how to act; and lhow, without attracting attention, to sig- niLlize himn at every emergency. When. the midshipman returned and re- poited to Captain Morris, the latter, for a mo- ment, looked completely nonplussed. The ' Tartar?' " said lie. "Bring inme the Rlegister!" It was done ; and after a glance at it, he saiid  "The ' Tartar' is on the East India station!" "The officer of the deck on board of the schooner-her first lieutenant I believe-,aid they were just fromt the East India station, sir!" said the midshipman. "But the ' Tartar' is down here as built in Portsmnuth," said Captain Morris, " and if that, craft there isn't Yankee built, I'm a monkey  Why the deuce don't her commander come on board to report to me, himself?" "Ie said he was going to dine with the governor, sir!" meekly responded the middy. "Curse the governor and lhim too," said the captain--just as a pale, slender individual, dressed in citizen's dress, stepped on board and tadvanced to him. "Who are you?" he added, to the latter person. "The secretary of Sir Humphrey Dorset, whom you were just cursing," said " cousin Tom," very quietly. "Do you know what schooner that, is?" asked the captain, subsiding a little. "Yes, sir-the ' Tartar,' she has been here these two weeks, refitting!" "' What vessel brought her in?" "N None-her commander came in without any company!" "There is a mystery Lere, and by the' gods   of war, I'll unravel it!" said Morris, bitterly. - hlave all hands called!" le added to in offi- cer. "Now, sir, what do you want?" he asked of the secretary, not in a very amiable tone. "'The governor sent me on board to ask what vessel this was, and what niews you had'; but if I am to be treated as if I was a black. guard instead of a gentleitman, I'll let hinm do his own errands," said " cousin Tom," indig- aantly; and turning on his heel, lie went over the side to his boat, and ordered the crew to pull him on shore. "I  the; Fates! thngs are cominitg to a pretty pass, when a captain in the British Navy must be snubbed by the beggarly secre- tary of a. Hampshire baronet " itmuttered the captaini, as he saw the young man leave. "The crew are mustered, sir,"' said his ex- ecutive officer, at this moment. "Very well, sir," replied the captain. "Is there any minan or officer on board of this ship," he continued, " who has ever served on board of a vessel which I find named in the Register as the schooner 'Tartar?' " "I never sailed aboard of her, your honor," said an old seaman, coming forward, holding hiis hat in one hand and tugging at a fore-lock of his hair with the other. "But I seed her launched, and helped to rig her!"' "Does that craft look like her?" asked the captain, pointing to the "Tyrannicidee." The old seaman turned the quid in his checek, looked steadily at the schooner while hetsettled his hat on his head again, then tf'ter hitching up his trousers, said: "( She's the same rig, sir-about the same size and nunber o' barkers-but she's a great deal sharper in the hull fore and aft thian the 'Tartar' I knew!" "That will do! You can turn the hands down again. Have a constant eye kept on that schooner, and if she, offers to move from her anchor without my permission, sink her on the instant," said he to his first' officer. "(I will go ont board of her myself, and see if I cannot unravel this mystery." The gunner of the ship. now approached him; "Mr. Swab," said Captain Morris, "do you recognize that craft?" "If she hasn't a couple of holes through her fore, and main-sails that I pitched iron through thie other day when we we're off Nan- tiucket, I don't, sir," said the gunner. "That is a fact--we did make daylight through her canvas. I'll soon see if she hasn't got our mark," said the captain, ordering his gig to be manned. CHAPTER XXVI. When Morley saw the captain of the British ship, whom he recognized to be such by his nuiform, coming toward the schooner,. he had   the side-b'oys at the gangiway and acut-cdtA' there himself in true inanl-o'-war's-man's style, and received' Captain Morris at the gangway as formally and politely as any other otficer could have done. "My name is Morris-captain in His Brit- tanic Majesty's navy," said the former, very. stiffly, as he stood oni the deck of the schooner. "Captain Morris is very' welcome on board of the"Tartar.' I am Lieutenant Beverley, at his service," said Morley, bowing. "Perniit me, in the absence of Lieutenant Commanding Sinclair, to invite you into tIhe cabin, to take a glass of wine, sir?" The young officer did the honors so coolly, that Morris was more 'than ever bothered. "When were you off Nantucket shoals last?" lie asked, abruptly. "Our course from the East Indies brought us a long ways to the southward of the lati- tude you mention!" said Mr. Morley, quietly. "You have very heavy lower-niasts I I should like to see the spread of canvas in your fore and mainsails ; will you loosen them, if you please?" asked the cunning commander, thinking, without a doubt, that he had the proof'he wanted-now at .hand. "Certainly, sir!" said Morley, giving the necessary orders. "New canvass!" said Morris, with a disap- Ipointed air, as the foresail was loosened fronm its brails and furling-line, and the mainsail hoisted. "Yes, sir.' Our old ones were blown away in a hurricane, just before we made port." "Blown clear awy--didn't you save the canvas, sir?" asked Morris, still in hopes of seeing the convicting shot-holes. "Not a, yard, sir; it' was a terrible blow! But you forget the wine, sir; we have some very fine-we got it on our way'out." The British officer was nonplussed, but far front satisfied. He- felt certain that the schooner was sailing under false colors ; bhut lie meant to act with circumspection, and secure proof of it before he adopted ultimate measures- Therefore he went into the cabin and took a glass of wine in a courteous manner,-but asked no more questions fronm Morley, who was so perfectly on his guard and composed, that he saw a cross-examination would not affect him. "Your commanding officer has gone on shore, I understand?" said he. "Yes, sir-to dine with the governor." "Although. self-invited, on the strength of a slight acquaintance with Sir Humphrey Dor- set, I believe I will do the same," said Captain Morris; and, politely bowing to Morley, he again entered his boat, which he steered toward the landing. "It is evident that he suspects us 1" mut- tered Morley, as he watched the receding boat., "I wish we were out of this scrape '" The doctor, who had been engaged in some-- thing or other in his statc-room, now came oen deck.  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6983-00000020"/> "What would you think, doctor, if that ship should open her batteries on us as we lie?" asked the young officer, while lie pointed to the "Bristol." "I should imagine zat very soon I should 'ave plenty of ze amputat!" said the doctor, as lie took a pinch of snuff, and shrugged up his shoulders. "She'd sink us efore you could take a leg off!" said Morley, quietly. " Al! ha! You sink zat? I can take off a leg so quick as you vink your eye? But pardon, Messicur Morley, I 'ave ze desire for one boat. I am to dine wiz ze governare." !"The ;captain begged me to say that he would make your excuses to the governor, as we might expect to sail at a moment's notice." "Ah, mon Dieu! What will ze governare do for somebody to get intoxicate wiz?" sighed the doctor, and he retired to the cabin to seek consolation for himself in a solitary glass of eau de vie. CHAPTER XXVIII. "Ah, my dear Sinclair, I am delighted to see you back so soon I You come to dine, of course?" said Sir Humphrey, when Seawaif rejoined him.        o "Yes, Sir Humphrey. Your invitations are so kind, that I find it impossible to refuse them." "Al, tank ye, thank ye, my boy I Excuse my familiarity, but, d'ye see, I've got almost to feeling as if you were one of my own family. 'Perhaps you may be yet--eh? The Egertons are our cousins, you know. Ha! ha! let's drink to Lizzie, the blossom! You can't re- fuse that toast, I know!" "I have no desire to, I assure you!" said Seawaif, laughing, and accepting the eccentric baronet's invitation. "By the way, where is the doctor-the glorious doctor '" said Sir Humphrey. "Unwell-he begs to be excused to-day. You've been rather too hospitable to him, Sir Humphrey. There are few who can sail in your company and carry so much canvas- spiritually speaking I' "I thought he'd have a hard head if he could keep up with me in the long run, though he made a fair start-a very fair start!" said the baronet, delighted at the thought that his head wasi the strongestjet, though the doctor had apparently come off conqueror at each and every bout of the bottle. "By the way, I forgot to ask what ship that was which came in Y I sent my secretary to learn, and I see he is coming back." "It is the ship 'Bristol,' one Morris corn- manting ; and to judge from the question she   bade an officer ask me, he must be either a fool or a madman!" 'said Seawaif. "Morris-yes, a milk-sop, I kno. him-he can't stand Ios second bottle. Sir Peter Parker wants Lizzie to marry him, but she hates him worse than poison! So do I!" "Aid I, if he is after her," mentally ejacu- lated our hero. "What's the matter, Tom? You look as red in the face as if you'd been at your second bottle!" said the governor to his secretary, who, flushed with anger, and half breathless with haste, approached. "Matter enough,-Sir Ilumphrev; when a saltwater pig, beg your pardon, Mr. Sinclair, I didn't vcan you, sir, or the like of you-tad enough, sir, when a duff-fed lout da(res to cure you, and insult your messenger!" "Who dared to curse me, Tonm-who dared to curse me?" "Wlhy, Captain Morris, of the.' Bristol,' sir." "Hie did-did helie? Then curse me, myself, if I don't make him answer for it! He'll want to refit, provision, or something else-want to see Miss Egerton ; but hang me if he shall! Go and walk witls her, Sinclair, hang me if you shan't marry her while he is here, just to spite him! I'll make it right with Sir Peter after- ward-she's my cousin, and I'll give her away I'm not going to be cursed for nothing, By any he that sails, if lie does wear a pair of epaulets! I'll call him out-but I'll wait till after dinner!"' "There he is in his boat, leaving his ship now, sir!" said the secretary. "Yes, and going on board of my schooner!" said Seawaif, watching affairs now with eager interest. He smiled when he saw the fore-and- aft sails loosened for inspection; for intuitively he understood the reason, and could imagine the curious captain's disappointment when he looked at the new canvas. He did not, however, feel perfectly easy un- til he saw Morley bow the captain to the side, and saw the latter pulling toward tlue bore. ' The polite and amiable individual is going to pay you a visit, Sir Hiumphrey!" said Sea- waif, with a smile. ," Perhaps he'll invite him- self to dine with you!" "If lie crosses his legs under myI mahogany, I'll give him leave to curse me from now till doomsday!" said the choleric Baronet. "But go you, my dear boy, and see Lizzie! It is her he comes to see, not me ; and blow me into a bubble if he shall see her.! I'll send him aboard of his ship with a flea in his ear!" Seawaif, who had no desire to meet Morris either then or at any time. without le could do it fairly, and on blue water, very willingly obeyed the Baronet's suggestion, and went to join the ladies in the garden.   CHAPTER XXIX. "You are in danger,. are you not? Sus- pected at least?" said Lizzie, anxiously, as Sea- waif approached the' spot where she and Ven- ouna were standing. "Suspected, but not known,!" he replied, quietly. "The only danger that I fear is, that I shall, all too soon, be obliged to leave society which has become very dear to me!" "If it will only insure yoar safety, I care not for thie separation, for it will only be tempor- a-y!" said Lizzie, earnestly. ",If the nation- ality of your vessel should be discovered, she would be taken, and your own life would be in peril " "She shall not be taken. I have a favor to abk of you;'ladies. Aid me in some way to keep this captain on shore and occupied as long as possible, for lihe docs suspect me to be what lam, the very oine who crippled his ship; and if le can fasten the matter on me, it will b' e a hard matter for me to get my vessel out from under his guns. But if I can keep him Iquiet, so that he sends no- orders off to his vessel' before night, with the aid of darkness, I hope to slip away from him!" "That we can surely do, else woman's wit passes on false reputation, and is too highly rated!" said Venona. "But wlhat is the Ship, andwiho the officer whom Iasee with my father? The latter seems to be very mad about some- thing!" "'The ship is the ' Bristol,' of Sir Peter Par- ker's squadron!" said Seawaif. "What! my uncle arrived?" asked Lizzie, turning pale. "No. Sir Peter has changed his flag to an- other ship, I presume ; but Captain Morris is in command, and would be likely to show inme few favors -indeed, if he knew the state of my mind toward you, sweet lady.' "He ,can and must be managed; how, I know not-but it t must be done," said Lizzie, thoughtfully. "Venona, do you go and keep him in check, if you can, until I can get nmy wits to work. If your father is quarreling with him, get them reconciled, and over a bot- tle of wine, if you can; and then join us again." The warm-hearted daughter of the governor hastened to perform the duty allotted to her; while Seawaif and Lizzie passed on to a place more secluded from observation, where, unin- terrupted, they could lay out a plan of opera- tions. While they are thus engaged, we will return to the governor. "My dear Sir Humphrey, how do you do, sir?' exclaimed Captain Morris, as he' ap- proached the baronet, who, with his face red- der than ever, and his frame quivering with anger, stood where Seawaif hadleft him. "Very ' dear'!--very 'dear,' when a man   that has no Sir to his name new, nor ever will have, can insult rme one minute, and then comec and fiawn around me; like a 'hungry dog, the next! I s'pose you smell dinner, sir--lyes, dinner, esir I If you do, smelling is as near as you'll get to it, sir! If it isn't, yon my? cunrse me, sir--me, Sir llujiphrey Dorset, Governor of Bermuda, and cousin to the Ilonorable 'Misez Lizzie Egerton!"' The baronet pauscd here. He could not help it, for he was utterly out of breath. - HlI lie not been, the startled captain would have heard more before he could have shoved a; de- fensive word in edgeways. "I perceive, Sir- Humphrey," said he, in :::. apologetic tone, " that your seereliry has uo- ported language used by me in i hasty fit of the tantrunms, which-" "Yes, sir-yes, sir, he has told nie that ynis; dared, before all your crew and officers, to curse me, sir-me, the Governor of Bermu- da!" cried the' baronet, recovering his breath, while his anger lost no ground. "' Clrse you,' sir, for a little while, and see how you like it! If you don't-you wear a sword, and so do I l Do you understand that, sir-do you under-' stand that?" "Please to be calm, and undes tand me, Sir Humphrey," said the captain, with unwonted patience.' "I tell you that when I made the expression which gives you offence, I was an.. noyed by outside matters, and spoke without either thoughit or the intent to insult'you per-' sonally or officially. Fearing -that my Words might be ,ither misconstrued or exaggeratfed, I hastened hither, to explain and to apologize." "You had no business to curse me!" '  ' "I grant it," said Captain Morris. "I ami an old man, sir; old enough to be your father, sir!" "True, my dear sir," mildly acknowledged the captain. "But I'can 'fiht, sir-fight yeo, for all that; and curse me if I'll be curred withfl impu- nity!" "Sir, again I offer you my humble apolo- gies."  - "Which you must accept, my dear father," said Venona, coming nmost opportunely to the captain's aid. "Tut, tut, girl'; go away from here. Don't you see I'm mad-mad as I can be?v "Not with me, fathler; not with me :" And Venona put her round, soft arm over one of his shoulders, and with the other hand stroked his chin, as'one would the mane of a restive horse, while she kissed his red face two or three times: "Come now, that's a dear, good father- accept the captain's apologies for whatever offence he has committed-I am sure 'he mean none.., Be friendly with hinm, and settle your differences over a bottle of wine-; do, tha t's a sweet, amiable papa! Cousin Torn, please tell the butler to send a couple of bottles o f  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6983-00000021"/> father'es eihoic down to the bower by the sea- wall, with three glasses. Hurry, coz, for we'll have a nice little make-up party!" The baronet tried in vain to remain wrathy. A smile stole out upon his wrathiful counte- nance, like tihe glinam of a rainbow on the face of a departing storm-cloud ; and resting his great fat hand on her whitek neck, he said: - Well, blossom, it shall be as you say! If Captain Morris will take a glass of wine, and not curse me any more, I'll let the matter drop!" (- A thousand thanks, fair lady, for coming to my rescue!" said the captain, who could not hut offer the laly his arm, as she pointed ,o the arbor by the sea-wall, and saidi: "Let i s go, and wait for the wine!" CHAPITERI XXX. It is about as impossible to keep the eye of a reader, perusing a story like this, upon all our characters at once, as it is for a sehool- ma'am to see what each one of fifty scholars is doing-and that she can't do, witlhout she is cross-eyed and cross-grained; and 'tis a doubt- ful matter then. But we can run away from our friends at Bermuda a little while, to see those whom we 1-ft at Salcm ; for I can scarcely believe thait even Lizzie Egerton or sweet Venona can cause fair Kate Cringle to be utterly forgotten by our readers. 'When Mr. Doolittle arrived safely in 'Salem harbor with his prize-when a rousing salute was thundered out from the guns of a captured sloop-of-war, taken in fair fight-- boarded and captured by their own gallant townsmen, tlhe people of that ancient 'towi almost went maid with pride and joy. A few tiere were 'who had to mourn for the loss of loved ones ; but the sun of victory brightened even the cloud of their sorrow. The news, spreading like light everywhere, nvoe gladness to the hearts of all the patriotic, and dashed cold water upon the hopes of the dastards who still sided with the king and his  if course, more than all others, did Mr. ringle r.'oice. Not alone that the capture atldeI to his wealth and importance among his fellow-citizens, but because it gave strength to the cause of his country, weakened her ene- mies, encouraged her friends. And he was proud of his vessel, doubly proud of Seawaif, whom he began to look upon as a son; for, with a father's penetrating eve, he had detected the at- tachment of his daughter for the brave young captain; and he never, for an instant, could have been made to think that any one, loved by Kate, could fail to return her affection-for of all things upon earth, he deemed- her the most lovable. And to him she was. Like a precious angel-   gift from heaven, she had been given to-him in the spring-time of his wedded life-when grim Death came, and took away the loved ]artner of his heart, the child was left to cheer and comfort him; and she had so grown up and into his heart, that she seemed an in- tegral and vital part of himself-a part which it would be death to lose. "I want you to send Mr. Doolittle' up to me, father!" said Kate, after her father had announced the arrival of the prize. "l. want, to hear from his own lips how Edward took his vessel into action-how lie fought-hov lie won the victory. Oh! how I wish I was a man!" "No, you don't, girl ; no, you don't!" snai. Mr. Cringle, with a sly wink. "Men don't marry men, and you'd die if you thought you wasn't to have ,Ihi,!" "I But I'd like to be able to fight by his side!" continued Kate, with a blush. "Oh! it'll be time enough for ymc to talk of fighting by his side after the country is free, and hpeace is declared. You'll fight then -tongue-battles, seasoned with kisses There -there, don't talk back, darling! I'll send that slab-sided first mate up to talk to you. But you must call him captain now-lie has grown nearly out of his boots with importance, since be ihas been inll carge of tihe man-of-war!" Kate smiled, and kissed her father, who, after tapping her cheek gently with his great brown hand, said B: less you, beauty---less you!' and then went down into his store, where Mr. Doolittle was telling all about the capture, for probably the fiftieth time, to a listening and wondering audience. "Daughter Kate wants to see you up-stairs. Captain Doolittle!" said the old merchant, as he entered the store. "To see mr, sir?" said the tickled officer, who, though he had often cast a wistful eye toward the beautiful heiress of the richest man in Salem, had never even had a chance- to speak to her, and now hardly believed - his ears when lie heheard that she wished to see himn- "Yes, she wants to see you!" said the mer- chant. "I reckon I'd better go and git shaved nand fixed up first!" said lie, instantly-thinking that the better his personal appearance was, the more favorable would be his reception. "You look well enough now, and hadn't better keep her waiting-she wants to ask you about the captain, I reckon!" said Mr. Crin- gle. Ol, is that a//ll?" said Mr. Doolittle, whose look of premature oy and imnportance percep- tibly altered with the last piece of information. But, nevertheless, lie went to the little cor- ner of the store where a tin wash-basin, a look- ing-glass, crash-towel, and a comb of horn, fastened to a nail by a long string,.invited anv improvement in his toilet; and there he occu- pied several minutes in washing and in comb.-   ing down his long, yellowish hair, which had "a way of its own," which the comb could with difficulty coax out of it. Having, however, arranged it to his satisfac- tion, and given his shirt-collar an extra pull upward, Mr. Doolittle smiled pleasantly at him- self in the glass, as if to say--"You'll do now, sir"-and, went up the back pair of stairs, to- ward which Mr. Cringle had pointed him'when he delivered his message. CHAPTER XXXI. When Mr. Doolittle left the looking-glass, he felt as bold as a lion--by the time he reached the head of the stairs, he began to feel a little more like a lamb;, and when, after knocking at' the sitting-room door,-he heard the sweet voice of Kate say: "Come in " he felt more lamb-like still; and when he did go in, and saw her in the blaze of 'her beauty and a French gingham dress, he felt as sheepish as could be. Twirling his hat in his hands, as if he didn't know what else to do with themn, and blushing as if he had been caught doing something wrong, he stood and stammered: "Your father .said as how you wanted me for somnetin', mnarm!" "Yes, Captain Doolittle!" said Kate, not forgetting her father's instructions, in regard to his title. "T ake a seat, sir, if you please!'! Dropping his hat. and then picking it up, and still blushing, the officer sidled up to the chair, which she had placed near her own, and lifting it, up first, as if to see if it was strong enough to hold his weight, suddenly placed it under him, and sat -down quickly, as if he was afraid some one would jerk it iromn under him. Then lie bent over, and put his hint under it, as if to preserve it from harm, by hover- ing" it as a hen would a pet. chicken. Kate could hardly repress a smile as she noticed his blushes and nervous agitation; but she was a well-bred girl, and did not wish to make him  more confused than hie was, lest hi2 should be utterly unable to answer her questions. "How did you leave Captain Seawaif, sir?" she asked. "Oh! he was all right, marm-as stiff as a billy-goat in a gale o' wind-that is, marm, he was well, I thank you!" "Did he get hurt any in the battle?" "Yes, manrm-nor marm-that is; I mean, I believe hie didn't get hurt mfuch, but I seen where a bordin' pike tore a hole in his trow- sers!" Kate could hardly help laughing, and Mr. Doolittle became more confused than ever, when he noticed the mischievous light of her really beautiful eyes. "You must have fought very bravely to have captured so large a vessel, with even   more men than you had yourselves!" said Kate. "I swan to gracious, we did, marm! We slew 'em right and left, like Sampson did the Philistines.- We give 'em Hail Columby from the start! They didn't know which cend they stood on, ionme of'em!"' "When they cried for mercy, you spared them, did you not?" "Yes, after we got over bein' mad so we could hear 'em!" "That was right. Mercy always goes in the tracks of valor!" said Iate. "I suppose, Captain Doolittle, that you will soon, rejoin your vessel!" "The L'brd only knows where she is now, marm!" said the officer. "I s'pose I'll have to wait till he comes in, or I know where to go to meet him!" "And time must hang heavy on your hands in this dull place, after being engaged in such active scenes as you have!" "It wouldn't, mnarm, if you'd let me conic to see you, and tallk to you!" said Mr. Dooe. little, with a desperate courage, which made him blush and tremble more than ever. "I shall be very glad to see you often while you are in port!" said Kate, with a quiet smile. "Any friend of my father's is welcome here, especially if he is at brave man, and loves his country!" "It's eniough to. make any man brave,-to hear you talk!" said Mr..Doolittle, gathering courage, and actually hitchi'ng his chair a foot or more nearer to the lady. CHAPTER XXXII. "4 Did I not see Miss Egerton in your com- pany, a short time since, Miss Dorset?" asked Caplain Morris, after he had gallantly drank her health in the reconciliation glass for which she had sent. "Of course-Lizzie and my blossom always hunt in couples," said Sir Humphrey. "How did you leave Sir Peter?" "He was well. I have a lettei' for Miss Egerton fi'om him," said the officer-not liking to have received his answer from the father instead of the daughter. "Venona can take it to her-can't you blos-  som, while the captain and me empty 'the bottle?" said the baronet. Inwardly cursing the old gentleman's offi- ciousness, the captain said: "t There is no need of haste in its delivery. Merely a friendly letter, I presume-for he had no news to send." "( Nothing about the progress of the war?" asked Yenona, who noticed, and was secretly delighted at the uneasiness of the captain. "'Nothing. The rebels will soon be starved out. They are a miserable, cowardly set--. a half naked and half armed!"  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6983-00000022"/> "Yet, for half-armed men, they did a great deal of damage at Bunker's Hill," said Venona, sarcastically, in reply to the contemptuous re- mark made by the captain. The captain bit his lip, and was about to make a reply which, judging from his looks, would not have been very amiable, when two more persons entered upon the scene--the lady leaning, in the most friendly and confiding manner, upon the gentleman's arm. The eyes of Captain Morris fairly flashed with anger and jealousy, for his suit to Miss Egerton had already been openly made, under the sanction of her uncle and guardian, Sir Peter Parker; and whether she favored it or not, he felt that he had a right to pay her sole attention. "Iow do you do, Captain Morris?" said Lizzie, with cool courtesy. "Allow nie to introduce to you my particular friend, Lieu- tenant Sinclair." "I shiall be glad to make Lieutenant Sin- clair's moat intimate acquaintance, very short- ly!" said Captain Morris, with emphasis, and bowing haughtily; "but at present, I must ask a private interview with Misa Egerton. I have a letter from her uncle for her." "Miss Egerton can receive all letters or communications from her uncle in the presence of her friends, and knows no necessity for granting a private interview with Captain Morris, for that or any other purpose!" said Lizzie, calmly, ironically, yet so gently in tone, tlhat but for a, slight deepening of her color and a brighter light in her eye, no one could have deemed her to be as she was-very angry. , The captain, however, lihad not such a com- mand over his looks or temper, for his face flushed and his hands trembledas he produced the letter; and, handing it to Lizzie, said: "After the perusal of Sir Peter's letter, Miss Egepton may alter her mind!" Lizzie very quietly opened the letter, and, as she read it, a smile passed over her face, and she said: "It, appears that your ship has received some damage from the enemy!" ' Why, you said, there was no. news, Captain Morris!" said Venona, sarcastically. 1"None worth reporting. A cowardly Yan- kee schooner pitched a couple of shot into our foremast, whieh disabled it, and then, when we were going to attack her with the boats of the squadron, she made sail, and ran away through some intricate passages among islands, where we could not follow her." As the captain spoke, he kept his eyes fixed upon the face of Seawaif,. hoping there to de- tect proof that his suspicions were correct. But there was not the least sign of, agitation, or even a look of surprise upon that face. "The Yankees could not have been very cowardly, to have attacked a fifty-gun ship in the presence of a large fleet, with a schooner ; or anything else but prudent, in evading the   attack of the boats of the whole squadron V!" said Lizzie, with a smile. "i I am not used to argument with ladies in such matters. Myself and Mr. Sinclair, prob- ably, could understand each other better--es- pecially as he commands a schooner which is very Yankee in her build!" said Morris, spite- fully. "I am always ready to converse on nautical matters, or any other that concerns gentlemen. only, at a proper time and in a proper place!" said Seawaif, very calmly, while he firmly looked Morris in the eye. "My uncle informs me that a transport will be here, on her way to England, in about two months, by which, unless I accept a certain contingency, he desires that I will return to his estate in England, near Yarmouth," said Lizzie, with her eyes upon the letter. "And perhaps the necessity to discuss the contingency to which your uncle alludes will cause you to grant the private interview which you just declined," said Captain Morris, in a tone almost as sarcastic as hers had been. "There being no necessity to diseuss the contingency, which I unhesitatingly and for- ever decline, there will be no cause for me to grant any interview, unless in the presence of my friends!" said Lizzie, haughtily. "And," she added, "' if Captain Morris desires it, I will name the contingency which my rather too imperative uncle has spoken of!" Morris blushed scarlet, but remained silent. "My uncle, presuming upon rather too ex- tensive powers, granted to him in my father's will, wishes to, control my heart and hand, as well as my fortune; but he will find that I am not a child, to be kept in leading-strings. I am old enough to act, and feel, and judge for myself-and Captain Morris can tell him so, if ,he chooses! Excuse us, Sir Humphrey, Mr. Sinclair and myself will meet you' at dinner." And the beautiful girl, twice as handsome in, her excitement as before, passed on, with her proud and happy escort, who, in. her presence, *-and in the thought that she loved him, forgot all danger, and even if he remembered it, did not care therefor. "Huzza! There's spirit for you! There's Egerton blood!" cried Sir Itumphrey, who hated Morris enough to enjoy this scene ex- qnisitely. Morris was too angry to spealk; and drank his wine, more to conceal his confusion than. from any other reason. "Will you not take a walk with me, Captain Morris?" said Venona, in a very gentle and; persuasive way; for she feared that a storm might break which would really endanger Sea- waitand Morley, and she determined to do all she could to keep back its fury, for the present, at least. "Yes-take awalk; but don't forget dinner. 'Twill be ready in an hour/' said Sir. Hum. phrey..   Thus pressed, common gallantry prevented Morris from refusing; and, with a very cold grace,' he offered his arm to the baronet's daughter, and would have followed the path which Lizzie hadstaken, but Venona insisted upon showing him some rare flowers, of her' own planting, in another direction; and, in spite of his wishes, he was led off in a different course from that which he wished to pursue. CHAPTER XXIXII. "He more than suspects the character of your vessel," said Lizzie, to Seawaif, the mo- ment they were out of the hearing of Morris. "I could see' it by the way that he watched your countenance when he spoke of his vessel hav- ing been fired into I He'"tried to read there an. acknowledgment!" "-le failed in marking any change in my looks. I have my features too much under control, and my feelings also, to let a man, who is himself half blind with anger and jeal- ousy, read a thought of mine," said Seawaif. "Do you think that he was jealous?" asked Lizzie. "Certainly-no one ever showed it more plainly. From his looks, rather than any ex- pression of yours, I knew what the contin- gency was to which he alluded i" "Ah I pray tell me what you think-it was!" "If I surmise correctly, will you acknow- ledge it'?" "Certainly-I shall tell you if you even do not, for no one has so good a right to know as him to whom I have given, my heart, and sacredly promised my hand!" "Ah, dear, dear Lizzie, that promise and your love make me but too happy!" "But the contingency-what do you sup- pose it to have been?" "Why, your uncle wishes you to marry this same Captain Morris,' and in case you do not do so, desires that you will retire to some lone- some place which he calls his estate, in Eng- land!"  "Why, you are a magician, my dear Ed- ward! Had you perused the letter yourself, you could not have come nearer to the truth!" "Where is this estate of'your uncle's?" "It is on the eastern coast of England, near the classic port of Yarmouth, famed for her- rings, and nothing else. It is a dreary old castle, overlooking the wild and barren coast, just fit to imprison disobedient wards in!" "And extremely handy for a bold lover to visit, whose'highway is on the sea," said Sea- waif, with a laugh. "It would be a dangerous latitude for you. to visit during the continuance of this war," said Lizzie. "Love laughs at danger!" was his reply. "But weeps when the danger becomes fatal and its object is doomed to perish," said Lizzie,.   sadly. "I had rather be there in that old castle where I spent my early life, than here," she added, "for there I can think of you and our future, without being persecuted by the at- tentions of others. It is a quiet, and a lonely place, and dear Venona has promised to go with me when I return!" !"Will her father spare her?" "He must-he is kind, and she is willful. If her entreaties should fail with him, a few tears 'will gain his consent!" "Would that you were already 'mine, and need not go beyond my protection," said the' young officer, tenderly. "It is better that we should wait. I do not wish to go to you a dowerless bride, though I know how entirely disinterested is your love. But wealth adds to comfort, despite the ro- mance of ' love in a cottage,' and r do not care that property which is legally mine should go to another! I feel sure that this war will soon be over; and when it is, you shall claim me in a way which will make the refusal of niy guar- dian's consent an impossibility. I am not in any way prudish-I love you and acknowledge it, and hope for the speedy coming of the day when we shall be united, no more to separate during life. At present, while peril is all around you, from which I would by no means  dissuade you, for it is honorable and glorious, I would be an incumbrance. Therefore, let me care for myself until you and your country are free; and then gladly will I resign my freedom into your hands, and become the wife of an American citizen-a prouder title, in my mind, than that of King of England!" "My beautiful, my own!" he murmured, and he pressed her to his manly breast with a ] ride equal to her own, and an affection as oundless as the sea over which his vessel often rode. But the next instant he released her, for the voice of Venona, speaking quite loudly, doubt- less as a warning, was heard in a neighboring ,avenue; and very soon she was seen with the British captain in tow, chatting away with him as if the whole hope of her life was cen- tred in a wish to make his time agreeable. Not wishing to meet him, Seawaif suggested to Lizzie that they. should join the baronet at the house, to whieh she assented; and they were soon in the company of the old gentle- man, who was in excellent humor, for the din- ner hour was near at hand. CHAPTER XXXIV.     i In a short timne after Lizzie and Seawaif reached the house, Venona and the captain appeared; and immediately after, the ladies excusing themselves to dress for dinner, left the two officers with the baronet. "Come gentlemen, come to the side-board and qualify our poor water' With some good  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6983-00000023"/> brandy, and try and rouse an appetite for din- ner," said the latter. "I have no objection to do so, and I shall be glad to drink to a better acquaintance with Captain Morris," said Seawaif. "Doubtless we shall very soon be better ac- quainted," said Morris, poitedly. "It is un- fortunate that we have not met before!" "Perhaps it is, sir," said Seawaif, blandly; "but now that we have met, it is to be hoped that we shall become well acquainted!" "It shall not be my fault, if we do not, sir! And to give a better opportunity to prove my wishes sincere on that point, I shall solicit the honor of your company on board of the' Bris- tol,' after we have had the honor of dining with Sir Humphrey!" "It will afford me sincere pleasure to attend Captain Morris anywhere, and at any time!" replied Seawaif, with the same cold and studied politeness used by the British officer. '"How do you take your brandy, with or without?" asked the baronet, pointing to the iter-pitcher, while he filled his glass "with," lwabstained from the qualifying " without." "My throat not being coppered yet for fifth proof spirit, I believe I'll qualify," said Sea- waif, carelessly, as he weakened his liquor, "English seaman seldom water their grog," said Morris, tossing off his portion undiluted. "If they hadl only East India arrack to drink, they probably would not be averse to water," said eawaif. "Or if they were used to New England rum," said Morris, looking Seawaif in the eye. "An article which I should suppose you would be well supplied with, since you have been cruising on the New England coast," said Seawaif, returning his glance. "The cowardly Yankees take good care to keep hidden away in their inland creeks and coves, and give us no chance for a fair crack at them, outside," said Morris. "I should suppose, then, that brave and zealous officers would follow them into their harbors. I presume, as the country is yet in its infancy, there are no very formidable forti- fications erected!" "No-only some miserable mud and log foits, which my ship could knock to pieces in an hour," said the captain, contemptuously. It is really singular how such cowardly crea- tures, thus illy provided for defence, can have the mad effrontery to resist his majesty's offi- cers for a moment, is it not?" said Seawaif, de- termined to out-do Morris on his own tack. ' It is," said Morris. "I hope to append a few of them as ornaments to the yard-arms of my ship, before long!" "Exactly! That would be beautiful; and it would strike almost as much terror into them as must the Government's offer to the Indians, of money for scalps; though I notice that some of our own leading people have had the folly to declare that very commendable *r;   offer barbarous, and unworthy of the age we live in!" "You do not think so?" "I? Oh no-I approve of burning rebels, always, provided-as the cook-book directs, in regard to cooking a goose-first catch the bird 1" "Some geese are caught before they know it, and that will probably be the case with some of the poor Yankees that we've been talking about. They are so bold and audacious in their ignorance and self-sufficient cunning, that they run their necks into a noose before they know it!" Dinner, gentlemen, dinner is ready-hark to the oyful sound-mine ears attend the cry," said the baronet, fortunately at this juncture, for the faces of both gentlemen seemed to be indicative of a ricing storm. A moment later, the ladies made their ap- pearance, and in spite of an attempt made by Morris to secure the arm of Miss Egerton; by a skillful and evidently preconcerted move- ment of both the ladies, the British captain found himself to leeward, and forced to take that of Venona, while Lizzie, with an arch look of triumph, was escorted to the table by Edward Seawaif. *' Do not touch the sherry wine-though you see the baronet and Morris take it; it is the- favorite of the -ltter!" whispered Lizzie to Seawaif,- with a slight pressure of the arm, which he understood, and replied to without speaking, in the same manner. CHAPTER XXXV. A Bermuda dinner, even at that early day, was peculiar-it had a "fishy smell and savor," even as it has in modern days. The baronet could not there command the mighty sirloin which would have graced his table in Hamp- shire, nor could the saddle of South Down mutton be procured, but the Westphalia ham was ready to follow the soup of turtle, and the courses of an infinite variety of fish. And an apology for roast beef was there, which the baronet declared was as good as could be had for love or money in such a climate, and not good enough for a hungry Scotchman at that. But Captain Morris either lad a sea-appe- tite on, or felt like some cross children that vou may have seen, that he must bite sometuin( --for he ate almost voraciously, and kept his jaws so much occupied that he could not find time to use his tongue. All of the gentlemen, and the ladies, also, partook temperately of champagne during the meats, and when the dessert was introduced, each of the ladies took a single glass of port, in which they were joinedby Seawaif, but the baronet was loud in his praises of the sherry, which he preferred, and which Morris also drank, perhaps because Seawaif said that he did not like it.   As a general thing, it had been the custom of the ladies to rise instantly after the dessert had been partaken of; but upon this occasion they lingered for some time, endeavoring, by their pleasalit and lively conversation, to keep the old baronet and his guests amused. But in a very short time, Sir Humphrey and Captain Morris began to show evident signs of being vety easily affected with their wine, not in a lively way, but ;by becoming quite con- fused and stupefied in their answers to ques- tions. The captain feeling very sleepy all at once, declared, with a yawn, that he must go aboard his ship, and tried to rise from his chair, but his limbs refused to do their duty, and he sunk back, with closed'eyes, in his seat. "Why- b- bless me, if-if Mor- Morris hasn't got dr-- drunk for once!" said the baro- net, with a yawn. "Pass-pass the bottle bios - blossom!" Before, however, he could raise another glass to his lips, he also was asleep. The eyes of both the young ladies now gleamed with delight-their plan had perfectly uccttccdcdt -their lovers were safe, at least for a time, frormthe eye of Captain Morris, and it was left to them to make good use of the time for escape. '"How long,will this stupor last?'? asked Seawaif. "Probably for several hours-but lose not a moment in H'eaven's, name.  When he awakes, Morris will be so indignant that he will not temporize an instant!" said Lizzie, who having ordered the servants out of the room, now felt no hesitation in speaking her thoughts aloud. "I must write a farewell message to my friend Morris, and then I will go on board-I cannot attempt to move my vessel until after dark, and there is yet nearly an hour of time to be passed away i" said Seawaif. Taking a pencil from his pocket, and a leaf of paper from  a note-book, he wrote- these words:  "Captain Edward Seawaif, of the American Pri- vateer Tyrannicide-who, a few weeks since, sank a British sloop-of-war, and captured her convoy of five valuable ships, which he took safely into port-who also, a few days afterward, beat back a boat-expedition, sent to take him by Sir Peter Parker, then disabled the ship Bristol, so that her zealous captain, Morris, could have an excuse to visit Bermuda and persecute an -'orphan girl with unwelcome attentions-and who soon after the above adventures, engaged, boarded, and cap- tured the British sloop-of-war Electra, and sent her a prize, into port-presents his respects to Captain Mor- ris, and regrets that the captain should be so fond of wine as to neglect his duty! When Captain M. intends to grace his yard-arm with rebels, le should first catch them          .       "Adieu, dear captain-hasten to blue-water, where it will not be difficult to find your very obedient sery- nut."   -        "EDWAnR SEAwAIFw." Then, after a moment, he added the follow. ing: ' "P. S.-Captain- Seawaif desires Captain Morris particularly to understand, that Sir Humphrey Dor- set has not for a moment even suspected that the rchooner was American; and that f Captain Morris   should by any report, or any ill-timed and useless an- ger, in any way injure the said honorable, loyal and generous gentleman, or any of his family, on account of the matter now between Captains Seawaif and Morris, the former will assuredly cut off the ears of the latter at the first opportunity, and nail them to his mast- head, and until an opportunity to do that occurs, proclaim him a dastard and a villain. E. S." "Have either of you ladies a pair of scissors to spare for a moment?" asked Seawaif, after he had pinned the foregoing paper to the breast of he captain's uniform. Lizzie produced a pair, asking what he in- tended to do.      -  ' "Merely to exchange tokens with the cap- tain!" said Seawaif, laughing, and cutting a tress of his ow'n dark glossy hair from hIishead,  and fastening it to the paper. ' "An exchange is no robbery!?' hlo added; and a moment after, he cut one of the captain's superb whiskers from his cheek, and also one moustache fronm Iis lip, and rolling them up,' put them in his pocket. "Heavens I the captain will be heart-bro- ken!" said Venona, with an arch smile. i' lie thought there were no such whiskers as his own in the world!"        -   - "They were too beautiful to be monopolized by one individual-I have only secured a speci- men for general exhibition!" said Seawaif, with a laugh. "Do not delay, every moment is precious now!" said Lizzie, who was too anxious for his safety to enjoy even a practical joke.  "I will leave at once, and Miss Dorset, I will bear your parting regrets to Mr. Morley, whom I know to be imost tenderly attached to you, and who is a worthy and honorable gentleman. We shall finid Ileans not only to communicl'ate with you, bult, in time, to sec you. Have no fears for our safet --fortune has favored us too far to desert us now! Farewell, butnot forever -farewell but for a time i" said Seawaif. One embrace and salute from Lizzie, a sa- lute as chaste as a brother would have given to a sister, exchanged with Venona, and he was gone. .       - Lizzie gazed after him with tearful eyes, but Venona could not help laughing, while she re-  garded the sleeping captain-who, with his one- sided whisker and moustache, presented, in- deed, a most ludicrous appearance. "How he will swear when he looks in. a mir- ror!" cried the laughing girl. "Or if he has any feeling left, he will not have to wait- for that to discover his loss. He may thank his stars that his loss is not irreparable, forhair will grow again in time!"  "We must prevent the servants from dis- covering anything until'our friends are safe!" said Lizzie, now turning to Venona, for Sea- waif had disappeared in the gathering gloom of approching night, and was now in his boat, and on his way tohis vessel. "It will be easily done-a word to the serv- ants, and they will not disturb my father and  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6983-00000024"/> his guest over their wine!" said Voenona, archly. t"How I would like to have the cap- tain's picture in his present situation!" she added. "I wish that my uncle could see it, or rather see him now! iHe then might not feel quite so much attached to him as lie does!" said Lizzie. "He shall not lack a description of him at any rate. Why he should wish to con- trol my hand and heart with his tyrant will is more than I can fathom. Were I his own daughter lie could not be more absolute! But I have a will of my own, thank Heaven! and will use it!" "My dear, good papa would find that I had too, if he should try to thwart me!" said Ven- ona. "The day that unites you to your Ed- ward, shall not see me far from the side of my Eugene, if he lives!" CIAPTER XXXVI. As soon as Seawaif got on board of 'his ves- sel, he called Doctor La Motte to his assist- ance, and in a very short time prepared a few dozens of wine, and some other liquor for use, intending to prove his friendship and generos- ity in an impromptu visit to the "Bristol," and in becoming self-introduced to herofficers. (Giving the wine and liquor in charge of the old' gunner, Mr. Brownell, to whom he gave special instructions to be as generous with the English crew as he was with the officers, lie or- dered him to follow in another boat, while lie went on in his gig. The night had now fairly set in; and though there was a breeze blowing off the land lightly, the dull black clouds that sometilnes 1precede a rain-storm lay heavy and leaden in tie sky, and hid the stars from sight. But the position of the vessels could easily be distinguished by the lights which they hoisted; and soon after pushing from his own vessel, the boat of Seawaif was hailed from the "Bristol." - "Tartar," was his reply ; and in a moment more he was alongside of the English man-of- war, and proceeding over her side. Assuming the liveliness of a man who " felt his wine," though not decidedly intoxicated, Seawaif in- troduced himself to the first lieutenant of the ship and the other officers, who met him in the gangway.   ,            "I dined with Captain Morris at the gover- nor's, on shore, gentlemen," said he, "and had a glorious good time. He is a trump, out and out, and takes to his wine like a baby to milk. I saw that he was disposed to be a little atten- tive to a fair lady there ; and as the old baronet was half-seas over, I thought I would come oif and enjoy an hour or two with your mess; and supposing, as you had been on a long cruise, you might be scant ot wine, I took the liberty to order my steward to send aboard a few dozen for your use."   Instantaneously voted to be a " good fellow" by all the officers who heard the welcome news, Seawaif was invited into the ward-room, whither, as the wine soon followed, all the of- ficers of the ship rapidly gathered, and a gen- eral jollification was the order of the night. If the suspicions of the officers, like those of their captain, had been aroused in regard to the character of the "Tartar," the fact that their lynx-eyed captain had dined with her commander, and been satisfied, as they sup- posed. set all of them at rest. And the gene- rous, free-and-easy manner of Seawaif mnide him instantly popular with them all, and they would never have believed, for an instant, that a Yankee rebel could be such a gentleman as he seemed. For then, as is still the case with too many of their countrymen, the English believed Americans to be naturally very much the same as savages - heathen fresh from the wilds. Even within a few years, I recollect to have read of quite an intelligent and celebrated English. lady being surprised, upon being in- troiuced to a native-born American gentlemnan, to find that he was white! The revel on board the "Bristol" ran high and glorious for a while. Toasts were drank; songs, the most of them ridiculing the rebels, were sung-and the loudest voice of allhwas that of the commander of the "Tartar." His car, too, could distinguish convivial noises on deck, and he knew that Brownell was doing his part. Although lie pretended to drink as freely, or even mnore so, than any of the rest, a keen eye would have detected the commander of the schooner in playing " young sojor" by emptying his glass at his feet, instead of down his throat. An hour passed ; and Seawaif, at the end of that time, seemed to be very drunk, while the few of the British officers that were yet awake, were really so. "I must-hie-go-'board-hic-the Tar-- Tartar Hook-hic---and soda-hic-in morn- ing-hic-for headache-hie!" lie stammered, as tie left the ward-room, and staggered to the deck. Here he found Brownell and both of his boat's crews, sober, and ready for anything; but not-an Englishman on watch. Theqy had been but too ready to drink when liquor was offered them,-and the consequence was rapid. Doctor La Motte's sleeping-powders had ren- dered excellent service. Going to the flagslocker, Seawaif found the ship's ensign, which he bent on to the hal- liards and hoisted union down, so that it could be seen at daylight as a signal of distress. lHe then hurried on board of the schooner with his boats. "Is all ready to slip, sir?" he asked of Mr. Morley. "All ready, sir! said. the young officer, pointing to a lantern fixed to a spar-buoy,   ready to 'be fastened to the end of the cable which threy were about to slip; and which, when their regular light on board was put oput, would be seen at the same height, and in about the samec place. "Then man the boats, and let the men, withl misuffied oars, take the tow-line, and follow me out, 'while I' sound the way through the chan- niel. Hoist the decoy-light, and slip as soon as the boats straighten the tow-line!" Ay, ay', sir!" said the young officer,. in the samne low tone in which he had received the order. And then, in perfect silence, the crew of every boat stole over the side to their places ; muffled oars were dropped into their rowlocks without noise ; the towline was taken up ; the cable slipped, with the spar-buoy and lantern left attached to it; and fllowing the captain, who. once in a, while, showed only a glimpse of light from a dark lantern, the schooner was towed quiectly away from her anchorage, in the gloom.' The channel was a narrow and a dif- ficult one, and it required the ntmost care, both by compass courses and soundings, to avoid the reefs ; and hours passed before the deep soundings and the freshening breeze told theta that they were all clear. Then the boats went .alongside-the crews sprang on board, and hoisted them up, and sail 'was made upon the schooner, By the time that, this was done, the dday, which had been unwrapping itself from the embrace of night, came up in its car of pur- ple and gold ; 'and in his pride and triumph, Seawaif ordered a national salute fired. And as the echoes of the guns rolled away over the waters, and rattled against the land, the saucy schooaner, with her country's flag proudly floating from her gaff, and her other colors streaming from her mast-heads, stood away, with the white canvas bellying out from every spar-looking, indeed, like "a thing of life and beauty. "They've slept well," said Seawaif to-Mor- ley, as he pointed to the English vessel, where the crpss of St. George was fluttering as they had left it. "But I reckon they'll soon wake now, for there goes. Morris in his boat," said Morley, who, with a spy-glass to his eye, was scanning the harbor. see two white flags waving to us from the house," said Seawaif, who had turned his tele- scope in that direction. "Heaven bless the noble girls!" sighed the young man. "Amen to that! Mr. Brownell, two imore guns, for a private salute!".said SeawaiL "Don't forget the baronet," said Morley. "I will not: three guns, Mr. Brownell!" "They understand us," said Morley, who was looking now at the house - or, rather. those in it---also, Their handkerchiefs still wet "   "( But the English colors have come down, on the ' Bristol,' " said Seawaif. "By thun- der, there comes a shot!" "Too short, by a mile or more," said Mor- ley, with a laugh.. "John Bull may as well save his powder." "I wondare, now, who ze baronet 'will 'ave for to get intoxicate wiz?" sighed La Motte, who had been very silently regarding all the movements. The breeze, now freshening as they receded from land, inccnased the speed of the gallant craft; and soon they were losing sight of the spot where they had passed niany eventful and pleasant hours-to which we will now return, retrograding both over space and time, for a little while. CHAPTElR XXXVI. It need not, would not, be supposed by any reader cognizant of the anxieties natural to thle. hearts of those who love, that either Lizzie or Venona felt'any desire to sleep while the night passed on,' after Seawaif had left thie house. Although they could not, in consequence of the darkness, see what was going on, they knew that he, and those under his command, were engaged in a bold'and desperate attempt to extricate their vessel from her perilous po. sition ; and they prayed heartily for their suc- cess, although they knew that its chances were not brilliant. Love has keen eyes. While wrapped in their thick shawla they sat upon the piazza and watched, they saw, far'out on the water, the o'- Casional gleam -of light which Senawaif showed as lie piloted the schooner through the wind- ing channel, and in whispers they expressed their belief thlat the light camne from the es- caping vessel. Several hours had elapsed, and in the dining- room the silence which reigned told how well the baronet and Captain WMorris slept. But some time after rmidnight the girls heard a noise in that direction. First a low muttering, then louder words, then :a crash as of broken glass or dishes, and finall an angry shout for lights and servants. "It will not do for us to be seen now, let us hasten to' our clansbcer, and appear to come from it in alarm, if there is sufficient noise made," said Lizzie. And the girls hurried away to their room. The cries of tie baronet, and the curses of- the captain, soon brought a negro servant witkh a light. "Why, bless my soul, captain, if I don'the- lieve we've been drunk-you're a better fellow than I thought' you was," cried the baronet. Then as his eyes caught a sight of the captain's, face, he burst out into a fit of uncontrollable laughter,' in which the negro servant joined. They could not well help it, for the sight of  &#xD;<pb n="48-49 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6983-00000025"/> a British captain in full uniform, with one wihisker and one nlouwstiche only, both very prominent, while the other side of his anger- pahd face was smooth, was a sufficient excuse to make a preacher laugh. "What the deuce are you laughing at?" asked Morris, raising his hand to discover what it was that made his face feel so singularly. They laughed yet the louder at his actions when he discovered his loss. He swore terri- bly. worse than: the whole " army in Flanders" ever dd. 'Til t Sinclair must have done it-the cruel wag-ha, hia  Hoi didin't like your attentions to Lizz%/i-ha, ha! You don't'know how odd you look. captain--I can't help laughing, on mVy soul I cant! lIla-ha-ha!" "It sh ill be no la:rghing mnatter to him, or you either, sir I' shouted Mor-is. "You have Leen harborinm a cursed Yankee, sir! Yes, sir, giving aid and relief to a rebel, sir, and \iou 1uew it, sir"I "Captain Morris, I don't often get maid, or intulta man in iuv townhouse, but you lie--you ,;:,  ,ir:; .l if \-u o-av that a imin I'll kick yoa 1" cried Sir Humphrey. -- The schooner that is called the ' Tartar' is the same that that fired into the Bristol, and the oflicer who calI lhiin=elf Sinclair is a Yankee and a rebel!" cried Morris, not heeding tihe threat of the haronet.  "You're too drunk to know what you re yillng! Go a;:d g,-t the (othr side (f your face shaved and get sober, andi then you may talk r,eason!' s:aid the angry b;aronet. "I have been drtec.'fd at your table, Sir lIumihlrcy ." shouted Morris. "DDrugged, in- suIted, and abused ; and, sir, if it co:;t my life, I'll have satisfaiction!" "You shall have it, very quick '!" cried the b;aronet, now -thoroughly enraged. "I Here, kick that liveried rascal ouit of doors!" lie cried to the servants, who, alarmed by the noise, had hurried to the room. "Why, what is the matter, dear papa?" cried Venona, who, with Lizzie, had just en- tered the room. "Are you ill, Captain Morris?" asked Liz- zie, with well-assumed alarmn at the same time. The captain did not pause to see or hear more; but, uttering wild and bitter curses and terrible threats, he rushed from the roonm and house. Upon reaching the landing-place, he hailed loud and long before lie coutl get a boat fronm his ship, iand the day was actually break- ing be-fore one reached the shoir. When it id, and li he saw the schooner under atil I1veyond the mouth of the harbor, with. a ir Cire 'which had already plhced her beyond the reach of his batter, 'his rage almost made him speechless. The'sight of his own flag, union down, did not lessen his anger. As he r weh pI wast the sa)r-buoy with the lantern at its peak, he unnlerstoodf by what ruse the schooner liad managed s4o slip away in the   darkness unseen' but not until lie h had go on board, did he completely understand how Yan- kee cunning had worked as efficiently with his officers and crew on board, as lie supposed it had with himself on shore ; for he did not sus- pect that his wine on shore had been drugged hy or through the influence of any other than Seawaif, since the latter had undoubtedly done it on board of his vessel. Nor could lihe blame his officers, or punish his crew for getting into the same trap which had'caught himself; and after ordering a sin- gle shot of defiance to be fired after the schoon- er, he went into his cabin to equalize the ap- pearance of his face, by the sacrifice of the remaining whisker andi moustache. Thus done, he sent his executive officer on shore to arrange for the immediiate repair if his vessel; for lbe swore that lie would not rest until he had found the schooner again, and re- venge himfiself upon Seawaif for. his injury and insult, which he thoroughly understood, after having read in a cooler moment the pa- per which he had torn from his breast and thrust into his pocket in the tirst moments of his passion. He determined not again to visit the baro- net ; for he felt that he had looked and ap- peared too ridiculous in- the eyes of the ladies to be seen by them again witlhout drawing smiles to their faces--andt his pride would not allow them that triumph. CHAPTER XXXVIII. Mr. Doolittle had taken regular Yankee ad- vantage of his invitation to call frequently on Miss Kate Cringle, and had gotten quite over the bashfulness which, at first, had made him appear so awkward and ridiculous. In truth, he appeared more ridiculous still, with his as- sumpltion of ease ; for he mistook-as I have seen others do in more modern days-t-he kind-. nhess of Kate for ant acknowledgment of his own captivating power, and seemied to belive that he had only to say the word to b',chmC the obliging custodian of her hand and for- tune ; for, of course, he thought that her hea,:rt had long since surrendered to his chamrs of person and mind. It was some weeks after his first appearance? in the parlor, that the scene occurred whiceh we choose to describe, in order to elucidate Iis progress in that " art, which art is none." Not now, as at first, did lie shrinkingly oc- eup one chair, with his cap placed beneath it; but, seated on one chair, with his huge feet upon another, and his cap hanging on the back of a third, while his right arm rested on a fourth, and his left thumnb was inserted in the arm-hole of his waistcoat, he lay back with an air of importance, that Kate, for the life of her, could scarcely keep from laughing outright. With his cat-gray eyes cast aneularly in  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6983-00000026"/> vision toward the ceiling, and the fingers of his left hand beating a tattoo over that portion. of the body generally supposed to contain the heart, Mr. Doolittle seemed to be in a very deep study. Miss Kate, whose fingers were seldom idle, was engaged in knitting an article, which, in that region, was more useful and fashionable in winter time than kid gloves-a woolen mit- ten. Kate could, as I said before, s arrcely keep a sober countenance, as the looked upon the occupant of four chairs, and his position; and she dared not trust herself to speak, lest she should open the flood-gates of mirth. "Two anld scing is' nine-and two more makes eleving" he muttered, as, with eyes upturned, he seemed to be lost in some deep and important numerical study. "Five times eleving is fifty-five, and none to carry! By jingo! it's enough, when what'll come with her is added, and I'll do it-yes, I'll do it!" and as he emphasized the last words, he kicked over the chair on which his feet rested, and brought his great right hand down upon his slender leg wtith a force which threatened its instant'destruction. Kate raised her expressive eyes, and though she spoke not, they asked wondcringly what he meant to do. He did not keep her long in suspense. "I tell you what, Miss Kate," said lie, "when a feller has got nigh on to fifty-five thousand dollars in hand, or a conrnin' to him, lie' worth somllthin, isn't lse?" "Yes, so far as his money goes," she an- swered, qkietly. "Well, my shares in the prizes, so far, all reckoned up, comes to, or nigh to, forty-five thousand dollars ; and supplosmn' th what t the eap'n will be sure to bring in afore long, will count me ten thousand more, why that's fifty- five thousand, isn't ib?" "hi round figures, yes," said Kate, quietly. "Shouldn't you think a man could afford to g't Cmarried on that?" continued Mr. Doolittle. ' There wouldn't be no danger of his havin' to stint his wife in calico, nor the children in vit- tel !" Kate could not repress a smile, scarcely could she restrain her laughter. Mr. Doolittle regarded this as a favorable sign; and with one hand on his stomach, and the other used in rubbing his smooth-shaven chin, he said : "I feel as if I oughit to get married i What 'ye think o' that, Miss Kate?" "I thilnk, tihat it being a matter which con- cerns you most, it is only you who can judge of its expediency!" " ' "Yes! That's so!" and Mr. Doolittle sank away into a brown study again for a few mo- ments.  All at once he started again, as if a bee liad stmuung him, and said:   ' S'pose we hitch teams, Miss Ktc! You're as handsome as all out-o'-doors, and I ailt bad- lookin', if I do say so myself! I've got enough -to go to house-keepin' on, and it's likely your old man 'll give you somethin' nice to set up with! What d'ye say? Is't a bargain, and' no backin' out?" Kate, although she had expected soiocethiig, had not quite expected this; nmd the droll way- in which Mr. Doolittle made his. proposi- tion, was too much for hel;. Shl burst into a violent fit of laughter--laughed so long and loud, that Mr. Doolittle began to laugh too- a kind of a weak and hysterical laugh, which -did not seeni to have a very good foundatlion. At last, when she had laughed until the tears ran down her rosy cheeks,. she began to try to look serious again, and Mr. Doolittle began also to draw his face into shape to receive her reply. It soon came. "Mr. Doolittle," said she, "Il have been long thinking of making you a present!" "Yes?- Hey you, really " he said, delighted; for he did not feel a doubt but that herself and prospective fortune was thepresent intend. ed. "Yes, sir," she continued, " and thllis seems an appropriate occasion for my intended pres- ent, that I beg you to accept it!" and rising, she handed him the article she had the moment before completed; and then, with a mieichiev- ons smille, walked out of the room. "Shoe-thread and bee's-wax!" said Mr. Doo- little, looking as if he had dropped all his prizo-noney overboard. "Dang my buttans, if she hasn't gi'n me the mitten! I'm a. darn- ed fool, anyhow it can be fixed!" And he held up the sign of refusal, anid re- garded it with alook of sorrow which no pencil but that of Darley could properly delineate. "I think she night as well have given me a pait of 'em-one is no use for any ting except to ag- gravate a feller!" Afte regarding it a shoit time in silence, he put t in his pocket, and ,then a heavy sigh came m) from his boson. "I thought she was swee/on me!" he sighed. "She always smiled when -canme--hid shook hands when I went away! Women is decevin' creeters! They ain't to be trusted no more'n a fog off the banks-you can't see through 'em!- Now, who'd have thought she'd have given me the mitten?" During this soliloquy, Mr. Doolittle 'had approached the window by which he could overlook the'entrance to the harbor. Two vessels under full sail, .with colors fly- ing, were coming in. "Thunder and ightning, there comes the schooner and anotheirprize!' he slouted ; and setting his cap upon his head, he rushed from the room, probably forgetting all about tha mitten, in the excitement of the moment.'  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6983-00000027"/> CIIAPTER XXXIX. Kate entered the room a moment after the mitenee had left it, and advancing to the win- dow, saw the vessels. As she did so, a thou- sand conflicting hopes and fears came over her, and she sank pale and trembling into a chair near the window, where she could still keep her eyes on the advancing vessels. Was he, upon whom she 'had, unasked, placed the affections of her true, pure young heart, living or dead? had he passed safely through the perils which she knew had environed him upon every sile, or had he fallen? stood he then triumniphant beneath his country's flag, or did his loved form rest in the blue winding-sheet of a seaman's grave? She could see, by the tattered sails, some apmars nissing, and their general appearance, that both vessels had been in a heavy and severe engagement-that the American was the victor she could also see, by the flag which waved above old England's cross upon the prize; but she knew not who might have fallen in the light. She only knew that leaders, ever conspicils, arc but too often picked off by the miarksinen of the eneny, and fall as Nelson fell, and Wolfef peirised, in the very arms of victory. I her fathcr Jentercd the roomi at this moment, and before he noticed her pallid face or agi- tated manner, asked: "What was the matter with Doolittle. just now, daughter? he went through the store as if he was stark, raving mad n "He probably saw the schooner coming in, Sir, as I do now, and wanted to get the news," said Kate, innocently. "The schooner coming in? Why bless my soul, if she isn't!" cried the merchant, looking from his windlow. "'And prize with her-I must hurry down to the wharf. I wonder how old (telsonl will feel non! He'll see more powder wasted, I reckon!" Ant even as the old merchant spoke, the thunder' of a s'lut- rclle, throutgh the town, and woL. e up the inhabitants to the knowledge of the arrival. He hurried away. and Kate was again alone.  Going t to the mantlepiece, she took down a i spy-tanlas. and adjusting it to suit her eye, be- gan to try to distinguish the persons on the vY-t ti-tant vessels' decks.        t While she was doing this, she heard the n sound of a foot-step behind her; but suppos- ing it to he a servant, paid no attention to it, t until a low and meek voice-but yet the voice 1 of a man-uttered her name. She turned quickly, and saw that it was Moses Gelson who had entered- her presence. Knowing her father's great aversion for him, she wondenrd why lie came there; but, never- c theless, she spoke, to him kindly, and asked a him to sit down. "No-no, Miss Kate," said the old man, in f tremulous tone. "Your father hates me, n   and I may not sit under his roof. He hates me without cause, for I never wronged him out of a penny-not a penny! But I didn't come here to tell you that-I saw him go out, and knew that all the town would run with him to see the ships that are coming in, and I thought I'd take the chance to come in and thank you for saving me from abuse and cruelty a while ago!' iil never forget it-Miss Kate-1I'll never forget it. Folks think I'm a mean old miser; but if they think Moses Gelson has no heart, they're mistaken - they're mistaken  He can-feel a wrong, and a kindness, too, though kind words are seldom used by him. I'll not forget you, Miss Kate, I'll not forget you!" "I only did my 8uty, sir-while my mother lived, she taught me to respect the aged!" "Your mother was an angel, Miss Kate-- I knew her well, better-perhaps, than you are aware of-she was an angel in life ; is an angel now," said the old man, in a husky voice, and a tear actually came out upon his white, dry cheek, and seemed to soak in there, for it stood a moniment and then disappeared. ("I've got a prel'senit for you, Miss Kate," he said, "I've kept it a long time, but I thought you'd value it a great deal ; and though it's been a world of company to me, I thought it would please you. You look like it now, for you are a pic- ture of what your mother was at your age!" And as the old man spoke, he handed to Kate the miniature of a young and very beau- tiful woman, which, indeed, bore a strong re- semblance to herself. It was in a gold locket, and surrounided by diamonds; but Kite's eyes did not rest upon the splendid setting-she was gazing tearfully, eagerly, upon the fea- tures of her mother. "Do not show it to your father-or if' lie ever should see it by accident, do not tell him where you got it!" said the old man. "I did not know before that you had ever beemn acquainted with my mother," said Kate ; and she looked wonderingly at the old man, through the mist of her tears. "Oh, yes; I knew her well-but-but 1 won't talk of it now-I may sometime, but not now! Good-bye-God bless you!-good-lyv( -I'll not forget you!" And the old miser thurried away, while more teanr were coming out upon lis w;hite checks, and dripping down upon his bleard. Kate stood for a moment and gazed upon the -to her-most precious relic; and after kissing it again and again, placed it in her bosom. CHAPTER XL. As usual, a large number of citizens gath- ered at the landing-place, when the salute' announced the arrival of the vessels; and their shouts were' long and loud when they saw their favorite schooner-for the "Tvrannicide " waa  not the only privateer out of that port-:-come   to'an anchor, and her prize, evidently a very large and heavily-armed transport come to, also, close under her lea. After the usual duty of furling sails had been performed, a boat, lowered from  the schooner, was seen coming to the shore, and , in the stern-sheets a single officer, who was { recognized by Mr. Cringle, in a little while, as the surgeon, La Motte.- The old -merchant, in a moment, was in an agony of anxiety. Seawaif was either dead or very badly wounded, or lie would have been the first to report his success, as usual. Tuarn- ing to Mr. Doolittle, he expressed his fears that i the cantain had been slain. "Maybe so-if lie is, s'pose you'll -put me  in charge of the schooner as cap'n, bein' that I'm next in rank-!"  Mr. Cringle did not reply to this look-ahead- ative supposition, or proposition, for the boat was in tailing distance, and hie sung out to the doctor: "Where is Captain Seawaif?" "Aboard ze schoonare, sare-very sick wiz one ver grand hole in his stomach, made wiz one peel of lead, and a grand coup of one sabre zat 'ave disable his shouldare! We have one' grand combat wiz two John Bull sheeps- one we send down to Davy Shones' lockare; ze ozzare, under ze conimaind of MeEsicur Mor- ley, is zere at anchor, as you see. All, Messieur I and shntilhommes, it was one grand affair- beautiful in ze extreme. We fight for two hours all same like diables; zen I amputat for see:x hours more, by ze 'watch! Al! it was ltlte glorieuse!"        / "Is Captain Seawaif dangerously wounded?" askcd Mr. Cringle of the doctor, who had by this time reached the wharf. "No, sare-not zat he shall did! If he had ' 've eat his dinnare 'cfore he was shot, and his stomach was big, he would 'ave been kill-buut, hi 'ave 'ave zer enemy early in ze day, and he reserve hisi appetite until he 'ave take zrn?!  Ah, ha! zere is Messieur Doolittle-if you 'ave been wiz us, you would 'ave had ze. opportu- nity for to do a great deal--my' lteL- toad stickare did bozzare zem John Bulfl mons very nmuch. Zey  , slash, slas;h, and make a great swear wiz zeir great big cutlass; but I stick, stick wiz my rapier, and I no say nossing, but hu wn, dovm go ze John Bull mens all around, wiz loetel holes in zeir stomachs. Zey 'nve esat, dinnare before zey fight, and zey die more often for zat!" - Will it be possible to have the captain re- moved on shore, where be can have tender nursing and attention?" asked Mr. Cringle. Certainement, Messieur Cringle-certaine- msent! Wiz care he can be remove upon one littare. And zat remind me zat lie send to you zis lettare, to tell you how we 'ave 'fight zo John Bull mens, and ze name of ze prize" While the merchant; read his letter, tIhe citi- znas gathered around the crew, and sought to   learn all the particulars of the recent action; and many a glad exclamation told their grati- fication and pride, when they learned that Seawaif, after a mrost desperate defence upon tlhe part of the enemy,i had shnk one heavily- armed transport ship, conveying Hessian troops to our coast, and captured another, also, full of troops, arms, and military stores. Vessels so laden, at that period, were more valuable as prizes to our government than they would ]iave heen if laden with silveri and gold. Powder and lead, and armas to use them in, were more in demand than anything else in our arminy. "Will you see to having Captain Seawaif removed at once to rMy house, doctor?" asked Mr. Cringle, after, he had perused the report of the young commander, "Wiz pleasure, sare-wiz one grand plea- sure!" replied the doctor, "Mr. Doolittle will go on board, and resume his duties as first officer of the schooner 1" continued' the merehant,' " and I shall be glad : to see you at my house whenever your duties will permit, doctor!" "Sank you sare--sank you!" said the doc- tor; and he again entered the boat, with the crew and Mr. Doolittlec to go on board the schooner. And the merchant turned to go to his house, to prepare for the reception of the wounded -commander. As lie did so, he met Moses Gelson, the miser, and could not restrain exhibiting the - enmity which he had shown to him for years, mid which seemed to grow with his age. "More ' powder wasted,' you see, old gripe- hard-and more prize-money in my chests!"' he cried. "I do not envy you your success; Phineas: let, us be friends as we were thirty years ago" said the mier, in a tone so meek and kind, and' so different from the' usual, harsh, sneering manner of his replies, that the merchant was for a moment taken completely aback with surprise. "Why, what's corme over you, 'Moses Gel- son?" he asked. "Has all of the snapping- turtle left your nature?" "I have been thinking, to-day, of the times when we were both young men, and sought the same prize. You won: I lost; and my loss changed my nature, and made me a harsh, lonely, misanthropic, world-hating, man-hating being! I will try to be better hereafter-I will try, and Heaven help me!

You dared to love her while she lived, and now, curse you, you dare to speak of her again,; to my face!

CHAPTER XLI. When Mr. Cringle, still agitated and excited from lis recent Interview with old Gelson, reached the parlor, where Kate stood, pale and anxious, with the spy-glass in her hands, her alarm became instantly fearful, for she read in his looks that he for whom she trembled, he to whom she had given her young heart's full de- voted love, was dead, lost to her forever. With a wild scream, and then a moan of aonyv, she sunk senseless to the floor. "O le aven! Kate, Kate, what is the matter? Kate-Kate. are you dead?" cried the terrified lerchant, as he raised and carried her to a settee. "Help-help--run here, somebody-  run h'ere, verybody ." he shouted, as he tried in vain to get an answer from her lips. A servant woman, who entered, uttered another scream when she saw the white face of thim poor girl, and acted as if she also would faint. "Run for water, brandy, vinegar, camphor, somethin", erveything, or my Kate will die!" groaned the merchant; and then, in his agony, not knowing what else to do, he hopped rightI up and dlown, and moaned: , "Oh, dear oh, dear!-oh, dear!" The servant woman, who recovered from her 0 alarm as soon as she knew that Kate was only in a faint, now hastened to use restoratives; and, to the intense relief of Mr. Cringle, Kate s soon opened her eyes, with a heavy sigh, and a shudder. "He is dead-my Edward is dead!"' she "No, Kate, no; he is only hurt, and I have sent to have him brought here to the house, c where we can nurse him until he gets well!" t now discovering why she had fainted, and for whom she was so alarmed. In truth, as she had 1 not been able to see him among the rest, with 1 her spy-glass, there seemed reason in her fears that he had been slain, the more especially that w taie v"esel bore marks, many and large, both in h the hull, spars, and canvas, of having been in a tierce and terrible engagement.     t "Father! do not deceive me I I am stronger le now. and can bear to hear it. I know that he c is l ca4 ' she said. Who do  you mean, child?"? "Edwiard Seawaif, father!" "I tell you that lie is living, daughter!" a "Then why did I not see him among his the officer and inmeli? Why did that French doe. to tor come on shore in the boat? I saw Mr. Morley on board of the prize, but I could not M see Edward anywhere!" "Of Course nnot, for he was in his cabin, un wounded. But if you will look now, with your glass, child, you can see them lifting him over ce   the side into the boat, to bring him on shore! CI ome, cheer up, and be ready to nurse him, if t you think so much of him!" Kate, yet very feeble, and trembling all over, tottered to the window, and, while her, father steadied the glass to her eye, saw that he was I not deceiving her. "Thank Heaven that be yet lives'" she sighed; and then she sunk back again to her seat, for her nerves had been fearfully shocked. The good merchant now hastened to have a room prepared for his expected gucest, and Kate assisted, as soon as she got over her fit of weakness, CHAPTER XLII. Two weeks had yassed, and Edward Seawaif, nursed by Mr. Cringle and his daughter with a care all as tender as a son or brother ever received from a father or a sister, was not only entirely out of danger, but so far recovered, that he could tnove from his room, and occa- sionally spend an hour or two with the mer- chant down in his store, and there receive the visits of his many congratulating friends. During his confinement to his room, he had gratefully noticed the tender kindness of Kate; tut he either did not, or would not, ascribe it to her paesionnte and devoted love for him, but rather to that of natural goodness, which seems inherent to woman-who, whatever may be her faults, is ever an angel in man's hours of anguish and distress. Now that he was better, though very grate- ful to her, he seemed rather to avoid than to seek her society; and this, perhaps, affected her feelings more than anything else. One thing was certain, and the anxious eye and heart of her father soon detected it--her health was failing, and though she made no complaint beyond a frequent sigh, he saw that she was drooping and fading, like a neglected flower touched by frost or left without moisture. Knowing, as he thought he did, the reason, Mr. Cringle determined to do what, but for his love of her, both his pride and delicacy would have forbidden. So, one morning, when Sea- waif was alone with him, he asked the latter if he had ever thought of matrimony. " I have thought of such a matter!" replied the young officer, with a smile; ," but I do not let such thoughts interfere with my duty or check my patriotism! I shall never surrender my freedom to a woman until my country is free!" "In ordinary cases I should approve of such a determination!" said the merchant. " But there might be a case where it would be right to break such a resolution!" "In my case there is no such necessity!" said Seawaif, carelessly. "You are not sure! Perhaps you do not understand your ease!" "I believe I do I If I do not, no one else can '!"   "Pardon me. my dear-qaptain; perhaps, now, I do t The lady, in her natural delicacy, might be more communicative to me than, to you. 'At any rate,!, who know her so well, can' tell much from my own personal observa- tion" i" "You, sir? Why, you never saw the i lady!" ' "' Never saw my own daughter?  Why, Captain Seawaif, you must be craz!" t ir, you surely -ire jesting with f me! I have never paid any marked attentions to your daughter-never in any way acted other than with a calm respect, such as was her due as a lady and your daughter!" "And you do not love my child?" "I esteem and/respect her'as your daugh- ter, sir; but no more! No action of mine could give her or yourself a just ground to think so! I do love a lady, one who is far away from lere;' and when this war is over, hope to make' her my wife!" "For the love of Heaven, do not tell Kate of it now i" said the merchant, sadly. "She could not stand it. She loves you. I have seen it for somen time -- known that it was growing upon her; and not dreaming that you , had a thought of another, I have not tried to cheek it When she supposed you had been killed instead of wounded, the shock almost caused her death. Be kind and gentle to her now ; and if you cannot love her, at least let me strive with care and gentleness to gradu- ally win her thoughts away from you. She is all that I have got to love on earth ; and if she died of a broken heart, I could not sur- vive her long!" I' will act so fir as I honorably can under your dictation!" said Seawaif-who, as a man, sensitive, honorable, generous, and full of feel- ing, could not but regret that which he hiad just been informed of.  "I will very soon be able to go to sea again!"' he added, " and when I am absent, it is possible ,that she can gradually be brought to put her thoughts upon other subjects " Ah! little does he know of the human heart who thinks that the absence of one who is be- lovedecan lessen love. Wilder, stronger, even ihcn it is hopeless, glows the'fire, which once lit, cannot go out! But I must not think-for thought brings madness! "The doctor thinks that I will be able in one more week to return to duty " continued Seawaif; tand this revelation will hasten me in my determination to be afloat again as soon as possible, Our country, threatened in every portion of the sea-coast, demands the energy( of every patriot mind-the strength of every arm that is able to strike in her behalf! I long again to do my part toward humbling the pride, of those haughty Britons, who boast themselves invincible upon the ocean. I have done it more than once, and feel that it is my   destiny yet tostrike many a bold and succees- ful blow for my beloved country!" "God bleei you  yours is a noble heart I I do not w6nder tt my poor Kate lovee you!" said the mereha t. "Until I knew you,  and saw -that she love you, I would have struck the man dead at -hy feet who hinted at 'ever filling my place in her love-at ever tak- ing her as a bride! Now, my only sorrow is, that you do not love her!" ." "As a brother may love a sister-as a son may love a father-so will I ever strive to re- gard you both!" said Seawaif, with deep feel-' ing. - Several friends, coming in at this timo, caused the subject to be dropped ; and soon Seawaif retired to rest, and to think of what should be his future action. CHAPTER XLH, The great blue waves of the Atlantic heaped high, and pitched wildly one over the other, off the dreaded shoals of Hatteras--for the wind, coming from the north, took the current of the Gulf Stream in the teeth, and set it in- 'to a boiling, seething rage--and with her scant canvas set to the best advantage for scudding, for she had reasons for not laying to or coming to the wind, which would have best suited her sharp hull and clipper rig in such a gale, the gallant privateer flew like a frilght- ened bird' over and through the heaving wa- ters, scattering the foam far and wide and high up among the quivering spars. The reasons whiy Seawaif was forced to scud rather than to heirve to or bring his vessel by the wind, were at least ten or a dozen in num-, bher, and consisted of a whole fleet of British ien-of-war, bound also to the south, which had come almost into range before, discovering their character, lie bore away. Hiaving the advantage in spread of canvas and size of hull,. also in ability to drag a press of sail in such ia galel the vessels also' spreading out so as to prevent his escape if he hauled on either tack to try to get the windward, his danger of cap- ture seemed most imminent. But Seawaif, who, though not entirely re- covered, was able to keeD the deck, and as he had recognized the "Bristol" in the leading ship in chase, with'the broad pennant of Sir Peter Parker once more at- her mast-head, he was determined never to be captured by her. For, in such a case, he well hnew that Cap- tain Morris would remember his cause of of-" fence, and render no mercy which he could avoid. On flew the gallant sechoonc uinder every stitch of canvas which her spars would bear --the hope of her commander being, that by gradually working in. toward the coast, he might slip into some inlet or harbor on the ;coast of North or South Carolina, 'into which he' could not be followed by the pursuing squadro.  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6983-00000029"/> The gale had set in steady, and had swept very cloud from the sky; and the moon, be- in att or near its full, made the nights almost as clear as the days. That Seawaif felt anxiety is true--tie proof might be seen in the fact that he would not leave his deck for a isoment, night or day; but as hrs vessel held her own with the lead- ing ships of the pursuing fleet, and gradually dr1opped others. which did not sail so well, lihe fllt confident, that if the wind held, he would make good his escape. It seems tarnation stranre to me tihat so many great ships ,f war should chase one poor devil of a schonuer!" said Mr. Doollittle, as he stood by the side of Seawaif. "They are not running off their course in l':k-ing us!" said Seawaif, quietly. I That is evitdently the fleet of which we 'heard before ,-' iitedl. intended to land troops in the South, and co-operate with them on the Carolina coast. There are transport,. as well as men- of-war in the fleet!" "Likely it is so! I do wish the wind would shift to the south'ard, and give us a chance to try 'cm on a bowline! If they caught us then, they might use my hat for a spit-box!" "( If this wind only holds twenty hours more, I amn i satisfied!" sail Seawaif. We nare slow- ly eilging in toward the -oa;t, and that time will bring us down so that we can run into Winyaw Bayv, Cape Rlninain, or Charleston; uind then we are safe. for a time at least, for we can run into, sholer wal ter than they!" "They've got it fort tt at (Irl: ston,'haven't I hey?" continued Doolitthe. ' Yesa, and gallant imen to defend it. If we ean once get safely over Charleston IBar, I have no fa:r o(f bein, taken, or what is more, being forced to blow up ni' vessel-for that I wo,::ld do,before I'd strike my colors to the man who is in lh:it leading ship! '" *We'd make some thunder blowin' up with full six ton of powder aboard!" said the offi- ce.:', with such a dry expression, that Seawaif could not restrain aimiile. CIIAPTER XLIV. There was far more excitement on board of t '.. . Bristol" than there was on board of the ,'hooner, (durin, the chase. For the latter had blen recognized by all of the officers and cr,.w of the ship, not only as the saucy de- ceiver of Bermuda, the capturer of the "Elec- tra," but for her first and also her last exploit, an'l hind got a reputation, which fairly entitled her to ble terned the "Terror of the 'Seas." ' Well, Morris, you'll have a chance to trim ht" whiskers for him now, I think!" said Sir Pter, as he stood by the side of his captain, frward, and with hiiti looked at the "chase," ss Mr, gallantly bowled awa:y ahead of them. I'll do worse than iniige his whiskers-he sii;h ,! retch hemp,. if I have my say after we gt him ." said Morris, bitterly. -t\   "'Twould be a pity to tnga suclh a gallant fellow!" said Sir Peter, ( His fight with the "Electra" was a fair stand-up thng, and would have knighted him, had lie been upon our side,. Rebel though holis, I cannot but admire his courage and audacity!" "Inii his attempt upon the heart and hand nof your niece and ward, Sir Peter, I thiink lie dis- played a very considerable aniount of conraOt andm audacity Z!" l'Poh-poh, nint! You are jealous of hinm. and still mad at the loss of your whiskers t I wouldn't believe that she cared for a nanmeless rebel, even if I had it from her own lips!" "You have not seen what I have, Sir P6. ter!' "No; and I nm glad that I have not, for T might have got angry, and anger brings on. indigestion, and'a man whose digestion is bad can't fight well -lead is too heavy for isiri- and cold steel doesn't sit well on his stomach: But give yourself no fears about Lizzie. She shall soon be in safe quarters, beyond the careless care of that old rum-puncheon, Sir Humphrey; and I'll warrant you that she'll soon forget the Yankee when she is among the stern hills of Yarmouth, if indeed she has ever cast a thought upon him.  You may make yourself perfectly easy. I hold her for-- tune, and with it her iate, in my hands ; and you have inmy word that she shall be yours. There is no go back when I have made a pro- mise. So be easy--your whiskers will soori grow again; and after we've taken Charleston. tind taught the rebels in the Soutih a lesson of obedience, we'll run over to Bernmuda, and I'll settle matters there!" "I wish we were only three miles closer to tlhe infernal rascal. We don't seem to gain an inch, aniid hardly hold our own, if we do so much!" said Moorris, who, during all of this conversation had' not moved the glass from his eye. "I should rather have her close under my battery than be in her bare range. She has a splendid piece there nmidshipb, which might. knock away our new foremast, as it did theo other one '! "The gale seemni to hlull a very little. [ think we can stand the main to'-gallant sail over the topsails i" said Morris, looking alofi. "We might try it, at any rate!" "Do so!" said the commodore. "Tell Mr. Winship to set the main top-gal- lant sail; and if she bears that, to get the top- nimast studding-sail boonis ready for use!" said the captain to a middy close by his side. Ay, ay, sir!" said the shrill-voiced reefer: and a moment after, the officer of the deck shouted through his trumpet: "Away aloft there, and loose the main top- gallan' sail! Bear a hand about it. you mon- kevs " In a few minutes the additional canvas wa,4 on the ship, making her quivering spars buckle yet the more -but'she stood it; and ea- ^ **   couraged by this, the 'captain ordered a top- mast s tudding-sail set. "' How do you think she goes now, sir-- does she lift the chase any?" asked Morris of Sir Peter, whose eye was very frequently raised to the schooner. ( No; -I think we've got too much canvas on the 'ship. She buries!" said, the comumo- 'dore. "Pressing her nose down into it, dead- ens her headway. The schooner, you see, has not set another stitch of canvas--and I'm sure we do, not gain on her; on the contrary, I think we are dropping her a little!" A muttered curse rose to the lips'of Morris-- it did not pass them-as he gave orders to take in the studding-sail and top-gallant sail. It was really a beautiful sight to see upon that dark blue sea, cheecked like a sheep pas- ture with foamy fleece, those vessels stagger- ing along under all the sail which they could carry--scattered here and there, but all steer- ing in one direction-and all, like hounds in view, upon the track of the gallant little schooner. "If tis 'gale continues until to-morrow morning, we'll hole the rebel in Charleston harbor!" said Sir Peter, as lie noted that the, chase was gradually edgiug in toward the land.  "And if we do, I'll have satisfaction out of Mr. Edward Seawaif, or lose an arm in try- ing!" said Morrris, bitterly. CHAPTER XLV. The gale did last, and the sun of' another day had just risen above the blue of the ocean in the cast, when the keen eye of Seawaif, who knew the coast well, detected the tall pines which marked the north entrance of the %bay, formed by Ashey and Cooper rivers, known as Charleston harbor. As the schooner had drawn into smooth water (for the wind was suf- ficiently west of north now to lessen the sea a rnd save the ground-swell, her speed increased, mand the British fleet, though well in sight, had fillen considerably, astern, when Seawaif had gotten sufficiently to the southward to haul up tr the channel which led along the shore to the west of Sullivan's Island. With all the sail set which he could carry,. rand his colors flying, Seawaif luffed for the harbor as soon as he could clear thel "north breakfrs"'--for the Beach Channel either did not then exist, or was unknown--and his gal- lint crew could not repress a cheer, when, %afiter a chase of over forty hours in duration, they saw that they were safely within reach of a harbor where the guns of a'fort would aid in their defence; for from Fort Moultrie waved thie loved flag of theirgcoumtry, and its rude ramparts were lined with patriots, whose cheers echoed back the shouts of the privateer crew. In a little while, the beautiful vessel swept by under the guns of the Palmetto fort, and while her conmiander had a boat lowered, and went in person to inform the commanding offi-   cer of the fort of the character of the fleet which was coming down the coast, the schoon- er run ip to her a:tchiorage nearer thie town. When Seawaif saw how few were the guns in the rudely-constructed ' fort-which wa': made of sand and palmetto logs-and how fiw men also were there to defend it, lie feared for the result-little dreaming that it, like the famed breastwork at New Orleans, would gain a world-wide name, not only for a desperatk and successful defence, but for the havoc and damage it would do upon the enemy. The gallant Moultrie received hini with open arms; and, to his surprise, heI found himself already known-for the flag at his mast-head had designated the name and character of his vessel, and her deeds had already been heralded far' and wide throughout the lanid.  Getneral Lee, with a pretty large force of militia, and some regulars, was in the city , butc the defence of the place would 'depend almost; entirelyc upon the prevention of the entrance of the British fleet into the harbor; and to do this, Colonel Moultric was deputed-and he swore to do it, or lose every marn of his garri- . son at their guns. Right joyous was lie to hear Seawaif offer, to assist, with his well-t:ained crew, in manning his batteries, and promptly did lie accept the offer. "Our greatest danger will be a lack of pow- der, now," said thie heroic colonel. "I/liave not more than twenty pounds a piece for my guns!" "I will supply you, sir, so far as I can, and will bring a boat-load of powder when I land a my crew," said Seawaif,    "Your coming in has been indeed a god- send!" said Moultrie. "I can see already that it has raised thie spirits of my men ; ant  with your aid I hope soon to send those Brit- ish hounds back from our coast faster than they came upon it! We have a great advan- tage over them in being stationary with our batteries. My guns are heavy, and will range full as far, if not further, than theirs; and now that you are here, with your gallant and experienced tars, I know th'i4 they will be well served! My men are brave,willing, and ready, but all of them have not yet smelt gun-powder or seen blood run!" "They will soon get used to it!" said Sea- waif. "My crew was literally a green one-as, in truth, Iwas inexperienced, when I first took them into action ; but they took to fighting aa naturally as gamne-cocks, and now they seem to like it!" "There are sails in sight to the northward, colonel," reported a subaltern officer, who had just come in from a look-out station, which had' 'been erected upon the north eastern end of thea island. "' I will hasten to transfer my crew to your batteries!" said Seawaif, bowing and retiring. -while the air resounded with the cheers of the soldiers, who were gladdened by the knowledge. -, -  m 'at t "  *  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6983-00000030"/> that th:-y wivre to be reinforced from the schooner. CHAPTER XLVL. The twenty-eighth day of June, 1776, is one which should be ever memorable in patriotic hearts-a day which should be held ever dear by the thrv. and chivalrous sons of the "Pal- metto State." On the torning of that day, the British teet, undruler Sir Peter Parker, took position for the purpose of silencing the batteries upon Sullivan's Islndl; for, unless this was done, it would be impossible to pass up the chatnnel, and land the immense force sent under General Sir!Henry Clinton to subjugate the Carolinas. The sun rose in a cloudless sky, and there was just breeze enough to sweep the vessels into the positions chosen by the commo- dore. While the ship swept into their places, and anchored head and stern, so as to bring the broadsildes to bear, not a gun was fired from the fort. But stern raid quiet behind their wooden ramparts stood four hundred men, r(naIv, when the order cameC from Moultrie's lips, to t th the Britons that they had no busi- ness there. And he, their-leader,remained as passive a; if those black-hulledt ships only in- tended t o tire a salute in his honor. He smoked hils pip,- while he insjpected their movements through his glass, .and smiled when he saw them run up their flags and streamers upon every miast, while his single flag waved proud- ly from it a short staff, above the ramparts which he had sworn to-defend until death took from him, and his the power-to do so. Upon the wharves and piers of the city, and Along the "Bay," where now "Beauty" so 'loves to promenade, were crowded those whose homes he was to defend. Many a lovely cheek paled as those ships pressed on and formed the battle-line; many an eye looked through a mist of tears, toward the little fort, and many % fond heart throbbed with anxious agony for the loved ones there--for, brave and patriotic as the women of our revolution were, they were u nman, and would tremble for those whom they loved, though they had not a fear for thenr erlvcs. The Enlish vessels took their positions with a great deal of deliberation-with as much svftem. as troops would display on a "field-day." and not a gun was fired until each was in its prescribed place,nand every sail snugly furled to its spar. Then from the flag-ship a signal was dis- played; and a moment after, those who lined the' wharves of the city saw a line of white, wreathy smoke burst frome the side of every vessel. And soon, with a single sound, like the burst of terrible, but distant thunder, came the noise of those united broadsides to their ears. Anxiously they looked toward the fort, to see if or not that terrible fins of over one handred.   and fifty cannon, centering upon one seaa2 point, one hastily-constructed fort, had not sweplt away its defences, sacrificed its Spartanic garrison. They could not, at that distance, tell what had been the result of the fire. The flag still waved above the low rampart of the fort ; but' all was still there as dea th. What could it mean? Were the defenders terror-stricken- dumb from fear? Again the rattling broadsides of the British ships threw their sthower of iron hail upon the breaet of the gallant little fort. And still no groan came from its proud heart! What could be the matter? Let us go and see. As each of the enemy's ships came into position,.Edward Seawaif, act- ing as aid to the gallant Moultrie, and' chef d'artilleric for the fort, went from gun to gun, to arrange it for the execution which it was shortly to perform. "There's no hurry, boys," said Moultrie, with a smile, as he checked the- impatience of' his men. "(There's no hurry-let them waste their powder; when we fire, we'll get the worth of our ammunition!" Three full broadsides had beeVn poured into the fort before a single gun from thenoe gave answer. At last, one shot-it'wsaa from, the battery manned by the crew of the "Tyrannicide"-- was fired, and a thousand voices- joined, in a glad' cheer, as they saw one of the tall top- masts of the flag-ship, with its taunting ban- ner, come tumbling down. And then, not in bursts or broadsides, but in, single shotsr each one making spars fall and splinters fly from, the dark hulls of the enemy, the batteries of the fort began to talk! Slowly and steadily, watching where the last shot struck, and improving in aim as they got their range, the Americans wasted not a single charge of powder.  Meanwhile, from every one of the British ships came broadside after broadside,. until they were so enveloped in their own smoke that it was night, sulphur- ous night all around them, and the Americans could only tell by the flashes of their guns where the enemy was. But they had their range, and little need -had they even tos ight a gun, for every shot found a home in British oak. If the boast of "Brittania rules the waves" was on her seaman's lips that day, they had good cause to believe that she could not rule the shore. Steadily, but not firing one gun totwenty of the enemy, the little fort did its duty. The officers within seemed'to be merely practicing for pleasure ; and theygsmoked their pipes as pleasantly, while they went from gun to gun and cheered with praises their brave men, as  if death had no privieges among them. Once during the day, Lee-that general' who would have been an Arnold, had he had an. Arnold's opportunity and temptations--   visited the fort; and though he Ihad been war- worn and battle-tempered in the old world, ere - 'he took up arms in this, he candidly confessed that never had he seen such admirable cool- - ess under fire, such utter sangfroid in danger as was then and there exhibited. The fort had only twenty-six guns with which to answer over three hundred-if all of the enemy's guns were brought into' use. Thus, for hours-the battle raged on. Once, and once only, did the fears of those who watched from the city become great--once and once only, did the suffering foe hope for victory. Suddenly, after one of the heavy unitedf broadsides had sent its iron shower ngainst the fort, the flag which had waved above its wooden walls was seen to fall. Then a cheer rose from every British lip, and' the American spectators held their breath, for they thought all was lost. But see I an American sergeant, JASPRE-. write high his name upon the patriot's scroll of immortal fame-leaps over the low breastwork, seizes the fallen banner, affixes it to the staff, and in the face of the bursting shot places it once more where it can be seen by friend and foe. Again hope rises in American breasts, and falls in the bosoms of their foes. At one time the smoke hides the English vessels altogether from view, and then their tire so slackens that the defenders of the fort can mark the effect of each eliot. Seatwaif had signaled out the "Bristol" for his particular aim. Marking his name on a shot, he had it placed in a cannon, and soon saw that. very shot knock two ports into one on board of the "Bristol." And not long after, a shell which fell near him, but which did not explode-for a brave man drew the fuse-- was exhibited- to him, bearing the name of Morris. The rivals in love and war had' exchanged cards. It was almost night; and yet, on either side, thei fearful fire continued. One of the English frigates had been shot froin her mooring, and drifted on to a bar. Two other vessels Iad also grounded. Once,.the spring to the "Bristol's' rfable being cut away, shel "tailed" stern on to the fort, und every shot which struck her raked her fore and aft, making terrible havoc. Poor Morris was fated that day! for after he had used superlhunan exertions to cheer up the crew and make their fire destructive, a iiot struck him, and mangled him horribly, but B living, he was carried below. Sir Peter, though badly wounded, and at times without on officer by his side, and de- prived of full half of his crew, stood stern and fearless upon his quarter-dock, and gave his orders calmly, until a new spring was got upon the cable, said his broadside, once more, was ipu-mn to the fort, . Terrible was the day-terrible to the foe, glorious to the cause of freedom. Night came   on, and still war's dire labor was not ended. Sullenly, gun replied to gun; still the loud echoes of cannonry rolled over the water to the ears of those who watched from the' city- those who no longer trembled for the result of the day's battle; but looked"to see every British ship go down at her anchor. And had not friendly Night-who so often puts her dark hand between battling foes--in- terposed, not a ship of that proud fleet had ever reached the ocean's blue again. / As it was, the "Acteon" frigate lay disabled on the bar, and had to be destroyed; and the rest of the enemy's ships crawled away, shattered in hull and tattered aloft, in the darkness and gloom of the night; and Carolina, for the time, was free' from danger. But only for a time. Tarleton was fated to run his raid of blood-Hayne was doomed to suffer-Jasper was to fall-fire and steel was to work many a bitter woe in the land of Ma- rion, of Moultrie, ,of Horry, of Piuckney, and of Sumner. But go to history to' read of that -our path is on the sea  CHAPTER XLVII. The shattered vessels of the almost disabled fleet of Sir Peter Parker had drawn off the inhospitable coast which had welcomed them only to their graves; and each ship was di- rected to make the best of' her way to the general rendezvous which had been appointed. In the cabin of the "Bristol" was occurring an event which, in justice to a brave man, we must describe. Captain Morris lay upon his cot, suffering from his death-wound. Though agony drew from his brow great drops of sweat, not a murmur broke from his lips. The commodore, Sir Peter (himself wounded, but niot disabled), stood by his side, and sheard, with deep regret, the decision of the surgeons, which told him that he must lose his friend and favorite officer. "I have no one to mourn me," said the dying officer. "I have done ury duty!" "I shall mourn till I follow you to the grave, brave shipmate, and true friend 1" said the commodore, with deep feeling. "I'm sorry they whipped u--the rebels will crow over this day!' continued Morris. "Do not think of that! The war is not ended--we will yet make them rue even this victory," said Sir Peter. "No--they wyill conquer in the end," said the dying man. "Curse them, luck is with them'"  "Well-well, do not think of- them.  Is there anything I can do for you,?-any wish I can execute?" "Yes, one!" "Name it, my dear Morris, name it, and it shall be attended to!" "Lizzie willbe free now, so far as I am con- cerned!" gasped the dying man. "I care not who she weds, if it be not Edward S'cawaif   &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6983-00000031"/> ,'r,:!se me that she shall never bear that rUattd name!" "I promise that she shall not!" said the commodore, as he grasped the already death- chilled hand of his brave friend. "Heaven bless you, commodore!-God save the king!-and- A gasp, and the spirit of the gallant officer went aloft, leaving that which he would have said unuttered. After tlihe firing had ceased, Moultrie, ac- companied by Seawaif and others of his officers, visited the temporary hospital in the rear of the fort, to see how the wounded were getting imong, and to say a cheering word to them. They found Doctor La Motte, with the other 'urgeons, as cheerful and busy as they could -. Slow do you like matters, doctor?" asked the colonel, as lie approached our surgeon. * -!\.'s-blt, inon cher colonel-passblde," said tiii, doctor, shrugging up his shoulders. "Wo ve had a few case of amputat; but nossing, loxAsziarr sIaro, to zat which zey must 'ave had on hoard ze John Bull sheleps! Alh, colonel, if I had only been zere, I should 'ave had all ze ainputitzat 1 desire! Many times I sink of zat while I see how your cannon balls go into, zeir slce[s I I do'not like ze fight wizin the fort, zere is not enough of ze aniputat for The colonel could not but smile at the pro- fessional zeal of the doctor, though he had no wish to see such havoc among his own men as would satisfy the doctor's anpurative gluttony. CHAPTER XLVIII. It was but a few days after the body of the gallant Morris--sewed up in a sailor's canvas coffin, and wrapped 'in the flag beneath whose follds he had received his death-wound-had been consigned to the bosom of the deep, when the look-out from the mast-head of the "Bristol" sighted the land for which the ship had been steered-Bermuda's ever-lovely isle. And within a few hours, the "Bristol" was once more at an anchor in the well-known harbor. Sir Peter Parker in a very short time landed, and soon stood upon the threshold of the gov- ernor's residence, where he was received with unusual warmth by Sir Humphrey -who longed for more companionshi :--for he had not had any visitors for a considerble length of time. Lizzie was there to welcome her uncle ; but his manner was very cold and chilling to all- so much so, that Sir Humphrey could not but take notice of it, and ask why he acted in such a distant manner. "- When I left my niece and ward here, I as posed that you were both loyal and honor- able," simd the commodore.   "So I am; and he lies who says that I am not," said Sir Humphrey, angrily. "Softly, softly," said Sir Peter. "I believe that but- a few weeks have elapsed since you permitted a rebel privateer to refit in this port, and allowed her rebel commander to make love to my ward!" "Your ward will exonerate Sir Humphrey from all fault in the matter; for he did not know that she was American, until she was beyond these waters," said Lizzie, with spirit. "Perhaps my fair and loyal niece cannot say so much for herself," said the angry commo- dore, sneeringly. "She has no fears in regard to herself, and only wishes Sir Peter Parker to pass as blame- less those who are so!" replied the brave girl. "I have heard, Miss Egerton, of your flirta- tion with the Yankee rebel ; but it came to a timely end. Had he not fled as he did, poor Morris would have taught him the use of Brit- ish imp!" said Sir Peter, bitterly. - How does poor Morris survive the loss of his whiskers?" asked Lizzie; full as bitterly. "Girl I mock not the dead!" said the com- modore, sternly. "Dead? Is Captain Morris dead?" asked  Lizzie. "Yes--died bravely died as he had lived like a man i" "It is well!" sighed Lizzie. ' lie can suffer no more. It is well!" "Well for him-better than for you? You, girl, are his widow! I know your heart; but disappointment awaits its every hope! I pro- mised him, in his dying moments, that you should never bear the name of Seawaif!" "You never had the rirht to say whose name I should bear, Sir Peter Parker!" said the brave girl. "Nor, when I choose to change my name, will I ask your consent.  Play the tyrant if you will-never had a monarch more rebellious subject than I will prove my- self!" "We'll see, mad girl-we'll see I Within a week you will be on your way to the Eng- lish coast; and once there, you shall know whether or not such guardianship as mine is to be rebelled against. I'll tame your spirit down, if life has to sink with it'!" "Yes-for with my death an accession to your fortune will be made," said Lizzie, more bitterly than before. "Oh, you are a brave, good, Dear uncle!--a most trusty guardian! My father chose wisely when he selected Sir Peter Parker!" "Yes ; for his honor's sake he did," said the commodore, sternly. "I will not let his child throw herself away upon a nameless rebel! But get you gone to your room-I have busi-' ness with Sir Humphrey, and want no officious women about me. Remember-you will sail for England within a week 1" "I rejoice to hear it, for duty will not take yie there, tyrant," said Lizzie, as she turned away, angrily, and went to her chamber.   CHAPTER XLIX. "Dear, good Sir Humphrey, I do not know jiow to thank you-how ever to repay you and dear Venona, for the 'sacrifices which you have made for me! You have resigned your place mid-" ' "Poh, poh,-poh,! blossom. Don't speak of it! I was tired of the place-it was too dull-not a soul to crack a bottle with. I was getting as lean as a church-mouse there!  And ten chances to one I'd have been turned outl if I hadn't resigned! That is the truth. By re- signing, I save my credit; and it canii never be baid ofi me, that I was turned out of office P' "That is so, my father," said Venona. "(We will be happier in good, peaceful old England, than ever we were in Bermuda!" "Sir Peter little thought, when he sailed from Bermuda, that I would be the escort of his niece back to her native land," said the aronet. "If he had, he might not have been so willing to intrust you to my care; for he dis- trusted my wisdom very much, and my loyalty more, when, I dared to say that, rebel or not, Captain, Seauwaif had acted like a gentleman!" 'IThis converslation, which occurred on board the good English transport brig "Coraline," then ten dayS out from Bermuda, and bound home to England, was suddenly interrupted by the cry of ' "sail ho!" from the look-out. Whore away, and what is she?" cried the commandler of the transport, as he seized his spy-glass. "Broad on the weather-bow, sir, and seems to the square-rigged!" was the answer. The breeze was fresh ; and the brig, carry- ing all the sail which she could well stagger under, was close-hauled' on a bow-line, but still on her course. "We are out of the track of Yankee cruisers, I should think!" muttered the captain; but, nevertheless, lie felt uneasy, and went aloft with his glass, to reconnoitre the strange sail. He did not stay there long, but soon came down, with a face which expressed'great anx- iety. "What nation do you think she belongs to?" asked Sir iHumphrey. "She's Yankee as beans, sir!" growled the ealptain.  * "Is she large?-can't you fight her?" asked the baronet, who did not lack in courage. "What can we do with only fifteen men, all told. and four useless little pop-guns. Six-' pounders are only fit to bark at South-Sea Islanders with, to scare them away. It's likely that fellow yonder, who is comning dob\n on us, with everything set aloft and below, carries ,eighlt ens or thirty-twos!" * If you can't fight him, why don't-you run?" asked the baronet.  . "We'll make a pretty mess in trying to run naway from a clipper; but there's no harm in try- ing," said the skipper. "Hard up your helm, there! Round in the weather-braces, some: of you, and square the y'ards. Away aloft, and   loose the royals, and rig out the stu'n-sail booms!  Bear a hand, if you don't want to chaw Johnny-cake!" With her course altered, and all the canvas which she could show spread, the brig's'head- way increased' materially ; but still the strange sail "rose," with a' rapidity which proved her to be indeed a clipper. "There's no use-we might as well lay-to and let her come up, for she goes' three knots to our one!" growled the skipper of the trans- port. "But, curse me, if she shan't have something for her trouble I Get your arms men-double load every gun, I'll not strike my flag till she has tasted cold iron!" "Spoken like a true 'Briton!" cried Sir Humphrey, slapping the captain on the back. "Come into the cabin, and take a drink with me, and then I'll get my arms, and help to do-' fetnd 'the vessel while, a plank of her floats!" "Captain," said Lizzie, who' for some time had been looking at the vessel in chase, through the glass which the skipper had laid down- "If you will shorten sail and heave to, and make no resistance, I will pledge my life that the vessel which is following us will permit you to proceed on your voyage in safety, after mer commander knows who are your passen- gers. H-le is an old friend of ours!" "Why, blossoms; what d'ye nean?" cried the astonished baronet. "That the vessel in sight is the ' Tartar,' alias the ' Tyrannicide!'" The deuce, you say!  Then heave to, captain, just as soon as you can. Blossom, here, speaks the truth-her commnahder would. sooner blow his own brains otut than lay a straw in her way! If lie is a rebel, he is as fine a fellow as ever drew, breath You needn't blush, blossome, I mean what I say!" Thei captain of the transport, though rather ldubious about the clemency which the Yan- kee schooner would show him, hove to; for lie saw that escct)e was impossible, and that re- sistance against her armament and force would be madness.- And while the baronet went into the cabin with him to fortify the inner man with a mo- dicum of brandy, the Iadies, with that desire to look well which is a component part of wo- man's nature, hurried to improve their toilet, for two hearts bounded in their bosoms with the thought that they were soon to meet those for which alone they throbbed. CHAPTER L. The baronet and the ladies stood out of sight when the schooner ranged up alongside, or rather on the weather-quarter of the brig, and heaving her two topsails aback, became sta- tionary, for Lizzie' desired to surprise Seawaif after he had come on board of the vessel-if he came in person to take possession of the transport.  '  "Brig ahoy-what brig is that?" asked Sea-  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6983-00000032"/> waif, in his clear, manly tone, as he came with- in half-pistol shot and easy hail. "The British brig t Coraline'. What vessel is that?" replied the captain. "The American privateer ' Tyrannicide.' Haul down your colors and you shall be well treated! You are my prize-I'll send an officer to take possession of you!" "One of my passengers suggests that you had better conime yourself!" said the captain.. "One of your passengers?" said Seawaif, in surprise. "Yes, sir-a lady, who sends her compli- ments to Captain Seawaif!" "A lady? Where are you from?" "Bermuda!" answered the captain. No further questions were asked of him; but a boat was lowered from the quarter davits of the schooner about as quickly as ever it had been done, and as the ladies and Sir Humphrey now deigned to show themselves, two officers were seen to ledp into her stern-sheets ; and in almost as short a space of time as it has taken me to ddscribe it, Seawaif and Morley stood upon the deck of the transport, shaking hands with Lizzie, Venona, and good, jolly, happy Sir IIumphrey, "Little did I expect to have the happiness of seeing you BO soon, ladies, and you also my kind SirI fumphrey!" said Seawait, as he stood and gazed upon the group. expctaed they'd turn me out for being so blind that I couldn't tell a rebel from a loyal- ist, and so I turned myaself out of office to save them the trouble!" said Sir IIumphrey. "But poor Lizzie here is undee sentence of banish- ment to Sir Peter Parker's estate, and my blossom won't part with her, so 1 thought I'i act as escort to both!" "My colors are down, sir-what nire your orders concerning my vessel?" asked the cap- tain of the brig. "' You can hoist your colors again, sir ; and I will trust to the honor of your owners to re- mit a reasonable ransom, as justice to my crew and owners, whom I have no right to deprive of their prize-money!" said Seawaif, in a kind tone. "God bless you ir!-if the brig had been captured, I should have been ruined ; for all I have in the world is invested in her! Name your ransom, and on the honor of a British seaman, Irwill have it sent to you!' said the captain, with deep feeling. "And I'll go his security for that!" said the baronet. "Were I to take the value of your live freight into consideration, your ransom would be a heavy one," said Seawaif, with a smile. "But I will be as easy as I can for the sake of those whom you carry 1" "Thank you, sir-- shall never forget you! If all of those who are called rebels are so generous, they will not long fd British sea- men to fight against them 1"   "I know you'll excuse me while I go into tile cabin to get some drinkables ready," said, the baronet. "I see that Mr. Morley hiss taken my blossom in tow, as you sailors say." And good Sir Humphrey darted away and left both the young men tete-h-tete with the ladies--a situation it may well be supposed not at all disagreeable to them. "How &amp;id Captain Morris relish the loss of his whisker?" asked Seawaif, of Lizzie. "Poor fellow! he is dead ; and we will speak of him no more!" said Lizzie. "Dead? How and when did lie die?" "At sea, of wounds received in the late at- tack of my uncle's squadron upon Charleston.'* "Heavens!-I was in that action! My ves- sel having been chased into the harbor by your uncle's fleet, I and my crew volunteered to do service in the fort which beat him off!" "How strange! Well, his suit can trouble me no more ; but even in the hour of death he did not forget you- or lihe made my uncle pro- mise that 1 should never be your bride!" "Your uncle's promise is not your own, thank Heaven!" said the young American. "No-nor shall it bind me!" said the lovely girl. "I Sail ho!" cried the look-out from the mast- head of the brig. "What do you see there?" asked Seawaif, quickly. "Two sail away up in the weather-board, sir, just lifting ; 1 cannot make out what their rig is yet." "They may be British ships-we must part now, dearest lady, but I will see you very soon again. Ask no questions; and no matter -when or how you meet me, evince no surprise; nor, if in company, recoguize me-for I am a wild adventurer. and fond of maskerading, and vou may again see me in a British uniform." "The bibibles are ath ready--come and wet a lip, gentlemen!" cried the baronet, from the cabin door, at this moment. "A single 'glass, and we must part!" said Seawaif. ' There are strange sails in sight, and I niust see what they are. By the way, cap- tain, give me writing materials, and I will write a certificate that you n'are under ransom, which will protect you from any other of our cruisers which may overhaul you." The document was soon written, a friendly glass of wine taken, the parting words spoken, and the two officers returned to the schooner. As the brig filled away on her course, her crew gave three hearty and thankful cheers, which were speedily returned by the Ameri- cans, who, hawling their larboard tacks aboard, and bracing sharp up, soon shot away at ani angle from thie brig heading up for the strange sails which had justfbeen discovered. When La Motte heard that Sir Humphrey was on board of the brig, his sorrow was great that he could not have seen him. O0 malheur!" said he. "It was one grand   pleasnre to become intoxicat wiz ze governare -lie holds so much in ze stomach befores it af- foct his 'brain. It was admirable to observe!" And, with a sigh, the doctor went to his room, to take a private drink to Sir Hum- phrey's health. CHAPTER LL. As soon as he had parted company from the brig, Seawaif tore his thoughts away from the loved one there, and with that stern moral force which is Heaven's best gift to a brave, true man, drew his mind down obedient to his duty --to the duty which he owed to his country, his C;:'w, the owner of his vessel, and, himself. He took his glass, and hurried aloft to see, if possible, before they closed, w11hat was' the character of the stranger vessels; which, if ene- mis, would have a greiat advantage over himn in being to windward; for his craft, which was sharp:-built, sailed best when beating up on the wind, and was most dull in running off before it, He remained aloft for a long time, until the brig had run almost hull down to the eastward, and the strange sails were quite hull up on his starboard bow. At last he came down, and at once .ordered the vessel cleared for action, and everything smade ready to crowd on sail. His men and officers hastened to obey his orders, though they asked no .questions-for lie was one who did not permit it. Mr. Doolittle, upon whose head the bump of curiosity was very prominent, often raised his glass to look At the strange sails,.and 'would have liked to learn what the captain supposed them to be, but he had been too often rebuked for asking questions prematurely, to wish to offend again. But at last he made up his mind to hazard a leading remark, and said: "Them  craft are square in rig, and look hecavy, sir." "Yes!" replied Seawaif. "I shouldn't wonder if they turned out to the men-o'-war!" continued Mr. Doolittle. "Nor I!" returned his taciturn comrnan- "Do you think they're American, sir?" No '--if I did, I should not clear ship for ncton!" said Seawaif, quietly. "Look to the sails and rigging, and have preventer stays arind braces ready.' The breeze is freshening, and if we' have to run, we many have to drag canvas heavily." "Ay, ay, sir!" aid the officer, whose curi- osity was now satisfied. ' Are zem John Bull inens, 31ssieur Ic Cap- itaine?" aaked La Motte, coining on deck, visibly improved after his visit to the cabin. " es, doctor; we may have some more fight- ing soon!" said Seawaif, with a smile. "Eh, bien! Zat will please me very much. I 'ave one grand desire for more opportunities to amputat! Ah, sare, no ones but ze children - , /   JI   of science can'appreciat ze beauty, ze pleasure, zat zere is in ze amputat, ze bone-set, ze ball extract!" said the doctor, with enthusiasm., ' If I shall 'ave my choice to live forevare upon ze world, wizout ze amputat, or die to-morrow and go ze place where ze diable reign supreme, and zare to 'ave plenty of ze amlputat to do,' I shall prefer to die more, zan to live!" "But, doctor, that is rather a hard-hearted desire. It hurts men to lose their legs or arms!" saw off ze bone, and all is ovare, and' ze patient 'ave not know but very leetel vat 'ave hurt heem! Ah! mon cher capitaine, it is science zat make even death lose all its terrore! But excuse me, I shall go to prepare my instru- ments!" "' Darn me! if I don't believe the doctor would refuse vittels, if he was starving, if he had only a chance to cut off a leg or an arm!;' muttered Mr. Doolittle, as the doctor went into the cabin. Then again the dnion of curiosity took pos- session of the lieutenant's spirits--hhe had seen the flutter of silk or calico on board 'of the English brig, and had been told that she had' been allowed to proceed upon a ransom bond-- 'a matter not uncommon m the annals of pri- vateering. But he wanted much to know who the ladies were, and why Mr. Morley had been, so' anxious to go 'on board the brig with the captain i for through his spy-glass he had ex. amined the fair ones while they stood tite-d-tte with their lovers.  "I seen wonmen aboard that 'cre brig, didn't I, cap'n ". ho asked. "If you used your eyes, you had a chance: to!" said Seawait. "Mr. Morley seemed as thick with one of 'ecm as if he'd seen her before 1" continued the , hunter " after knowledge under difficulties." "Probably," said Seawaif, smiling, for hie saw the drift of the lieutenant, and was deter- mined not to gratify him. "I don't like women!" continued Mr. Doe- little. "I presume not, if they understand knitting!" said Seawaif, to whom Kate Cringle had re- lated the mtnitten-scene, while he lay wounded at her father's house. "Darnation, them lubbers are reeving tliat fore-topmast stun-sail geer all wrong!" said the mate, turning as" red as a turkey's comb' in the face, and going forward to conceal his con- fusion; for until now he had not known that the captain was aware of his scene with Kate. Seawaif again took his glass, and, ascending ' the weather rigging some ten or a dozen rat- lines high, scanned the vessels, which Were now rapidly nearing him, with an anxibus eye. laving looked at them for some time, and also studied the weather, whichi looked wild and threatening, he came to the deck again, aAnd  &#xD;<pb n="64-65 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6983-00000033"/> calling his officers to Ihis side, bade tierri put on their English uniforms. "I must get the weather-gage of those sbips!" said he. "They are men-of-war, and double-deckers at that; and, with a free wind in a sea-way, will give us a tough pull-most likely overhaul us. If I call for them into the belief that I'm English, or a prize, and get to windward, all will be well; for on a wind, with whole spars and out of range of their broad- sides, I wouldn't care if every ship in the ihitis h :Ivy wetre in hease of ime!" Th, officer hastened to obey his orders, and the English colors were got ready for hoisting, while the "Electra's " signals and signal-book were also brought out, to be ready in case the Englishmen should ask questions with their bunting. And in addition to these preparations, the t-ch,ir waLs cleared for action, her guns cast loose, magazine opened, fires put out, and :'rmr all placed where they could be put in hand in a moment. CHfAPTER LIIT. Uiid-r hecr large fore-anld-aft sails, and single- reetfed topsrils, with top-gallant sails set above them, the schooner made fair headway and }autiful weather, laying up within four p)oints of the wind, or thereabout; and though it had been sometime after meridian when the ships were first sighted, it was not yvet night when they were close aboard, hearing down under a cloud of canvas; for having the roll of the sea with them, and a free wind, their spars could I,car double the sail which they could have to,)1i uip under if brought to on a bow-line, with their tcka hauled aboard.  Seawaif expected, the English vessels rui'rncneed signalizing to each other, before they were fairly in range of line, for he had hoisted English colors, and they seemed both- red at his boldness-for no one could mistake the American build of his vessel. But by this they got no advantage of him   whatever-a copy of their signal-book was in his hand, and he could read bunting, and talk it, as well as they. The ships having run their numbers up at their fore-truck, he had but to glance at his signal-bok and navy-list, to see that the dou- ble-decked frigates 'iThundeerer" and "Etna" were, coming in range of him. "What schooner is thatT" asked they, in '"Ti. ' Tyrannicide '--a prize to His Majes- t" ship L Bristol,' bound home with dispatch- '." rpl,-d Seawaif, also by signal, long before I tire otler vessels were in liail. A\   I1i' tood steadily on his course, and t rtw,..1 1no signs of alarm or of a disposition t t  - eva:Ie the frLi a.tes, and this reply talled with 1 tk r- evideitly American build and rig, the cilws of the frigates, which had been called to n quarters. were piped down, and preparations f uakle ou boa nl of them to shorten sail.   "You will heave to, to take our letter-bags! was the next signal from the leading frigate, to which Seawaif answered: ," All right--we will." As usual, the crew and officers of the schooner, yclving with unfaltering confidence on him who had so far led them only to victory, thlrough every ldanger, were as calm and comrposed as he appeared to be, and in him not a trace of anxiety or agitation could be seen. In a little while, one of the frigates was rounding to, not more than a half musket-shot to windward of him, while the other was doing the same so close under his lea, that her com- nuander easily hailed him without a trumpet. '"What officer corlmmands the prize?" he asked, for though he had recognized the British uniforms through his glass, he did not recog- ntiz the officers. "Lieutenant .Sinclair, late of the ' Tartar,' which was wrecked on Bermuda reef, a t1w weeks ago, sir!" said Setwaif, readily. "I thought I was some on lying, but the cap'n takes the rag clean off my bush!" said Doolittle, delighted at witnessing such perfec- tion in the art. In a minute, tIhe frigate had fallen too far to . leeward to have her commander's voice heard; and as they expected, of course, to see the schooner heave to, they only busied themselves in taking inl their own sail, and getting their letter-bags and boats ready. Easing his bow-lines'a trifle, and giving the sails a clean full, the schooner shot ahead with a speed which was rapidly carrying her out of rairge to windward of the frigates, and site had got, full a mile and a half ahead before it secured to be noticed by themr that she had not come to. Then their bunting was scen running up in a hurry. t"leave to-we waint to send letters, home by ynou!" was thie signal made. "Haven't time!" wnas the reply which soon fluttered from the schooner's mast-head. A gun was fired to windward from the near- est fr'igate,whilch now braced up her mIainl yards, which had been thrown aback. The schooner was now out of ordinary rans, and Seawaif proudly gave orders to hoList the American flag over the English, that theV might see how nicely, his Yankee wit haul given him the weather-gage. Scarcely had he done so, before the friigau. opened her entire broadside upon hilnt; but, fortunately, not a single shot tourched the vessel. though some dropped close aboard. "Y'on may give him nae blessing from long Tom, Mr. Brownell I' said the American ccri- mander, " and then. we'll drop company with themri. They're not profitable  crustomers there's more hard knocks than prize-money to be got fromn them!" The old gunner carefully sighted his gun, anrd sent his iron messenger so truly, that thbr fore-yard of the frigate was seen to part in tire elings, sending the t'ore-aail and fore-topsail al'  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6983-00000034"/> adrift, and, of course, injuring the headway of the ship. Night was now drawing on, and the 'wind rising fast. So Seawaif ordered the top-gal- lant sails in, and the guns secured, for he had a clear weather-gage of the enemy, and was safe from their pursuit. Soon darkness came on, and then, first order- ing every light put out,'he bore away, and steered the course which he had been on when the brig was first sighted, for the Island of Cubai, where lie intended to take in water, and give his men a run on shore, preparatory to a cruise toward the windward islands. CHAPTER   LnI. Two weeks after Seawaif had so nicely fooled the two English frigates, his beautiful vessel lay in the quiet and lonely bay of Matanzas; and, well provided with money, his crew, one half at a time, were allowed to go on shore for recreation. If there was one single thing beyond his favorite dish of pork and molasses which Mr. Doolittle delighted in, it was the " olla podrida" which none but the Spanish can make. It was rather too rich a dish to suit the doctor--who, though something of a gourmand in his way. preferred a oulct fricassee, or a soup de buj' maigre, or an omelette souffle, to either Doolittle's choice, or the dish familtle of Spain. Yet they were destined to dine together on the "first day that they visited the shore, and the only dish placed before them was that com- pounded of everything, known as " 011la Po- drida." Into this Mr. Doolittle pitched with an car- nestness which, if it excited no wonder in the servants at the "Posaua del Estrangeros,'" aroused a more evident passion in the breast of the worthy doctor.  "You partak of zis (jinnare wiz one grand appetite, Messieur Dooletel!" said the sur- geon, turning up his sharp nose, as if its flavor did not strike him very agreeably. "Sartain! Good grub ahlays makes me hungry!" said the lieutenant, helping himself to a fresh plate-full.  "For ze benefit of science, I desire to know of you one sing, very much, Messieur Doo- "What's that, doctor?" "It is, sare-excuse me, and do not take offence-it is, wezzare or not your stomach ex- tend down to vdur- feet, like ze marrow of oz bone, for mani- time I have observe zat you eat more zan it seem possible in nature zat your stomach shall contain!" 1"Darnation I Do you mean to insult me again, doctor?

But one sing I assure you ; if ever I 'ave ze honor'to see you without life,   I shall examine you, post mortem, to see wez- zare or not you 'ave an extension of ze stom- ach!" "Thank you for nothini' doctor-I hope you'll never have the chance!" "Perhaps not for zat. But perhaps for ze amputat, yes! You will be vi-y easy for am- putat.

If ever I 'ave ze chance for amputat your leg or your arm, Messieur Dooleetel, I shall make one beautiful job I!" "Yes, if you have the chance, which I hope will be lever!" said Doolittle, rather ltestily, for he could not appreciate the pleasure which the doctor felt in doing a good job in that line. "You do not know lb  said the. doctor. "Zere is no fortune ike zeo fortulne of war. A man zat is good for nossing is as liable to be keel as one lwo is good for everysing! A an zat is lean may be ze receptacle -for lead or steel, all zc same as hcem who is fat." "Hallo! there's a gun from the schooner P" cried the lieutenant, springing from the table, and hurrying to a window firom which he had a view. of th harbor. "And there's the cornet up, a signal for all' hands aboard. 1 wonder what's fie matter, now!' I propose zat we shall go and see!" said the doctor; and after settling for their unfin- ished meal, the two officers hastened away. CIAPTER LIV. The gun and signal of general recall was very hastily obeyed by the officers uand wel l disciplined crew of the schooner, and as they hiprried down to the landing-place, or mole, all of tie boats of the vessel were found there - ready to take them on board. Mr. Morley himself came in charge of the boats to hasten the embarkation. "What in tarnation is the matter? What does the cap'n want us for?" asked Mr. I)oo. little of Morley, as he arrived, almost breath less at the landing-place. "There is a whole British fleet outside and coming in, and as they are none too apt to re- spect neutral waters, the captain wishes all hands on board, for we may have to fight our way out!" I wish old Nick had 'om! They've spoiled my dinner-I was up to my eyes in the best mess that ever a hungry chap worked jaws on, when I heard the' gun and saw the cornet!" growled the lieutenant - "More John-Bull mens-'more fight, eh  Messieur Morley?" asked the doctor. "Yes, sir-tthere's a fair1 showing for it, as the woman said when her husband capsized the wash-bowl!" "Eh, bien! I care riossing zat I lose my dinnare, if by-and-by I can recompense wiz a chance for 'tamputat!" said the doctori as he sprung into a boat.  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6983-00000035"/> The schooner lay at anchor some ways down the harbor; and close under the guns of the fort, which stands on the starboard hand. seen whln yu von tire cotlingin, But the crews pulled at their oars with a will, and in a very short tlme all hainds were on board of the gallant lif tie craft, which had already been niade ready for action, if a neceisity for such an act should occur. HeIr guns, double-shotted, were run out-springs were on her cable, and she lay broadside to anything which could approach her from the sea, as now were some half-dozen chips of various sizes, under the lead of a dou- ble-decker, which carried a commodore's pen- nant. "TlThere is our old friend, the ' Bristol!'" said Se-awaif to Doolittle, as he pointed to the leading shifp, which was now standing up the h:arbur, ald was not a half mile distant. "Itarul ltion! So 'tis!" said the lieutenant. 'I a1ioul,ln't wonder if they tried to take us right here on neuter ground, just for spite!" They will hardly dare to so act in the face of the law of nations!" said Seawaif. "But if they do att-mlpt it, no hostile foot shall' press this deck while I live! If they try to take us, I will fight to the last gast), and sink with my colors flying! lloist every flag to its place!" Seawaif wats not conscious that his 'eelings had earried hm so far beyond his usual cotm- posure, that lie liad spoken loud enoutgh to be heard by most of the crew, until three hearty cheers biur-t from their lips in response to his words; "I thanik you, miy 1 :'bave lads!" he said, itn reply to this demons!.r:ttion. "I know that you'll stand by mie Yo long as one flank of our bonny craft floats above water!!" "* Ay, that we will, sir!" was the shout; and when their nmotto-fligr wa:s unfurled to the. breez,, ;.':ini they reut the air with their loud aind fearleiss cheers. While fbis occurred, the British shits were ranging Iup) into the anellorage, and one by one, Ilarely out of cable's lengtl of dhe schooner, they came to :tn annchor. Scaiwxaif who, with glis glass in hand, was closely watching. theirt niovnict-nts. saw that, with r ngry and sullen looks, many nn officer ont the 'different ves- seNS a Is likewise occupied in regurding his craft and her proud and saucy flags. Soon he obscrvcd sign:als hoisted on the flag-ship. Sending for his (t signal-book," lie began to rnad them. Tlhe signal was: (  Tile captains of the fleet will conime on board of the flag-ship to attend, a coutneil of war."              i "So, they are going to hold a consultation, and see wihether it is best to attempt to take nme in the harbor of a neutralnation!" mut- o tered Seawaif. "I hope theyll have a    good t time in their deliberations."  Scarcely were the sails of the differetit ships furled, before a boat left each of them, with I her commander, in obedience to the signal. a Seawaif now  deemed it best to send Mr.    n Morley on shore, to inform the commander of ie the fort that he considered himself, by the laws n of neutrality, under the protection of his guns; d and as the Spaniards of that island were by no t means friendly to the English, he hoped to be it informed, in reply, that the fort would not y tamely permit his rights to be outraged. After the consultation of officers on board n the flag-ship had been called for an hour or y more, a boat was seen coming from the "Bris- li tol" toward the "Tyrannicide." A lieutenant, a in full uniform and armed, was in the boat. - Seawaif retired to his cabin, giving orders to -Mr. Doolittle to receive the officer, and also to have the crew at their quarters, so that the lieutenant could report on his return that the schooner was ready for action, if it was forced 3 upon her. The British officer came alongside, and was permitted to cotme on board, but Mr. Doolittle informed him that the boat's crew must remain in their boat, and not offer to come aboard, "I wish to see your captaiin, sir," said the officer. "I have a message for him from Com- modore Sir Peter Parker." "It can be communicated through me," said Mr. Doolittle. "Captain Seawaif will hold no commtuttnitcation with a person of less rattk than himself." "I'd like to know who gave him a coummnis- sion," said the oficer, wiith a sneer. "The American Congress, sir," replied Doo- little. "And you had better be a little re- spectful here, or you may be sent back to your master with a flea in your car!" "I wish to see your captain," said the lieu- tenant. "You can't do it! You're an epaulet short of his rank, and can't shine!" said Doolittle, sarcastically. "Then tell him that Sir Peter Parker wants to see him on board of the ' Bristol!' " "  Umph! I'll tell him; but it's my private ,9)pinion publicly expressed, young man, that if your Sir Peter had sore eyes, and seeing my captain on board of his vessel would cure them, lie'd suffer a long time before they got well." And with this, Mr. Doolittle went into the cabin. "Your men are at quarters, as if they were ready for action, sir!" said the British officer to Morley. "Yes, sir-it is a rule with the commander of this vessel to be prepared for every emer- gency!" replied Morley. "Surely, he would not lie so mad- as to re- sist our fleet, if it was decided that he should be taken?" "Yes, sir-mad enough to sink with his col- ors flying, before he would haul them down at the command of the minions of tyranny!" said Morley, proudly. "Cap'n Seawaif sends his respects to Sir Peter Parker, and says, if that gentleman has a desire to see him, he can do so by coming on board of this vessel. And, moreover, Captain   Seawaif will guaranty an honorable reception, hospitable treatment, and a safe return to Sir Peter, should he choose to visit the schooner!" ' Well-I've heard of inmpudence, but if this is not ahead of all record, may I never taste toddy again!" said the officer. "Do you know what reply I would make to such a messenger, were I Sir Peter Parker?" - I neither know nor care!" said Doolittle, quietly. "I'd reply with a broadside, and sink you at your anchors!" said the lientenant. "And feel as mean and sne akking afterward as a big lummux would, who'd struck a woman or licked a cripple!" said Doolittle. The British officer made no reply, but passed over the side, entered his boat, and returned to the English flag-ship, whither we will follow him for a moment. CHAPTER LV. The majority of the English captains had counseled, upon the question being -put to tihem, to' seize, or, if she resisted, to sink the Ameri- can schooner where she lay, even though it was in neutral waters and under the guns of a friendly fort. She had been recognized as the vessel which had done more damage, to the royal cause than any other ten in thei rebel service ; and it seemed almost a necessity, as well as a point of honoi', to destroy a foe so dangerous and full of mischief- The commodore, in this case, was not with the majority. If he had been, lihe would not have called the council, but acted under the influence of his own imtperious will' and fiery disposition. "I doubt the legality of the act!" said lie. "Did I not, I would blow the bloody ' pica- roon' out of water! But the colonies have got so strong through recent success, that their in- depemldence eitlher is, or soon will be, recognized by all the-great powers, and we must fight on rule, or else we'll get ourselves into a box we can't haul out of so easily." The predominant " fire-eaters" were not dis- posed to consider the schooner in any light but that of a pirate, whom it would be next to God's service to destroy ; but Sir Peter, who had done as old ZACHARY TAYLOR did-bless him! for he was my godfather in the baptism of blood-called a council to learn what his officers thought, not how he should act, deter- mined to-send a message to the schooner, and see what the commander would say in his pres- And while the officer was g}one upon that duty, aeorditug( to the custom not yet abol- ishead in the British service-cxpcrientia doceft- the iolly old commodore placed his spiritual stores' at the service of his confreres- - Menuiwhile, he paced up and down his quar- ter-deck, awaiting the reply which his lienten- nnt should bring. When the latter reached the quarter-deck of the "- Bristol,' the commodore asked:   "Well, sir, what does the deuced Yankee have to say?" "Sir Peter, his reply is so impudent, that I hesitate to repeat it!'" t( If you could receive it; sir, it will not en. danger you to deliver it," said Sir Peter, sternly. "- Well, sir, the long and the short of my re- port is, that Captain Seawaif, who would not receive me because I wore but one swalb,' while he wore two, sent word to you, that if you wanted to see him, you must come on board of his schooner!" "Well, that caps the climax of impudence!" - said Sir Peter. "Yet, nevertheless, 'Il go. I like the fellow's pluck, though it will bring hinm to the yard-arm, in the end!" "I would advise you not to go, commodore!" said the lieutentant. ," Ilia men are at their quarters ; but I will do Diim the justice to say, tlhat lie sent word that yqu should receive hos- pitalle welcome, and be guaranteed a safe re- turn." H"have. my barge manned;-I will go on board and try his mettle 1" said Sir Peter. It was done; and, in a short time, in full uni- formn, the commodore was in his barge, and on his way to the s6hooner. CHAPTER LVI. When it was seen by Seawaif that the com- modore was indeed coming in person to pay him a visit, he ordered his officers in uniform, to be prepared to receive him, and also bade his steward to prepare refreshments in the His drummers and fifers were ordered to the gangway to receive the visitor with the" grand roll'. and all was done to make the reception as proper as possible. But Seawaif, determined to stand upon his republican dignity to the last, anmid not even to recognize the-s&amp;evant of a king as his equal, remained in his cabin, and deputed his officers to receive the commodore.    / As the latter stepped on board the schooner, while the drummers " rolled off" and the guard of honor presented arms, he was received with raised ehapeaux by Doolittle, Morley,- and the doctor. "Have I the honor of addressing Captain 'Seawaif?" said he, with a sarcastic politeness, as lie bowed to Mr. Doolittle. "No, sir-but if you'll walk into the cabin, he'll be glad to see you!" : The commodore's face flushed with anger, thtough he made no reply, but followed Doo- little to the cabin.-  As he entered it, Seawaif, who was dressed in a neat and handsome uniform, rose to re- ceive him. "Good Heavens I Can the grave give up its * Lietutenants in the British service, as they did, in f ),tr navy until recently, wore btt one " swab" or etp- auh.;t, w'hilc the c:ptaiua wyr V: one Un eCchU slioutlr.  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6983-00000036"/> d'al?" crcel the English noble, as he started back, while his face paled and his whole frame quivered with agitation. "Who are you, !r?" "Edward Seawaif, commander of the Ameri- can privateer ' Tyrannicide 1'" said the young captain, utterly at a loss to account for the Siugular expression and agitation of his vis- itor. "Resemblances are often accidental!" mut- tered Sir P'ter, to himself. Then, in a louder tone lie added ; - You must excuse me, cap- tain Seawaif, your looks reminded me of an old friend. But we'll not speak of that. I come on business. You sent me rather an impudent message; but I like your courage, even though you exhibit it in a bad cause; and I thought I'd humor you so far as to come on board!" "You are very welcome as a visitor, if your purpose is frieouly, sir!" said Seawaif. "Be seated, sir, and permit me to offer a glass of wine!" "Thank you, sir! If you are as chivalrous in battle us 'yo are polite under these circum- stances, you are a very dangerous foe." "'.ir l'etr is disposed to flattery!" said Sea- Waif, quietly. "Either in battle, or in any other position, I hope that I shall never forget the courtesy of a gentleman!" After taking wine, the conmmodore said: "The most unpleasant portion of my duty, Captain Seawaif, will be to ask, though in kindly words, the surrender of your vessel." "The most pleasant part of my duty, Sir Peter, and it is also expressed in ' kind words,' wi!l be to refuse to do so I! This vessel is now In neutral watere. If you do not respect them, mny men are at their quarters, and will fight her until she sinks I But if any one of your ships will give me a fair fight on blue water, I'll go to sea and meet her, and let Heaven decide the right!" The old commodore seemed at first to be struck dumb with astonishment. "Surely you are mad, sir!" he cried, at last. "The guns of my fleet would sink you in five minutes if fire was opened." "Yes, sir.-but if they did, retribution would follow. I have claimed the protection of neu- trality from the fort." "Blast it and its protection I I could silence its batteries in five minutes!" "Perhaps, Sir Peter. But I should suppose the memory of Charleston would make you a little cautious about attacking forts "  "  There's a difference between a fort manned i with skulking Diegos, and one occupied by A  merican rebels, who fight with a rope around their necks!" said the commodore, paying an y involuntary compliment to the rebels. " If I I should decide to take you, I'd do it if you I were under the guns of the Moro Castle, in- stead of this petty fort! But I will think of r the matter. If you will surrender your vessel, I think that I can safely offer to your and your   d ' officers and crew a full pardon; and to yo ta o ; rank as high in the British service as you now I, hold in your own." "I am not aware of having merited this last insult, sir!" said Seawaif, coloring with anger. No bribe can purchase me, nor can any threat intimidate! I will defend this vessel to the - last gasp-so help me Heaven! and before she shall become your prize, I will put fire to her magazine: with my own hand! If you will force me to final desperation, the blame be upon your own head. But all that I ask, and ' II repeat the challenge, sir, is a fair fight out- side, and if any one vessel of your fleet can toaster me there, I will yield to her! Othcr- wise, I remain here in safety, or fight where 1 ;lie, as you may force me to do!" "You are a brave young man! 1 respect, while I pity you for the obstinacy which will be your destruction!" said the commodore, as he took his leave. CHAPTER LVIL Seawaif attended his disinguished visitor to the gangway, where he was ushered to his boat with all the usual honors and ceremonies given to and received by officers of his rank in regular navies-music, presented arms, and six side-boys to pass the hand-ropes; and there our young commander parted with him, as courteously as if he had been a warm friend instead of a foe, yet with a dignity that com- pletely won the heart of the aristocratic old nobleman and commodore. "  Leave the rebel cause, and you shall be a captain in our service!" he said, in a low tone, as he stood on the first round of the gangway ladder. Seawaif smiled coldly, but made no reply. "1Morris is dead; and you might, if in His Majesty's service, yet hope to win a prize that you sought for at Bermuda!" continued the commodore. "I will not affect to misunderstand you, air; and will even believe, that zeal, rather than intention, causes you to insult me by such a proposition. Were I to nat dishonor- ably, or prove a recreant to a cause, which my heart tells me is holy and just, she, and alt true women, would scorn me-you., sir, who would tempt me to become a traitor, would detest me when I had become one!" P"On my soul, I believe I would!" said Sir Peter, who. even though involuntarily, could not but admirethe stern integrity of the young American. And he pressed the hand of Seawaif, as he went down the side into his boat, and bowed kindly after he had got there, though he did not speak again. "What d'ye think will be the eend of this matter, cap'n?" asked Mr. Doolittle, after the British commodore had left him. "Fight!" said Seawaif, abruptly. Then, a   he turned to go into the cabin, he added: 1 "Watch every signal, and every boat that leaves the flag ship, and report to me instant- i ly any unusual sign or motion I1" "Ay, ay, sir" " "Alh, ha! more fight-- more amputat? I  am much rejoice!" said the doctor, striding s up and down the quarter-deck, and rubbing 1 his hands together in glee. 'Ah, Meslieur c Dooleetle, if in ze fortune of war you should 1 lose one arm or one leg, it will afford me more pleasbre to amputat zem zan you can irmaginde; because, my frent, it. will be done wiz all ze precision and ze beauty of science  ' "I'm etarnally obleeged to you, doctor;  but I hope I'll lose my head first of all, and then you can amputate on the rest of me all that you like!" "Eh bien I I shall dissect your stomach, zat I mwy observe how it is possible zat you digest so well ze beans, and ze pork, and mo- lasses!?" And with this, the doctor went into the ca- bin, not waiting to observe the effect of this home-thrust at the lieutenant's gastronomic taste and habits. Meanwhile, Mr. Morley, who had visited the commandant of the Spanish fort, returned to make his report. He informed Seawaif, that the commandant would be glad to afford the protection demanded, if he had the power; but with his small battery he could do no- thing against such a force as the British ex- hibited. But if they fired upon him, he, the commandant, would certainly remonstrate with them; and if the schooner was destroyed or taken, the fact should most assuredly be re- ported to the home government. '"This. is cold comfort, as the fellow said, who made his bed in a snow-drift; but we must endure what we cannot avoid, I pre- sume we shall be attacked; if so, I shall de- fend the vessel so long as a man lives 'on board 1" said Seawaif. "And not an officer or man on board will shrink from the contest, no matter how great the odds-of that rest assured l" said the young officer. "I know it-God bless them II know it I Go on deck, and keepa look-out for the move- ments of the enemy; and call-' me xupon-ob- serving. anything remarkable 1" said Seawaif, his tone and look evincing his intense feeling. The officer hastened to obey, and Seawaif, taking down a chart of the Cuban coast, its harbors and bays, began to scan it carefully- perhaps with a thought thereby to aid himself mn forming some plan to escape the great peril in which he foundr himself. As he ran his eye over the tracings marking out the bay in which he then lay at anchor, his eye flashed with pleasure, as he glanced upon the winding-mara .of ,a stream, laid out as "deep and narrod," which, by the chart, lay upon the opposite side of the harbor or   bay from wlhere he lay, on nearly a due south- erly course, and not more than six miles die-' tant. After looking nt-the chart for a little while, he went upon deck, and taking a spy-glass, very carefully scanned the shore on the oppo- site side of the bay. So " blind" was the en- trance of the "Rio Canima" marked on his chart, that he could not see a sign of it from his deck. But he had proved the chart else- where, and knew it to be true; and that, bear- ing south, three or four degrees west, lay the entrance, which, were he once within it, would enable him to lay his broadside to all comers, and to defend his little vessel to advantage again her monster opponents. To get into that ittle river, therefore, was his only hope, if his enemies meditated an at- tack; for they had anchored in line, and so closely, that his escape to seaward would be a matter of impossibility, even in the darkness of the night, which was then rapidly approach-. it g. To know whether or not they did meditate an attack, was now most important to him. He was not left long in suspense on that point. After a delay of an hour or more, a boat wag seen to leave the flag-ship, and to row toward the schooner. Very soon after, the command- ers of the different vessels returped to their ships, thus showing that the council had ad- journed. An officer in the first-named boat brought to Seawaif a letter, of which the following is a copy: "Young man, you are brave, courteous-and, in a' bad cause, have already proved yourself a hero. And, although it is almost criminal in me to express admir- ation for a rebel, I cannot conceal, that I have seen enough of you to feel a deep interest in you, and to' hope to have it ih my power to save you and your brave men from utter destruction, This evening, my captains, without a dissenting voice, excepting only my own; voted to consider you a pirate, and .destroy you as such, even though in the waters of 'a friendly I nation. To have opposed this positively, would have-  brought a suspicion of disloyalty upon myself, which would have been iumerited. I could, therefore, only insist upon a suspension of action until sun-rise to- morrow morning, to give you time for consideration; when, if you do not deem it best to surrender your vessel and crew unharmed, as they now arC, it will ioc my painful duty to order tmy batteries opened upon her; and as she' lies completely in our power, you know, as well as myself, what will be' the result. For your own sake, promising my influence to secure you a free pardon, I entreat you:to surrender. In human- ity's name, I ask you to save your crew from a fate which they do not deserve; for brave men ought not to resist hopelessly or die mercilessly. Make no im mediate reply, but think of my offer; and, if at sun rise your vessel is seen without her colors hoisted, we' f will consider it a surrender, and treat you with kind- ness and consideration as prisoners of war. PsaER PIRKBRA, "Baronet and Commodore S. B. M. N." A sarcastie smile flitted over the face of the I young commander more than once while he t read this letter; and he mnurured : "Not so ;, muqh in your power, Sir Peter, as you'dream r -but the time is importantP"  &#xD;<pb n="72-73 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6983-00000037"/> "Tell your comnmodore, sir!' he said to the officer who had brought the letter, that I will consider upon itg contents. Should I con- clude to accept his conditions, he will know it by the sign he mentions-if not, tell him to take me if he can!" The officer bowed, and would have retired at once, but Seawaif politely insisted upon his taking a glass of wine with him. "It is hardly safe to take wine with Captain Seawaif!" saidf the officei, who had been one of those who slept under spiritual influence at Bermuda. "When I entertain, it is, sir!" said Seawaif. smiling. "I will join you from the same bottle!'

'liisB don,., bearing only a verbal mbessage from Seawaif, and that one most calculated to disarm the commodore from any suspicions that he meant to escape-he returned to the flag-ship. And by this time, the shades of evening were descending; from the sun-deperted skv, and wrapping earth in their sonib,re n'intles. CIIAPTEI:  LVIII.

But that yarn has no bmi'i- nessF he rco It was morning; and the schooner lay in ; clieimtel of clear, hlui h, fresh water, scarcely her length in width, but' many feet in depth.  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6983-00000038"/> Above her, on either hand, towered rocky precipices three times her mast-head high, al- most perpendicular, yet so covered with vines, and shrubs, and flowers, that scarce a rock could be seen, and the hill-sides looked like curtains of flowers) lowered down from heaven to hide the fugitives from tyranny from view. Birds of varied and of gaudy plumage flew all around, and filled the air with melodyS The square-yards of the schooner had been braced sharp, eo as to avoid touching. the lofty shore, and now the schooner was laid with her broadside down the stream-a matter easy to do, for the. current was very gentle. After dispatching a boat, with iMr. Morley in charge, to watch the movements of the British fleet, Seawaif bade his crew take rest until they were needed, for they had labored nearly all the night to place their vessel in that harbor of safety. It was morning. -And Sir Peter Parker, who -could'scarcely account for the deep, strange interest which he felt in the hero ofthhis, tory -an interest which I hope is also felt by the reader-was at the dawn of day upon his quar- ter-deck, gazing toward the spot where he had last seen the schooner on the night before, but where, to his utter astonishment, she now was rnot. Only a sp ar, with a dimlantern upon it, oc- cupied the -position which she had filled. The officers and sentinels, who had been on Watch during the night, were instantly called, "and closely iquestioned ; but all persisted that they' had not helard a single Eound during the night-not the rustle of a sail, the rattle of a chain or rope-not the creak of a block. The schooner had disappeared in some way, as silently as if by magic. But whither she was gone was quite as much a mystery as not. Signal was at once made for the captainpof the fleet to reassemble in the cabin of the flag- -ship. Soon all-had arrived, and each reported that no sound or sign of a passing vessel had been heard on board of their shils. ",It is impossible that she could lhave slipped us- all and gone to sea! The line of vessels was anclhored so completely across the chan- nel, that she could lnot have passed unseen, or at least unhlcard!" said the commodore. t"The deiced Yankees are more slippery than eels 1" said one of the captains. 1"ButI do not think it possible that she could have got to sea without treachery or absolute--caroe lessnc-es onl the part of some of our look-outs!" t"Isn't there some 'iiook or bay up the har- horin which she could, by dropping up with the tide, have hidden?" asked another old sea- fox. "i We will examine the chart!" said the com- modore. 1- have looked carefully with the glass ovcr every inch of water in sight, and ouIld ee u- signl of her-not a spar or sail in   sight-nothing to show of her butthe anchoried spar and lantern!" The chart of the harbor was brought, and soon the old "fox" just alluded to put his dumpy finger down on the spot marked out as "El Rio Canima." "I'll bet a month's pay that she has crawled in there during the night. The soundings are deep, and it is just the place for a small craft to hide away in!" "It will be easy to'find out if she has or not!" said the commodore. "Yes, sir-a confoulided sight moie easy tlan it will be to take her if the little river is too small for our ships to enter, as I judge froni what is laid down in the chart!" "If she is there, she must be taken!" said the commodore, sternly; and lie at once or- dered two armed boats to be sent with active and trusty officers to inspect the river, and see if the schooner had indeed found a harbor there* The officer in command was instructed merely to reconnoitre, and not to endanger himself or men unnecessarily; but if he found that the vessel was there, to return at once and report the fact. CHAPTER LX. The boat in which Eugene Morley haa been sent to the mouth of the narrow and beautiful river, that he might keep an eye upon the movements of the British fleet, had scarcely reached a spot whence lie could see their- ves sels, when his eye caught sightof the two boats sent by Sir Peter Parker to reconnoitre. He and his boat's crew were well armed, and had the advantage of being able to land and conceal themselves, had lhe so desired, but young Morley was not one of the hide-away class of men. He laid his boat across the mouth of the river) and waited the advance of the British boats, "Buenos dies, senor!" said the officer in the' leading boat, as it came within hailing distancee "I am not a Spaniard ; you can address me in your own language, and receive a reply in the same!" said Morley, calmly,  "Ah A!-are yon English?" asked the officer. "No, sir--American!" replied Morley. "Then, perhaps, you can tell me where the privateer lies, which left her anchorage in the bay last night."  "She, lies where it will not be safe for any one to molest her!' said Morley, quietly. "I should like to have youspeak a little more definitely, sir!" said the officer. "I was sent to discover the whereabouts of the sclioon- er, and do not intend to returii until' my duty has been performed to the letter  Is the schooner in this river?" "It is formyou to find out!') said Morley. "That we will soon do!" said the officer, angrily. "I believe I should not exceed my duty, were I to take you-and your boat in mv d were I to tak, you  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6983-00000039"/> charge ; but as my ordrs do not extend so far, I refrain!" 'To refrain, when my consent to such a matter has not been given, is wisdom on your part. But to gain the knowledge you desire, you need go no further!" sail Morley, who did not wish to have the officers know the po- sition of the schooner, lest, if an attack was meditated by the boats of the squadron, it would benfit t:hem to know how she lay. "The vessel you seek is in this river, and it would be policy, on the part of your master, to let her alone!" "He is not in the habit of either asking or taking advice!" said the officer, haughtily. - If your leader had known when he was well off, lie would have surrendered when he could, without offering a resistance which, against such odds, will be useless! I advise him still to do it; for if blood is once shed, I doubt whether quarter will be given from our side!" It surely will not be solicited from ours!" said Morley. And thus the boats separated ; for no sooner had the British started toward their vessels than Morley hastened to convey the informa- tion which lhe had gained to Seawaif. "I expected little else!" said the American captain. "It is necessary to them that we zhould be extinguished; but it wiil give them mure trouble than they are aware of. They never shall have the schooner;- for if the worst comes to the worst, I'll land my men, anid blow her up ." "If you will not think- me impertinent, sir, I would like to offer you a suggestion," said Morley. 1 Speak on, my dear boy-I have great con- fidence in your judgment." "If you would permit, sir, I will t:ake twelve or fifteen of our best shots, and station them at points well up among the cliffi, which I no- ticed as we came up; from which, though hid- den themselves from view, they cnn pour ill a %ery destructive fire on the enemyv, a they as- cend the channel in their boats."' "The idea is good, and we have more men than we need on board, for we can use only one battery. Pick out your men, and go aliead; but keep them and' yourself out of danger as much as you can. The sound of your guns will warn me of the approach of the enemy!" The preparations for a desperate defnce on the part of tlihe Americans was now made; and after all was ready on board, Mr. Doolittle was sent with two boats, to land Morley and his men at the designated points, and also to look out on the bay, and report the time and manner of approach of the enemy. And now all was ready for action. And as the sun went up, the day, which had dawned with a fresh and fragrant air, began to be hot aud stifling--so close that, though lying in that narrow channel between the hills, he could sa. but little of the sky, Seawaif predicted that a hurricane was at hai,   :A UR, uO  TL  U-AST-. Tha doctor, while the preparations for sf- tion had been going on on deck, had been him- self busy below, and he now came up with a smiling face and most contented air. "Everysing is prepare for ze amputat!" said he. "I shall desire zat we 'ave one grand com- bat wiz ze John-Bull mens zis time!" Seawaif smiled quietly, and then a flush came over his countenance, as he heard first a signal gun, then rapid shots, and quickly fol- lowing, volleys of musketry, but a short dis- tance down the river. The next moment Doolittle appeared with his boats, which were fastened on the up-river side of the schooner in a few seconds, and their crews transferred to her decks. "They're a comin', cap'n-a whole squad o' boats; more'n I had time or a chance to count!" "Very well, sir I We are ready for them I Run up our colors--we will receive them with all the honors!" replied Seawaif. CIHAPTER LXI. The British boats approached in column, four abreast, very rapidly, until they reached time mouth of the river, where only two could row in side by side. Here they lay on their oars, and the commanding officer passed hisi final orders to each officer, and then bade his men to row on. They had not proceeded more than sixty or seventy yards, when the stroke oarsman gave a low groan, and dropping his oar, bounded up from his sent, and tlthen fell back dead among the men. The sharp crack of a gun, and a puff of smoke from away up amid the thick bushes, in an overhanging cliff. told whence came that death. But it came not alone; for, in a moment more, shot after shot caime pattering down, bringing death at every instant from the lofty coverts, though no manu could be seen there, nor yet a single cry to in- timate who or what was there. Though the boats were thrown into great con- fusion, scattered volleys were fired from them up among the bushes; but, of course, at ran- dom, for no object for aim could be seen. But the continued fire from the bushes told with deadly effect upon the officers and men in the boats. Many of them had fallen, when the second in'command-the first had been slain- shouted to his men to land and drive the reb- els from their holes. Ordering his coxswain to steer his boat irn. its prow had barely touched the shore, when a huge rock, loosened from above, came tum- bling with fearful force down the steep hill- side, plunging through the bottom of his boat, killing and maiming several men in its passIa,',. He bad barely time to spring into anotfher boat before his own sank; and he now gave the order to push on up the stream, for there was death in delay ; and he did not dare to re- treat without having engaged the schooner. They moved on asfast as they could, but ever and anon a white puff of smoke would beloh   *o ut from the hill-side; and when it did, a,man ,o' officer was sure to fall. But in a few moments they caught sight of the tall spars and gay colors of the schooner, and dashed on with a loud cheer. On board the vessel, all now was still as 4death ; but her guns fi'owning from their ports, the boarding-nettings triced up-all told that she was ready. There was a straight reach in the river of a bhout two hundred yards, after turning a point which brought the schooner in sight; and up this, though they knew the race was in the cry pathway of death, the boats were rowed by the unflinching crews, with all their strength. Every gun was depressed on board the schooner so as to sweep that 'channel. Each piece was. loaded almost to the muzzle, with grape, canister, and musket balls. "It is a pity to murder brave men in the way I must!" imurnmured Seawaif. Then, wil- ling to give them a chance to retreat, he shouted through his trumpet: Black, there! Back, for your lives!" A scornful cheer rdse from the6 lips of the British. For more than two-thirds of them, it wns the last cry on earth. For, as Seawaif waved his hand to his gunners, with one lurid, thnding flasl--one united, deafening tioar, the whole battery opened, when the leading boats mwere not half pistol-shot - away from them, ,:a;king the very hills sh'ake with, the thunder-' in g echoes and the dreadful concussion. L" oad, and prepare to repel boarders!" shouted Seaw aif; and then hle and his men peered out into the night-like canopy of smoke "1011 the river, whence a few- stilled shrieks a;nd groans arose to tell that all were not dead a1mong thie enemny. Then, though they could not be seen for the smnoke, rallving cries could be heard from lthe British officers, and renewed cheers, as if reiin- forcements had come up; and soon, through the gloom, came the quick, sharpdash of oars iagain. "Stand to your guns, men-don't raise a snatch till I give the word '" cried Seawaif. A momrent later, and the heads of several boats were ecen in the smoke, close aboard. "Fire!" shouted the American leader. And again the earth, and  ir', 'and water trembled with the terrible shock-and then, but for a few wild shrieks, a few bubbling groans, a few sad cries of agony, all was still beneath that slr oud of smoke-that canopy of death.                - The crew of the schooner reloaded their battery quickly, without waiting for orders; but they had no occasion for another broad- side. A few scattering shots, far. down the river toward the bay, told that the survivors were in full retreat, and once more- running the gauntlet of Morley's merciless battery marks- men. The smoke slowly rose, and upon the water nothing could be seen but the wreck of boats,   and here anid theie some wounded wretch cling- ing to a shattered plank, or else struggling by the shore, to grasp some bush or overhanging branch, to keep from sinking in the blood-en- sanguined river. "Ah! mon scalpel!--see zem mens wizout arms, and wizout legs. Do preserve zem for me, zlat I may have ze pleasure of amputat!" cried La Motte, as he saw these maimed wretches. "Ah 1 mon cher capitaine, let me go quick-quick in 'one boat!" Seawaif laad scarcely bowed permission be- fore the doctor had leaped into a boat, and, not waiting to have it fully manned, had pushed off to fish up subjects for amputation, and the practice of his surgical skill. In a few seconds, he had picked up several; but as his boat lay alongside of the shore, under a huge cluster of broad-leafed vines and foliage, he was destined to be " picked up " in a way which terrified him almost to death; for a huge serpent of the constrictor S pecies, drop- ping from amid the foliage, wound its immense coils around-the doctor's-lank body, and bring- ing its hideous head into close contact with his own, seemed, with his open mouth, about to swallow him sans ceremonie. "Help!' shrieked the horror-stricken French- man. "I am keel wiz ze snake-help I.-I am keel wiz ze snake!" Though the men were also. much terrified at this unexpected visitation,-one or two of them had sufficient iresesnce of mind to use their sharp cutlasses in liberating the doctor from the hildeous embrace; and in a few moments he was free, and the shiny reptile lay ill pieces in the Boat, or overboard. But the doctor was completely unnmaned. lie did not look for more sulieets ; but still almost fainting from Ilis terror, begged the crew to row him back to the schooner, quickly. "What is the matter, doctor?" asked Sea- waif, whio had seen the whole transaction from his deck. "All! mon cher capitairie, nevare do I wish to go to ze shore in zis infernal country, any, times more. Ze diable embrace me in ze shape of a snake, and almost shoke out fmy heart. Nevare I go to ze shore here any more!" As no more British boats made their appear- ance now,'Seawaif manned and armed four or five of his own, and pulled down the river, to see what had become of them. When he arrived at its mouth, he-discovered the shattered remnant of the expedition pull- ing1 baek toward the vessels- as fast as they could, for a terrible storm was gathering, sueh an one as, in the exposed bay where they lay, would be very apt to endanger the ships. He knew that, even if it did not force them to weigh anchor and stand out to sea, it would. at least prevent a renewal, for the time, of san attack upon his vessel. But he had little fear of this when he learned from Morley, when-he lie took him and his sharp-shooters aboard, that more than four-fifths of the attacking  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6983-00000040"/> party had perished. And upon his own side, only one man of Morley's, who foolishy ex- posed himself, was killed, and two more were wounded. On hoard, not a single soul had been hurt, and the doctor's had been the only casualty. His terror was so great that he had to take several strong glasses of brandy before, zealous as he was. he became sufficiently composed to attend to the wounded British who had been picked up in the schooner's boats. Meantime, although no wind could be felt in that deep gorge between the hills, the black and driving clouds overhead, and the distant roar of the wind and surf upon the bay, told that the hurricane which Seawaif had looked for had come out in all its force. I reckon the Britishers will have their ILnils full all around!" said Mr. Doolittle, as he noticed this. "We've taken the starch ,.itL of 'emr in here, and now they're going to catch Jessie outside!" "You can take a boat, sir, and watch if they go to s'.-!" said Stawaif. "If they do, we must watch our chance, and get into btluoec wat-er too, for if they can be revenged for their lis of to-la:V, they will be, even if it costits them ai miany men as have already fallen!" Ay, v, 'r! Doctor, wouldn't you like to go along, and have another snake adventure?" Mid the lieutenant, as the doctor paused for a moment in an operation, and strengthened his nerves with another glass of brandy. "Sare! Messieur Dooleete!, I consider zat you mean an insult, when you say snake to We! Be g;ar a ire ; if evare you so observe to nel any more, I will catch one snake and make you eat Hlwm! You onnerstauid zat? Eli? If nut, I will taach you annuzt er lesson wiz y toadl stieknrn.!"' cried the doctor, almost wild with annrr. Mr. Doolittle did not care to excite him any more just then; so lie hal the boat manned, nnd started down the riv'er. in obedience to the orders of Seawaif. CIAPTER LXII. Not two hours later than the tinme of the occurr-enc-es which 0odcluded our last chapter, Mr. Doo!ttle returned with the news that the British fleet had weighed anchor or slipped th!;ir cable, and were standing out to sea, for al:: gale was most terrific in the bay, endan- ,:,r.'mbig evervthinsi within it. z'eawaif gnstautly ordered his light s pars seutdown from aloft-his guns, and evervt ling on deck to be thoroughly secured; ani then getting out his sweeps. moved slowly from the spot where he had made so gallant a defence, and where so many brave Britouns had found a watery grave. It was nearly night when he arrived with the schooner at the mouth of the river. Not a sail of the British fleet was in 'ht; but far as the eve could see, all was 'w':4: and tumultuous with the force of the   terrible storm. The bay was white with foam s, and where the surf dashed upon the shore, or broke upon the rocks, it threw the misty spray more tihan mast-head high. Seawaif saw that he could carry but scant sail,. though he had the wind free for his course out of the harbor; so, after setting up preventer stays, and close furling and securing all the rest of the canvas with extra furling-lines, he hoisted his balance-reefed mainsail and fore storm stnysail, and, with even so little canvasr shot out from under the land, like a white cloud driven athwart the sky, or a dove flying from the hawk. Soon the ever-green shores of Cuba lay far away, fading to view, and the beautiful schooner was rising and falling, plunging and heaving upon the great blue, foam-crested waves of the Gulf Stream, heading away to- ward the northw:ard and eastward, and' free from all peril save that of the wind and wave. "Sir Peter and all that are left of his crew will feel a deadly grudge against our craft after this, sir; for sihe has proved a bitter pill to, them upon every occasion!" said Morley, as Seawaif stood by him, while the schooner sped along. "She has, indeed. He would not be apt to have such mercifull interest in me again if I were to get under his guns," said 'Seawaif. "Yet he ought to hold no grudge. We have only done our duty, as men ind Americans." "True, sir; but you cannot nmke them look upon us as other than rebels." "The time will come, and that soon, when they must do so, and treat us according to the recognized rules of war among civilized na- tions. lHad they done so in ths instance, they would have been saved this last terrible lessorn which we have been frced to give them." "They deserved it all, sir. They have been utterly mnerciless to our people on shore. Burning villages, tortured prisoners, women and childreun slain by hired savages, attest that! They merit no favor!" "'True!" said Seawaif; but he sighed at the thought. CHAPTER LXIII. Almost all of the coast of England, Ireland, Wales, and Scotland, can be called "rock- bound." Much of it is very wild and danger- ous ; its few harbors bad, and in stormy wea- ther difficult of entrance. But in due tinlme the good brigc "Cornline " landed her precious "Iive freight "---or, in more select terms, de- posited Miss Lizzie Egerton and Sirllnmphrey Dorset and daughter in the port of Yarmouth, near which stood the castle which Sir Peter Parker called his home, when he was not upon the sea. To this Miss Egerton, with her voyaging companions, was soon conveyed, in a lumber- ing old family coach, that in' looks seemed to date from " the year one;" for thoughl Sir   Humphrey was intending to return to his own *deeply-mortgaged estate in Hampshire, he could not refuse to spend a few weeks at "Eaerton Castle," especially as Venona had promised and was determified to share Lizzie's imprisonment there; for both, considered a residence in such a gloomy place, iand such a lonely old pile, as little less than an imprison- ment. Perhaps a second reason for Sir Humphrey's being very willing to endure a short residence in the castle was, the information that in it were vaist stores of wines and liquors, which Sir Peter had collected in his different cruises to various parts of the world. True, he was told that there was no one there to drink it with him-,-for it was not likely that he, a lampshire baronet, should associate with a morose agent, a deaf old butler, or any of the ret:iners. But he could "play a lone hand" over a good bottle, if no company was convenient- for he had learned to do' that at Bermuda. The shooting around the castle was represented as being fine ; so that he made up his mind to have a regular good time, and enjoy it without grumbling. It was a ihuge, unshapely, but grand old pile; full of rough towers, walled in, even though it stood upon a rocky and almost inaccessible hill,' up which, except by the excavated road- -way. searce a goat could have clambered. But once there, the view from it was splendid. On the front, the 'eye could scan the bound- less space of restless ocean; 16ok far away where the distant sail seenmed but a snowy speck upon the blue rinm of the horizon-or down at the very foot of the cliff, where the great waves, with loud and 'constant roar, dashed angrily against the rocky boundary, which refused to let them pass. Back from the sea, the eye ranged overa wild and rude expanse of 'hill and dale, of foresthand moorland, with only 'here and there some peasant's hut to show a sign of human life. But there were deer, and cattle, and goats, and sheep'in plenty there; and the whirr of the black-cock and the ruffled grouse often fell upon the ear. Lizzie had been received at the port by the agent of Sir Peter Parker, to whom she bore letters of instruction from the commodore, and who'came down in, and rode back on, the box of the family carriage. His name was Wood;-Simon Wood-and he had been engaged. in many callings-more, probably, than he had chosen to inform his employer of, or chose to have generally known to the few whom he condescended to associate with in any degree. Pew, I saay, for he was taciturn to sullenness-almost morose-and very s4elom mixed with any company, except when business called him. 'Ilis age was some. where between forty and fifty-that or more-- to judge from his appearance. His features,   rather sharp and thin; his eye, keen, black, and piercing; his expression, generally' very quiet and sober. But there was a something hypocritical-a kind of half sarcasm-in his soberness, which did not strike a stranger, agreeably. He was well educated; it was supposed from his manners, well born-perhaps a yo unger son in some titled family.; for it was known to the 'commodore -that; he did not use his real name.  He had been connected with the church, as curate or pastor, in his' younger days'; but, for some reason, had changed the clerical vocation for that of a soldier; and he was in the humble canpacity of a private of marines when Sir Peter first discovered him and took an interest in him, in consequence of his education and talent. he had procured his discharge. and made him  agent of his estates, some four or five years previous to the time when we introduce him to the notice of our readers. Lizzie gave this man the letters of Sir Peter when he first came on board theo transpoirt, in obedience to the messenger whonm she sent for means to remove herself, friends, and baggage to the castle, and she could not Lut notice thle changes in his counitenance while lie 'perused them. "The wishes of Sir Peter shall be strictly followed!" said Ihe, after he had perused thce letters, and placed them in his pocket. Lizzie 'now mentioned, without formally in- trodicing them, that Sir Hunmplhrey Dorset and his daughter would remain wSitfi her, as guests, at the castle, for a time. "The guests of Miss Egorton shall receive every attention in my power and province to yield," said the agent, with cold politeness; and after having given the necessary orders iin regard to the baggage, he begged leave to escort the party to the coach. . In a short time, the ladies and the baronet were located, as comfortably as could be, ia the old castle; and the butler, instructed by Lizzie,' had waited upon the baronet, to ask what kind of wine he priferred at dinner, The butler, as we have before hinted,' ias rather deaf; but, by his color and proportions, he gave evidence' that he not only knew what good eating and drinking was, but probably improved his knowledge by pretty constant practice. The baronet saw this, and felt a sympa- thetic liking for the nbutler at once; and to in- gratiate hhiself in hi ',favor, made a deposit of a golden guinea in the fat palm which had held up many a dusty bottle. "So your young mistress wants you to find out what kind of wine I like, beet?" said thei baronet, rather loudly-for he had. been. in- formed of the physical failing of the butler. The latter nodded his head, to imply an affirnmative answer4 ' Well, let me see. I like claret, in its place,  &#xD;<pb n="80-81 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6983-00000041"/> i.' t :,.o ..l y.

CIAPTER LXIV. Though there were many romantic drives and beautiful walks it the vicinity of Egerton t',tle, and occasionally both were enjoyed by izzie and Venona, their favorite spot was a rude and lofty tower which overlooked the sn. standing in truth upon the outer verge of the rocky cliff which formed the seaward-side of the castle. Here it was their pleasure to sit for hours, and gazing out ipon the waters, to talk of those who made their home upon the ocIean, those to whom they had given their vonng hearts in keeping. Lizzie had caused ite room to be fitted up comfortably as a sittiun-room and study, and here they had numerous maps and charts, as well as a pairof' excellent telescopes; and while, at one time, they wo*tld nauatse themselves by looking at vvery sail in sight, from the far-off and sluggish mlnerehantntula off the coast, to the fishing shal- a t"p oloece in shore, or at anchor in the little  port u nar by, at another they would examine 1 every isle, aind channel, and harbor, laid down 1 in the chart of the American coast, and won- der where then could be those who most occu- piwl their thoughts. In this occupation con- ,i-Ktd their greatest happiness, for they never  Sw any company except the baronet, and eel-  doin saw him, except at dinner-timne; for when ot enjoying his meals, and the accompani-   \   Ineits, hle was away with the agent, who for one that eschewed the bottle altogether, had wonl stranlgely upon his favor. Perhaps it was, because he was fond of angling and hunting, and knew well the haunts of game around; for Sir lumphrey was passionately attached to such sports, imore so than'is usual with men ot plethoric habit, and Mr. Wood was very atten- tive in showing them to him. The agent had learned the baronet's peculiarities very easily, and by managing in their various excursions to always have a choice bottle of wine or liquor. and a lunch introduced opportunely, had con- - pletely won the baronet's heart, even though he could not, or would not, toss off bunmp-p., with him-lis health being a plea to avoid it But there was another, whose keen eye catching many a wild and passionate glance from hinm, when he did not think her so observ- ant, who saw tlat Mr. Simon Wood sought to win the favor of Sir Iumnphrey Dorst with the view of endeavoring to win a greater prize than that-for whenever the agent could man- age to make ani excuse to appear in the pre- sence of Venona, lie did so-and if there lay in his power any service, howsoever great or srnall, which lie could render her, he did it with an eagerneis only out-done by his courtly grace. Venona saw this, and not unlike mnany another of her sex, who dislikes most the one who has tired to loved her, she Ihated the very sight of the agent. And although not natur- ally haughty to those who were in a position interior to tlat which she occupied, to him she was as cold as even a queen to the lowest serf in her dominions. And she knew that he saw and felt it, for at titnes a wild, revengeful light would flash from his eyes, which spoke to her of danger. 'Yet noting so muellch as she had, in that one  thing she haa not made a confidant of Lizzie. Why she had not, is beyond our ken. Per- haps she deuned it folly, even in herself, to be- lieve that lie, late a private marine in 11. B1. M. S. monre than twice her age, and only now an agent on the estae of baronet, wotd dare to love her. At any rate, all that she knew in the matter she kept to herself-only, when oc- casion served, giving him looks of scorn for h imploring glances. Anid what this was to lead to, is yet beyond our ken also. Only this have we to say, that. once in a while, when after some necessary or- made-up errand had taken hin into her pre- sence, he would retire with a fiery flush on his ' usually pale cheek, muttering: " This will not lastlong-my turn will cone yet, proud lady!"  CHAPTER LXV. "-le has been very long absent, fathe-- very long; I wish he would come in onee again before I die!" Can it be our once sweet, blooming, dear Kate Cringle, who lies there so pale, het  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6983-00000042"/> couch moved up by. the window, so that she may look out upon the harbors? Can it be her who in such a fiaint voice utters those words? It is, and she is very thin and pale! Oh, how quickly do the sorrows of the heart eat up the strength of the body! Mr. Cringle himself looks ill and very un- happy. He is worn down with anxiety; for what to him would be all his wealth-where would be his ambition, if his dear Kate per- ished before his eyes. She was his only heart's treasure. He was, and ever had been, one who regarded wealth more as a convenience than a necessity--ad gathered it without toil, used it without meanness, and dispensed charity where he saw it was needed.  All this was human; but now in the yearning agony of his soul he asked something sup4rhu- man-hle asked the ALMiGHTY to check the ebb- ing of the tide of life in his loved and beautiful daughter. He could see his wealth melted awa y-could with his dwn h:,nds toss it into ,the sea-but lie could not lose her, his Kate, his darling, and his more than life! "Can you see no vessel, fither? No white spot upon the dark'sea-board that will warm my heart a while before it walks the winter- path of death?" she murmured. "There's a stir about the nlag-staff of the lookout," said lie, forgetting the ct-cct-cra;, as he had done under the excitement of his latter da-s. "There's a stir here-something may be coming in!" At that moment,- a basket of fruit and flowers was brought in by a little boy; and that it was not the first visit of the child may be inferred from her words: "He' is here again! Who sends to me those sweet flowers, those fruits, which tell me that oven while I amn dying, I leave some thoughts about me not perishable--who?" A gun at that instant fired from the look- out station, attracted the attention of both the merchant and his daughter. An instant later, when they looked for the beairor of the fruits and flowers, he was gone. "What is the signal, my father?" asked poor Kate. A single vessel coming in-an American!" he replied, "No private signal, father?" "Not yet, child. Ah, yes, there is one going up now-do not hold your breath so, or feel anxious, I will tell you what it is the moment it unfolds!" "Oh, be- quick, father, I feel faint-this is -not deathl, is it? I feel as if I must sleep!" And the long fingers dropped from her eye- dsa down upon her pale cheek; and she seemned indeed to oe sinking into that sleep which kaows no eathlly waking. "Cheer up child-cheer up!" cried the mer- obant. "Tlhe private signalflutters out, and tells me tha t its the schooner!" 'Wake nme when le comes!" she sighed-and   seemed to sink away in a pleasant dream, for her face was wreathed by a smile, and low, soft breaths came up through her pale lips. CHAPTER LXVI. Seawaif was surprised after having come to an anchor, furled sails, and landed, that he was not met at the wharf as usual by Mr. Cringle, and he asked of the first person w1hom the met, which happened to be Moses Gelson, whlere Luh merchalt was? "Attending by the bed-side of his angel child, young air!" said the miser-who in many things had decidedly improved since first we saw .him. "And I think you will be the best doctor there, young man. Be kind to her; she is an angel, just as heri muother was-be kind to her, ind I'll not forget you--'ll not forget you?" Seawaif would have asked more questions, but a crowd was gathering around, perchance expecting news, and he hurried away from thlem-for he had no news to give which affect- ed him half so much as that which lie liad re-'  ceived. Not that he loved Kate, but that he knew-'and felt that she loved him-and who, who that has a spark of manhood in his breast, can know that lie is loved and notfeel, even if lie cannot return love for love, a respon- sive thrill toward that heart which throbs for / hiim  In a few moments, his rapid steps had taken him to the store, and a glance, rather than a word from a clerk there, told him that Mr. Cringle was up stairs. Quickly he went up, and stood in the room, where he had first met, last parted with ler. And his own cheek grew pale, his own heart trembled, when he saw her white face-the dark hair lying tangled about the snowy brow, for he thought she was dead. "Katepoor Kate!" he mlurmured. "Come-come at last!" she cried, and half arose from her couch, extending her armns as if to greet him, and while new beauty for an in- stant gave life and color to her face, she gazed at him with her dark, soulful eyes, and then sunk back as white and still upon the couch as if she were dead, indeed. The merchant could not speak. lIe extend- ed his hand to Seawaif, but choking sobs pre- vented his saying a word. Low and very sweet her voice came up from her white lips, as she said : t"Don't weep, my father-I am happy nw!"' And she reached a'thin, white hand out to the young captain; and while lie pressed it in hisown rude, warm, and true palm, lie wept; but she smiled, and went to sleep again-for her strength was gone almost utterly.  But her slumber was easv, like tht of an in- fant-not wild, dreamy and oppressive as/it had been before; and when, soon after, the phy- sician came and felt her pIulse, lie looked astocn- ished, and said that "a favorable change was  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6983-00000043"/> taking place, but that by no means must she be awakened!" And there they sat, the merchant and his captain, and not a word was spoken, or a ques- tion asked about the result of the cruise, or its incidents. A matter of more importance lay before them-a soul was pausing upon eternity's dark verge, and a breath might blow it off. CHAPTER LXVII. A few days, when one is lingering between the confines of Life and Death, often bring about a great change. It was so in the case of Kate Cringle. While the "Tyrannicide" was being fittled up for another cruise, Seawaif was a frequent visitor to her side; and though from his lips no wordl passed which a brother might not have uttered, and no act of his could be construed into menning more than a fraternal care and feeling, she improved in looks and health each dnav. And Mr. Cringle was so overjoyed at this, that hle began to remember his et-act-e-ras. In one thing, however, he was very dilatory. He exhibited no haste to prepare the schooner for her next cruise. When an article was asked for, by Seawaif or his executive officer, it was furnished ; hut there was not the usual bustle with the merchant-the usual anxiety to furnish everything, and get the vessel ready for sea. If indeed she had been pronounced 1unsca- worthy and condemned, to judge from  his actions, I'Phincas Cringle would not have fret- ted very much. nor have been in great haste to build another. Not that his patriotism was less than it had been, but because he saw that Kate's health improved daily, while Seawaif d was near her. She serned to cling to life while he-was pre- . sent. aind to emi devor to rally, while, when he was absent she did not aid Nature by an effort. How strangely it is that all souls which are 8 delicate juine in their nature--all spirits which are sensitive to the passion of love, are so closely linked to the physical nature, that if the heart aches, or the soul sunffers, the body v droops and fails at once! Kate had so far recovered, that she was able c to sit up by her favorite window and look out t upon the harbor. Though she had not strength h to raise the spy-glass to her eye, by resting it se across the window-sill, she could bring it to d bear upon the schooner, and watch the daily preparations for sea; such as fitting and ben&amp;- p ing new sails, scraping and slushing down the upper spars and booms-getting in water, wood, and provisions. "You will soon be ready to depart again!" a said she to Seawaif, one day, " I see that they th have finished taking in wood, water, and pro- vionson board!"!" "Yes, we are nearly ready for sea!" replied ti Seoawaif. "I wish this cruel war were over-then yon a   e would not have to go to sea again!" she said, in such a quiet child-like tone, that Seawaif s smiled as he answered: "Ol, yes-when the war is over, I shall still r be a child of the sea I I have no other pro- e fession!" "A child of the sea!" she murmured. "I wish that I too were one, and not a weak, help- less girl. Can you not take me with you? I think I should get better there ; and if I died, why you could put me in the water, and I would go down among the mermaids in their , coral caves, and ask them for a home!" f   Rather say, up to heaven among your sis- ter angels!" said Seawaif, enthusiastically. He could not help it. She looked so beauti- ful in her transparent pallor-in the unearthly brightness of her eyes ; and when he spoke to her, a gradual pinky flush, a soft and roseate tint camine out not only upon her lilied cheek, but all over her fice, quch as the sun gives to any Ilower just opening to its breath. l am not an angel-thcy are immortal; alas, I am mortal!" she answered. "Subject to mortal pains-to mortal rassions-I cannot make eternal spring, nor yet a winter of my heart, for one or other musst be done 'cre we can find contententm  here!" Why, swhy'is it that beauty, intellect, every- thing brightens in-those who approach Death's dark land before their time-? The aged sink in hndness, deafiess, palsied to the grave-but the young go, growing more and more beauti- fiil until thsey disappear-even as a lamp flames brightest just before it goes out.  "When will you go?" asked Kate, after a long pause, for her strange words had sunk too deep in Seawaif's heart to make hinm talkative. "We will be ready to groi to-morrow!" he said. ,( But perhaps we will niot go so soon!" "Yes--you will go to-morrow-you must!" she said. "  Far across the waters there is a spirit far mioIe hopeful thadn mine, and yet 'tis oomned to disappointmentt! Go Edward--. o --I shall wait on earth till you come back i' lie looked wildly upon her face to learn what knowledge she could have of another, "( far across the waters ;" but her eyes were closed, and she seemed to be speaking in a trance; for, when lie spoke to her, and asked her what she meant, she made no reply, but seemed to have fallen gently asleep, as she often did. With a troubled heart he gently kissed her pale brow, and went away. CHAPTER LXVIII. "Ready for sea, et-cei-e-ra? All ready?" asked Mr. Crinkle, on the morning succeeding the evening which closed our last chapter. "Yes, sir," replied Seawaif. " , Everything that is needed is on board, and the crew impa- tient for service." "Then I suppose youn must go?" said the merehant, slowly, and with a sigh.   "Does Kate know that you are going so soon?" asked the merchant, after a pause. "She knows that I am ready for sea," re- plied the young captain. Then he asked: "Have you ever told her that my thoughts had rested upon another lady, Mr. Cringle?" "I? No, sir! It would 'have killed her, had such news come from smy lips; and H love my child too well to murder her! Why did you ask me that?" "I Nothing caused the question but a fear that such a suspicion might have found a place in her heartA through some unguarded word." "No such word or hint lihas palssed amy lips. But if you are going to sea to-day, Vyou had better tell her. Do it gently-very gently- for her life hangs upon a tenlder thread." "I will speak as I ever doL-kindly, as a brother should unto a sister," said Seawiuif; and he warmly pressed the hand which Mr. Oringle had extended to him, and tlwn swent to see Kate. A calm and lovely smile was on her face when lie entered the room where she had lain so long an invalid, and she looked as if Life had resumed courage, and driven back Death from its portals. "You have come to say good-bye!" she said, so cheerfully that he was astonished, and without speaking, -only bowed an afflirmative reply.  "Do you believe in dreams?" she aasked; and a radiant smile overspread her face. "In'dreams, Kate?" he asked. "Ybs, in dreams! I did not, once; but I do now. An angel has come to me of late so often, in my dreams, and worked so hard, that it has dug up the roots of sorrow which I, in my folly, had planted there, and planted Hope where they existed." "An angel in dreams--may it bless you while I am gone, for I any going away again." "I knew it!" she answered , "you go to gain fame; but where your heart yearns most for success; disappointment will meet it. Ed- ward, I shall live now, for you will come to me again-you will come, with a sad heart, and say you cannot live without me." "It may be so," he said; "and if I come, I know you will speak kindly to me."  "My heart and soul are yours. But go- go quickly, while I am strong!" she said. And he felt that it was better to do so : and he kissed her, and hastened away. Two hours later, and the schooner breasted the waves of the Atlantic. CHAPTER LXIX. ;Venona Dorset was a dreamy girl at times, and loved-oh, so mnuch!-to wander away off from eompany-even from her almost con- stant companion, Lizzie Egerton--and to visit the wild; dark dells, where sparkling, noisy streamlets rushed, and where Nature dwelt in   her beautiful rudeness. And there were many such lovely spots near Egerton Castle, where gray rocks, covered with moss, rose ruggedly and stern from the earth, seeming tot-ive even a cold welcome to the glimpses of sunlight which came "a-visitinsg" down between the brlancnhes of the weeping ash. Onue dtay se hind started from the castle with Lizzie and her own tfather, and the three had wandered ia long wasy-'for it watn a bright sunny day, and the cool shades of the forest were delighitful. By direction, a hlunch had been brought to thern, lbut Venoma wandered on while the baronet and 'Lizzie stayed to pay attention to it. She had not gone more than a hundred yards or so, before she canue to a clear, grassy pool, formed in o little, shady nook by a descendling rivulet--so beautiful, that she ipaused and sat down on the mossy sbank, and amIused herself by casting little peb- bles into it, that she might watc- the glitter- ing ripples that they ninde. e' Ovr er her lad was a profusion of green tranches and vines, and around her were many wild flowers, raising their bright lieads up from amnong the rocks, as if they were looking to see what she--herself so beautiftl-was do- ing there. And lulled by the gentle rustle of the leaves above, and by the murmur of the waters be- low, she ceased, gradually, to throw pebbles into thie pool--her white haisnds sunk carelessly down upon the moss-her bonnet, having been untied, fell from her head, and leaning hack against the flowery bank, she fell off into a gen- tle slumber. To her it seemed that she scarcely /rad slept, for the rustle of the leaves--the silvery gush- ing of the waters'-were sounding plain in her cars, when suddenly she felt somsething as hot as fire l:sou her lips ; it did -not seem like a kiss, but like a festering blister-but strong arms were clasped fiercely around her, and she knew that she was in territle danger. She awoke-but her eyes were so blinded by terror -that she could see nothing ; she felt that she had been partially raised from the ground,and while scream after scream broke from her lips, had been dropped again, and she had a dim glimpse of some one rushing from her into the- thick bushes close at hand. but could not tell who it was. Yet her frightened heart knew. Had it not told her, i paper dropped accident- ally near her feet did; for she took it up, ex- amined it, and put it away in her bosom, for use thereafter,- It whis a rent account upon the, estate of Sir Peter- Parker, anmid had no business in the hands of any one but his agent. But a few moments had elapsed after she hbad uttered the shrill screams caused by her' terrible affright, when Venona heard the sound of rapid footsteps coming ; and in a moment, Lizzie Egerton, brave andh feairless, rushed tio her side-nt firt -almost breathless-'to askf. what was the matter-.  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6983-00000044"/> O Woman-Woman! How you can dissi- mulate! The first word which Venona uttered was one of dissimulation. "Dear Lizzie, what a foolish creature I am!" she said. "You heard me scream, didn't you?" "Yes. What was the matter? I thought you were in some fearful peril!" "Wh-- wla-what's the matter, blossom?" cried Sir Ilumphrey, coming up at this in- stant, puffing and blowing like a porpoise bound for a liarbor with a gale of wind close astern of him. "Why, I've been very much frightened by by a dream! I fell asleep here, and dreamed that-a snake, or something of the kind, had coiled itself around me, and I screamed right out, and woke myself, as well as alarmed you." "Yes--seared me so that I dropped and broke my bottle of sherry before I had drank half of it!" said the baronet, sorrowfully. "I thought that something was the matter." "Your terror lasts a long while for a mere dreani," said Lizzie, looking at her closely. "You are as white as a lily, and tremble yet from head to foot." "1 Wake you from a deep slumber in a terri- ble dream, and you will also tremble, sweet coz!" said Venoua. '"I am equal to any dan- ger of which I know and can see ; but a dream nay terrify those who possess the strongest nerves." *"Drenams do not leave the mark of violent hands!" said Lizzie, in a whisper; and she glanced down to where the distinct marks of fingers remained upon the white shoulders of her lovely friend. "I usih! Do not let my father hear you, or seeelhe sign. I will explain my suspicions -my almnost certainty-after we get to the castfe," said Venona, also in a whisper. And she drew her scarf up over her shoul- ders, and rose to her feet, saying that she was ready to return. "My lunch is spoiled-l-I broke my bottle of wine," said the baronet, sadly. "Perhaps my flask will partially supply our loss, Sir Humphrey!" said-the agent, Simon Wood, coining that moment in view, with a gun upon his shoulder and a well-filled game-bl: g by his side, and at the same time extending a flask which the baronet had Been before very often. "Thinnii you, Mr. Wood-thank you. You are the ttiruigest nian I ever knew: always near when you are wanted!" said the baronet. 4"And soinet:rnes when lie is not wanted!" said Venona, in a tone which did not reach her ftther's car, for he was just then busy with the flask; but the agent did hear her, as she intended that he should. "I We will go back to the castle." L aid Lizzie, with rathler more than her usual dignity. "It will not do for us to wander far away from the castle, it seems!"   "What is the matter, Miss Egerton? ia0  anything occurred to render your usual ram- bles disagreeable?" asked Mr. Wood. "No, sir-not particularly. But' have ymo 'heard no unusual noise, in your excursion recently? Nothing which should draw you near our party?" "Indeed, I have not, Miss Egerton!!" "Then, sir, I am glad to congratulate you!" "Me, Miss Egerton? I do not understand you now, surely; for I do not know of any good fortune which I, but a poor agent of your un- cle's, could have received which requires con- gratulation." "I congratulate you upon your lack of hearing, sir! If you desire further informa- tion, you will call at my room after I have re. turned to the castle." And Lizzie, looking him full in the eyes, so expressed herself in a single glance that he un- derstood her, and he turned away confused-- and, for the time, unmanned. Sir Humphrey, having very nearly emptied the flask, would have returned it to Mr. Wood, but that gentleman had vanished almost as sud- denly as le had appeared-and, therefore, the baronet quite emptied it, and placed it, as a vessel which yet might become useful, in his coat pocket. And the trio returned to the castle; for the adventures of the morning had rendered a longer stay outside unpleasant. CHAPTER LXX. The sun was dropping well down toward the western verge of the sea-lined horizon; and the young ladies having dined and left Sir Humphrey with his wine, had almost com- pletely recovered their nerves, and forgotten the rather startling events of the morning, narrated in our last chapter. With her glass to her eye, Lizzie was, as usual, swee ing the expanse of sea open to her vision, while Venona, occupied seemingly in thought, was sitting in a corner of the tower, looking listlessly away among the golden and purple clouds which had gathered to escort the sun down to its bed. "What are you thinking of, Venona?p asked Lizzie. "Nothing in particular-everything in gen- eral, dear coz. What a glorious sunset 'tie going to be 1"!" "Yes; but does it not, in its redness, be- token a coming storm? See how the fleet of fishermen are all scudding in to find a harbor. So red .a sun to-night betokens a dark day for the morrow." "  Indeed? Well, as you are a commodore's niece, Lizzie, you should know all about the weather I And the more that you have a full- blooded captain for a lover 1" said Venona, laughing. "Ah, Venonu, why should you taunt me?- you who are so in love with Morley that you'd give now two of your unjeweled fingers to   know what IPve been looking at for the last twenty minutes!" What, dear Lizzie--WHAT   Is there a strange sail in the offing?"And Venona hur- ried from her seat to Lizzie's side, and put one of her white, round arms about her neck, and did that which I so dislike to be a witness to- kissed her I "Yes, my dreamy little coz-yes, there is a strange sail in the offing, and she is growing very rapidly. I wish we had an hour or two more of daylight, to help us to find out who and what she was. She spreads a good deal of canvas, for she has a fair wind' for our port, and must, therefore, be steering for it. Her sails, too, are very white, as if bleached by service. But she is so far off that I yet can- not see a speck of her hull, nor can I make out her rig." "Ah, what a pity And the sun is going down?" "Yes, in a field of blood. We will have a terrible gale by to-morrow, or perchance be- fore. I hope, i this stranger is bound in, who- ever he is, he will have a pilot; for it will be be dark before lie is off the harbor, and in a gale, ours is a coast much to be dreaded." "Why couldn't a boat with a pilot be, sent  off, while it is yet light, to meet them?" "It could," eaid Lizzie, " but it would seem so strange for me to order such a thing; and it would be so dangerous, too, if the strange sail should be the schooner, that I dare not risk it." "More dangerous to them should they risk a near approach to the -coast, or attempt to enter our harbor. without a pilot!" said Veno- "That is so ' said Lizzie. "They shall have a pilot. I wish that I were at the port, or could get there unseen. Let me think: I can send Jennie, the butler's daughter, down, as I sometimes do, upon an errand. She is a girl of sense, and will do what I bid her do, -without asking unnecessary questions." "Then do send her, dear Lizzie. Something whispers in my heart that Seawaif and Morley are near-are in that vessel which is speeding toward us on the wild wings of the wind!" "Perhaps so.- Let us go down. I will send the girl away immediately," said Lizzie. And they left the tower. Scarcely had they done so, when, from be- hind an angle outside, a head appeared before the window which opened inland, and a body followed-which, a moment later, crept in 'over the balustrade. The spy was none other than Mr. Simon Wood. *"So they have lovers!" he muttered. ",I inew begin to understand the instructions of Sir Peter; and Miss Lizzie Egerton shall have the benefit of them. Morley and Seawaif are their names. And a pilot is to be sent off I  will see to that myself. The little lady need not trouble herself to send Jennie; for I want   these gallants to enter our harbor onoe, and I'll warrant they'll stay there-or their vesael will for a time! They shall,be very welcome!" And the eyes - of the agent flashed with new fire, as he passed stealthily on in the course which the young ladies had taken. But, wonder upon wonder! scarcely had he left the tower, when another head appeared from a second window close beside the one through which he had entered, And it was a fresh, fair head -not such a pale, sharp-fea- tured, rascally-looking caput as his. It was the head-ruddy and healthy, and far from uncomely-of a girl of eighteen or twenty years of age. Her red hair, blue eyes, rosy cheeks, and plump figure, gave token that there was life and love in her; and even if, in her soliloquy, she had not named herself, her likeness to him would have told us that she was the butler's daughter.,  "So, Mr. Simon Wood, I know what you're after now I You made love to me till some- thing that looked better came in your way; and now, on the track of fresh game, you think you'll run a safe and sure scent I! You'll run off it, as sure as my name is Jennie I Miss Venona hates you; so do Hnow that I kno" r you. She loves somebody else, and so does Miss Lizzie ; and they're expected in a ves- sel; and the vessel which Miss Lizzie saw may be the one. She will want a pilot. She shall have one, and not a soul in this eaStle shall be the wiser. She shall have one who will place her, not in Yarmouth, but some- where where she can be twice as safe-and Mr. Simon Wood be none the wiser of her where- abouts!" -And Miss Jennie Rollison, the -.butler's daughter, having said thus much to herself-- not knowing, reader, that we were listeners-- disappeared in the gathering twilight, follow- ing the same course which had first been taken by the young ladies, and next by Simon Wood, thie spy, whom she had herself put under sur- veillanee.    -  CHAPTER LXXt.  There were two inns in'the town of Ya'- mouth. One carried the sign of the Her- rings "-being as many fishes as could- be paintad on a board three feet square. The other was tie "Jolly Tar ;" and had upon its signal a picture of a sailor ashore, scattering gold pieces on the ground, which a lot of not over-dressed little human angels were picking up. In the tap-room of the latter, about one hour or so after the sun had gone down, there were, probably, full twenty individuals, most of them fishermen, and mostly sitting with a tankard of beer before them, at the long table, and with a pipe in their mouths. It be ,like to storm rough, out, to-night, Jack," said one of the oldest of these men, to a young, smart-looking fellow, who sat near him. "Yee, Hannock.  It'll blow great gone  &#xD;<pb n="88-89 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6983-00000045"/> fore morning. I reckon all the boats be in- if they're not, they ought to be; and'll wish they were afore day breaks on 'em.  The wmoke, this mornin', didn't raise a hand's- breadth above the chimneys; but snaked right out toward the ground; and the sun came up slow and dullish red- a if it didn't want to. We'll have a power o' rain before it shows its face again!" said the young fisherman. And, as if to prove the soundness of his judgment, the wail of the rising gale began to nmake itself heard about the old inn. Its heavy sign creaked out opposition to the "lerrings " across the way; and each window seemed to have a peculiar ague of its own-for it shook in a different key. "Some'at warmer than beer would do thee good, Hannock," said the young man. "lHere, landlord, let'a have a coulle o' mugs o' some'at to keep the chill off. A little o' t'mt Holland -that never a gauger clapped eyes on- wouldn't hurt us-and there's the silver down for it!" "Is Master John Driver here?" asked a sweet voice, which came frot a facc so closely hooded that. though it peered inside of the door, its features could not be distinguished. Yes," said the young man1, springing to his feet as suddenly as he would have done with an ounce of lead just sent through his heart. "Yes. mistress. I answer to that hail!" * You are wasted here. a mitomienst," said the hooded voice. He was half-way to the speaker before the last word had left her lips ; and when he reached her, he took her inside and stepped outside with her. "What is the lmatter, my sweet Jeunie?" he as;k,.d, hurriedly. "What brinigs you so far front the acmtd-, aloll.

I told you she wanted a pilot!" And, as the girl spoke, t deep booning sound came over the face of the roaring sea, and funld echo in the nrcky cliffs ashore. "Ay-theret i a vessel uutsifle; but what's it to w-hether she Ceo'nles into port or not? Let her carry sail, and drag off from the lee.

There is some one she loves in that vessel; and her heart is beating wildly for his safety.

"I do-and will seal it with a kiss!" she said-sniting the action to the word. "I'm off, then, in a jiffy!" said the young man, feeling far better from the effects of than kiss than he woullf have done if he had taken till the "Hollands" the landlord could have seti before him. "W hen you get on board, tell the captain that Miss Lizzio Egerton sent you," said thie girl. "All right, so far, Jennie bhut if you wnt:l nle to run 'em in to Bracelet Cove there must be a tiny fire lighted, down close under tle rocks, at the lower point. Dare .you go thetl' to do it, or must I trust some of imy mates?" I'll go tmyself and do it, if yon will come to see me home after you have got the vessel in safe to an anahor!" said Jennie. "* Will I not?

"I shall not play the hoyden, John, only do, thy duty this night!" said Jennie' and after giving him one more kiss, she hastened away while the echoes of another gun from the vess;l outside were rolling off among the rocky hills.- The sound of the two guns attractetd atten- tion from inside ; and, while lJenie vanished away in the darkness, several of the fishermen came out to see what was the matter. "There's somebody outside tlat wants a' pilot," asid John to tlannoek, his elderly no,- ranion, as the latter came to the door. "She might keep ai wanting:, for all I'd d,. such a night as this is got to be!" said the old man. "Why don't she carry sail wtil,' she may, and haul off, instnad of lavin, in shore, and firing guns which nobody 'li hee '" ** I'm going off to her.

And he, with the rest, went back i;lt, the in.  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6983-00000046"/> CHAPTER LXXIL When Lizzie and Venona went quietly to seek for Jennie Rollison, wishing to let no one else know of the errand which they desired to send her on-for they knew that she could be both secret and prudent-lshel could nowhere be found. At last, after they had hunted all over the great castle, they learned, front the porter at the gate, that she had passed out a short tihee before dark, and had gone down toward the port.. Witx her errand could be away from the castle, at that hour, was more than they could divine, nor could the poiter inform -them more than that le believed she had friends and relatives down in the village, and might have gone to spend the night withl them. WhLat to do, or whom to send as a messen- ger, now, they did not know. Although they had given up their first intention, of bringing Mr. Simrlt Wood to bay, by charging himn with that which they could not positively prove, and which hle would be sure to deny- the causo of Venona's fright in the forest-they would not, for the world, have let him know of their plans, or even of the fact that they had seen a vessel outside, bound shoreward;- for they had not the slightest suspicion that lie knew of anything of the matter. He had played the spy most cunningly, ipdeed. And whom to trust beside Jennie -in the castle, they did not know; for he had all of the retainers unlder his will, through fear or brib- cry-for Sir Peter had given him unlimited power over them, and a word fronm Simon Wood would influence them all nearly as quickly and as powerfully as if it had been. uttered by Sir Peter himself. Uneasy-for their very hopes made them positive that it was the schooner, with their lovers on board, which had been seen by them --they retired to the chamber which botlh occupied, and from the window of which the sea could be seen. when it was light enough, r hre to endeavor to study out some plan of action. The gale was rising very rapidl; and as they heard its loud roar, and the dash of the inereasing. surges at the foot of the cliff, they trembled, not alone for the safety of the vesse, thut witlh the fear that even af she escaped wreck, she would be driven off from the coast, to return, alas! they knew not wlhen. They had not been long in their chamber, before the bright flash of the gun for a pilot was seen by Lizzie's quick eyes; and a minute or more later, the dull boom of the cannon fell upon their ears. "They are calling for a pilot; if one dares to go off, they will come in," said Lizzie; and her cheek flushed and paled, with the alternate enmot1ions of hope and fear. "Should their nation and character be dis- covered, her peril will be fearful," said Ve.   nons. "They will be captured right before our eyes.!" . "I do not fear that .ii,..e'r," said Liazie. "There, is not a cannon x hllt;u fifty miles ,f this place, and no force at tLte port but a h I , dozen I preventing. to watch smugglers-i' I the inhabitants lAve no arnIa, even if tl-: feft disposed to risk thr lives in an encounthv witl such brave -men as form the seiooner'a crew! 1 fear most, at prlexelit, from the e;l- inenta-biut look,there is the ftsh of another gun!

But the old commodore's telescope was a good one; and soon a low cry of Jlight broke from Lizzie's lips.   . I see the vessel-it is the sclunmer. II wovul 'know her among a thousand sails. Sue has a light in her rigging-and there, lse burns a blue light. It is as plain as day on board I can see the officers and crew distinctly 1 "Are they there?" asked T;uu:;iL."

Watch - him closely, dear Lizzie, and tell me what progress sF makes. Does he use a sail?" "No-he rows with a pair of oars-I can see him plainly, for he has a lantern in the boat with him, and I think that he is seen from the schooner, for her sails are some- of them aback, and site is almiost stationary. But oh! his is a fearful struggle-that poor brave boat- man. At times his boat goes entirely out of my sight between the great, black waves, thep it seems to be tossed helplessly upon thir foany crests. He rows with strong arms annd a dauntless heart!"         - "Heaven bless and help him! It cannot be for mere common gain that he dares s6ch a fearful peril; and yet they cannot have friends upon this coast, other tlan ourselves i" Lizzie made no reply to Venona's -last rc- * The dilference between a night and a day,-telescop is, that the former inverts objects--naking a vessel, for instance, nppear to be standing with her rmasts dowuward- the 'sky beiug seen as lelbw, and the water above, by the arranemuent of the flam.,  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6983-00000047"/> mark. She was watching, almost breathlessly, the progress the he boatman. "Brae man.--brave man!-he pulls more feebly, as if he were very tired; but he does not stop. Ah they see him now, surely, for they hold lights over the side. Yes, anda the eehooner alters the position of her sails, and ans down toward him," said Lizzie, again. A few minutes more elapsed ; and then, with a sigh which came up as if her heart had been relieted of a load of anxiety, she said: "he is -fe on bhoard-he speaks to the officers who eawd to the gangway to meet him. The eourse of the schooner is altered-ah, it is not for the harbor. Surely she is steering off the eoaat. There--her lights are extinguished, and I can scarcely see her at all now! It is too bad!" And poor Lizzie seemed almost ready to weep from her disappointment. Kxense us, if we leave her, and look else- where a little while. CHAPTER LXXIII. At the very time that Jennie Rollison was at the door of the "Jolly Tar," persuading brave John Diver to go off to the schooner (which she knew contained some one in whom her dearly-loved mistress, Lizzie Egerton, felt an interest, though she had not the slightest knowledge beyond what she had gained in over- hearing the conversation which her espial upon the movements of Simon Wood enabled her to hear), the last-named individual entered the other tavern, known as the "Herrings," upon a similar errand-he not dreaming that he was forestalled by her. In that inn, as well as the other, a consider- able party of the hardy fishermen of the port had gathered-as they almost always did at night-to drink, and smoke, and spin yarns. When the agent entered, they all became silent-for he was known, and not liked very well; for he had the reputation of being a elose, hard man on the poor-and no such person is ever popular with the masses. "'Tise a stormy night, mates," said he, speak- ing in a condescending way, as if he would like to make friends among them. "Ay-one which should keep honest men in doors," said an old rough-spoken skipper, who neither feared man nor fiend. "A glass of punch 'round wouldn't hurt ye all. Landlord, mix Up a howl for all hands," Mid thie agnt, not seeming to heed the manner or matter of the last speaker, while he tossed a piece of gold down before the master' of the "Make room for his honor before the fire!" ened half a dozen voices all at once now; for his unwonted generosity touched the weak spot in their nature, and they were as ready now to bs as they had been to ourse him a moment o two sooner. Did any of you Aotwe a schooner in the   offing, just as the sun set?" continued Simon Wood, as he took a seat by the fire, and glanced around among them. "No, your honor-there was nothing in shore when the last of our boats came in," said two or three at once. "Perhaps you could not see her-for she could just be made out from the castle with a glass as the sun sunk out of sight." "There's no schooner ielonging here ex- pected in. It may be somd drogher bound up the coast. If it is, she'll have a rough night of it outside. It'll blow great guns afore mornin'!" said the old growler who had spoken first when Wood entered the inn. The boom of her first gun suddenly sounded upon their ears. "By the big Herring, there's a gun I A vessel is firing for a )ilot!" cried several voices at once, "That's more than she'll get on a night like this, with the wind blowing right in a fellow's teeth, if he tried to go out," said the old fisher- man. ' I'll give any man a couple of golden guineas that'll go out to her, beside the pilot- age that he'll make!" said Simon Wood, who had sprung to his feet when he heard the sound of the gun, and who seemed considerably excited. "Maybe .you know what vessel it is, and have an interest in her?" said the old man, looking Wood keenly in the eye. "No--I do not know what vessel it is," said the agent, confusedly; " but I don't like the idea of a vessel being out in such a gale off our dangerous coast, when a safe harbor is near at hand!" "If she's acquainted here, and is honest. she'll be apt to find her way in without wait- ing for a pilot. If not, she's no business here. It may be -one of them infernal Yankee priva- teers, that's the 'next thing to a pirate-for I've heard that they've been in our channel o' late, burning and taking everything they met. There's one 1Iaul Jones I've heard tell of, that's worse than a demon afloat!" Another gun was heard. "She's in earnest about wanting a pilot," said Wood. "She. shall have one, if money will hire him. I'll ve five gmneas to the man that'll go off to her!" A dozen of the fishermen rose and went to the door at this; for five golden guineas wa.- a large sum to be owned by such men as they. But, when they looked out intothe darkness. and heard the Jashing of the angry surf, as it rolled in toward the shore, and te howling of the rising gale, they shook their heads, and came back, one by one, to wait for the punch which the landlord was mixing. All came in btAt the old growler, before nl-. Iuded to, and the agent. "There's some one going out on his own hook, without waiting to hear your five-guinea.   Hd;' said the old man, after they had stood by ihe door some minutes. And he pointedto a light which went danc- ing up and down on the waves of the harbor, evidently at some distance from the shore. "Yes, yes!-Who' can it be?" said Wood, r agely.. - "Heaven only knows 4 and will not tell her a whitewashed sinner as you are, or such ; bad chicken as the like of me!" '"I'd give a guinea to know!" said Wood- )ot. heeding the insulting words or sneering :iianncir of the old man-who had, evidently, no liking for him.    ;     et "' Maybap you can find out for less money, l' going ovec to the other inn. A bowl of tineich there may make you as worshipful as k has done with some here P' "Yes; the man may have gone from there. 1 must find out who sent him, or what induced hiun to go, whea no reward can induce others ?) go." And the agent started off in the gloom. "Hallo!-a word before we part, Simon Wood, Esquire!" cried the old man. "What d'ye want?" asked the agent. "Speak quick-for I'm in a hurry." "I want to know if it's your ownu money you're so liberal with, to-night?" said' the old 1isherman, in a sarcastic tone. "Mind your own business!" growled the agent, turning to go, while the fisherman re- turned to the inn, to look at the bowl of punch which the landlord had by this time prepared. CHAPTER XXIV. When the agent entered the "Jolly Tar," he was received as coldly by the inmates there' ais he lihad been at first at the "Herrings." Ilis reputation was evidently in advance of him. But he was in a hurry now, and didn't want to stand on so much ceremony here,; but *too make what friends he could as soon as pos- sible. "This is a hasty night, landlord," he cried, -,a night to make men huddle close to the fire, and like a sip of something strong and warmn with their pipes. Mix up a rousing bowl of punch for all hands, at my expense," Aand he threw down here, as he had at the other inn, a gold piece before the willing inn-' 'master.     . Room was quickly made for the liberal agent to approach the fire, and a change seemed to come over the faces which h ad looked black when he entered. "I wonder what's in .the wind now?" mut- tered lHannok, the chum of Jolhn Diver, to hinmself, as he heard the order, and saw how tinusually complacent the agent was. "A Ah! Master Hanmnok, how are you to- night.?" said the agent, who'knew him well, for they had hard words more than once about the rent of a little cottage in which he stowed his family..   "I don't know as I'm the better for seeing Simon Wood," said the old man, testily. "I don't often see him, except when rent's due!" "Oh! don't speak of that, Master Hannook. When I go to see you then, I do not act for myselfbut for the estate; and must do my duty or lose my berth, you know." "You'd never lose your berth with Sir Peter for being a bit easy wivith his oldest friends," said Hannoek, roughly, "But that's neither here 'nor there. I owe you nothing till next Michaelmas, at any rate."  "No-of course not; but let by-gones be by-gones, and wash away their remembrance in a glass of grog. By-the-way, where's your fishing-mate, honest John Diver?" "A woman called him to, the door, a bit- ago, and he hasn't come back yet," said Han- nook.                 / "A woman, el? He's a gay lad amongst the girls, I warrant." An honest one, Simon Wood, who, had he place and power, would suffer his right hand to be cut off before he'd injure or oppress one of them-and that is more than can be said of some who'd hold their heads above his if they could," said Hannock, sharply. And then he chuckled to himself: "I reckon that touched Sinmon under, thie gills." "I heard a vessel' firing guns for a pilot outside, a little while 'ago. Surely Master' John Diver wouldn't attempt to go, off the coast in suchl a terrible 'storm as tins is?" said the wily agent. m"A man as honest and brave as he is, will go wherever he thinks duty leads him," said Hannooek, quietly. "What duty could call a man out on a night like this?", '  "Duty to his fellow-creatures, if he thought they needed help-a thing I reckon you don't understand much about," said the old fisher- man, drily.    / "It must be he that is rowing off to the vessel. It is a terrible storm; and a wan risks his life to face it," said the agent-singu. larly insensible, for himnt, to the insulting words - of the man hie had talked with. "Did you see a boat going outside?" asked 'the old man. "* Yes," said Wood; "or the light of one bobbing up and down in the seaway." "I'll see if Jack has taken the boat,". said Hannoek, and, seizing 'his sou-west er" hat, he put it on his head, and salliedforth toward the pier where the boats usually were moored. He was elosely followed by the agent,' who, in both cases, seemed to forget a h about the punch which le had ordered and paid for, or even getting the change which was idue to him. "Yes; the boat's gone, and John in it. Hallo!-they're burning blue lights outside. I wonder what ean bo up " said th old main, as he stood upon the pier and looked to' 'a- ward .  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6983-00000048"/> "Did yon know what woman it was that called Jo6n Diver out?" asked the agent, abruptly. ' No; and if I did, I'd see you soaking in ten fathoms water before I'd tell you!" said Hannock, fiercely. "I'll soon find out," muttered the agent, as ho turned on his heel and hurried away. "It must have been either Miss Egerton or tenona Dorset-for they only knew of the ves- sel's approach--they only had cause to feel an interest in her safety. But I would not believe that they would dare to venture out from the castle at such a time of night, and in such a storm. But I'll soon find out; and then, if Sir Humphrey is only as ' far over the bay' as usual in his wine, I'll worm out of him the secret about this vessel-for he must know something about it, I think!" The agent now said no more, but hurried along on his way to the castle, leaving the in- mates of both the 1 "Herrings " and the "Jolly Tar" to enjoy their punch without his' pre- sence-a matter not at all disagreeable to most of them. And now, reader, I know you'll be glad to meet our gallant privateersmen once more, so we'll go aboard.  CHAPTER LXXV. At the very moment when Lizzie Egerton had first discovered the white sail in the far- away seaboard, from the look-out tower on the castle, Edward Seawaif and Eugene Morley were in the fore-top of the schooner, engaged with the glasses in gazing toward the shore. They could see the port, and could also dis- tinctly make out the gray towers of the castle- for, looming up from the crest of the hilly coast, they had the clear sky for a back-ground. But they could not, at that great distance, discover that there were watcher' also gazing anxiously toward them from the castle; but that secret sympathy which always plays the telegraph unseen between hearts that love, told them that they were not undiscovered-that they were near those to whom their hearts were linked by the holy chain of love I "I wish that we had two hours more of day- light," said Seawaif. "I We can't trust a chart to run in by at night; and we're going to have a heavy storm, or I'm out of my reckon- ing. "A storm is surely close at hand; but we *asil be in near enough to be seen quite plain from the harbor by dark, and perhaps a pilot will oome off," said Morley. "We will try and bring one by signal," said the other. Thbej remained but a little while aloft; for the night with its darkness came rapidly on, and they could not make out the land any longer, even with the aid of their glasses. Seawaif ran the schooner in as far as he dared to-for, though his lead gave deep   sounding, lihe knew on that coast he would carry them close up to the shoals or rocks, upon which wreck would be all too easy. Then he hauled her up on a wind, and laving his topsail abaek-for he yet carried them-. ordered a gun fired for a pilot. Then he carefully scanned the dim outline of the shore, to see if he could discover the evidence of an answer. "I see a light in a tower of the castle!" said he, in a low tone to Morley. And then he gave the. order to fire another gun for a pilot. "If they are watching us from the aestle," said Morley, " and have a glass, they might recognize the schooner, if we showed a blue- 'light or two!" ," That is so i" said Seawaif. "I was careless not to have adopted or named some signal when we parted with them, by which they might have recognized us either by niight or 'day. But have the blue-lights burned---thev can do no barm, and will do to direct a pilot, if one should be so bold as to try to coime off, in the face of the gale that's blowing up!" "Hadn't I better reef down the topsails, sir?" asked Mr. Doolittle, who was watch- officer at the time. "The spars are' buckling like whip-stalks!" "Yes, sir, do so!" said Seawaif; and in a few moments, the active crew had reduced sail. The blue-lights now threw their sulphurie glare across the wattrs, lighting up, while they lasted, the vessel and every one on board. "A boat is coming off-I see her light dis- tinctly!" said Seawaif, shortly after the first blue-light had burned out. "Burn anothl'r blue-light and also hang lights over the side I' Thtis was done, and Seawaif, who had got his glass fixed upon the boat, watched its pro- gress toward 'iim with anxiety. "It is a hard pull in such a seaway for a single man!" he said. '; Mr, Doolittle, let the men tend sheets and braces; we'll fill away and run down toward him'!" "Ay, ay, sir!" was the ready response. and in a few minutes, conned* by the captain. the schooner was running in toiward the short again. In a very shiot tintm they were close down to the boat; and runnin g just to leeward of it, they frounded to, flattening in the sheets, and bracing sharp up, then'with their main-top- sail aback, and iib sheet to windward, lay easy for the pilot to come on board. In a few minutes, John Diver was on the deck of the schooner, and he at once asked for her commander. "I am he!" said Seawaif. "Have you a message for me?" "Yes, your honor!" said the young fisher' man, in a low tone, touching his hat. "I've * To con a ship, is to watch her course, and direct the helmsman how to steer.    orders from a lady to pilot you into a snug cove a league or so below the castle, and I'm ready to do it." ' i)rders from Misa Egerton?" asked the young captain, taking the pilot aft. "' Yes, your honor!" said Diver. "Then all is right. I'll put the schooner under your charge. Take her safely in, and you'll not have to ask for your reward!" "Thanks, your honor---rcekon I'll get paid ashore." "And aboard, too. How do you want us to erOcl^' y '  Keep your tack aboard, sir, and stand off iudcr easyesail, until a beadon is lighted for m,11,; and theen have your anchors all ready to come to in a narrow berth.

"Very; well; give your own directions as t, the suil you want, and the course to steer- but first come in the abhin, and take snomie- thing warm afte r your hard pull!" CHAPTER LXXVI. When Simon Wood returned to the eastle, he-asked of the old porter at the gate if either of the young ladies had passed out that even- ing. The old mnan, who had neither the lik- ing for, nor the fear of, the agent which was felt by most of the other retaincrs, saw by the manner of Wood that somethintgaifecting tile young ladies was in the muind of the agent, aid lhe replied that they had not, carefully- re- fraiiing even a hint thiat he had seen them. What woman lias gone from the castle since dark?" .asked Wood, sternly. No woman has passed the gate since dark!" said the porter, speaking truly, for it was ret twilight when pretty Jenny Rollison  went'by him. "It is rather strange! Who could it be that induced John' Diver to go off to that rcsitel? But I'll find it out from huim in tle ,o:nin'g. and wnho and what ticesc, lovers are thurt awakent such an interest in the' larts of thi .nohlu I demoishes. I'll do it, or Master ,ol, Driver will find this region too hlot for. hin; to live in '!"        / And theU agent pasoed on, soliloquizing still st ho went:  That was a glorious kiss, a wild and darncrous embrace to-day, but I could not help it.

It is an easy thing to get her in my power here, and she wanders about so much, that her disappearance could  be accounted for without brtinging suspiaion on my head! But I must see Sir Humphrey, and try to find out if he knows anything about an expected schooncrand certain lovers. If, as usual, he still lingers over his wine, it will not be a hard task-if not, I must en- deavor to get his company over a jorum of punch. I think I can manage it then well enough." The unscrupulous schemer then moved on into the castle to carry out his designs. It was well that John'Diver got on board of the schooner so soon as he did; rfot the gale in- creased rapidly in strength, and thie sea ran higher and higher every moment. he had not. been on board a half hour before Seawaif woa obliged to furl his topsails, and the schooner had all that she could 'stagger under. as she luffed to the wind under her foresail, jib, anti mainsail.  Meantime, with the night-glass in his hand, the volunteer pilot kept his station by the tee quarter, and looked down the coast to see the; beacon-fire, which pretty Jennie liaclpromiseed to light for him. He dared not steer for Brace- let Cove until he saw that light.  At last, far away-for thie schooner had edged up in the wind, until she was well off shore-- lie saw its red gleamnn flash up suddenly in the darkness, and lie cried to Seawaif: "1 You can brail up your foresail, sir, if you please, and ease off the main and jib sheets. We'll run down for that light, with the wind quartering!' The necessary orders were given, and iD a few moments the schooner; obeying her helm and canvas, veered off nearly before the wind: and sped away, like a winged bird, toward time dark and rocky coast. Seawaif felt some anxiety, for he knew th:I. if the pilot was either unskillful or trnehnie-,. ous, there would-beh no hope for the vessit.; nor yet for him and the crew, if the sclhooneir was wrecked, and they did escape to the shore-- for lie -had recently performed soee d!arinr deeds in the British channel awln along 'li coast, taking and burning vessels almost umnl'r the guns of some of their forts. and, sending in saucy messages by such prisoneis as' he took--fo r he chose rather to liberate them on parole, than 'be hampered with the care of them. But he had been cautious not to letI thecpilot know the nationality of his vessel-- in truth, John had been too anxious about thie beacon-fire and the rising gale to think of that -and the chances, whatever they were, nmust, now be taken. As-the vessel rushed in shoreward, the dark loom of the lofty cliffs could be dimly made out; and the fire lighted at the foot of the rocks could be bseen, growing brighter and  &#xD;<pb n="96-97 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6983-00000049"/> briglter as they advanced, and as occasionally frthe fuel was thrown upon it. "There is a female attending that fire!" silid teawaif to John Diver, as he lowered the glas, through which he had been examining it. "Yes, sir!" said lie; and then speaking to the lihllaiman, he baid: "Port your helm thlen. uad let her come up half a point- thlcr, steady so-keep her at that!" "Surely iss Egerton would not venture out : lone on such a night?" said Seawaif. ** It is inot her. It is a friend of hers, that I hopel yet to call Mrs. Jack Diver, sir " said tile hluct young filshernman. "*And that she is a truip, you may know; for she first got aie to colme off to pilot you, and then traveled well ou to four miles around the castle, alone, to get where she is now, to build that fire, so that I maight know how to run you into the Cove." "She is indeed a treasure, and shall not come to you without a dowry " said Seawaif. You'd better be ready to take in sail quick, sir, and have all clear with your an- lhors, for we can run but a little ways after we shoot in by the fire!" said Diver now; and he gave an order to the helmsman to keep sway a ifc more.  The dah of the great waves against the rocky wall before them could now be plainly heard, and maa an anxious eye peered out in the gloom ahead to see a sign or opening of a harbor. But none met the eye--only an unbroken line of rock seemed to rse out of the ,ea. On-on, the faster it seemed, as she neared the peril, drove the swift bark-lthe men stand- ing at the hallinrds and down-hauls-on, with the great black cliff towering away up in the sky, higher tha her mast-heads--on, and now the pilot himself sprung to the helm. The fire gleamed up   elose before them, tliir flying jibboom seemed almost over it; then the pilot shoved the helm hard astar- loard, and the cliff seemed 'to open for thelm, for they shot in through a dark, lofty gorge, turned an angle of rock, and in a few seconds were beyond the influence of the wind in a smooth little basin, which seemed to have been scooped out by the hand of Providenee as a haven of saety. Stay there till I eome in a boat fofr ye, Jeunie!" shouted John Diver, as the vessel flew past theofire; and in half a minute after. ward, he said to Seawaif: "In sails, sirif you please, and drop your anchor, for sie'll thae but little room to swing in, and headway must be cheeked, or she'll butt her brains out a against the rocks ahead" " In as litte time, ay, less, than it would take t is t  describe it, the schooner's sails were furled and her anehors down; and the pilot, v with a smile upob his coarse, but honest face,  stood and heard the praise of Seaiwf who t had just placed a purse of gold in hiu had.&amp; -   The pilot would have refused a reward so princely, but the young officer would not hear of it, but told him to keep secret the fact of the schooner's arrival, except with those only whom it concerned to know (the ladies), and -the reward should be doubled when be went to sea. "And now, my brave man, the next thing which I want to know is, how, when, and where I can see Miss Egerton?" "That I cannot say, sir, but Jennie can tell you-she that lighted the beacon-fire, and waits by it yet for me!" ' Then I will have a boat lowered and sent for her!" " "You had better send me, sir; she'd hardly come aboard with a stranger!" said John. "* Very well; go and bring her, and assure her she will be safe here, and free to go with you when she desires!" The boat was lowered, manned, and with Air. Doolittle in charge-for he volunteered to go-it rowed rapidly back to the entrance of the cove, where the fire, now no longer needed, was burning low.  But it burned bright enough to make Jennie Rollison look vey hanldsotne, as she stood there with Ute  gale blowing out her curling tresses, and the color of excitement flushing her cheek, and its light brightening her eyes. "Jerusalem! what a purty gal she is!" ex- claimed Mr. Doolittle-loud -enough to be heard even by her; and as she looked at his tall, slim, and ungainly figure, and his sharp- featured, cheese-colored face and yellowish hair, a comical smile came over her tace. "You'd better mind your helm, or you'll stave your boat " said Jaohn Diver, sharply, for lie, like most lovers, didn't care to hear his sweetheart's beauty praised by another man. The officer, however, was not so careless as that; he shifted his tiller over at the right time, and rounded the boat alongside of the rocky shore, upon which the pilot sprung. When John told Jennie that the commander of the schooner wanted to see her, she at first objected to go on board; but when he told her that it was to arrange with her how and when he could meet Miss Egerton, she thought how necessary it would be to have such an under- standing; and she permitted herself to be helped into the boat by him-refusing, to his infinite delight, the proffered services of Mr. Doolittle, who seemed exceedingly anxious to help her   '      lhe lieutenant seened rather chagrined at this, but gave his orders to push off, while he stowed an extra-sized chew of tobacco in his exceedingly large mouth; and in a short time the boat was again alongside of the schooner. Jennie was received on deck by Seawaif, who invited her and John into the cabin- Mr. Doolittle, seeming to be magnetically at- racted, followed; but Seawaif, observing him,  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6983-00000050"/> "You will please to attend to putting the vessel in order, sir. You can also say to Mr. Morley that I wish to see him here!" The lieutenant didn't seem to like this ex- pulsion from the presence of Jennie during the iantnhled interview, but he knew better than to disobey orders there; and therefore he turned away to do as he had been bidden. CIIAI'TEI LXXVIL   ' "You have done me a very great service, youandyour brave friend here " said Seawaif to Jlennie, as he plateed in her hand a purse quite a33 eavy as that which lie lad given to John. '-Ah, sir, I do not deserve this. I only whaitd to please SMiss Lizzie, and surprise her, for the did not know what I woa going to do!" Why, Jennie, you told tne Miss Lizzie sent you?" said John Diver, in utter astonishrment. How cculd you?" and he seemcid displeased anli hur thaut she had deceived him. "Just let me explain how I knew what she wanted, and why I did as I have done, John, and then blame me if you can!" said Jennie, coloring up at the rebuke, which both his words and tone implied. And then she told all about Simon Wood, and his doging the girls in their walks, and his capial upon twor:n in th.' tower. and how t'lto had doubled on ttim, and had learned, from their conversation, that they ;I'i t:ie on the sea. and in a schooner, whichl they looked for and w,a., I thi v Aoel ; a d a" r- a:' ifr he saifl an:ything to titun she niiht have bec:n die- covertd or delayed, she had concluded to do as she had done. Whila she spoke of Simon. Wood and his u/in!eoing atkantions to Venoha Dorset, nimre than one low-mlutlt rcd thrtat broke from the lid) of Morley, and when she alluded to him as a mean, low wretch, who had more than once insulted her, John Diver swore that he'd not leave a whole bone in his body when he set hiuml. So Simon made two very danger- ous enemies by information gained in that hour. You have acted most wisely and well!" said Seawaif to Jennie, as *ho closted her story. --And your young mistress will be more obliged to you than I can explain to you now. on tullust ianage to let her and Miss Dorset know where we are, without informing any one else. And that you may know how -I trust, and how important is the secret which I confide in you, know that y-S stand'this mo- ment in the cabin of an American privateer!" "My goodness! A Yankee vessel!" ex- claimed Jennie, turning pale. "I shall be hung for treason, for piloting you in here!" said John Diver, in dismay. "Be not alarmed, either of you. No one but yourselves and the ladies, who already know it, will discover who we are, even if we are found out in this out of the way place. We are not here to do any harm to the people,   we only come to see those we love, which you two cannot blame us for i" said Seawaif. No, sir-not that, but if we should be found out, it would go hard with us; and if you should bo taken, why, the poor young ladies would die!" said Jennie. "You shall be held harmless, for you can hie back to the castle before dawn, and good John can get back to his quarters also, and no ono slall know that you have been near uIs. You can tell the ladies wihre we lay, and doubtless a plan will seon be contrived for them to meet us in safety i" "That's so, sir?" said John, beginning to feel reassured. "You've noted the liractvr gentleman with us so far, iand I know  u'dl never betray those who've help'ed 'yof.

Well, Mr. Wood, Istn tolerably portly, es- pecially easy to be found about (hinir-lhne or a little later. What is wanted?" "Why, Sir Humplirev, as tis a very wild and stormy night outside, and the ga!e soudl; gloomy about these old lhalls tinnd toTers, I thought that if you would condescentl su if;t as to visit my poor apartments, 1 ndihbt n:i;,ki things a great deal mure cheerful for you as well as myself, over a bowl of nice hot p)t:i,.

"Why, yes, Mr. Wood ; you've such a. winning way' with oun, thist whent you an.-'. tion punch, pipe, a blazing fire, anrd a goo:.l story or two to boot, I can't find it ill my heart to refuse you. But the * blossuirss' will be expecting to see me in the drawing-room- I'd better see them firt,L" "I'll send a servant with 'our excuses to them. Sir Humnphrey.' Let me beg- you to go directly to my poor quarters, where all L   recdy for brewing the best punch that you ever, tasted 1" "Well, well-I can't say you nay. Lead the way, and I'll follow on the scent 1" The two passed on throughl a dimly-lighted hlall to a stair-case, where a servant stood in waiting with a light his hand. Taking this from him, the agent ordered the servant to inform the young ladies that the baronet would be engaged for a. while; and then, in a tone too low to be heard by the latter, said: "See that no one intrudes upon us!" ' "Well, on' my word--' poor quarters'-your poor quarters!' Why, Vood, you're quar- tered like a prince!" said the baronet, as he entered the room, which the agent designed to occupy that evening. It was a large, old-fashioned, but elegantly- firrnushed sitting-room. The walls were hung with paintings, portraits, sea-scenes, hunting, sketches, aid landscap'es. In a huge fire-place blazed a goodly quantity of oak wood, and more lay at Ia i,l ready to use for its replen- ishment. Full in front of it was a large, round table, and on it were sundry black bottles, a basket'of lemons, a bowl of sugar, and a huge, antique punch-bowil, which looked as if it had served umany generations. Before the fire, puffing out a nwreathy jet of steam, upon some coals, sat the kettle of hot water. And on the broad mantel above, a variety of pipes laid in siglat. The baronet glanced at this spiritual pre. paration with a look of pleased satisfaction, then turned to look at the pictures. "Why - why, how in Heaven came that here?" he asked, with every mark of sur- isisc in his features, as lie looked at the por- trait of a young imanl, elegantly apparelcd in a court dress, with several orders on his breast. "That, sir? Why, it is' the portrait of Lord Egerton, taken when he was young-so Sir  Peter Parker told me."  "Why, so it is-so it is; but it reminded "na so much of one whom I have, seen since,  that I thought it hiad een taken dately. The likeness is surprising. Venorat and fLizzie "Who does it resemble, sir?" asked the agent, so abruptly and so eagerly, that he put ;cst the dull baronet on his guard, for the latter replied : - No one that vou know, Mr. Wood. No- one that you know. Upon a second look I do. not know as the likeness is so great after all" i" The agent bit his lip with vexation. hIe felt that he had been upon the veiy point of gaining some insight into the mystery which perplexed ,him. But, though foiled, he was n't defeated - his hopes lay in the effects which the punch iuight produce; and drawing a large, cushioned, high-backedr chair be- sitle the table and beforle the nfirl, he seated the baronet. He drew another chair near,   but did not sit down. Tse punch was!yet to be brewed.   - "There is a great deal of science in brew- ing a good^Suneh, Sir Humphrey F' said the agent, taking up a letnon, and beginning to take off the rind carefully, not touhiag the pulp at all. " ou speak truly, Mr. Wood-truly!" said the baronet, leaning back in his comfortable chair, and crossing one dumpy leg over the other-a matter wlhiih seemed quite ditfficult. The agent saw what was wanted, and wesnt and brought a foot-stool, which clovated the pedal extremities of the baronet in a Umore comfortable nianner. "Ahl, thank ye; Mr. Wood, thaick ye; 'tis very thoughtful in, you." After the agent had pealod some half dozen or more lemons, he placed the rinds in the punch-bowl, and added such a qumntity of sugar as he thought necessary.  lie then poured a very small quantity of hot water 'in the bowl, to dissolve the sugar and extract the- aromea of the lemon and the' more exqsisite acid which is found in the rind. Then lie placed the kettle back on the coals. "This old Jamaintca rnm," said lie, taking up one of the bottles, ",was brought from the West Indies nearly thirty years ago by Sir Peter Parker, while he was a lieuteiinat."' "It must be mellow as oil!" said the ba; rotet, watching the rich color' of the liquid as it went in a flood of sapphire light down into the bowl. Thins brandy, I expect, came into this country without ever having paid duty, for in former days vast quantities of cognac were nsmuggled in on this coast, and it is said thlt the smugglers seldollm forgot to litvei toll at the castle!" continued the agent, as he emlp- tied nearly a bottle of brandy, into the. bowl, and gently stirred the contents with the'siifer ladle. "This arrack," he continued, producing a square, green bottle, ("Sir Peter pusrehiased in Oalcutta, nmny, smany years aigo. It gives body, as well as flavor, to the punch!" After he had stirred these ingredients up for a little time, le took Up the ketftle, and poured in boiling water for a few imomentu, until he had reduced it as murch as lie wished. And then he pronounced the punahl brewed- for in that era they knew nothtg of the now insdispensable addition of a couple of bottles of- champagne, and a quart of good, green tea. IlHe now raised the bowl upon a small iron tripod, and placed under it a lighted spirit- laimp, to keep its contents warmnn. Then going to a side-board, he selected two huge silver goblets, which gave 'an advantige to thO ;inuker-in that no one could observe' how much or how'little he drank, as wotild be tho' ease were the drinking-cups of glass. Filling one of these for the baronet, he ha-nded it to himns and said:  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6983-00000051"/> "There, Sir Humphrey, is a punch made secundesm artem, and 1 doubt if it can be much improved by any one!" Then taking care to 'only partially fill his own goblet, he took a seat in the opposite chair, and awaited the test opinion of Sir Humphrey. "It is indeed a capital punch, Mr. Wood-- capital! Why, sir, you are a philosopher!" said the latter, as he took a sip of the bever. age, which brought out a richer glow upon his ruddy face. "This is comfort, indeed, and the sough of the wind outside makes it all the heartier for us in here! I pity those who are out at sea, though, in such 'a gale; especially if they're off a coast like ours!" "Yes, there would be danger, indeed. You do not expect any one in our harbor, about this time, do you, Sir Humphrey?" me,? No, sir-not here! 1 rue, Sir Peter expected to be ordered home after his failure at Charleston, but his vessel whildn't come into 'this little harbor. It couldn't!" The agent saw that the baronet was not mellow enough yet for close-questioning, so he paused, until he saw that the goblet of Sir Humphrey was emptied, and then he hast- ened to refill it. "That punch is delicious, Mr. Wood. Some way I think you must have been born a gen- tleman, for you have the manners and capaci- ties of one.' "Sir, there is as good blood in my veins as any fli ly, notoyal, can boast in the realmr!" said Simon Woo!T, proudly. "How I became redtuced to my present position, or why I per- eit myself under an alias to remain in my pre-unt obscurity, is for the time my secret I But, Sir Humphrey, the day may come, and-I hope that it is not far distant, when I can re- veal myself to you-an:d then, sir, then you wibl not deem. it condescension on your part to favor mec with your conmpanvI' "Condescension, my dear'Mr. Wood? Con- descension in nme to sit with a man who can brew such a glorious bowl of punch as this? Ah, it is a pleasure, an honor, not' a coniles- cension!" and the baronet emptied his second geblet, which was speedily replenished by the wily agent, who pretended also to refill his own. from which he had only sipped a few drols. **You promised to tell me some stories, also, my dear Mr. Wood!" said the baronet. "I will, Sir Humphrey; but first let me fill a pipe for you. I have here some Turkish to. baeeo, brought by Sir Peter from Constantin- ople years slnce." The agent, having done this, sat down. and said, that he would relate a TRADITIONARY sIOXND or EoiMrroa CASTLX. CHAPTER LXXIX. U This legend was told to me," said the agent, "'by a very old man, who was in his   second childhood, and, consequently, garru- lous--and I doubt about there being a word of truth in it. But it may serve to amuse you, and so I'll tell it as it came to me : "A great many years ago, when one of the earlier Egerton earls dwelt here-a very stern and fiery-tempered man he was-he had a daughter said to be the most beautiful of her race. She ivas so exceedingly lovely that no man looked upon her whose heart did not melt adoringly at once. The fame of her loveliness went far and wide , and many of the bravest, most handsome, and noblest of the land came and sought her hand. "Her father saw this; and, though it grati- fied his pride, he looked upon all who came with a jealous eye, and' almost with hatred- for he so loved his child that he could not bear the thought, that another' should ever bear her from his side." "I know just how he felt. I've felt so about my blossom-my Venona!" said Sir Humph- rey, emptying his goblet once more. The agent had a mind to ask him ifany one had sought to win Venona from him yet; but then he feared the baronet was not mellow enough to yield a direct answer, and he re- frained, and continued his story : "But there was one amonj the many who loved her whom no common obstacle could foil-one who, when he had a desire, knew but one thought, and that was to obtain it. He was of nomle blood, but had no title-for he was a younger son. But he was proud, head- strong, wild, adventurous; and, until he had seen, by chance, the beautiful Lady Jane, had been as reckless and dissolute as any of the young men of his day-going as far into all extravagancies as his means would permit. "But, from the hour when fate threw himn into a spot where lie saw her, lie changed utterly, and in every way. All at once, his companions, who had noticed this change, missed him; and it was reported that he thal gone to serve in arns in some foreign land. But that was not the case. He loved too wildly and too much to *ar himself away front the sight of the star before which he had laid ,his heart's worship. And knowing that non6m 'but those who had wealth and lordly rank could ever enter her presence, as visitors, he disguised himself, so well that his nearest of kinm would not have known him, and entered the service of the earl as a huntsmuan. "This gave him frequent opportunities to see-though at a distance-the idol of his soul; for she, as well as her father, was ex- ceedingly fond of the chase, and very frequently enjoyed the sport." "Yes; the Egertons, like 'the Dorseys, all had. hunting blood in their veins," said the baronet. "The young huntsman," continued the agent, " by his skill and courage, attracted, more than once, the notice of both the earl   and his daughter; and, as he was not ill-look- iag, and his costume well became hi's splendid figure, he began not only to hope, but to believe, that the Lady Jane really felt attached toward him, humble as was his position. "But all too sooni'was he awakened from this dream of bliss. One day, when the lady, by accident, had become separated from her party, and a rising shower forced her to take shelter under the shelf of a cliff near the castle, he being the only attendant near, lie cast him- self at her feet, proclaimed his name and his passion, told her why he was in disguise, and that life, without her love, was to him worse than worthless. She received his address with a scorn so bitter, a contempt so intense, that he rose to his feet and swore he would humble her pride. "' And but for hearing the tramp of approach- ing horses, and knowing that some of her friends, perhaps the earl himself, was near, he had done some desperate deed, all too fearful for me tor tell. She heard the sounds; and, though but an instant before she had stood and gasped in pallid terror, the color came now to her face, and she bade him begone, or she would deliver him to the merited anger and vengeance of her father. . "He' mounted his horse and fled; but, ere he rode out of her presence, he swore a terrible oath, that he should yet humble her, or that' both should perish I "She shuddered when she heard him; but he rode off: and she was in a few moments joined by her father and his party, who had been alarmed at her absence, and sought her. When they came up, she greeted them as usual, not choosing to alarm her fitther by re- lating her recent peril."      ' "She did very wrong in' that," said Sir Humphrey, turning up the bottom of his goblet again. "My blossom wouldn't do so. I'll warrant if any hound should dare to insult her she'd tell me, and I'd right soon have him by the ears i" The agent smiled, and replenished the baronet's goblet, but made no response. He then continued his story: The huntsman suddenly disappeared, much to the surprise and regret of the earl, who had, more than once, given him tokens of his favor. "Weeks went on, and the lady, who, for a time, remembered his fearful threat, and was cautious never to be for a moment without attendants, one day got separated from them in the' excitement of the chase, and it was long years before she was again heard of. "When the earl and her attendants missed her, their alarm was' intense; and search was made for her near axd far, in: every no6k and corner, beneath every cliff, in every. lake and stream, over hill and dale; but all in vain. It nearly killed the earl--for, though he had sons, she was his only daughter, and his heart's pride.   "Poor man!--how I can pityhim! Were I to lose my blossom, I'd die --I know I should!" said the baronet. "Yars after," continued the agent, " apoor gibbeiding maniac woman was found at the gate of the castle; and, to the horror of the earl and all who had know-n her in her loveliness and purity, it was discovered that she was the wreck of the hapless Lady Jane. The hunts- man had kept his oath i" "The infernal scoundrel!" cried the excited baronet. "Hle ought to have been whipped to death with nettles!--bit to death by\ er- muda sand-flies, and roasted forever -in the hottest fire that could be fouid!" "Let me fill up for you again, Sir Hum- phrey-you touch the punch lightly." "You may, Mr. Wood-you may. That story is enough-to sober any man. I shall re- member it so long as I live. 'Poor girl--poor girl! The baronet felt so bad that he emptied the goblet, this time. at once, and handed it to the agent, who very readily poured out another ladleful of the strong puneh-'for he began to look asixiously to see it produce some effect on his guest.  "You don't drink, Mr. Wood-you-don't do justice to your own grog," sai Sir Humphrey. "Oh - yes, sir, I do-.'thio is my fourth goblet. I am but one behind you, and I'll soonube even there. Let mi refill your pipe." "Tlihank you; you are very kind, my deasi -Mr. Wood.  Really, you are very good. Without you, I should be vastly dull in the castle." And the baronet blew a cheerful cloud of smoke from his lips, and then sipped again and again of the punch, pronouncing it to grow better- and better the longer it steamed over the lamp, CHAPTER LXXX. - At last the baronet began to show signs of being a fit subject for the cunning agent to, work upon, to worm out the mystery about which'he was so anxious. Miss Venona is very beautiful, far more handsome than Miss Egerton, I think, Sir Humphrey," said Wood. "Yes-my blossom is as pretty as a pink t And she is as good as she is handsome!" "I should think, that before this she would have had more than one young man's heart at her feet "  "Who said she hadn't?'--who said sher hadn't? But no one shall ever have her-=no' one shall' ever have her!" said the baronet, hastily, showing more and more the effects of' his libations.  '        .  "It blows terriblySoutside--terribly," said the agent, suddenly and'artfully changing the' subject. "'The schooner which the young ladies were looking' at, at sunset, will have s hard time of it!'"  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6983-00000052"/> "The s lhooier? What schooner?" cried tihe hironet, aroused, and springhing to his feet. '- I do not know what schooner, sir-but it WIM o)ao which the young ladies seemedto re- coganze, and feel a deep intereit in!"  By Bacchus!--they wouldn't dare to come in here. But young Seawaif is as bold as a lion, an, li he dare do anything; and Morley loves Venona; but he sa'n't have her-he sha'n't have her!" cried Sir Humphrey. "Who are Seawaif and Morley, sir?" asked Wool; but again his eagerness awakened the pruduceo of the baronet, inebriated as he was, and the latter was on his guard, answering: o- shor:ly that you know, Mr. Wood-no- !,ody that you know.

It was alhnost dawn when Jennie Rollison- brave. true hearted Jennie--wjio had been es- corted to the gate of the castle by good John iv r, r rewarded him with a sweet kiss, and re- nwivm. the promise which had induced him to that night's peril and successful work, parted  with him-he to go to the port, she to get i w .thin to her room, unseen, if possible. i 'I declare, there is a light in the young aInditci' room yet!" she said, as she glanced to- warqn their window. "  I do wonder if the poor creatures have been up and watching all the  night. I may as well go and tell them the new' at. once. I couldn't sleep and keep so I groat a siecret all to myself!"' A few minutes later, Lizzie Egerton--who n 1   no,t retired, or even undressed-heard a a low, timid knook at her door. Arousing Ve- . nona, who had fallen asleep in her chair, she c Maid: "Who can it be, oozAho comes to us at such an hour?"  The knock was repeated, and Jenie'a low voice heard, gently asking:        L   ie  "Please to let mle come in, Miss Lizzie P" "It is a woman, whoever it is-there can be it i no danger," said Lizzie, and she unbolted the e- I door. "Jennie Rollison, as I live!" she cried, in e surprise, as she looked on Jennie's flushed face a and disordered hair.' "Why, where have you y been, my girl? We were looking for you e everywhere!"    : "I ave been at work for you, lady," said i Jennie. B  "At work for me? I do not understand , you V, "Please to tell me what you wanted me for, - Miss Lizzie, and then I will explain to you t what I have been doing 1" "We wanted to send you to the village upon an errand," replied Lizzie. r    "To try and get a pilot for the schooner which you saw just at sunset, and which was firing the signal-guns soon after dark, was it i not?" ' Why Jennie, you are a witch! 'How do ; you know that?" "Because I was very close to you when yon were looking at the vessel from the tower, last evening, heard what you said, knew what you twanted. But I was not quite so close as that villain, Simon Wood, whom I was watching all the time!"             g  "Simon Wood?"' "Yes, Miss Lizzie; he has been playing the spy upon you for some time, hiding himselr away .outside the main body of the tower, where you sit to look out upon the sea--and I have seen it. So, last night, J got ahead o01 him, and hid myself near his usual hiding- place, to see if I couldn't find out what he went'there for ; anrd I not only heard what you said, but found out that he had done so, too'; and would injure you and those you love, if it came in his power. So, after you had gone and he had followed, I slipped away and went to the port, and saw John Diver-the hand- somest and best fisherman that ever lived, if I do say it-and' got him to go off to the schooner, and pilot her into a little cove not far from here, which is known to very few peo- ple, and used to be visited only by smug- glers!" -      " " Why Jennie, what do you mean?". "Just what I say, Miss Lizzie I If yon doubt me, read this letter from Captain Sea- waif!' and Jennie drew the missive from her bosom, anid handed it to her mistress. "You needn't look disappointed, Miss Ve- nona," said the girl, with a mischievous smile, "Mr. Morley is well, and sent his love to you. 'Twas as much as I could do to keep 'en from coming direqtly along with me I never saw two young men quite so deep in love i" "The letter is indeed from Seawaif, and the schooner is at anchor, and in present safety. O  Jennie, how hall I reward you?" eried Liyo   "iL tnk I'm pretty well paid already, Miss iZtrio," said Jeanie, displaying the purso -of gold wlhich Seawaif had .given to her. '" lie gave my John one just'like it," she added. "Ohi gotl will never repay the half I owe yoe, Jed:suio," aild Lizzie: "You have lifted a terrible k weight from my heart.

Now they nar sifat(i, and ftflhere' not a thing on earth which you'd ai;ik of me, that I'd refuse you!" "Well,' Miss Lizzie, just to please you, I'll ask one very great favor,e" said Jennie, her bright eyes twinkling more merrily than ever. Name it, my'good girl-it is granted be- fore you ask it!:' "Then, Miss Lizzie, please let Captain Sea- waif kiss mse just once, after he has kissed youn --as I knmo he will whein he sees you.; 1 want to be kissed once by a real gentleman, justi t6 see if it feels different from being kissed by common folks!" "Yon shall have twenty kisses from him without any objection on my part," said Liz- zie, laughing. b- "' And you may have fifty from Mr. Morley," said Venonn, laughing also. "I don't care about any from him.' He isn't near so handsome as the captain," said Jennie, demurely. "He  hasn't got any whiskers!" "And he didn't give you a purse of gold, ell, Jennie?"   , "Oh! Miss Vcenoa--'mn not so mean' as to value a man fur what lie gives me! But to speak truly, he is a very nice, handsome young man; and' when his whiskers grow out like the captain's, he will b1e very pretty, I am asure! But I think I had better go off to my own room now, nail tumble up my bed a bit, so that none of the rest of the girls, if they go in my room, will see that I've been out. And then, as soon after dayliglt as 1 can get a good chance, and not be watched by that mouse-eat, Mr. Simon Wood, i'll see you again, and we'll formni some 'plan. for you to see your lovers with no danger to them or you.

"I think we had better follow' her example, Venona; and if we can, get a couple of hours' sleep, or we shall look any way but interesting when we meet them," said Lizzie, as Jenny went away. "I m of your mind, Lizzie ; but I fear that little sleep will visit our eyelids this morning. I am so happy that they are safe!" "Bless the noble, thoughtful girl! She shall never be forgotten!" said Lizzie. i tvmoncler if Soawaif will appreciate her de- silre fr' a kiss fronm 'a rmeal gettlemain' and gtratify her?"'

Day is acthy dawning,!" said Veuona.  "So it is-nevertheless, it is necessary that we should give our bed the appearance of hav- ing slept in it, as Jenny is going to do with hers!"  CHAPTER LXXXII. At the very first glimpse of dawfn, Simon Wood, withi a spy-glasa in his hand, stood upon a point of the castle wall, from which he could get a view of the sea for many leagues, 'and  also look ddwn into the harbor, and 'upon the village. But froing no point inside of the castle walls could the cove be seen where the schooner had been anchored. Far as the eye could reach, seaward, only a wild, tumultunous mass of waters was in view. The gale, still fresh, though not so high as it, had been, had lasihed the ocean into a fearful rage. Its great topping waves, crested with foam, came tumbling in toward the coast as if they would overwheln it; and, there, strikinr-- the huge, rocky cliffs, sent n1'p their ;antr:y breathing in clouds of spray and fell back: in great drifts of tam.. Not asail ould be seen far or near, not m strange vessel was in the harbor, nothing in sight at the village dcnotlI anything of, an exciting or unusual nature. "It is strange! She must have worked off to sea to avoid the danger of a lees shore, Yet with a pilot on board, she could 'have come into the harbor last night, I should think!" muttered Wood, with a disappointed air. "I' go down to the village, at any rate, and see it John Diver as returned, or been heard of!" The agent, having formed this resolution, :he hastened to put it in execution, The very first person whom 'he met, as he passed the cottage of Hiannolct, where Diyver boarded, was John himself-looking, with his tumbled mair, and jacket on his arm, as if he had just turned out of bed, "Itf.' a very nihte, clear morning. after the blow last night, MiantepD'Iver," Bsal the agent-'  &#xD;<pb n="104-105 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6983-00000053"/> in a tone meant to be very friendly and con- descending. "Any fool might see that without giving himself the troublle to ask you to tell him so, Mr. Simon Wood," said John, gruffly.  Why, what is the matter, Master Diver? Have you got up cross this morning?-or perhaps yon haven't been to bed at all r" said the agent, still kindly-for he sought anything but a quarrel with the fisherman just then. He wanted news from him. "I don't know as it's any of your business, Mimon Wood!" "* Oh, pooh-you're testy this morning. A glass of good rum will put you in a good humor-come and take one, at my expense- I see they're opening at the Jolly Tar " "When I want a arink, I'm aile to pay for it ; and if I weren't, I'd go dry till doomsday, before I'd let yon pay for what passed my lips!" 'Why, you're in a terrible humor this morn- ing. I'd like to know how I have crossed you, to receive such treatment as this!" "You haven't crossed me directly, Simon Wood-if you had, I should have choked your lufflong ago. But you have wronged my friends, insulteld them that I love; and you are gene- rally a mean. dirty, low conniving scoundrel. The further you ate away from me, the better I feel. You smell bad to me, you look bad, you are bad-and yon know it!' "Very well, Master John Diver-very well, sir! If you wi quarrel, why quarrel let it he!" cried Wood, now thoroughly enraged. Perhaps you'll know to your cost, who it is that you are trifling with!" "Perhaps youll know how a broken head feels, if you go to threatening me, Simon Wood. r know you, from stem to stern, from truck to kelson; and you're as rotten a craft as ever stood on two legs. You're not fit for crab-bait-if you were to drown, the eels would wriggle their tails and swim away from you, you*re so pison "' "Where did Tou go with your .boat, last night?" asked Wood, almost choking with rage. None of your busines!" replied the fisher- man. "I'I' make it my 1nwees ionu probably went off to some smuggler, or went into some mischief! If the vetel you went to had been on an honest errand, she would have been in the harbor now; for you could have brought her in as easily as not, with a fair wind-far easier than she could work off in such a gale 1" "What do you-the remnant of a bloody red-back-know about vessels and gales?. said John, contemptuously, and he passed on toward the "Jolly1 Tar.' "That scoundrel s deceiving me; but how, I cannot tell Can it be possible, that Miss Egerton can have arranged with him previ- naly to take a mesage off to an expected   schooner, if one came and made signal? It must be so!" muttered Wood. "But how to find out, is the question. Let me think-this fellow has been courting pretty Jennie Rolli- son, whom I had picked out as a pigeon for my own picking before magnificent Venona Dorset came on the carpet. She must know the secret, and they say women can't keep secrets. I'll test her; and if gold can't get it out of her, fear shall!" And Mr. Wood, with this idea in his mind, returned to the castle. CHAPTER LXXXII. When day-dawn came to the schooner, it found Seawaif and his officers, as well as most of the crew, on deck; for it was but natural that they should'desire to see into what kind of a place they had been brought in the night- the more especially that they were within the bounds of the enemy's country, and not upon neutral ground, as they had been at or near Matanzas. They found that they were in a snmll semi- circular or half-moon-like bay, with narrow en- trances, or outlets, at either ends, and protected in the centre by a huge and lofty cliff, so like the remaining line of coast, that from a short distance outside, no sign of a break or harbor could be seen. Inside, the cliffs were almost as perpendicular and inaceossible--presenting only here and there a few platforms beneath the overhanging rocks, where men could find a footing. Above, all was bleak and drear, not a sign of a human habitation, or the mark of man's hand could be seen. As the spot where the pilot and Jennie were landed could not be seeti from the deck, and he had represented that there was the only passable pathway from above, it was deemed best by Seawaif to keep a boat there continually, and also to station an officer and a guard there, to prevent the possibility of surprise. The boat was to bring any visitor who came from the castle, on board. Mr. Doolittle at once volunteered to com- mand this guard, perhaps because he hoped thereby to get another glance at the pretty Jennie; but the captain represented that it would do just as well to place a subaltern officer there, and Mr. Doolittle was disappoint' ed in his ws. 4I I sink I should like to go to ze shore, and zere to stretch my legs," said the doctor, as he glanced at the platform before alluded to. No need o stretchin' 'them-they're long enough now, and almost as thin as a pair of pipe-stemsn, said Mr. Doolittle, spitefully, wishing to vent his ill humor on some one. 4 Messieur Dooleetel, ze comparison yolu make between my leg and ze stem-pines will not prove itself true. If you do not believe zat, I will demonstrate heem for you Sup- pose I strike you wiz one pipe-stem, so--and it break!" and he broke the stem of a clay  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6983-00000054"/> pipe, which he was smoldng, rver the shoulder of the lieuterant. "But now chserve, if yo. lease, I kick you very hard wiz my leg, and it do not break!P And suiting the action to the word, the doe. tor planted so heavy a kick in. that portion of the body where kielm usually are bestowed, that Mr. Doolittle was actually lilftd from tho deck. Fortunately, the captain interfered jnst at this moment, or something serious worithave happened; for Doolittle, almost blind with nlge, snatched a boarding-axe from its beeket, and would, have used it, pehaps fittadly, upon the unarmed doctor. i Mr. Doolintle, I shall nevertake the trouble to remind you a third time,that there must be no quarreling on the quarter-deck of this' vessel t" said he, sternly.. ")id you see him kick me, canp'n?" "Yets, sir; and also beard. the uncalled-for fjnd insulting renmark which caused him to do it!" said Seawaif, sternly. 'sAlthough I do notjintify him in using violence on the quarter. deck, I do, not blame him for. resenting an in- dignit- y!" nCapitainc, I apl1ogie to your- quarter.. deck, tuany times. I only wish to demonstrate to Meh:sicur Doolcetel.,at he was mistake in Ilia eomirison. If I 'ave so done to ki/ satis- faction, /am very much content, Ifnot, and' he shall desire more exercise, I shall. be very- miuch'more content if you will permit him to. go wiza hi to stretch our legs on ze shore!" Seawaif could scarcely repress a smile at this proposition of the doctor's, and the man- ner in whelic he delivered it; but he replied: "You can go on shore if you wish, doctor,. understanding that you are not to go beyond' that cliff there; but I have duty on-bosar, for Mr. Doolittle!" "I am not to go beyond ae oleef?" said the doeto:, looking comically- at the# impassable precipices of the mountain. "Wizeut. I 'ave wings like ze aigle, or pinions like one angel, I sink I shall not go beyond ze cloef I Ze goat could not climb zere-if Messicur le General Wolfe had such a precipice as iat to climb at Quebec, I sink sat he and'General Montcalm would not now be dead. I will not go beyond ze elefc, capitaine I extend to you my honare Zat I will not!" And with this, the doctor entered the boat which was about going to the shore, taking with him a emall bottle ofea de ve as aeom- lanion. CHAPTER LXXXIV. When Simon Wood returned to the castle from the village, he had arranged his plan fully for a cunning erossrexamfnation of Jennie Rollison. He knew that he had a keen wit to eontend with, but being confident that it was difficult for a woman to keep a eecret-and   determined to use both gold and po*Wr 'o o5- tain it, he felt almost Pure that he would suc- ceed. So, while taking his breakfast in his room,. as he usually did, alone, he bade theo servant toll Jennie that he wantedf to see her a numncent; and," he added, to the man, " when sle cornmlc' you can leave the room* I wish to c,- her nlone."  No one, to- see thm fresh and rosy checks of Jennie-her-bright and fearless eyes, ai lier- ncat figure, apparelled with so muncii care-- woul fthr an instant lave dreamed that she had passed a sleepless night, one of excitemint- as well as peril Fresh fromn her ablutions and dressing-talde, she looked as if she had passed: a halDy and' dreamy night. "Take a seat, my pretty Miss Jenny! Why. how sweet and frelihyoutlook this morning-' on my word, you grow more and' more charnm- ing every day!" said the agent, with a very grim ttempt at a winning smile on his pall:* face. *"I supposed' you wahted to see me on sonme business, sir! can lihear complihients else- where, and from those I like Better than you!" said the brave girl, with-an indignlmnt tosse (,' her head, which- shook her ringlets like a. shower-of'honeysuckles over iher wlite neck. "Ahl now don't be pettish, my dear Jennie," said he,.in a soothing tone. "-You know tJh:t I think a-great deal of you!"' "When it iw to your interest you nmay ay  so, but you, like nothing but your own mean, ti miserable, ugly self! If 'you have businses. with me, shy so--if not, I wrill go'back to my father, who is waiting at breakfiist for mo!" ' "Well, sit down; Jennie, sit down, and I Will tell. you what I sent for you for!" She took a chair, and'placing it quite a 1\-. tance from him, sat down. "Yon was very sly, my dear, when yon;: went down to see John Diver, last night, wit!: a message from your mistress," said he. He had spoken utterly at random; bi;t a nervous start which she could not quite snp- press, and a change of color, told hin) that ife had hit somewhere near the mark. But. in a seoend she recovered her self;possession, anid seeing through his plan of examination, re- plied: "I did not bear any message froni my mis- tress to John Diver, last night, eir!" "Oh, of course not. You called hini out from the 'Jolly Tar' on your own account en- tirely, I suppose," said lie, carelessly, as if he knetw she had been the one who had' been Peen. to speak to him. She made no reply ta t thi ; buth rising, said: "-Is this all tho business you have with me?" "K Not all--not all, my dear Miss -Jennie. Do * you see this purse?" "I am not blind, sir," she answered. "Well, Jennie, there are five guineas in it!"' "Indeed '   Yesa; and by just honestly answering one 'question, you can be the owner of them!" "Well sir, first put your question, and then I'll consilder Whether it is best for me to answer it!"' Well, Jennie, tell 'm e what message your mistress sent off to that schooner by John Diver, last night ", A new plan of operations in a second flashed across the fertile mind of the young girl. Fix- ing her eyes upon the purse, more to conceal her true thoughts than anything else, she seemed'to-study whether she' should respond to the question or not. The agent's keen eyes flashed with the theought of coming triumph. 'i Should I tell you, will you promise me never to say a word to John Diver or my mis- tress, and to hold him harmless in every'way?" she said at last, hesitatingly, but witi her eyes nxied on the purse, as if there lay the reason of her yielding. Yes ; I will not only pronnise that, but I will do more. I will please John by giving his friend and partner, Hannoek, a year's rent free, of the cottage he lives in." "No-don't do that, Mr. Wood, or John would suspect me. But write out your pro- mise to hold him harmless, and then--then perhaps I'll tell you what you wish!" With eager haste the agent wrote what she desired, anl! handed her the paper. She read' it and placed it in her bosom ; and then reach- ing her hand for the purse, asked permission to count the money. "It is all right," said Wood, more and more eager as lie felt more sure of learning what he sought to know.  "Yes," said Jennie, putting the purse iii her pocket. "Well, Mr. Wood/ since I've taken the money, I s'pose I must tell. It was me who went down and sent John Diver off to the schocner; arid I gave him a letter from Miss Lizzie 'to her lover, the captain ,of that schooner!"' "Whatis his name?" aslked Wood, excitedly. * I forget now-lie is an officer in the royal navy, ait lord something or other-on my woixt, I forgeft. Bat I can find out when he comes agdaiin-lie is to come again in one month from list night!" "Htow do you know that?" "Oh, John brought word to my mistress, bef*e day, this morning!" "The rascal! Htow close he was this morn- ing. I could get nothing out of him!" "' Oi! sir, do be carefil not to hint to him what I have told you-nom to my mistreas, either. It aould be my ruin if you did!" "Don't fear, Jennie- don't fear. But you have not told me all. Miss Venona Dorset also has a lover on board that schooner!   : "Yes, sir-I believe she has!" Did che not also send and receive a letter?" '"Yes, sir-she did. 'You seem  to know   everything. There is no use in my trying to conceal anything from you!" "That is true, Jennie. And now that you have'acted so well in this matter, I feel in- clned to 'be generous with you, and employ ,you further. Can you not; manage. to get the letters which John brought to the ladies,'from 4them, for me?"  . "I can try, sir!"     r A" nd also listen-and learn what their 'plans and arrangements are, and let me know all the time. They confide in you, it seems, and you can keep me nconstantly informed of their ma- nceuvres and intentions!" "So I can, sir!" "Do it, then, Jennie, and I will reward you liberally r!" "Yes, sir-and if you'll not take it amiss, sir, you can help nie, by doing one thing!"'- "' What is it, my dear r?" "If you please, sir, seem to be very angry with me, and with. them also. Don't come around them any more, or seem to watch thleir actions at all, or follow them when they go out; but leave all to me, and I'll let you know of every step which they take, and every thought that they utter i" "Your plan is good, Jennie, and I will fol- low'it. 'llll keep myself close over my ac-- counts in the castle, and you can let me know every day of anything new which occurs!" "Iadn't you better pretend to be sick, sir? Then they would be twice as bold and caie- less, and I should be sure to learn all that you desire to know, It will not be hard for you to keep your room for a few days, I am sure!" "No--I like your plan again, Jennie, and will follow it-commencing this morning. I begin to feel sick already." "Then, sir, I'll bid you good morning-fear not but that I'll do my part!" And Jennie left the roomn, Mr. Simon Wood beinu fully satisfied that he had extoried " the whlAe truth, and nothing but the truth" from' her, and secured her to his future service.  CHAPTER LXXXV. "O' Miss Lizzie-Miss Lizzie, I have had such fun!" cried Jennie, a few moments after she had left the room of Simon Wood, enter-' ing the apartment where Miss :Egertoi and Venona were busy in perfecting their morning toilet. "That ld mouse-cat;, Simon Woodt; has been trying to find out what 'I and John Diver were doing last night. . He gave me five guineas and ainriting to hold John harmless in all things; and I told him--"  "What, Jennie? You surely have not be- trayed us!"!"1 , Oh, ye,: I kae, Miss Lizzie 'The five guineas were such a tCmpa'tionp , and thun 8tmon called me his dear,. an loaoked so lov- ing.' He-would have -won an angel over to commit sin, and turned butter-milk into ew;et  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6983-00000055"/> cream again! Those little black eyes of his, glittered like glow-worms in a bag I! "What did you tell him? You may have ruined us!" "I expect I have, Miss Lizzie! But the temptation! Why the old fox means to mar- ry me, and he has saved up a mint of money out of his stealings from your uncle." "Jennie--don't you see that I. am getting angry? Tell me the worst at once." "Well, Miss Lizzie, I told him that you sent me with a message and a couple of letters to John Diver. That he, the said John, as the squire used to say, was to take the letters off to the schooner, to your lovers there--" "O Jennie--Jennie, what have you done?" "Don't interrupt me, if you please, Misa Lizzie, till I make a full confession to you, as I did to him. John was to take the letters off to the lovers of you two young ladies-who were officers of high rank in the royal navy- and in one month from last night, they were to come again, and carry you both off!" "O you witeh-I see now.   You have been putting him on the-wrong track!" "Don't interrupt me, please, Miss Lizzie. I haven't told you yet, half of my wickedness. I have agreed, for certain golden considera- tions, to play the spy upon you-to watch every step you take-to listen to your talk, steal the letters you have received, and keep old mouse-trap constantly posted on every- thing you do. And rest assured, I shall-he shall know to an ounce how much pomatum you put on your hair, and how much pearl pow- der there is on your white necks. In the mean time. I have persuaded him to leave the field entirely to me; and he is so fully convinced of my faithfulness to his interest, that he is going to sham sick, and remain in his room, on lemonade and gruel, while I watch you! Now am I not a very, very wicked girl?" "You are the best-hearted, quickest-witted, dearest creature in the world!" cried Lizzie; and in the exuberance of her joy, she clasped the plump girl in her arms, and kissed her agamn andaain* rDpon't, Mises Lizzie -rdon'," said Jennie, with well-assumed confusion. "tI'm not used to being kissed." And extricating herself from Lizzie's arms, she stood with the forefinger of her right hand In the corner of her mouth, and twisting up her a pron with her left hand, looking so irre- sistibly comical and mockingly bashful, that both of the young ladies burst into almost un- controllable laughter. "How now-how now!" cried Sir Humph- rey, taking a father's liberty to enterthe youngn ladies'dreing-room. "What's set you both  a gallop this morning so early, blossomes?"  Gh, ntotlibig mua, fa&amp;ther, we are merely laughing'for o hetlth-taklng sehinatory1 exercise, that we may becom, t like your.  alf," sid Venona.    "Fat like me? You two girls would look fine if you were as fat as I am. If you were in the market then, you'd go by your weight, and not by your looks. But that wasn't what I came for-haven't you got something good for the headache, bloesom?" "For the headache, father?" "Yes, for the headache, child. I drank some of the blessedest best punch, which Simon Wood brewed for me, last night, that I ever tasted, and I believe it laid me under the table. At any rate, I have the worst head- ache this morning that I ever felt. I've three bee-hives and a mill-dam in my head at least, this morning, by the feeling of it." "Drinking punch with Mr. Wood was you? Did he drink with you?" asked Lizzie. "Oh! yes, like a man! And told stories while I smoked anddrank, and had a jolly timeo generally." "This is the first time he has done so, is it not?" "Yes, blossom; but what of that? I knew he'd come into my way when he'd seen how happy I was. The force of example is every- thing." "Didn't he have a good many questions to, ask you?". "Some, it seems to me. Let me think-f believe he said you'd seen a schooner off the coast, last night-I remember something about it; but I was rather drowsy when lie told me of it. Did you see one, blossoms?" "There was some kind of a vessel off twh coast, last night; but she is nowhere in sight this morning," said Lizzie. "Sit down, father, and let me bathe your head with some of this aqua ammonia-shut, your eyes, and don't snuff up any of it, or it ma set you to dancing." The baronet obeVed. directions, and in au short time felt decidedly better; and by the time that the ladies were prepared for break- fast, he felt ready to accompany them. Jennie had left the room when lie entered. and was now with her good old father, who loved her quite as well as the baronet did his daughter. CHAPTER LXXXVI. "Where is Mr. Wood this morning?" asked the baronet of the personal servant who usu- ally waited on the agent, after Sir Humphrey had finished his breakfast. "He is quite unwell, sir-too sick to leave his room," said the man, who had already re- ceived his instructions from the agent. "  So-so! He hasn't quite so old a head a. mine on his shoulders--isn't quite so stiff be- low! He can't stand his grog so well. The punch was too much for him, I expect. Well. well-tell him the hair of the dog cures the bite. If he wants to feel better and get quite sober, tell him to take enough toddy thi, morning to put him halfway over the bay,   iand he'll soon feel all right as a six-year old in pasture!" And the baronet returned to the sitting- room where the ladies were.  They were busily engaged with Jennie, about something or other. But whatever it was, they evidently meant it for a secret, for they stopped talking when the baronet came in, and Jennie hurried out of the- room. "How does your head feel now, dear father?" asked Venona. "Oh,. better, blossom-better!" "Hadn't you better go to bed for a little while? A little repose will do you good!" "D'ye think so, blossom-d'ye think so?" "Yes, father!" "Well, maybe 'twill--maybe 'twill! The best joke out is, 'that Simon Wood is sick abed -this morning! He couldn't stand his own punch-poor fellow I couldn't stand his own punch!" And he laughed heartily. "But what are you going to do? I see Lizzie has put her hat and shawl on, and has yours in her hand." "Oh . we're going to take a little walk, as we usually do in the mornings, father."- "Hadn't I better go along, blossom?" "I think not, father. Rest will help your head the most. We are only going to'take a little run out, and will soon be back. Let mn fix a place on this sofa here by the window, -where the fresh air will come in. Wait a mo- ment, and I will bring pillows, and fix you comfortably ." And Venona hurried away for them. "What a blessed blossom she is," said the happy old man, as he looked fondly upon her receding form. She soon returned; and having prepared the sofa for him, and persuaded him to. lie ,down, she kissed his hot brow, and then joined Lizzie, who was waiting for her at the door. "I was so afraid that he would insist upon joining us, as usual; that I hardly knew what to do," said Venona. "But he is settled for an hour or two, I think." And the two sweet girls went out arm in arm firom the castle, for a walk, unattended, as they so often did, that they would not attract any particular attention. Passing through the gate, they went around by a narrow foot-path to the west of the castle.; and after they had got out of sight, hastened along into a dense grove, which extended for ,some way along down the coast, at first upon a path, and then, under the guidance of Lizzie, who knew the ground well, striking off, to the right, into the thickest and roughest part of the tangled forest. "'How does your heart feel, Venona?" asked Lizzie, as they paused to take breath, after -some ten or fifteen minutes walk. "It beats so loud that I should think you could hear it," said the other. "And mine, -too, is thumping .ike a druam-   mer after recruits," said Lizzie. "Butcome on, coz-it is yet a quarter of a mile to the spot where Jennie is to meet us." Now, Lizzie didn't say that any one was to meet her and Venona, besides Jennie-yet her heart never would have thumped away in her bosom at that rate, if she had been only going to meet the butler's daughter. CHAPTER LXXXVII. Morley and Seawaif were standing aft on the quarter-deck, with their heads in very close proximity, conversing in a low tone upon some subject which seemed to engross their -entire attention, for they did not notice what was amusing the, crew very much-the antics of the doctor, who was taking a course of gymnastic exercises, upon one of the ledges or platforms of rock, which we spoke of in our brief description of the bay. At one moment, --he would try the extent of his powers in jump- ing--then he would dance all the steps of a minuet-then le would walk upon his hands, wit his head thrown forward like that of a chicken suspended by the feet, while his long legs hung loosely down over his back like limbs of India-rubber. The first thing which drqw the attention of Seawaif and his young officer was- the ex- clamation of Mr. Doolittle, who had been lean- ing sulkily against the quarter-hammock rail, ever since the doctor went ashore, looking any- where but -at the latter. "Jerusalem! there comes that purty red- headed gal agin h" saidMri Doolittle., And as the officers looked in the direction which occupied his attention, they saw the boat which -had been sent on shore, coming off with Jennie Rollison in the stern-sheets. Both of them went to the. gangway to re- ceive her, and then escorted her into the cabin with far more deference than she would have, received, had she been an ambassadress from the King of England. Mr. Doolittle made an instant excuse to go into the cabin also. - The face6of Seawaif dark- ened as he saw him, and he said: ' Mr. Doolittle, you will do me the favorite take a spy-glass. and go np to the fore-top. gallant cross-trees, and look carefully in every direction to see if you can see a 'sail in sight. You Will please remain there until I call you down, for I may have some more questions to ask while you are aloft P' "Ay, ay, sir 1" said Doolittle, very sulkily,' for he'knew precisely what he was sent aloft for -his company was not required in the cabin. "I know them two is each in love with a gal, and that their gals are ashore here some- where l" muttered Doolittle, as he left the cabin. "And I can't see why they should be so tarnation selfish and all-fired mean as to want to monopolize this one, too! - I know she's 'taken' with me, by the way she looked-  and laughedwhd when I saw her first. And if I  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6983-00000056"/> only had a chance, maybe she wouldn't give me the mitten, like Kate Cringle did! By jockcy, they hadn't better make me much mad- der than I am, or I'll spoil the fun with their gals for 'em! I'll be swiggered if I'm goin' to be kicked by a frog-eatin' Frenchman, cheated out of a chance to even talk to a pretty gal, and be treated like a mangy dog ginerally, without having some satisfaction! Darn my buttons, if I'll stand it! That's said, and just as good as if 'twas sworn to!" Mr. Doolittle having procured a glass, now slowly mounted the fore-rigging, and had but just reached the cross-trees when Seawaif and Morley catne out of the cabin with Jennie ; and entering the boat which had brought her to the vesocl, it was pushed from the schooner's side, and steered toward the landing. "I eay, cap'n I! I see nothin' from up here!" cried Mr. Doolittle, not liking the idea of re- maining up there while the cantain went on shore, nor yet liking to risk his anger by coin- ing down without orders. K' Icp. your eye on it, then, air!" said Sea- waif, and in a minute more the boat had rounded tlse point of rocks, and was out of sight. I Well, I swow! This is enough to make a feller swear at his grandmother " said the mate, and sitting down on the cross-trees, lie turned his glass landward, toward the lofty, chalky cliffs, covered with a stunted growth of trees; but looking too barren and dismal to invite a desire for a nearer inspection. But while Mr. Doolittle looked in that di- rection, he saw something which made his eyes dance and twinkle like a couple of duck's eggs in a kettle of boiling water. "By jingo--I see calico a flutterin' through them scrubby bushes!" he muttered. "There's two on 'em by mighty t . I wonder if them is the gals the cap'n and Morley is goin' to sec. I reckon the eanp'n 'll wish he hadn't sent me up here now I By lhokey, I don't want to go ,lown now-gee up and go 'long, crack your whips, I'm in clover now! I Ireckon I ain't keepin' my eve on nothin' now!" Mr. Doolittle felt so good, that had he been on deck, lie would have danced-as it was, he hitched up and dows on the cross-trees, and shook his lanky legs about, as if he couldn't keep them still. CHAPTER LXXXVIII. It was two hours or more before the boat returned with Seawaif and Morley in it; and vet Mr. Doolittle had remained at the mast- head all that time, without evincing the slight- est wish to come down. When Seawaif came on board and saw him, he felt a regret that he had been so severe with him; and, calling him down, told him as much. "Oh, yon needn't feel bad, cap'n; I was very comfortable up there I I was taking ob- servations 1" q*   And the lieutenant looked so " knowing," as he said this, glancing shoreward, that Seawaif looked up at the mast-head, and seemed in- stantly to compare its altitude witht certain localities on shore. Whatever may have becci the mental result of his comparison, he eanil nothing more to Mr. Doolittle ; but turned to. the doctor, who had come on board durintu his absence, and asked how he had enjoyed his visit to the shore h Ahll, I was very mnuch delight, mon chor capitaine!" replica the doctor. "I exerciso myself in several position--I stretch my legs. and my arms, and my body: everysing I stretch except imy neck l" ' Tlhe hangmnan'll do that. some day!" mut- tered Mr. Doolittle; but he was very carf:! I to say it in such a low tone, that it did not reach the ears of the doctor, or lie undoubt- edly would have received the benefit of an- other " demonstration a" of the meaning of "kick." "How do you like the looks of things here- away?" asked the captain. "Ah, sare, zey look very firim-but nut very fruitful." "Not quite so beautiful as Cuban scenery?" "No, sare ; but far less dangercuse! I 'ave not observe here any snakes." And the doctor shrugged up his shoulders, and shuddered, as lie always did wlhn lie thought of his snake adventure in the Rio Caniima. "How long, if you please, capitaine, will we renima  in zis lplace?" continued the doc- tor. "Not a great while, I think. We will rest the men a little, refit our rigging, and set it 1up, and then again skim the sca irf search of glory and prize-money.  But why do you ask? )Do you anticipate a dull time while we remain?" "Oh, no, messoiur lo capitaine, I am nevaro dull. But if you were to permit your mens to go on ze shore and climb among zeus rocks, I sink in a very leetel while I should 'ave zo pleasure of amputat sonmesing, or at ze least to repair some broken bones." The steward now having announced dinner to be ready, the officers adjourned to the cabin. The crew had been piped to dinner al- ready. CHAPTER, LXXXIX. After dinner, Seawnif came on deck again, accompanied by Morley; and  iving him an intelligent glance, said:  "I think I'll take ano ier stro on shore. Morley. I wish, withou/its being ai-ced by Doolittle, that you would convey  Swiss chamois hunting rifle into the boat, Do it directly, while I occupy his attention orward in examining the gammoning of tihe bowsprit, which may have been strained during the laie  heavy weather.'   I!korley looked Ihis assent, for Doolittle ?-41ne up fat that moment, and he could not "Mr. Doolittle, come forward with me a moment!" said Seawaif. "I think the gam- bouing on the bowsprit wants overhauling, and most likely the head-stays need setting up. The heavy weather we've had of late must have stretched them." "It moug'lt be-so 1" said Mr. Doolittle, who' was picking his teeth with 'a straw, which lie had pulled from the cabin broonm. - And while he went forward with the captain, Aio-ley sltepped into the cabin, and. brought ,mt one of those short rifles of large bore a4sd by the Germans and Swiss, which carry to :m immense distance, aid though not so aic- " a ;' i sY the Amerie',i rifle, are deadly at a ,lnfuh graeter range. 'lTis he eoncealedWi the :,ti ali,side, with its ammunition, and then ,ie 'ivlt forward to where the. captain and Doolittle;: were standing, while the boatswainu and his umntes ripped the cover from over the -aiinmoniug. Seawaif knew from his look that he had done that which he had bidden him do ; and after he had -seen that the work which he required doieo was underway, he said to'him: "I think I'l take another run ashore, Mr, Morley, and reconnoitre. We must'be very careful while here to guard from a surpritse! Would you like to accompany me?" "If you please, sir!" said the young of- ficer. "Well, have the boat manned, and we'll Aind!" said the commander. This was done; .and in a few moments the boat was on its way to-the shore. "They think they're -cute now!" muttered Mr. Doolittle to himself, after they were gone. Think they're real cunnin'!" And he took a huge bite of tobacco from a pig-tail twist. "The cap'n sent me aloft for his pleasure this mornin'-noow, I guess I'll take a turn up I here to please myself. I reckon I can recon- 1noitre a little on my own hook. I ain't quite Molh a scaramouch as they take me to be l Love-makin' is all mighty nice for them that's i' to it, but it's cruel aggravatin' to them that isn't. It's worse than a hungry man: lookin tot vittels that ain't his, and- he can't beg nor buy-worse tkhn being poor and   iavin' to handle other folks' money. But all this isn't here nor there. I'm goin' aloft agin, to see if I can't get a squint at calico onee miore." The lieuteinant now provided himself as be- fore with a spy-glass, and going aloft deliber- ately, perched himself again upon the fore- op-gallant cross-trees, and adjusting the glass to a proper focus, began to look in the same direotion to which his attention had been for- esrly directed. ,For several minutes he looked, but no change came over his countenance, to indi-,   'n'., tihat lie saw anvtling ftl-t loore jd Idko - calico. But after he htad been percheld thr v, fifteen or twenty minutes, a broad eriu dis- played itself on the full moon of hIli fact, mani he said:   - "I see 'cm-the two gals is a comin', and I reelton the men is somewhere nigh," Just as hhe said thia, the unmistaknlio annd very startling sound of a bullet, whist.!'i- close by his head, caused Mr. -Doolittle t - drop his spy-glass to the deck, and very nearly to fall himself from the cross-trees. ;ot thuc he was iexactly a coward-for he was not; but it canme so suaddenly nd unexpectedl, th.: i:t  would have scared the best misti fint cvvr smelt powder. As lieo lutched the 'riynl-masnt bnck-staj fi'to - steady hiisoaelt; Mr. Doolittle looked, toward the ahore agamin, and saw a littlepuiff 'of sn,lk  riing from a clump of bushes there.  ;' I wonder who on airth is a sh6o!ta' i,', devilish careless from thoer?r, lie -muttered.- "If its the encmny, and a doin' onw it a' puir- pose, I reckon the cap'n ;nld zoeonld luff will- ' be captivated worser thain they be by the weo- men folks. And if that's the enss, then 1'm caE'n! Whew-if that is so, 1'll eapl ivat,: that 'ere red-headed gal, and nicake Ima-imony the price of her freedom - then I'll suil ;for hum, draw may share of prize-money, alnd stock a farin."  If Mr. Doolittle had any more plans fricsb. grown or growing in his brain-field to reveal, he had no longer time or place for their reve- lation up there; for another bullet canme -t very close to his hlead, thal t he ldodged ilt wind, and bumped his- head severel y ;agauii; the top-gallant mast in so, doing, while lie put his hand -up to feel if he hadn't beeon-hit by the lead as well as received a bump from the spar. "By mighty, this won't dol  The roost is a. little too conspicous; and if a folloerwas to fall from here, 'twould be worse than the fall of Adam ' he muttered. Andil with consiend- able alacrity, he evacuated his post by catch- ing hold of the back-stays, and sliding down to the deck, hand under'hand, as peedily uas possible. "Men, you'd better take diver P" snai lie to the cret-. - The enemry's sharp-shooters are a pepperin' at us from the mounting sup there." "1 I guess they won't do us much harm, sir!" said -an old tar, who had seen Mr. Morley take the rifle into the boat, and who was alnost aa s smart as a cross-eyed man, able at any rate ts look two ways for Sunday. "Well, do jest as you like-if you git pep- pered, it'll be no fault of mine. I'm , a gciu' into the cabin to look at the chart,-anA sle which is the aighest way to git hum!" And Mr. Doolittle dodged into the cabin Mi a hurry, glancing tp at the cliffi beforo hin went in, as if-He expected to receive a full vol-. ley from them every moment..  &#xD;<pb n="112-113 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6983-00000057"/> Perhaps it is as well that we should take a look on shore to ascertain the source of Mr. Doolittle's alarm. To do it decently, we will open another chapter. CHAPTER XC. After Seawaif and Morley had got on shore, and passed the guard, while by narrow path they were ascending the rocky heights, the voulnger offieer asked the captain why he had brought the heavy rifle on shore which he was now carrying. "To test its range, and cure a bad attack of curiosity in our first lieutenant, who, of late has been getting rather troublesome in more ways than one!" replied Seawaif, "I shall have to dispense with his services when we got into an American port again, if the fortune of war doesn't remove him 'providentially' before that time!" i I do not understand how you are to cure his curioisty with the rifle!" said Morley, with a puzzled look. "I will show yon after we get to the top of the cliff, and near the spot where we expect to meet the ladies! You saw that Doolittle made no complaint about being left at the nmst-head by me for two hours or more this morning?' "I did, sir, and observed with surprise that he seemed rather pleased than otherwise." ' Yes, he said he had been taking observa- tions.' And though I left him with duty to do on deck, he is aloft now with a spy-glass in his hand, ready to do so again." And halting behind a clumpl of bushes, from which they Ihd a plain view of the mast- heads of the schooner, the captain pointed to Doolittle, who had just fixed himself at the cross-trees, and was leveling his gtlss toward the shore. "Do you think he was looking at us when we met the ladies this morning?" I know he was. His triumphant look and significant language told me so,when we went on board. But I said nothing then; for I made up my mind to teach him a lesson this after- noon, and I brought my rifle ashore to do it "Surely you will not shoot the poor devil?" faid Morley, as the captain commenced load- ing his rifle with the care which it required. "No; but I'll scare him so badly that hell never goto that mast head again while e are in this port!" said Seawaif, aughing. The two ladies came in sight just at this moment, nnd by direction of the captain, Mor- ley hastened toward them to prevent their be- ing alarmed when he fired; and then, taking aim so as to send a bal so elosely to Doolittle as lie cotld without hitting him, diseharged It is unneoessanr to describe the effect again, for we have seen it. ImmneUitely after the retreat of the lieuten-   ant to the cabin, Seawaif joined the ladicn, and found them laughing heartily at the mant- ner in which he had dismounted the hero of the cross-trees. Of course, after a few words of generil courtesy, each couple found the seaward view more interesting from different ,stand-pointe.  But they remained within hailing-distance, int D case of alarm. And alarm came. Not a half-hour had passed in that " sweet converse" upon whicel we would never be so ungentlenmanly as to in- trude, when Jennie Rollison wan soee hn mrryirn toward them, with such evident signs of agit.- tion, that they hastened to meet her. "Oh, dear Miss Lizzie, good Mr. Captain!" she cried, breathlessly, we are all ruined-al t undone 1" "Why, what is the matter?" asked the 1i- dies, in a breath. "Sir Peter Parker has just come in a coach from some port where he has landed, and his first inquiry was for Miss Lizzie ; and when he heard she were out walking, he sent servants in evey direction to find her. I hurried on as rapidly as I could, for fear some one else would come this way and see the vessel!" Doing ver right!" said Seawaif, who dlid not seem in the least agitated. "Ladies, vou had better return to the castle, without yon feel ready to accept our protection forever, and to embark with us for a port where we ean be united by those sacred ties which no man can sever." "We will go to the castle," said Lizzie, ' bult are we not to see you again?" "Yes, surely-we will not sail without an i nterview." But your safety must not be compromised. That is the most important of al things; for, were you cnptured, alas I for us, poor girls." "We will be careful about that. Jennie shall manage our meetings as hitherto. I would trust the destiny of a nation in hier hands!" said Seawaif. ", She plots admirably, and executes surely and safely." "Yon have almost as good an opinion of her as she has of yon!" said Lizzle. " By the way," sh added, Inaghing, I have pro- mised her that she should have a kiss fromn you-she says she would like to be kissed once by 'a real gentleman,' and as this may be a last opportunity, the deed had better he done!' "Not now, Miss Lizzie r' erieJI Jennie, as she saw how willing Seawaif seemed to per- form the required duty. "Not now; I fear that some of the servants will find us-and- and I had rather let him kiss me some other time, when you're not looking on.." This last remark \wis made so arehlv, that not one of the party could refrain from laugh- ing; btt, as the danger of discovery was really imminent, a few parting words were baetily uttered, a promise to meet soon on  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6983-00000058"/> both parts given, and then the parties separ- ated--the ladies hurrying toward the castle, the officers slowly and reluctantly going the other way. CHAPTER XCI. The moment that Captain Seawaif reached his guard at the landing, lie directed Morley himself to take charge of it, and to advance posts up the hill to such points as commanded a view of the vessel, with orders to seize and detain any one who came to those points, ex- cepting only a known messenger?rom Miss Egerton; and to give the alarm if a force ap- proached by land, or from that lofty look-out, was seen at sea. This done, lie went on board. he was met at the gangway by Mr. Doolittle, who, on be- ing told that he was coining, had ventured out of the cabin. "Hiave you seen 'em, captain?" was the first expression mande by Mr. Dool;ttle, as he touched his cap to Ins commander. "Seen wcho, sir?" asked Seawaif, calmly. "Why, the ininmy, sir? They've been a firmn' at us!" "Firing at this vessel, air? You arc crazy, an you not? I have been but a short dis- tance from the vese.: l, and should1 have heard the noise of any' attack Inadle on her." "Maybe 'twasn't a special atttkw on the vecs- sel, sir-hut I was up in the cross-trees, and two bullets cnitc nihiii clu;-hi to my head to make men wink. My ears ring with'their un- airthly whistle yet." "What were' you doing aloft, sir? I left you to perforim duty below, and to oversee the work on the bowlsprit!" "I know it, sir!" ailid Doolittle, confused and at a hlos how to answer. "I know it, sir -but-but---darn it.! 'I nay as well tell the truth fi:st as last, for it will comue out some- how. I went lip there to see how you and Mr. Morley got along with the gals that I see come there to nimeet you this morniin'. If I can't do no court in' myself, I don't see as it's a hangin' matter if I Ihsappen to look oin at a distance, so long ais I can't hear notlhin', and don't say nothin' to nobody." "If not a hanging umatter, it came cery near to be. a shoiotring matter to you, it seenis i" said Seawaif, who could hardly repress a smile. "* In fuiture you will do well to restrain your curios:ty. and to remain at such duty as'you are placed at." "Yes, sir-but, cap'n, have you an idea who did that shootin'?" "Yes-I surpecet that it was myself. I was firing at n target with my rifle on shore, and probably some of the ;balls canme off this way!" said Seawaif, quietly, as he went into the ncabin. "Well, darn mny buttons, if that wasn't sool I I'll bet. a ginger-cke agin a bottle of spruoo beer that he? mcant to hit me! If I   was ashore, I'd 'swear my life' on hi-; as eure as I live!" muttered Mr. Doulittle, as he went forward to his duty.  CHAPTER XCII. When Sir Peter Parker arrived it the eas- tie, though he knew that his visit was unex- pected, he wats somewhat surprised, and not a little put out of temper, to til no one! to re- ceive him but a few of the domestics who wero lounging round. "Where is Mr. Wood?" lie asked of the first servant, who appeared after his coach stopped before the main gate of the carstle. "Sick in his room, Sir Peter!" said the man, deferentially. "And my niece, Miss Egerton-where is she?" *"Gone oqt to wall with Miss Dorset," was the reply. "S'e here? Then where is Sir   Ium- phrey?" "Somewhere in the castle, Sir Peter!" "Then go and find Miss Egerton instantly, and let her know that I have arrived." "I will go to find her, Sir Peter. I know the direction which she usually takes when ,he walks for exetrcise," cried Jennie Rollison, who had seen his arrival, and heard his questions.' "Who are you, my pretty mail?" lie asked. "Your buitler's daughter, si'," she etLid. "You will find Sir humphrey Dlorset aaleen. on a sofa ill the sitting-i'oom, i i' letcr," HoI added, as she hurried away to find her young mistress, before any other servant should en- danger her secret. The naval baronet looked at her a moment. made some sailor-like remnark to himself about her beauty, and then entered the castle,. "Hallo! Ship-mate ahoy!" lie cried, as he saw the corpulent form  of Sir lJInniphrcv stretched out on a sofa, in the prineip I sit- ting-room. "Starboard watch on deck! Rouseo out-rouse out!" And lie accompanied his words with a hearty slap upon Sir Ilumphrey's shoulder, which aroused the old gentleman so suddenly, that, in trying to spring up, he rolled off the sofa to the floor, falling face down. But his rotunditv and elasticity, much like that of an I ndia-ruD- ber ball, prevented all damage ;-- an aided by Sir Peter, who laughed more thal hlalf his strength away, he soon got to his feet. "Why, bless  my soul, Sir Piter, is thia you? Why, really, I'm glad to see you-glad indeed. When did you reach England?" "Four days ago I anchored in the mouth of the Thames I I posted down here as foon as I could, for I felt tired of salt-water and hard usage, and thought I'd rest a bilt. But what makes you so sleepy at this hour-you never used to sleep before dinner'?" "To speak truly, Sir Peter, your agent, Si- mon Wood--a capital fellow he is., by the way -made some of the bleassedst best nid- dcuo.   edest strong punch out of a dozen or more different kind of liquors last night, and we both got ' a little -over the bay,' as you used to say, on it. He is down sick to-day, and I've hardly been able to. keep my eyes open a. minute all day!" "What, Sir Humphrey, did you, a baronet, condescend to get drunk with one of my serv- ants? 'm astonished - really astonished, sir!" cried Sir Peter. "I cou dn't help it, Sir Peter-I couldn't help it; I was so lonesome, and hadn't a soul to drink with but him, and he is born genteelly, I'm sure'-lis vetry actions and'language prove that! What could I do---who could I drink with?" "You should have rigged a dummy, and drank with that, before you condescended to indulge with one who is at best no more than my servant!" "Rigged a dummy? I'd like to know what that is, iand how it's done!" "Why, you might have put vour hat in a chair opposite to you, and christened it Peter Parker, or my Lord Sunderland, or somebody else, and imagincd it to be somebody. You could have drank to it and with it, doing dou- ble duty by drinkfing its share as well as your own!" "Well-well! That, is a new idea, Sir Pe- ter-a new idea, indeed! But I like it! I'll put it in practice upon the very first oppor- tunity. Buit now that you are here, during the short time that I shamll yet enjoy your htos- pitality, I hope 1 shan't have to drink alone!" "The 'short time' you're goii'g to stay?. Why, yon don't mean to threaten to lieave up vour anchort just because I've come into port? ihaft would be a pretty how-d'ye-do!"  ' I have been herl ia long ti'me, Sir Peter- a much longer time than I should'have been, had I not been over-persuaded by Miss Lizzie not to tear ony ' blossom' away from her. The two girls seem to be inseparables-I can't get 'era apart!" "No; nor you needn't try for a while! You're in a good harbor, and you may as well lie at ease--at any rate till the Admiraltmy sets me afloat again! I suppose they'll do that be- fore long,' for the French are going to help the infernal Yankees, and we shall have'to work and drub them again I The Yankees, too, are getting bold with repeated successes--that same devil which fooled you in Bermuda, es- caped me in Matanzas Bay, after killing nearly two hundred men, and wNho has taken more prizes that we know of since the war began than any dozen of our own men-o'-war, has Iwhen along the coast of England cutting up his didoes-I've heard from him from, a dozen different sources.: If the rascal were only in our service, he'd be an admiral before he had a gray hair in his whiskers! But excuse me a little while, Sir Hurnphrey--I'll go and look at my agent, and then return,"   "Don't rate hm on account of hie drinking bout last night; don't for my sake, Sir P'eter," said the good-hearted baronet. "For ycur sake, I will not!" said Sir Peter, as he left the room. CHAPTER   XCIT.  The commodore met Simon Wood,.dlressed, and apparently in the very best of health, at tlhe door of his apiartmcnt, coming out, toward him. How is this, sir?" said the former, sternly. "I was told that yon we're sick in bed, from the effect of a drtunken debauch!" "I was not sick, Sir Peter; but nmerely acting so, for very good reasons, which I will explain to you, and I am sure to your satifaittion, if you will come into my rooin!" ' Well, sir, explain, I amn ready to bear yot!" said the commodore, as soon as he had 'taken a seat in Wooil's room. "There hats been som6thing very imy0s rious going on of late, Sir Peter, wit' which, I re- gret to say, your niece, Miss Egerton, as well as Miss Doiset, lias beeni connectedl in so0ni way-how, or how far, I have as vet been- unable to learn; but my illness, or rather the pretence of it, was part of a plan whic-h I had laid to find out. - My debaueh. as you were just pleased to term it, with Sir ]humphrey, in which 'he did all the drinking, while I only pre- tended to do so, was also a part of my plan!" "Whan is the mystery? bear  hiatnid, and tell me ; I'm in no fnmmor for long yarns with- out they mean somiellhingi " Well, sir, night before last,' there was a schooner off this port--" "-A schooner, a schoanrcr, did you say?" cried the commodore, vehcmcntly, itnterruptiug tlhe agent.  "Yes, sir--she came in sight before dark, and ran in near the harbor, where she fired two guns i" -"Did you see her? wwns sIte a large two-top- sail schooner, black in hull, with rak'ing spara '" "I only saw her at a great distance, sir i" "Well, wellt go on with your story, mid tell it your own way!" "I had overheard accidentally some conver- sation dropped by the younig ladies; about some one on board of a schiooner, and there- fore kept a little watch. ' But they maniged to evade my look-out, and nat it messenger off to the vessel with letters; and I am told by one whom I can trust, that, the vessel isexD;ected here again in one month front last night!" "You have no idea of what nation the schQoner was?" "- ' Yes, sir; the person frome whom I bought the information, that a messenger had carried letters froni the young ladies to their lovers on. board the schooner, said, that those lovers were officers in the royal navy, and of courao the schooner must be English!" English be hanged I She was a Yankeo  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6983-00000059"/> rivateer! I'll wager my commission on it! who was the person from whom you got your information?" "Jennie Robinson, the butler's daughter!" "The jade lhas deceived you in one thing, at least! Who was the messenger, who went off?" "Her lover, one John Diver-a fisherman belonging to the port, and living with Hannock, one of your tenants 1" "He must be secured, and brought secretly to this room to-night. I can frighten the truth out of him. If I can't, I'll hang him for trea- son, without judge or jury I That jade, Jennie, has been too smart for you ; but if she gets to windward of me, I'll eat her old shoes! Leave matters to me now, entirely. Keep up your ruse of being sick, and I can spend more time with you, examining your accounts. Let no hint of my knowledge of the matter escape you. Remain on the same terms with Jennie as before, and not many hours will elaps0 be- fore I am at the bottom of this mystery!" "Is Sir Humphrey and his dauighter going to remain here, sir?" "Yes, without I find that both have been connected with this treasonable correspondence with an enemy!" replied the commodore. "But retire to your bed again, sir, and obey my instructions. I do not think any of the servants have seen you up. I will go to niert my niece and her co-conspirator, and see if I cannot play the dissembler as well as they can!" CHAPTER XCIV. "Why. my dear uncle, how glad I am to see you!" said Lizzie Egerton, as she met her I uncle returning to the sitting-room. " Your i returti, tough, unexpectcd, will bhe the more delightful. Poor Sir Ilumphrey has been dy- t ing tor company "   " "  Yes, Sir l'er, lihe will be delighted to se6 f: ou!" said Venona, who had taken one of his hands while Lizzie held the other.    I "I have already seen him, young ladies," h said the commodore, in a very easy and plca- b sant manner. "But how does the time pass h with you?"                d "iOh., very agreeably, sir!" said Lizzie. " In t the castle we read, and sing, and draw, and ii tease dear Sir Humphrey--outside, we walk, sometimes enjoy the chase, and always see w something new  in the wild and romantic I saenery 1" "Yes, I suppose so! Like the old castle S8 almost as well as Bermuda; but do not find tt quite so agreeable company as you found there w upon one occasion!" "Ah, uncle, you banter us!  You know I that here we are as secluded as hermits, al- h most i" "  Yes; and it is well that such treasonabl ne disaped young ladies should be! You needn t Muab so-I know all your secrets 1'   ! Lizzie and VenoLa were terribly startled for r an instant, for they feared that the commo- dore knew of the vicinity of the schooner and their lovers. But a moment's consideration brought back the color which had fled from their cheeks, for reason told them that lie could not be so calm with that knowledge in his breast.  Lizzie told him, with a smile, that he was welcome to any of her secrets. Sir Humphrey at that moment approached fortunately, to give a turn to the conversation, which was becoming embarrassing to the poor girls. "How did you find your agent, Sir Peter?" he asked. "eRather under the weather-rather down in the mouth 1 You used him hardly, my good friend-you were-too much for him." "He hadn't ballast enough below, as you sailors say, to stand up under a press of li- quor!" said Sir humphrey. "Buthe'll soon come round-a little of the stauff that made him sick will set him on his feet again i" "His head will the sooner become clear enough to render me his accounts, as he will have to do, by letting it alone!" said the comn- modore. "Well, it may; but, for my part, I must say, that the poison has to work its own cure with nie. I must visit your side-board, Sir Peter. before I can get fairly woke up 1" "Well, heave ahead, my hearty! I'll stand in alongside of you, and freshen the niD, my- self. It is about time that yo  young lndies were dressing for dinner. If it isn't ready sOOhu, I'll have the cook at the gangway; for I'm as hungry as a Fejee Islander after man- meat!" t"Do you think your uncle suspccts any- thing?" asked Venona of Lizzie, as Sir Pe- ter went with the other baronet to the r  o freshbnent room. "ho-I think not! From his first remark I did, and was terribly frightened ; but I know his terrible temper too well to think lie could be aware of the near presence of those whom wo have just left, and keep so cool as he is. I don't believe Wood has told even what Jennie told him; if lie has, why unle is" just as much in the dark as that villain himself!" "Yes, if he believes her story! But lihe will not be so easily blinded as Master Si- mon!" ( Well, things must take their own way! Seawaif is on his guard, and can go to sea at the first sign of danger. If it were not that I, who am  the rightful owner of so niuch pro- perty, did not wish to go to him empty-handed, I would go with him as his bi'ide without an hour's delay. For he is al that my heart ever pictured that is manly, true-hearted, good, ge- nerous, and noble!" "  Each quality you name is also inherent in Morley'a nature; and did I not fear it would   break my poor, fond father's heart to lose me, I would not hesitate to become Eugene's wife, did I not own a farthing in the world!" said Venona. "Alas! I have no father, nor yet a mother, to claim my love or make me hesitate I Both died when I was too young to appreciate them -mother, before my mind had strength enough for memory to take root in it. I remember my father-a sad, stern man-who, they say, ever grieved for the loss of his first wife and babe, and in the second found but little joy to take away the memory of the loved and lost ones; but even of him my memory is dim and- vague!" "Do you not think your uncle would feel your loss?" "No--not in his heart. He has been heart- hardened in the service ; but he would feel his pride shaken if H tore myself away from the authority of his guardianship. But, coz, it is time, as he said, that we were dressing for din- ner!" "Yes-I will go with you in one moment. How will we manage to see them without arous- ing the suspicions of your uncle?"' "I don't know, Our good Jennie must manage that. She is a perfect jewel, isn't she?" "Yes; as well, versed in the art of intrigue, I should think, as if she had been brought up in attendance in a court, instead of being a simple butler's daughter, in a gloomy old pile like this!" And thus conversing, the young ladies left the apartment, to proceed to their dressing- room. CHAPTER XCV. Sir Peter Parker, to veil even a suspicion upon the part of the girls that he knew any- thing about their acts, or of a schooner having been off the coast, had been unusually pleas- ant and conversative with them, and after they had left the table, he sat a long time, seeming to'drink moret han usually free, to the intense delight of Sir Humphrey, who was now per- fectly happy. Bumper after bumper of gen- erous wine rolled down the well-worn channel of his throat-he volunteered toast after toast, and drank. again and again to the health of both of the " blossoms."   I At last, much to the relief of Sir Peter, who had been  throwing off," the old baronet gave in, having all aboard which he could carry to bed with him-and then the commo- dore found himself free for action. Going to the room which had been prepared for his sleeping-chamber, he dismissed his servants, with orders not to disturb him-; and then, watching a ehance to slip, unobserved, into the wing, where Simon Wood lay, did so. This was easily effected, as it was now night. Closeted with that precious villain, he was soon enabled to perfect his scheme for carrying out his intention of probing the "mystery"   which Simon could not unravel, to the very bottom. One after another, some half-dozen of the most sure and trusty men attached to the ciastle were called in, without any notice being given to attract outside attention; and when, they were assembled, their orders were given, and they were so implicitly obeyed, that at the hour of midnight, John Diver, who had been decoyed from the village by a pretended messenger from Jennie, found himself bound and gagged, in the presence of Sir Peter Parker. Simon Wood was also in the room, besides several attendants who were ready to do the bidding of their master, Sir Peter, whatever it might be; and John Diver would have gladly found himself anywhere else, just at that time I "Well, traitor I what have you to, say for yourself? Why should I not hang you up like a vile, treacherous dog as you are?" said Sir Peter, after the gag was removed, with a 'look habitually so stern and fierce, that Johni brave as he was, quailed under it. f"Speak I for you have not five hours to live!-I mean to hang you up for an example!" "What have I done, Sir Peter, to deserve death?" said John, while his face paled, and his lip quivered. "Insolent! How dare you to ask me such a question? Down on'your knees, and confess all, or I'll have you flogged half to death be- fore I hang you  '.Begging your pardon, Sir Peter, if I am to die, there is but One whom I will kneel to on,  earth, and that is He who will at His judgment- 'seat hold us all accountable for our actions here, and the motives which influenced them, and who will judge even judges!" "I want no preaching here I I look in vain for contrition upon your part, and equally-in vain may you look for mercy on mine. Both you an  Jeninie Rollison, your accomplice in treason, shall pay the penalty with your lives!" "1 Sir Peter," said Diver, gathering courage the 'more desperate his case seemed, "I beg that you will spare that poor young girl. She is innocent of all -crime, except that of loving her young mistress but too well, and obeying her but too blindly. For myself, I ask neither mercy nor favor; but for her youth's sake- for her old father's sake, spare her!" , "It is useless, to plead for her-by her own confession she is guilty. And you seem to care much more for her life than she did for ours, when, to preserve herself, she did not hesitate to reveal all your treason!" A look of anguish passed over the face- of the unhappy fisherman. Then an expression of incredulity followed. -"I cannot believe that she was so base!" he said. "So cruel as to betray one who would willingly die for her 1' A cold and mocking smile rested on the countenance of the commodore, as he'replied: "She is far more anxious for life, thien, than you are! Perhaps Captain Seawaif did not pay her so high as he did you!"'  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6983-00000060"/> "Yes, he did-he gave us each the same," said Diver, thrown off his guard by the appa- rent knowledlge which Sir Peter ex'hibited. "Well, it matters not-you both received the price of treason from him, and now you shall receive its reward from me .' "Sir Peter, we are not so guilty as you think, perhaps. As I yet live, and fear not to die, upon my only hope of heaven, I swear th it neithefr I nor she dreamed that the schoon- er wa. an American, until after I had run her into Lraef let Cove atnd anchored her!" - "Al! she is there, is she?" almost shouted the comnnodore, for lie could not control his rnad joy at the thought of having such a prize aa she womld be, in a trap. John Di er groaned in bitter agony, for now he saw that he had been entrapped into a con- fision ; and that not until he told of it, was the commiodore aware of the vicinity of the schooner. "Th will do for the present, Mr. John Di- ver!" :i 1Sir Peter, exultingly. "This will do for the present. You have piloted the schooner into a splendid harbor, where I shall not disturb her for the present, at any ratc. But it is very doubtful if she ever goes out of it under the'Aimerican flag. I can understand now why my niece and Dorset's " blossom" were out ir i!linirZ when I arrived. They may want to walk still more! I shall not hinder themn at present; but before long, their walks shall be circumscribed most effectually!" "  At least, Sir Peter, do not let them and Jennic Uelicve I have willingly or knowingly betrayed them!" said John Diver, in agony. t It is enough that I meet the fate which that  which you call my treason will bring upon me, without having to think that they will look upon mne as a kind of seconil Judas!" Gag him again, and convey him to the most secure dungeon in the castle!" said Sir i Peter. Simon Wood, see to it yourself--then return with thesec men I Messengers must se- I cretly be dispatched to London and to my ship in the Thames with all speed. These reb- c els have in ruded upon oult hospitality secretly, i but they shall enjoy it publicly." It was after midnight when poor John Di- ver was hurried down into a dungeon, there heavily ironed and secured by a chain to the I wall, and then left to the solitude of his own t misery. CHAPTER   XCVI. While S'mon Wood and his men were ab- a sent, takiig care of Jolin Diver, Sir Peter had i hurriedly written three dispatches; and when they came back, he selected three of the most if intelligent men, and the most trusty there. Bidding Wood get a full purse of gold for t each, with which to defray their expenses, he s handed one a dispatch, and said : "Thi is for the KaNG-it must be given to him in prison. Take the beat horse in the F stable, and ride him at his utmost speed until a   he gives out. Then hire or buy another, but do not draw rein or pause until you are ia London!" 1  To the second, he said: a  "Take that piper to the Lord of the Ad miralty. Do you as I have told the man who goes to the king, ,!" To the third he handed the dispatch,; bid ding him ride with the saneu speed to the' mouith of the Thanvs. nd not to pause Iui1l1 the paper was in the hands of the command- ing oiiceer of the Bristoul. ' These orders given, he dismisaed all the imen but his couriers, giving them th6strieleiat orders in regard to seercry, and then rweat with the former himse f to the stables to see theni mounted, and to pass them thrungh the gate, uniknown even to the portct--for there was no very btrict watch or ward kept tLher then. After his mcesessnca were off, thie cominodore hroathied more frecelv, and returned with a light step and rap)illy to the room of Simon Wood. "Well!" eaid lie, as he took his scat 'there. "ThHe audacity of this ribel, Seawaif, exceeds anything that I ever hward or dreamed of in my life. Not satisfied with pa-sing his vescel off as a British war-schooner, and in a British uniform winning the love of my niece andl war(d at Bermuda, but lie must come here, right under the walls of my castle, to carry on his suit. But his race 'is run, if we can only prevent his taking the alarm within the next four days. In that time or in less, his retreat shall be cut off; and then I'll end his ambitious and daring career. If he does not fall in a vain and useless resistance, he shall dance at the end of a rope, as sure as my name , is Peter Parker. He has too long been ;' tli terror of the coast," and too often escaped by skill or bravery fron our cruisers. Give me but four days delay, and he shall not escape again." "To insure his remaining here until your assistance comes, it will be best to have no watch whatever kept on the young ladica. Will it not, Sir Peter?" suggested Wood. "'eIt is my intention that none shall be kept " replied the commodore.   "They may have ' fulF swing at their cables,' for the little time that is left to them." "  Had not you as well as myself, Sir Peter, better pretend to be a little unwell, or at least so fatigued with your rapid journey, that you are unable to leave the castle or join the ladies in their exercise?" "  It hardly seems to me that such trouble is necessary," replied the commodore. "' Miss Lizzie is keen as a thorn. sir!" said the agent. "And that Jennie is about the smartest girl that ever danced a jig!" "I shall lock her up." "I fear that would ruin all your plans, Sir Peter. Were the young ladies to lose tkeif agent and go-between, their plans would all be   disarranged; and I feel sure that they would take the alarm." i"So they might-so they might i" said the contmodore. "I don't kn-ow but that your plan is the best after all. 'I can 'the more easily conceal my feelings by keeping within doors, until I have tIe rebels in my net." "1 ani sure you can, sir i" said Wood, whIo, in designing as well as executing villainy, was a perfect adept-a master of the art. "Well, it shall be done; and you will remain in your room, also. I will send for your ac- counts, and busy myself over thldm, and keep Sir Hlumiphrey amused.  Do you think he knows anytniing of this matter?" t"I am' sure lie does not, sir. I tested him fully last night. It was rather a hard matter to gect t anomugh liquor down him to throw him enitirely off his balance-but I sucededed; and I am confident that he knows nothing beyond what I found out--nothing whatever of the vicinity of the schooner." "' Then all is right; and if fortune attends us, I see nothing but plain sailing ahead." The comnmodore now returned unseen to-his room; and with the close of his day, we'll also end the chapter. CHAPTER XCVII. Yea; leve is blind sometimes-blind as an owl in the day-time-blind to all danger, and everything!ut -the one thing which it wor- ships! For one week, lulled into security by the lack of watchfulness, and the supposed illness of Smiron'Wood and Sir Peter Parker, both of nwlom played their parts admirably, both Lizzie and Venona enjoyed their walks and interviews without fear or interruption. They inct on the morning of the eighth day, howcvler, fior the purpose of parting; for Sea- waif hId already stayed longer in port than lie hiad intended , and he begaft to feel that it wIa his duty to be at sea again-a duty de- manded bY Ihis country, and by the patriot owner of tilhe vessel. Moreover, lie felt that, by so long a stay in a port, where some wand- ering fishing craft might discover him, and reporting, soon bring a hostile fleet down upon him, that he was trifling with thie safety of a brave l:,ni devoted crew. Therefore, on the evening previous, he had announced, not only to his officers and crew, that lie should sail'the next day, but had ap- pointed thaft morning as the one which should, for the present at least, terminate the happy interviews which he and Morley had held with those whomn they loved with such tenderness and truth. The hour was early on that day when they met; the sun had not risen when the officers reached tih, trysting-place; but the girls were 1ire ',d thore--both sad and unhappy with the thought of tihe parting which must come. Their'wiords came slowly from their lips; for they werL burdened with grief-and such *weds   travel all the slower that their cause comea eo swift and sure. Suddenly, Lizzie, whose eyes, first swimming in tears, had sought the face of her lover, turned them  way to glance over the sea, wheres his trackless course would lie, and am she did so, a low, wailing eoan of agony broke from her lips. "Oh Heaven! you are lost!" she groaned. "Look there!" A single glance told Seawaif that his chances were more than desperate.  Outside of tihe little cove, hove to and ready withtheir great frowning broadsides to attack him tthe moment lie offered to l-ave the port, lay two line-of- battle-ships and three heavy fi'igates, each un- doubtrclly containing, npart fronm its weight of metal, a crew more than quadruple his own. "We are in a net!" he said, while his face blanched, not with fear for himself, but with the thought that the heretofore brilliant suc- cess which had made his very iinane a terror on that coast, and uponi every sea where le had sailed, must now be darkened by misfor- tune-for it was hioping against hope to think for an instant that lie could escape froim such a blockade. "What will you do?" moaned poor Lizzie, while Venona laid her head uponi the shoulder of Morley, and wept in silence. "Fight-fighlt, while a plank of my good craft sticks to another-fight while life lasts, and die true to y6ao and my native land!" he said, with a calnness which- tihe desperate  thought rendered only the more terrible to her. "Oh it is dreadful!" she wlispered* "Can you not escape inland, and save yourselfT'  ' "Individually I might; but I would die a thousand deatlhs, by ithe nost crnel tortnrea' beforef 1 would purchase life with dishnonor. 3 cannot, will not desert' miy brave crew." At that nmoment, a g un was fireil from one of the ships. ' Onr old friond. the Bristol, speaks to us, Morley!" said Seawaif. 'Yes, sir; I 'recogniz(ed her at the first glance!" replied tihe other. At that instant, a heavy report sounded from the landward side of them. It was a cannon answering the signal from the ship. "We are beset by lanA- as well as sea I' said Seawaif, when lie heard this. "Our case is indeed a desperate die-hbut we must hurry on board, for the crew already show that they are alarmed." Hurried adieux were given and taken; and the young officers hastened from the side of the young Indies-while the Bound of bugles and rolling drums told them of the approach of a force from the direction of the .castle. Chained to the spot by their sympathies and terrors, the poor girls, With hand clasped in inand, in speechless agony1 snnk down upon the gray rocks, and prayed to the God of bat. tle to spare those whom they loved  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6983-00000061"/> In a very few moments after he had left them, Seawaif reached the deck of his vessel. The alarmed crew, who knew from   word brought by a boat which Doolittle had sent to the entrance of the cove, on hearing the gun, what lay outside of them, anxiously looked at face of their beloved leader to know from its expression what he meant to do. They saw but one look there, and as it told them that he meant to resist to the last, a thundering cheer rolling from their lips, told him that he would not stand alone wlile a single one of them survived. "I thank you, men ;" he replied. "We are in a tight phlce-but it is not the first time that we've been in one. We will do our duty, and trust in God for the rest!" And he at once made his preparations for defence, according to d plan which he had al- ready formed. Detailing a part of the crew for that pur- pose, he hastily landed a quantity of arms, ammunition, provisions, and the money and valuables of the vessel upon points of the shore where he could make a final stand, and be so far beneath the shelter of the rocks that he could not be harmed from above. lie knew that he could defend the narrow path- way, which led down the cliffy side of the hill,against a force twenty times his own. "We can at least hold out until they con- snt to our surrender upon honorable terms, if we do lose the schooner!" he said to Mor- ley, a he gave the orders to do this work. He now sent the doctor to a secure place among the rocks to establish his wospital-re- marking, as he did so, that he would probably have plenty of amputating to do now. "And some fight, too, I hope, mon cher capitaine!" said the worthy surgeon, with a gim smile ; and he touched the huge rapier by his side, and pointed to a couple of pistols in his belt, to show that he was ready to do Ahi duty in every way. Springs were now got -upon the cables of the schooner, and her broadsides so laid that they would bear on the entrance, through which they came, and along the other chan- nel, if boats made the attack; and boarding nettings were triced up. Every preparation was made which .could be thought of to de- fend the vessel to the last extremity. And to show what he meant to do in that extremity, Sea waif, with his own hands, prepared a train, which communicated with the magazine. All of the crew that were not actually re- I quired to work the guns on board, were now seat on shore; and though he begged not to ] be sent from the side of his commander, Mor- i ley was ordered to command them. -   I Seawaif, as the young officer went into his boat, had a small Chest brought out of the ca- 1 bin and put into it.-           1 "Take car of that, Eugene!" said he, "and should I fall and you survive, keep it for my 1 ske until it aube placed in er hand   It i   contains the articles which were found with me when Iwas east a helpless babe upon tlfch shore, and a statement of the time and all the facts made by the good old man Zane. There is some money there also, which may be of service to you if you are taken prisoner." Morley wrung his hand, but could not speak a reply. "Go--go, my dear boy, and do your duty ashore, while 1 do mine on board!' said Scal- waif, grasping him warmly by the hand, aud then pointing to the shore. "Nail every flag to the mast-head. They shall never come down while a spar stands or the schooner floats!" cried the young captain. And amid the cheers of his fearless and de- voted crew, it was done.  "We are ready for work!" he said 4 "I wihh they would open the Jball!" Scarcely had he spoken, when, as if they had been brought there by magic, the loft; cliffs and rocky heights above him seemed to be completely covered with soldiers. Hoe knew that he was in reach, though at a long range, of their musketry; but he wias confident that they could not depress any vf their artillery sufficiently to bring it to bear upon him. In a short time, a boat was seen coming in from the fleet outside, and as it bore a white flag, Seawaif sprung into another boat and went to meet it; for he was too old a hand. young as he was, to permit an enemy to see his means or plans of defence under the cowr of a flag, or any other pretence. To his surprise-for he had believed the commodore to be sick in bed-he recognized in one of two officers in the boat, Sir Peter Parker. "Good morning, Captain Seawaif!" said the latter, with stern courtesy, as he raised his cap. "We have met once more." t"Yes, sir 1" replied Seawaif, " and nearer to your home than before. May I know why I am honored so far as to be visited by yon under that emblem of peace, rather than tfhe meteor-flag of war?" and he pointed to the truce-signal. "Yes, sir. Wishing to save the effusion of blood, and to spare the lives of brave men. who must fall if they resist hopelessly, as they will in this case, Icame to ask your un- conditional surrender." "You came upon a useless errand, sir. We will not surrender ; but if we must, sell our lives as dearly as we can!" "Why, air, you are mad! Two full regi- ments are inland to cut off your retreat. should you attempt such madness, and five heavy ships await you outside. If you refuse to surrender, they will warp in until their broadsides are brought to bear, and you will be sunk at your anchors 1" "Very well, sir; if it is so to be, it will be I But we will go down with our colors fly. igl"VT   "I reerct it. Brave men's lives should not be sacriliced in that way!" said the commo- dore, sadly. "If you will surrender, I will treat you all as prisoners of war; and, as for yourself personally, I will strive to gain your relea e from those who are in power." Senwaif shook his head, and replied, calm- "  I thank you, sir, for your courtesy, but I ';have a duty to perform, which must be done i I cannot and will not, on any conditions, strike my flag." "Then Heaven have mercy upon you I for I can do and say no more!" said the baronet, badly; and he gave orders to his boatmen to pull back. CHAPTER XCVII. In about a half hour after the boat contain- ing Sir Peter Parker had retired, the head spiuars of one of the huge seventy-fours could be seen slowly appearing across the entrance of the channel. No sail was set, and she was evidently being warped into position- And almost at the same time, another one of them was seen slowly gliding into position upon the other side of the rock which keyed the. en- trance. "Fire, men, just as soon as your guns bear so that they can do any damage," said Sea- waif. "There is no use in our standing upon ceremony now. Fire low, and try and send yor' shot between \wind and water. We'll try and get the worth of our schooner out of 'em,- at nny rate." "There goes my compliments to 'em!" 'said Mr. Brownell, as he sent a thirty-two-pound shot from his long Tom right into the bows of the ship-'and as she was but a little over pistol shot distance, it went through and through her. "Nobly done!" said Seawaif; "heave in the cold iron; my men-the more smoke we raise about ourselves, the less chance they'll have to take aim at us." With a wild cheer, the crew replied; and as / gun after gun came to bear, the whole little battery of eight guns on a side went into ac-. tion, with a spirit which must have astonished the English, for it was some time before they could answer with the proper courtesies of war. At last they opened, however; "but as now they had only a cloud of smoke to fire at, they shot higher than the mark, overshoot- ing, as they did, in almost every action during the war. Thus, while the spars of the fatedi schooner came tumbling down at almost every broadside, the hull received scarcely any da- mage, and the crew escaped wonderfully on board, except from bruises by the falling spars, or causea of that kind. His guns having been depressed from the start, the fire which Seawaif returned with tireless spirit was -terribly destructive on board of the English ships; and actually   within a half hour from the commencement of the action, the ship which had first opened was completely silenced for a time, either be- cause she was in danger of sinking or else hier guns had deen dismounted. Thinking that the enemy might intend boarding in the smoke, with boats from all their ships; and knowing now that with his schooner entirely dismasted, he could in no way escape, Seawaif ordered his crew to land as rapidly as possible, with their small arms in the boats, which he had caused to be drawn up in safety close under the stern, though he still kept up a steady fire, so as to conceal his movements from the enemy. At last, all of the crew except those who manned a single gun on either side, were on shore; and then, seeing that the train was ready, Seawaif ordered them- into the boats, lighted a slow-match connected with the train, and carrying the colors of his vessel with him, was himself the last to leave her. Having reached the shore, and covered his men as much as possible in their natural forti- fications, he watched the schooner intently- for as the smoke slowly rose from her, lie be- gan to fear that the enemy would take posses- sion before the magazine was fired, and tha'e her yet sound hull and valuable battery would become their prize. For they, on noticing that her fire had ceased, had also stopped fir- -ing, supposing that she had -surrendered, and only waitian for the smoke to rise, so that she could be discovered, and the fact known, in order to send an officer to take char e of her. Slowly the sulphurous vail lifted from over the black hull of the doomed vessel, and Sea- waif began to fear that his match had gone out, or something had happened which had frustrated his design. His -heart quivered with regret as he saw a boat from the Bristol dashing toward the schooner-:but a second later, his bosom was filled with exultation, for with a report which shook the rocky hills from crest to base, the gallant craft was lifted in a thousand fragments from the water. "O Heaven! ze schoonare 'ave make a great deal of noise while she exist, but nevare so much as when she depart!" said, the doctor, who: was busy in attefiding to the wounded men, whom Seawaif had brought on' shore. , Seawaif now run his colors up on a small flag-staff which he had brought on shore, to show the foe that he had not surrendered, nor was yet conquered; and again the cheers of his noble crew went ringing over the waters. "Ah   I bonne hearts-good boys-ze John Bull mens will nevare say zat ze Yankees are cowards from zis day!" cried the delighted La Motte. Firing, as of musketry, was now heard in rattling volleys at the point where Seawaif had barricaded the single path which led 'to the waterside; and he knew that the soldiers  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6983-00000062"/> had entered into the amusements of the day, and meant to make an attack in the rear. But tie young captain had no fear about that point of his position. It was such, that ten men, almost perfectly protected, could de- fend it ;,against a thousand, or all, at least, who could attnack at once; and he had directed Mr. Morley to pll:cc a barrel of gunpowder be- neath the rocks in one place, so that, if the enemy reached that spot, it could be ignited by a train. and not only carry destruction to the foe, but render the approach almost or al- togtlher impassable. As the smoke once more lifted, he could see somtewht of the damage which his heavy fire hal inflicted upon the enemy.  The lower port of the Bristol, or rather the sides of the ship betwecn them, were knocked entirely away for an!most half her length-the lack of guns in them showed that many pieces lhad been dismounted, and the water which poured from her scuppers told that they were hard at work at their pumps to keep her from sink- ing. From the condition of both the English ves- sels, it, was evident that they had lost a great many men. But Seawaif knew that this would only' excite the rest to revenge; and as the otlher three ships had not been in action at all, he migl it expect every moment an attack by nu iaitiis iisvly superior force of fresh men in iutt the fearful odds, and his desperate po- sition, *lii nut cause him for an instant to tqail. Calmly he stationed his men, where they could be best protected from the fire of thC ncmlv; nid as ie had at least two mus- kets to a man, lie ordered both to be loaded, dnJ the second so placed, that it could be in- stantly seized after the first fire; and thus a discharge, at first would be given as deadly o, with a united force from double his num- ber. This done, he and Mr. Doolittle, who had acted n,bly all the day, went from man to man, and spoke words of encouragement, which were received by cheers, while the atewards and cabin-boys followed with buck- ets of grog, from which each man received a Atimulanting draught, to strengthen him for the next struggle. CHAPTER XCIX. At last, slowly, but in an- immense mass, which fifrly covered the water at either en- trance, the boats of the united squadron were seen, filled with seamen and marines. There were not less than sixteen or eighteen hun- dred men gathered there to attack the less than two hundred and fifty of Seawaif. But the latter had every advantage of a formidable po- sition, and with a Spartanic courage, they waited for the onslaught. "Not a shot mustheo fired until I give the order!" cried the young American. "And then   take deliberate aim, and fire low! If vre c!a keep them busy till dark, we may yet get awav { in our boats!" i The enemy approached slowly for a time; ! then, after they sa.:w themselves within range, they gave a loud, wild cheer, and dashoed on to the assault. Behindl their rocky ramparts the Americans recniabed, s still as death-not a sound could be heard there hut the click of their gun-locks, or the rattle of the barrels, as they leveled, thiem at ia rest, upon the rocks, and took a sure nnd deadly aim at the boats whichl came fromr two dirc:tions, but could be met by raking fi'es from two ways also, by Seawaif's men. On-on they came, until they were only ] pistol-shot away; and then, with a voice as clear as a bugle, Scnaif gave the order to fire. A single flash-one fearful, rattling roar along tin-, whlot{ American line, told (as it did at New Orleans, in 1814) a fearful tale among the crowded masses of the enemy. The second guns were seized, and within a half-minute more, another volley, even, more destructive than the first, was poured in. The boats were checked; and though a few scattered shots were fired in return, the terrible confusion among them told, thatnot only many men had been killed, but probably the lending officer&amp;--- for no one seemed to know what to do. Loading and firing at will, and as fast as poesile, tihe Americans kept such an unceas-' ing fire that the enemy was forced to withdraw firom range before another attack could be arrange(d. "All-hal-I sink Messieur John Bull will considare zat ze schoonere is one very grand expense to heem!"  cried the doctor, who had aeized a musket, and done his part with that- instrutnonelt during the attack. Seawaif now began to feel some concern, in consequence of his ammunition being, scaroe-r for so much had not been brought on shore as he had ordered, amid hoe learned with' regret that there were not more than three charges to a man. But be did not- for a moment think of a surrender, while ho had a charge left; and though lie saw that, reinforced by more boats and men, the enemy were about to make another effort to storm his position, he did not fiilter, but issued his orders as be- fore-only ordering his men to be very careful not to throw away a single shot, but to make each one "tell." The enemy again moved on, and all was once more as still as deaith in the American lines by the/water-side, but a rapid fire up the hill-side, by the barricaded pathway, told that Morley wat hotly- engaged. The boats were a bout as near as they had been before, and Se-.wnif had just given the order, "'ready," when, with a tremendous shock, the mine which Morley haid prepared above- for his protection wana sprung, hurling mI-U,- dnd rocks high in the air, and so astonishing   'the men in the boats, that for an instant they involuntarily stopped rowing, and fell into some confusion.     '  Fatal for them, and excellent for Seawaif, was this event; for again his double volley was poured into them with such fearful effect, that -in spite of that daunitless courn'age for which British seamen are famed, and which in too many wars they have exhibited to be sngered at, they again fell back. But it was not, their intentiom to give up the attack. They were seecrfagain fomerming; and now, having scarce a single load a piece for his guns, and having de- fended hiumself as long as lhonor, and longer than duty d&amp;manded, he began to think of smaking an effort to save the lives of the men- who had stood by him so daringly, and with such complete devotion. Although he still kept his own colors flying,- he hastily snatched a white flag-it happened to - be the very one Kate Cringle had em- broidered for him, from anmong some things lie had sent on shore from his cabin, and hoisting it. on a boat-hook, sprung into a boat, and pushing off a little way, waited for a reply from the enemy--though lie doubted whether, under the circumstances, they would notice a flag at, all. For some time they did not seem inclined to - do so, but kept-forming their boats for-another -attack; and Seawaif was about to lower his little flag, and to return-determined to dispute the victory with cold steel to thie last gasp- when a single boat dashed away from the side -of the Bristol, with a " flag" and several officers in it.  Seawaif recognized Sir Peter Parker long before the boat reached hm; and saw, also, that he had an arim in a sling, and, by Iiis pallor, ex- hibited the signs of having received a wound. "Well, sir " he said, severely. "After your mad folly in resisting suchIan oyerwhelming force; you ,begin to see the uselcessness of re- sistance, do you?" . "I have not ceased to resist, nor shall I, without I can be assured of terms which I can accept with honor to myself and justice to my men, who are ready to lie by may side, if I so will themn to!" replied Seawatf. "What are you doing in possession of that coat-of-arms?" cried the commodore, in sur- prise, as lie pointed to the little silken flag. "I have reason to suppose it is the coat-of- arms of the fimaily from which I sprunag, sir; for I have plate and jewelry with the same marks oni them, found with me when I was cast ashore, a babe, from a wreck!" said Seawaif; and a wild thought rushed like an electric shock through his heart and to Iis brain, that he was upon the eve of a discovery which he bad dreamed ot all his life. ':A bIabe from a wrck--O Heaven! it cannot 'e--they arc-the Egerton arms!" gasped the commnodore, seemingi astounded with surprise. "'The Egerton arms?" cried, Seawaif, in   astonishment. "And Sir Humphrey Dorset has so often said in every look that I was an Egcerton!" "In looks you may resemble that' family, sir," said Sir Peter, recovering his self-pos- session, ," but none of that fimnily would r,;ebc  against their king! But we have nq time to discuss such nmatters--that can be, done here- after, if you. will not, by your continued rash- ness, destroy every cha-mce of any heroafter on earths for yourself 1" "That -ill rest with you, Sir Peter! Macke your dentands-if they are comulpatible with my honor, I will accept them; if not, I ama ready to perish sword in hand, with the know- ledge thant your victory will yet be bought with terrible loss, much as you have aircady suffered"            /   -  "I demand your- unconditional s6'1endemi" 1 "I will surrender only upon your promilse' to treat my men and officers as prisonmreskof war. For myself, I vsk nothimg-hnut they must be open for exchange, an'd receive the treatment whiefic brave mnei deserve fat the hand of a generous enemy!" Sir Peter held a low and hurried consulta- tion with his officers. At its conclusion, lie said:  - - "Your terms shall be granted-not beinuse you deserve -them, but -too much blood lias- -been shed to-day, alreadyv! Iwill go on shore with you, and receive your 'flag, which I will do you the justice to say, you, have defended with a desperate zeal, wo'thy! of a better cause. The firing on the hill-stde haind-been sms$- pended during this interview, and it was not renewed again, for tihe combatants could see that some  peaceful arrangement -had beeti made betwee   Seaiwaif and the commo miore. When the Ameriecans learned the terms which Seawoif had gained for them, they ac- quiesced in a surrender ; for they kniew thaet, in . thile end, they wfould have been overwhehlmnced or starved out, even if the Eiglish had not made another attack. The doctor was the maddest of all. "Nevare-nevare shall ze John Bull mcns take my sword!" he cried. And lie tossed it out far into the deep water: and then, with a look of settled gloom, tuirned. to conclude hn oper- ation which he wits perfornming upon a wound- ed man.   ' - CHAPTER C. The* situation and 'feelings of poor, Lizzie Egerton ane Venona Dorset during thiis tei mible conflict, can be better imagined than described. They had at first sunk down in agony find terror where their-lovers hadIleft themr ; thlen hearing the approach of the soldiers, hnd crept close to thire front of the cliff, where, concealed by the bushes and rocks, tley remained on- seen by any of the troops--though -some eaiie ' very near to them--ind from which they could plainly see the schooner while she was being  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6983-00000063"/> prepared for action, and the ships as they were warped in to attack her, And breath- lessly they viewed those preparations; yet even so much as they feared for the safety of those whom they loved, they could not but exult amid their tremblings at the chivalrie daring which did not fear to meet and contend with sueh an overwhelming force. They saw every movement upon both sides, until the clouds of smoke enveloped the vessels, boat., and men, and made the air up where they 'were, almost insufferable for them to breathe. And then they knew an anxiety which it were only possible to imagine, not to describe. After the iving ceased, they felt almost sure that the American schooner must either have been sunk or had surrendered; butas the smoke- aloud slowly rolled up above their heads, they saw that, though deserted, she was still above wfater. Then, while they were looking at the flag which floated above Seawaif and his brave men, down almost beneath their feet, they beard and felt the shock of the explosion, and saw that the brave American had kept his pro- mise, never to yield his vessel to the foe. Then they saw the preparations for the boat- attack, and trembled yet the more; for they could not believe that Seawaif could success- fully resist such an immense force as was gathering to attack him. But they saw its ad- vance, its reception, its confusion and retreat; and like men who, once ii action, lose the fear thw felt at first, the girls, growing less timor- ous,  exulted more and more in the bravery and  coess of the Americans, with whom their everj sympathy was centered. Anr the boats were a second time repulsed, they gan actually to hope that the Ameri- eans U ould triumph in the end; for to them, who knew but litle of war, its arts, exigencies, and chanaee  of failure, the Spartan band seemed to be invulnerable and unconquerable. But when they saw Seawaif go forth with the white flag, their hearts sunk, and they felt that all was over. And when they saw the commodore, whom they recognized, go on shore I after the conference, and saw the flag which had been so bravely defended hauled down, they felt that all was indeed over: and they wept team of bitter grief "They are prisoners now-what will become of them?" moaned Venona. "'Heaven only knows!" sobbed Lizzie. "The nobleness of their defence will only the more s endanger them-our government, so far, has  shown no generosity to her brave enemies-all has been cruelty-bs e, relentless cruely I I know not what will be their fate!" "I can tell you, lady!" said a cold, sneering voice close betind them. It was that of Simon Wood, who had crept elosel to them  while their attention was en- mIe ay th"e  am n  ms . below. M  D   U  yote uyo" sid he,  The nun may   be spared, but the rebel officers will be hanged!" "Not as sp/e, as you ought to be, varlet!" said Lizzie, bitterly. Then turning to Venona, she said : "We have seen enough here, and will now go back to the castle!" "If the ladies will accept my escort, I shall be but too happy!" said the unabashed villain. "There are many rude soldiers about, who may not be over polite 1" "We- require no eScort, and can protect ourselves " said Venona, indignantly. "I am not asleep now!" And they hurried away. leaving Mr. Wood rather confused. "Not asleep now!" he said to himself, in a bitter tone. "No, fair devil, no; nor is my passion asleep! I'll tame your haughty spirit by-and-by. If I can trge Sir Peter to the extremity, your dainty eyes shall see your lover dance the dance of death, with naught beneath his feet, and hemp about his neck I Then I will not wait long to carry out a plan I've formed, and both Simon Wood and Miss Ven- ona Dorset will be missing. Some people will believe that they have eloped together!" CHAPTER CL     With anxious hearts the poor girls-who now, most of all, demand our sympathies, watched to see the prisoners brought to the castle. But though they watched until night gathered, they looked in vain; for they were all conveyed to the Bristol, which was, with the other vessels, warped into the inner part of the cove, there to remain until some re- pairs could be made, when Sir Peter intended to go in her, to deliver his prisoners at London in person. This they learned by a note which he ad- dressed to Sir Humphrey, announcing the capture. Wilh tihey were grieving-over this announcement, they found that they were not alone in sorrow, for poor Jennie Rollison came to them, convulsed min grief, to let them know that her poor John Diver was confined in irons in a dungeon, on a charge of treason, for having piloted the schooner into a harbor. "  Who told you so?" asked Lizzie. "Simon Wood!" sobbed the girl. "And he offered to try to save John--if--if-oh I I cannot tell you, Miss Lizzie, all that he said- I only know that it was so dreadful, that I struck him a fearful blow with a heavy glass decanter that I was cleaning for father; and I don't know but I have killed him. But I did not stop to think of that-my John is in a dungeon, and they will hang him. Oh, do, Miss Lizzie - do Miss Venona, try to save him. Sir Peter will let him go fyou will plead for him." "We wil plead for him, and sake the blame upon ourselves, Jennie; do not grieve so!" said Lizzie.   "Do you think you hurt that vile wretd-h seriously, Jennie?" asked Venona.- "I don't know how bad, miss!" said the girl. "I only know that I struck him on the side of the head very hard with the heavy de-. canter, and that the blood spouted out in a torrent, and he fell down on the floor. If you knew what he said to me, you wouldn't blame me-indeed you wouldn't." "I do not blame you; I only hope you have killed him, for he is too vile to live.'I "I don't care either--for if they hang my poor John, they shall hang me, too. If he dies, I don't want to live." "Oh, dear-oh, dear-oh, dear!" moaned the old butler, as he rushed into the room, under great excitement. "What is the matter, father?" said Jennie, putting her lips close to her father's ear, and speaking loud-for he was quite deaf. "Simon Wood lays in the glass-room as dead as a nail i" cried the old man. "How 'twas ddone I can't tell-nor who did it." "No? It is most likely that he did it him- self!" said Lizzie, giving Jennie a look which cautioned her not to betray herself. "He is but a small loss at any rate, and can very well be spared."    . . "Oh, dear-oh, dear-I must send word to ,Sir Peter about it!" said the old man; and he hobbled out of the room. 4"Say not aword to any one, that you did this deed. There was no witness to it; and few love him well enough to nmake much search into the manner of. his death l" said Lizzie to Jennie. .." He cannot now be a wit- hess against your John; and I do not believe there was any other. His death may save your lover." "Then, indeed, I'm not sorry I struck him so hard," said Jennie, wiping her eyes -with her apron. "He has insulted me before, but -never quite so badly as he did tlii time." - CHAPTER CIi, Sir Peter Parker was in his private cabin alone with Edward Seawaif. It was the night which followed the day of the battle in which the Tyrannicide had been lost forever. Upon the face of the commodore there: was an ex- pression of wonder mixed with sorrow. Before him on a table lay several articles of costly female apparel--several garments, such as belonged to-an infant, and a quantity of val- uable jewelry. Upon almost every article, the ooronet and crest which he had seen upon the flag of truce, was visible. The articles- were those, which had been saved when Ed- ward Seawaif was found on the shore of the Nantucket Isle, by the old hermit Zane; and in his hand Sir Peter held a carefully-written account- of the .date when the chest came ashore. and every other particular about its plititjrvljjtioB   He had alsa heard from Seawaif's lips"all that he knew of the matter. The baronet was sorely- troubled. "In my mind," /said he, " there is no doubt 'that you are the child which was christened i Francis Egerton, the only son of Lord Ethel- i bert Egertoii,; and if so, and not attainted of treason, you would now be heir to the earldomu and estates. in that year, Lady EIgerton sailed with her only child, to join' her ,husband, who held a high official station in/Canada. The vessel in which she sailed was never- heard of, after she had parted from a consort in a severe storm near the American coast, and then the was in a sinking condition. If, as some chil- dren have, you had any strange birth-marks upon you, such as nurses always look for, and are apt- to remember, you may be fully identi- fied; for the nurse who attended at the birth of that babe, is yet living in the catle-for she had a dread of the sea, which prevented Lady Egerton from ttaking her on that voy- age" "If it is so," said Seawaif, sadly, ' Miss Lizzie Egerton is my sister?" "Your half-sister 1" replied Sir Peter. "The earl married again; after living a widower such time as left him fully convinced that -his first wife and child had been lost'. But lie always grieved after them; and both his second wife and himself died soon after Lizzie was born. I have been hei guardian, and so far as I could be, a father to her. But about this identity-have,/you any strange marks about your person?" "Y es, sir-one so singular, that a nurse would hardly overlook or forget it--I have six toes, instead of the usual five, on each foot!" "Wonderful! Lord Egerton had the ame. and I now distinctly remember, that it was said his child was born with the same mark. Without a doubt in my mind, you are Francis, Lord Egerton. Oh, had you not been engaged in this rebellion, how bright would be your prospects nowL  The imimense estates, the -title, and the position, second to none in the realm, at your age, and with your courage and gifts, would have made you the envy of the world." -. "Sir Peter, enviable as that position seems to you, I would rather be simply Edward Sea- waif, a rebel, as you term, me, and free this night, ready still to resist the power of tyranny than to hofd it. My feelings and sympathies are all with America--I have known no other native land, though now it seems that I was orn here." "I do not know that I can blame you. But this war will ntIsist i -ton: America will be free, and peace will be declared. Some of our strongest minds in this nation are against the war. The king will yet have to yield to po- pular feeling; for day aftfer day the wair growA a more and muore mulnpopaiu.- It. aweerr amre  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6983-00000064"/> few-its exnenses draw -heavily upon En.-' land, both for men and money. There..will be pence before long; but, alas! I feiar that you will not live to see it. I fear that the king will insist upon making an example of you, without yon will now, as an English earl, side with us, and throw your strong arm and mind upon our side." "Not to save a thousand lives would I do that, Sir-Peter. I have but one favor to ask. That is, that you gently break to Miss Eger- ton the discovery which you lhave made; and when she can bear an interview with me, per- mit it to take place." "It shall be cs you wish!" replied Sir Pete;. "My only regret is, that I cannot re- lease you. But I will use every effort to save you ; and the king would be more than un- grateful if he would not listen to the prayers of one who has served him so long and faith- fully as I have! I will go on shore, and see Lizzie myself, though I did not intend to, for I was very angry with her." CHAPTER CIIL Nearly one eighth of Salem lay in smoking ruins. A disastrous fire had broken out in the night, and swept away many houses and stores, casting their occupants roofless on the world. Of all who suffered by this great dis- aster, Phineas Cringle was the greatest loser. An entire range of houses and stores, many of them filled with the cargoes of prizes taken by the schooner, were swept away. Barely escaping with their lives, he and his daughter and servants found temporary shel- ter under the roof of a friend near the house of Moses Gelson. The latter had not been in- jured by the fire in the slightest degree-his prolerty was out of its range. Mr. Cringle, upually so light-hearted, was dreadfully depressed on the day after the tire. But Kate, who, with a singular and steady hopefulness, had been gradually but surely improvitng in health and beauty, ever since the time of her illness. did not "even allow a shaldow to cross her brow, but strove, with all of a daughter's love and gentleness, to cheer up his sinking heart, "It is ever the darkest just before the dawn of day, dear father!" she said. "Be hopeful and trusting, for though you have lost the ac- cumulation of years, yet you lhave life and henlth. Who knuow what pIrizes are even now being sent in by Edward." "It's all very well to talk comfort, et-cet-e- ra-all very well to make a speech about, and to smooth one's face on, et-c-t-ra-but 'tis a different thing to feel it!" said the old mer- ehant. "There's no knowing where the schooner is. She may he as well off as my houses are-nearer heaven than earth, et-eet-e- ra-she may be takcn-bad luck never comes aloIne-it'- like!,bd neighbors-they' come- in squad;i when they do come, ct-cet-Tra 1" I*   "There is the southern post-man com ing. this way, father-he bears a letter in his handl for you. Now you will see that I foretold fair weather ahead not mistakenly." "* We'll see--we'll see, e-et-e-ra," said the merchant, nervously extending his hand for- the letter, which the post-man had signified by a sign was for him, while he was still dsomer distance away. The merchant hurriedly broke the seal, and cast his eyes upon the letter, which was writ- ten in the well-known hand of Edward Sea- waif. A groan burst from  his lips, lie turned ghastly pale, the letter dropped from hIia shaking hands, and lie would have have fallen to the floor, had not Kate thrown her arm around him andi held hiin up. "The schooner is lost, and Seawaif and all hantlds are in an English prison!" moaned tho ! old man. "But they have life. While there is life, there is hope-they will yet be free!" said' Kate-brave, true-hearted kate-who, though slie staggered under this new blow, would not let her poor, old fa:ther see that she did. "* Read the letter, Kate-read it, and tell mei the rest; my eyes look through too thick a cloud to make the words out," said Mr. Cringle, as lie tottered to a seat. She took up the letter; and many changes passed over her face as she read it4 "4 lie lhas learned who his parents were," she said. "He is by birthright an English earl; and they threaten to hang him because lie will ntt desert the American cause. But live or die, he will not. Thank Heaven, lie is true." Yes, Kate-yes!" said the old mnn, while the color ce olor came back once more-" yes, thank Heaven for that. lie says he blowed the schooner tup before he'd let the British have her-does he not?" "1 Yes, sir; and lie never surrendered until his ammunition was all gone and he had slain three times his own number." "Brave boy-brave boy! I don't care if the sehooner is lost!" snid the old merchant. "The British haven't got her. If lie can only get away from them, I'll build him another vessel-I-'ll do it if-but where will I get the inoiey?" "1 will let you have it, Phineas!" said the voice of one who linad come unheralded; andt who stood upon the thireshold of the door. It was Moses Gelson-thie miser. "What, you cursed old wretch!---have you come here to glory in my downfall-to tri- uniph in my wretchedness?" cried Mr. Cringle, bitterly. "Begone from here, or I'll kill you. as T would a dog that was biting me. Begone, I cannot bear the sight of you!" "I haven't conime to hurt your feelings, I1hine'as-I Ibeg you to bear with me till you know what I've come for, and then .you mnw I kill me it you want to-'   "You must hear him, my dear father!" said Kate; gently ; and at the same time Gel- son stepped within the door so as to allow his negro man-the one-legged and one-eyed indi- vidual, whom we looked at in one of our open- ing-scenes-to enter. He came in, followed by two other men, and each bore a heavy and stout box upon their shoulders, which, at a sign from the miser, they deposited on the floor- near the -feet of the merchant, and then they retired, receiving fronim 'the miser, as they went out of the door, cacch a brioad piece of 'gold. The nierehant saw this-saw Moses Gelson glve gold away; and he had heard the clink of gold in those heavy boxes when they were put down. Could lie believe his senses? What did it -mean. "Are you crazy, Moses Gelson?" he asked, not in a tone of anger, but one of surprise. "Not now, Phineas-not now-! But I have been for many, many years ; ever since-ever since the time when you--but no, I'll not speak of that now. There are five thousand guineas in gold in these boxes ; and I've brought thenm to you to usec-they have been --idle too long, and you can use themi to advan- tage."  -"J Mjoses Gelsdn,'what do you mean-? You are mocking nie!" gasped tfie moerlcant ; and he looked as if he was iboitC to faint. "' No-no-I'm not.!They art yours to use as long as you wish, and he's after that. I have more-plenty more!" said Gelson, as he pointed to Kate. "Five thoiisaind guineas? And you, Moses Gelson, are willing to lend me that without se- curitv?" "Yes ; and more still, if you have use for it, Phineas." "Ieaven forgive me-HHeaven forgive me! I have wronged you very much!" said Mr. Cringle. "I thought you had no /heart, and have treated you heartlessly." i"The hiear within me was all dried up, un- 'il your angel child dropped the dew of kind- ness on it. She is very like what Mary was, Phineas." The old miser said this so gently, and there was so unusual an expression on his face, thnat he did not look like a miser any more. And when Kate took one of his thin hands in one of hers, and her father's in the other, and placed them together, the merchant did not draw his hand away, but said, solemnly: "I askl forgiveness of Heaven and of you, Moses. I have been proud and hard-hearted; but my punishment has come." "And passed, Phineas-and passed?" said Gelson, whose very voice. once so harsh and hoarse, seemed to have changed into softness. "Now, good-bye for a little while, Phineas. I will go and clothe myself in better habili- menta, so that yon and your good child will not be ashamed to see me; and tlen, if you   will, then I'll come and talk with' you kil  about the past and the future. lMay 'I cons again, Phineas " "Yes, Moses-yes.  Come, and I'll treat you like a brother." "Well, I will come after I have had my beard trimmed, and gotten mo now clothes; for I wish to look and feel righlt once more." And he that had becen the miser, turned away, not -totterinig and shambling off', as lie had used to do, but walking with a firm step, as if youth was coming back to him. I told you, dear, father, that it was always darkest just before day!" said Kate. "Come here, Kate, come here-I want you to do something for me-I believe I'm realiz- ing!" said Mr. Cringle, who found it indeed difficult to believe in the reality of what had occurred. "What can I do for you, father?"  "Just pinch me, Kate-pinch me as hard as you can, or stick a pin into me I If I'm asleep 'twill wake me up!" Kate laughed, and bending down, did wkat would have almost waked a marbleht8,fue hti life--kissed him with her red, luscious lips. "Just lift one of those boxes, Kate-if Nt *: was gold there, I'm afraid it has sunk though' the floor." "I cannot lift it father," said Kate, trying. It is far too heavy!" "There-it is gold! What could havemade Moses Gelson change so?" "Her memory, my dear father!" s aid Kate, and she shtowed her father the mainiatuntr which she had wortn in her bosom ever sinceu the misecr had given it to her. . "Why, child, this a portrait of your dear mother I Where on earth did you gct it?" "Moses Gelson gave it to me, fathier, solle time ago. Do you remember when I interfered and saved him from being ducked in the pond?"  /- " Yes, Kate-I am glad, now, that you. did it; but I was angry at you for it, then?" "Yes ; I am glad, also, father-very glad; for, from that hour, he has been a changed mall!" "Hieaven forgive me!-had I been more kind and considerate, t;he change would have come at an earlier day, perhaps!" said Mr. Cringle. CHAPTER CIV. The war was over! Peace had been declar- ed! America was free--thanks to Almighty God, and tthrough HIi all praise to George Washington and her gallant sons I In the front parlor of a house 'very' similar to that which had been burned down and built upon the same spot, in good old Salem, sat three persons-and not one of the three looked unhappy. One was Phineas Cringle-the next, though with a ,clean-shaven face, and neat-fitting, new apparel-he could hardly be recogaized-wPa \        II  . i  &#xD;<pb n="128" xml:id="VAC6983-00000065"/> ceCs Gelson, and who could the third be but ar own pretty Kate? The merchant had been perusing a letter hich had just been brought by the postman, and which announced to him that Lord Fran- cis Egerton and his sister, with other friends, would soon visit them being about to sail in a vessel bound to Boston from England. He 'that had been Edward Seawaif had-through the devotion of his half-sister, Sir Peter Par- ker. and Sir Humphrey Dorset and his daugh- ter, who in person had solicited the king, and brought other influences to bear-been pardon- ed for what was termed his rebellion, and confirmed in his title and estate. Both of the old men expressed intense de- light on hearing this news-for Phineas and Mos s had become like brothers, and were larthrs in business now-but Kate;trembled a:l1 turned pale-she alone seemed to dread the meeting. Suddenly, while Mr. Cringle was plannin with Gelson what to do when they came, and hIw to receive them, a cripplety-hop step was , n: Lhastily approaching the door, and Jim ;e,/ old nelgro, now glorying in a re- i  ble suit of clothes, appeared at the door, ari said: "iMassa Gelson and Massa Cringle, dere's tree carriages jest dis minute drive up to de loor-.dey're all full o' white folks, dressed ever so nice!" "They've come!-they've come--'ll wager a cookie!" cried Mr. Cringle, and lie rose and hurried to the door. But, preceded by the porter from the store, who was showing the way, came those whom le wa s hurrying to meet. "Edward Seawaif-how do you do?-I mean my lord, liow doyou do?" cried the merchant., as he grasped the hero of this story by the hand. "Edward Seawaif, to you and yous , always ndll unchanged!" said the latter, as he return- e,1 the I ressure, and introducing his sister, ,r sed forward to where poof Kate stood, half tei% illred, and trembling from head to foot  lnave you no welcome for me, Miss Kate?" he t I kced, lnmost .rcproach fully. ' , To you I probably owe my life-to you I surely am in- t l1tedl jior the lknowledge which gave me a tt-r. a family and a namen-for they were dis, co curel through the means of this little flag!" And as he said this, he drew the flag winch sLIe had embroidered from his bosom.   Kate looked at him one moment, staggered forward into his extended arms, and fainted. "Here doctor-here, quick-have you not some restorative?" cried Lord Egerton, to one of the several who followed him. "Yes, sare; but, if you please you whie- pare some kind words in ze ear of ze ladie- when zey faint, zat or one kiss is ze most effect- ual remedie zat exists!" said our old friend, La Motte.  Egerton-it is hard for us not to call him Seawaif-did whisper something in her ear, and it seemed to have an effect, for in a mo- ment or more life seemed to come back to her, and a gush of tears came from her overloaded heart, and soon she was more calm. Then Lord Egerton had an opplortunity to, introduce Mr. Morley and his lovel young wilfe. and her father, Sir HHumihrey Dorset, as well ;Ia Ins own sweet sister, who, though nore pale, and sad, and quiet than she had been when first. knew her, looked proudly and fondly upon her brave and noble brother. Reader, I hate to end a story so well!-1 hate the common way that fishionable novelists have of leaving everybody happy! for. as a general thing, it is not life-like-is not na we find things in this tragical world. But I am indiiting a historical matter, and must stick to the truth! The love and gentleness of sweet Kate Cringle at last found a reward; for Francis Egerton, who, though lie loved, could not marry lis sis- ter, had not useless eyes or a senselesL heart, and he soon perceived her value, and determined to appropriate it. So, some few weeks later. Kate became his wife. And the entire party, not excepting Doctor La Motte, pronounced themselves haIppy.  If I cannot hec so happy as to 'ave more chance for amn)utat, I will study to be one grand docteur ricent!" said the doctor, as he winked at Lord Egerton on the day of his mar- riage. * Shall I build a ship for you-a nice tra- der, et-cct-c-ra, Mr. Doolittlo?" asked Mr. Cringle, at the welding-dinner, of the old mate. "No, thankee, sir!" said the laiter, blushing a greenisl-red. througlI his yellow skin. " 'PV been down to hum, where I was born, andl there's the widder Bombazine, who thinks I've been to sea long entlgh, and she wants me to take keer of the farm, and her, and I'm goin' tew dew it!"
