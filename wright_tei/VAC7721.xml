IT would be difficult to say to what class of liter- ature the following work properly belongs. It is neither romance nor pure history. Nor can the tales be said to be "founded on fact," since fact is not only the basis, but the framework and sub- stance, of the whole. Some time since, the writer became possessed with the very common propensity for antiquarian and genealogical researches, and rather unexpected- ly gathered a mass of materials tending to illustrate family history and genealogy through a period of three hundred years. It was deemed by others of some importance that these materials should be arranged and preserved in a permanent form. But a book of mere genealogies seemed to me the most unedifying of all performances. The question soon occurred, Why not put flesh upon these bones? Why not make these skeletons live? These names,  &#xD;<pb n="vi-vii" xml:id="VAC7721-00000004"/> vi       INTRODUCTION. in a genealogical table, would stand for nobody;  r and yet the men who bore them acted and suffered through the most interesting periods of history, and there are abundant facts to show what sort of connection they had with their contemporaries. I have attempted, therefore, to connect the current of family with that of public history, and to show how events xaffected not only, public men, but the homes and firesides of the people; and I have used the links of a genealogy simply as a continuous chain on which to hang pictures of the times through which it extends. Thus I have attempted to show the course of human life as it went on its perilous way behind the scenes of courts, parliaments, and battles, and to bring our ancestors before us, not in their shrouds and coffins, but as they lived and talked with their neighbors and servants, their wives and children. In order to do this more effectually, I have in the first two of the following sketches allowed myself a small margin of fancy, in which family and public history might be woven into each other so as to present a consistent and perfect whole. But I have always done this in strict subserviency to historical truth, and the facts, I I believe, are always presented in better perspec-  tive, and more, therefore, according to the verity of ! things, by reason of the threads of fancy by which ?   INTRODUCTION.       viil they are woven together. In Part Third, I found I did not need any aid from imagination, and I have therefore followed the course of simple and straight- forward narrative, giving a view of domestic life in the Old Colony in the days of the Pilgrims. In all the trials and sacrifices of our ancestors one thing appears prominent,- the beauty and glory of suffering, when endured for conscience' sake. This is not less conspicuous because the sufferers differed in faith, -some being Catholic and some Protestant; for in both cases alike, obedience to the supreme law gave a heavenly lustre to their example and a sweet fragrance to their memories. Whoever will attempt the study of history ac- cording to the method indicated in this work, tak- ing some family tree, - it matters not much whose it is,--and making its branches yield the fruits and lessons of past experience, will find that the study has a fresh and absorbing interest, and that the track over which it leads him will be covered with a light in which minute objects appear with a most attractive brightness. In the collection of facts, I have been aided by the researches of several individuals whose names it may not be proper to mention here; but literary honesty seems to require a distinct acknowledg- ment of the kindness of the- Hon.

Part Second, or the sketch entitled "'.The Adven- turer," narrates events and transactions in the Neth- erlands, with which the reading public have lately become familiar through Prescott's Philip II. and Motley's Dutchl Republic. It lay in my way to show the bearing of those wonderful events on family fortunes, but I had finished that part before either of the above-named admirable histories was published. The writer of these sketches, had no intention, when he commenced them, of producing them for any other purpose than private. reading. In intervals of more severe mental labor they were studies in history after a new method,--that of incarnating and galvanizing old skeletons. The skeletons, however, leaped up with so much life, that a part of them have been dismissed to a more unrestricted circulation. ,-    PART I THE EXILE. C Good Heaven! what sorrows gloomed that parting day That called them from their native walks away, When the poor exiles, evei'y pleasure past, IT Hung round the bowers and fondly looked their last, And took a long farewell, and wished in vain For seats like these beyond the rolling main, And, shuddering still to face the distant deep, Returned and wept, and still returned to weep."  &#xD;<pb n="2-3" xml:id="VAC7721-00000006"/>   CHAPTER I. THE MARTYRDOM. THE Tower is one of the first objects which the eye searches after, as the traveller approaches the city of London. A huge, square edifice, with tur- rets at each corner, rises above a pile of lower build- ings and smaller towersthat surround it. Around the whole pile there is a moat, and a fortified wall, at whose base on the southern side flows the Thames, near enough, with a westering sun, to reflect the turrets in its gentle waves. Outside of the fortified wall, and not a great way from its northwestern angle, the ground swells into a small eminence, which bears the name of Tower Hill, the last tragic scene of many a drama in the history of England. As soon as the eye rests on that immense pile of buildings, once the royal residence and the state- prison, the imagination goes back through the long sweep of centuries, and represents to itself the woes that have found utterance within those gloomy re- cesses without falling upon a human ear. What griefs, what unavailing sighs, have those walls shut  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC7721-00000007"/> 4        THE EXILE. in, and what a history would they give of hopes and agonies, could all the sounds be re-echoed that have fallen upon the impassive stone! There are two principal entrances, one at the water's edge, on the southern side, called "Traitor's Gate," through whose frowning archway many a person of gentle blood has read his doom before- hand, as the jaws of the great structure closed upon him and swallowed him from the hopeful day. There is another on the west, called "Entrance Gate," which opens in sight of Tower Hill. Around this latter gate a crowd might be seen gathering early on the 22d of June, 1535. The sun rose that morning in clouds and dark vapors, a thing not by any means strange in the city of London; but it had its influence on the imaginations of men, who thought the sun had now his own reasons for hid- ing his face. As the hours advanced, the crowd came pouring in thickening streams over London Bridge, and down the streets and lanes of the city, emptying themselves mainly into Tower Street and Thames Street, -which lead to an open view of Tower Hill, until the two latter streets were choked entirely full. The hour of nine had come, and all eyes were bent towards Entrance Gate. Still it opened not. There stood the platform on Tower Hill, covered with black, but the victim did not appear. The man most concerned in all this solemn preparation was fast asleep within, and the officials were wait- ing fore him to wake up. T'he Lieutenant of the Tower, who by the way was Sir William Kingston,   i:         THE MARTYRDOM.       5 a man of humane feelings, had waited upon his prisoner early in the morning, and warned him to prepare for execution. He asked permission to sleep awhile first; and now the hour had come, and the crowd were waiting breathless, and the prisoner was -in placid repose. It seemed hard to Kingston to wake him from such peaceful sleep, but he stepped in and touched him, and brought him to a consciousness of the waiting scene. He arose and dressed himself for the last time. There was a belief in those days, that, when in doubt or trou- ble, one might open the Bible at venture and alight on the spot suited to his condition. If he was for- saken of God, some awful passage would come up to his eye and tell him of his doom. If not, some words of sweet promise would present themselves 6n the blessed page. The " sortition by the Book," as they called it, was a fearful rite to them, for their hopes and fears trembled upon it. The prisoner, now weak with long confinement and privation, leaned against the wall with his Bible it his hand, raised an imploring look to heaven, and opened. These words came up to his eye: "' This is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent. I have glorified thee upon the earth; I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do." He shut the book, saying, "Here is learning enough for me," and gave himself into the officers' hands. While this was going on in what was called the "Bell Tower,"' a low circular building that could be seen peering above the wall, the crowd had continued to   &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7721-00000008"/> 6        THE EXILE. gather till it choked nearly every avenue leading to Tower Hill. Entrance Gate at length opened on its slow hinges, and gave the prisoner to the eyes of the multitude. He is an old man of nearly eighty years, so bent down with infirmity and hardship that he has to be borne in a chair between two con- stables, his head meekly drooping, and his scanty white locks streaming down his shoulders. It re- quired a good deal in those days to touch the heart of a London mob, but now a shade of softness ran over that sea of faces; and instead of the tumult and the coarse jeering that usually attended on public executions, there was an unbroken and fune- real silence. The ghastly procession of halberds and pole-axes moved on to Tower Hill, pausing at the foot of the platform. The old man seemed to have new strength, as he looked nearer into the face of death; for he now stood erect, refused the aid of the constables, and walked with a firm step up the stairs. Jist at that moment the sun broke from the clouds in clearest splendor, and, shining athwart his face and over his silvery hairs, made him seem to the multitude as if already transfigured with ,the resurrection glories. The omen arrested his atten- tion too; for he lifted his hands, with kindling fea- tures, and said to himself, "Turn to Him and be enlightened, and your faces shall not be con- founded." It was soon over, and the multitude broke into squads and slowly melted away. But let us classi- fy them a little as they retire, and we shall read in   ];'i THE MARTYRDOM.            7 their faces the events of coming history. Doubtless the dregs of London had emptied themselves into the streets, as they always do on like occasions, with the same feelings that swayed a Roman pop- ulace when they entered the amphitheatre. But the man who had now suffered was a shining mark of tyranny. He was the most learned prelate in England, the most distinguished among the bench of bishops in the House of Peers, the most hon- ored friend of the cause of learning, and withal the ablest defender of the Catholic Church. He had done more than all others to shut out from England the tide of Lutheranism that was sweep- ing over the Continent. The reply to Luther put forth by Henry the Eighth, which obtained for the King the title of "Defender of the Faith," was supposed to be written, not by Henry, but by the man he had now sent to the block. Though not free from the intolerant principles and prac- tices of his Church, he was a man of benevolence and piety, of gentle manners, joined to an un- bending moral uprightness. The King had broken with the Pope because the latter would not grant his divorce from Queen Katharine, and he assumed to be the Supreme Head of the Church of England. It was for denying that supremacy that Bishop Fisher had now suffered on Tower Hill. In that re- tiring crowd were large numbers of Catholics who denied in heart what the Bishop had denied both with the heart and lips, and whose meditations on the present aspect of things were mingled with a bitter sense of bereavement in the loss of their ven-  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7721-00000009"/> 8        THE EXILE. erated prelate. There were men too in that crowd who had swerved from Popery, but who, in the present hubbub and ferment of opinions, had not- come clearly into anything else, and who would therefore swear allegiance to any new pope rather than encounter the dangers of martyrdom. Prot- estantismn had not yet come fairly into conscious life among what would be called the upper ranks in England. But there was another class of men who mingled in that crowd, whom a mere casual observer would have considered the most insignificant of all, but who proved far otherwise in the progress of events. They were the men who wore fagots on their sleeves. Here and there, sprinkled through that crowd, were persons, found chiefly among the. me- chanics and laborers who had come in from the surrounding country or emerged from the lower strata of London life, who wore badges which had a significance that tyrants could not understand. In the right sleeve, wrought in red colors, was the, image of a burning fagot, that those who wore it' might have the fear of temporal and eternal flames ever before their eyes. These were the "Lollards," who had been once convicted and pardoned; and they had this hideous symbol bound upon them, that all observers might take note of them as living fuel for the Smithfield fires whenever they should relapse into heresy. They were thus marked out to be despised and watched by all men, and their words were weighed in the nicest theological scales. It may well be conceived that their words were very few, while their thoughts were very many.   THE MARTYRDOM.       9 The men who wore fagots were pretty well repre- sented at the scene of Fisher's execution; they looked on without speaking, - hard-handed and hard-featured men who had a '"lean and hungry look," who did not always " sleep o' nights," and who kept up a' thinking which fagots, whether of red worsted or of blazing twigs, could not entirely subdue. Fisher was the first martyr of note on the Catholic side in what was called the English Ref- ormation, and hence the strange interest which had drawn people of all classes and opinions to the scene. The -Lollards were considered the most despicable element in the crowd; and yet out of the thinking going on silently within them, Puritanism, clad in steel, was by and by to come forth and upheave the throne of England. But there was another element in that crowd which we have more distinctly to trace. There were men who were saved from Fisher's doom as yet only because he was the most conspicuous mark for the stroke of tyranny; who held his opinions; and who came to see how a man supported by them could die. They saw in the dim future, that the hour was coming on when they must weigh a- good conscience against the dross of earth, and de- termine which was worth the more; and it must have been with a silent thrill of admiration that they saw their good prelate, faithful to his opinions, turning the pall of the scaffold into a scene of vic- tory. But there was one man in the crowd who had a strange personal interest in the transactions of that morning, and whose history we have specially in hand. &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7721-00000010"/> CHAPTER II. THE MEN OF KENTM THE County of Kent is, and ever has been, one of the best and most thriving districts of Old England. Its northern border is washed by the Thames and its estuaries; its southern and southwestern by the Straits of Dover, where it advances so boldly to- wards the Continent that "the men of Kent" can look over into their neighbors' country and see the shore of sunny France lying like a soft blue cinc- ture on the distant waves. Two parallel ridges of hills traverse the district from- east to west, sepa- rated from each other by a breadth of about eight miles. From the northern range the country slopes towards the Thames and its estuaries; from the southern range it slopes southward towards France, and more than once has bristled defiance towards its neighbor over the Channel. If you stand on the summit of this southern range, which they call "The Rag-stone," and look southward, your eye commands a prospect of surpassing loveliness and beauty. This southern slope was once an im- mense forest of oak. Of course the forest has   fii      .THE MEN OF KENT.           " been cleared away; but it is still a region of oak groves interspersed with fields covered with all the richness of art and nature.   The houses, seats, vil- lages, gardens, and farms of smooth-shaven green, appear among large and towering oaks, and they gleam  out from  the foliage like gems of white- ness and verdure set irregularly in a framework of fringing leaves.  -Kent is the only county in all England whose lands are held, as the lawyers say, "by the tenure of gavelkind," -that is, where there is no right of primogeniture unless specially estab- lished by law, and where the father's estate is di- vided in equal portions among his sons.    Owing to this, and to the native goodness of the soil, Kent is one of the best farming districts in England; its estates are small in extent, but under the highest cultivation, and "the   mnen of Kent" have been known as men not of artificial,- but native nobility, and of indomitable vigor and hardihood.* Wordsworth's Sonnet, written in view of a threatened invasion from France, may occur to the reader in this connection. TO THE MEN OF KENT. Vanguard of Liberty, ye men of Kent, Ye children of a soil that doth advance Her haughty brow against the coast of France, Now is the time to prove your hardiment!

If you stand on the northern range, called "The Chalk Ridge," and look towards the Thames, a different prospect, but not less pleasing and'finely diversified, lies under your eye. Away on the ex- treme left you see the city of London, provided the smoke and the fog do not fold it in a veil too thick to be broken through. Down this northern slope -are lands of fertile loam, on which broad acres of pease, beans, barley, and the finest wheat, are luxu- riantly waving. Through the middle of this slope runs the river Medway, draining it by its tributary rills, curving round to the right, and finally losing itself in one of the estuaries of the Thames. Down to the shore of the Thames are scattered villages and farm-houses, surrounded with cherry and plum orchards, and various other fruit-trees, to supply the London market. Near the mouth of the Medway, and on its right bank, stands the ancient city of Rochester, and stretching along the shore of the estuary, and form- ing a settlement continuous with Rochester, lies the city of Chatham. In the former place are an old cathedral, an'ancient castle, now nearly in ruins, both invested with rich historic associations, and various schools, some of them founded ages ago, and celebrated from the earliest times. Adam Sayer was one of "the men of Kenton as early as the year 1300 or soon after. He died pos- Confirmed the charters that were yours before;- No parleying now!"In Britain is one breath; We all are with you now-from shore to shore :-- * Ye men if :Kent! it s Victory or Death!   THE DIEN OF KENT.       13 sessed of an estate in Chatham in the year 1346, and his descendents in collateral branches spread over the district in various directions, and sometimes be- yond its limits. One of them became the warden of Rochester castle. One crossed over the Thames into Essex, and. he and his descendants became pro- prietors of large estates in Colchester and its neigh- boring towns. It must have been about the year 1520 that the boy Richard Sayer came over from Colchester, drawn towards his kinsfolk in Kent for the benefit of the Rochester schools. Then more than now the benefits of learning accumulated in favored places. The see of Rochester was the charge of the learned and venerable prelate whose life we have just seen brought to its tragic close on Tower Hill. He was promoted to this bishopric in the year 1504, and now for sixteen years he had been the liberal patron of learning in this spot to which his affections had drawn him., Various other honors had been heaped upon him'; he had been appointed Professor of Divinity at Cambridge and Chancellor of the University, but here in the pastoral walks of his diocese he passed his most pleasurable hours. They offered him afterwards a more valuable bish- opric, but he declined it. "My church," said he, " is my wife, and I will never exchange her for one that is richer"; and so up to the time that the Traitor's Gate closed upon him he continued to lavish his affections on this quiet spot hid in the blooming vales of the Kentish hills. We know nothing very definite of the on-goings of the boy Richard in the schools of Rochester.   &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7721-00000012"/> "       THE EXILE. We judge from the family traits and pictures that he was a sturdy-looking boy, with sandy locks, a florid face, and a sanguine temperament, and we should not wonder if the Rochester schoolmasters had to keep an open eye upon him. We are pretty certain in saying that he rambled on the banks of the Medway and forded its waters, that he climbed the -Chalk Ridge and took in unfading impressions of the scenery beneath, that he sometimes-trampled the wheat-fields and roused the maledictions of the Kentish farmers. What religious impressions he got in the old cathedral, events perhaps will show. He was among the boys who followed the good Bishop and "' plucked his gown" in order to " share his smile." The face of the benevolent prelate got  brightly imaged upon his memory. We are not surprised at this. We are looking into that face  now as Holbein has copied it, and, spite of the slanders of Burnet, we must pronounce it an honest face and a kindly one, and, though slightly austere, yet one which little children might be glad to look into and copy into their hearts. Richard Sayer returned home to his father's house in Colchester, where he grew up, the elder of two brothers, the legal heir to a large estate, of which, in the ordinary course of events, he would come in possession at his father's death. We psass over the intervening years, till we find him in the throng that gathered in sight of Tower Hill on the morn- ing of June 22d, 1535. What brought him up to London? Something more than the tender recol- lections of childhood, and the benignant and treas-   THE MEN OF KENT.      10 ured image of the Bishop of Rochester, though doubtless these abode with him now that fifteen years had passed away. He is now twenty-five years old, and the most eventful period of Eng- land's history is opening its fearful drama. Great calamities are said to fling their shadows on before them, and this man- felt the gloom of coming events growing deeper and deeper upon his spirit. He thought by coming up to London he should find out something more sure and reliable touching the prognostics of the coming storm. He was strongly attached to the old religion, into which he had been baptized and confirmed. To understand his position, let it be observed that in the month of March, 1534, the English Parliament, as the tools of Henry, authorized a new oath of allegiance, de- claring the King's first marriage null and void, Mary, the issue of it, to be excluded from the succession, and the children of Ann Boleyn the legal heirs of the throne. The satne servile Parliament had declared the King the Supreme Head of the Church; and made the denial of that supremacy high trea- son. The new oath of spiritual allegiance was en- joined on all English subjects. Hence the peril to true Catholics. Perjury lay on one hand, and the scaffold or Tyburn on the other. And Richard Sayer was brought to the metropolis in the vague expectation that 'some way of relief would be opened to him; and hence he is drawn into that vortex of life that is whirling through the streets of London. It may well be conceived, that what he has just  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7721-00000013"/> 16        THE EXILE. witnessed does not soothe his apprehensions. The multitude have broken up into little knots, and, as they melt away one by one, the name of " the her- etic Nan," with many a vile and degrading epithet, is found half suppressed on the lips of the popu- lace; for to the pretty face and the corrupting arts of the new Queen they ascribed the present troubles and the lowering storm. The "new Herodias" was another of the flattering titles which were ban- died about in undertones. Somebody had com- mended her graceful dancing at Whitehall. "I tell you," replied another, " that in her dances her feet will spurn off our heads like foothalls." But the crowd have all melted away, and night, more still and awful than ever, has come down and hushed the street murmurs and noises, and there is little that is audible but the ripples of the Thames. The King and the new Queen have finished their last game at tables, and sleep in the palace at Green- wich, and Fisher sleeps. in eternal peace, though tumbled without shroud or coffin into his cold and bloody grave.   , CHAPTER    III. LEGAL ADVICE.  IN the times of which we write, London and Westminster could hardly be called a single city. Westminster was originally a town lying farther up the Thames and three miles west of the city. Between the two lay "The Strand,"' a low, marshy ground, through which three sluggish streams wound their sedgy way into the Thames. But the city and the town gradually spread out to meet each other, and now the Strand was partly filled up. It had already become a continuous street, a great thoroughfare between the city and the West End. iOn the south side of it splendid edifices had arisen, in the rear of which were parks and gardens, terraced down to the water's edge; and on the north side were shops, churches, and residences. Among other buildings is "St. Clement's Inn," the resort of law- yers and clients, to be immortalized by Shake- speare as the home of Master Shallow in his tem- plar days. The entrance to it is through a noble archway with lofty columns, and in the rear of it is-not the bowling-alley, where the hangers-on 2.

Justice Shallow had not yet taken up his abode at St. Clement's Inn, but a man was there a good deal more shrewd and subtle than he. Hie was well known to the Colchester Sayers, for he had been their agent in drawing up wills and title-deeds and managing suits in chancery, and whatever legal instrument he made out was pretty sure to be free from flaws. He was a high-toned Papist, had threaded all the sinuosities both of the canon and the civil law, had large property at stake, and was therefore averse to change, and we presume would have rejoiced in his secret heart to have had the last shred of Lutheranism turned into a blaze in Smithfield Square. He was the very man for Rich- ard to consult in the troubles that weighed upon him, especially as he supposed him to stand in the same slippery place as himself. After the scene of the 22d, as soon as he could sufficiently recover his spirits, his resort was to St. Clement's Inn. He was yet a young man, and in the simplicity of his heart expected to find Lawyer Leach somewhat troubled at least in respect to his temporal interests. He was mightily mistaken. Lawyer Leach was in as comfortable a frame of mind as could well be imagined. It was very evident he had not been broken of his rest. His face was round, rubicund, and beaming; though the top of his head was bald,   "EGAL ADVICE.       19 and shone like polished ivory, and withal was rather flat, his hair laterally lay back sleek and smooth, his person was full and rotund, and evidently had no idea of renouncing those two creature comforts of all true Englishmen, roast beef and London beer. Though rather portly, he had such a look of refresh- ing coolness that it would be a privilege to contem- plate him in a hot summer's day. It was doubly refreshing now to Richard, for it inspired him with confidence, and he had not a doubt that Lawyer Leach had the secret of safety. A nature so smooth, elastic, and oily could certainly glide be- tween two impinging religions without being ground to powder between them. He laid before him his whole case. Lawyer Leach looked towards the ceiling and squinted with his left eye, his usual expression whenever with his other eye he was taking exact aim at some legal nebulosity, which under his keen gray twinkle was sure to be resolved in less time than were the nebula of Orion by the new tele- scope. "They can't make it treason," said he; "treason by the new statute is a denial of the King's su- premacy." "And is not refusing to take the oath a denial of the King's supremacy." "No, sir,-not in the sense of the statute. To make out treason, they must prove some overt act. Holding your tongue is not treason,-doing noth- ing is not treason, keeping still is not treason." But suppose I refuse to subscribe the oath, what will they make of it?"  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7721-00000015"/> 20        THE EXILE. "That is only misprision of treason." "And what is the punishment?" ( Imprisonment and confiscation of goods." "Then how could they send Fisher to the block?" "He did n't keep his tongue in his head. iHe did n't understand men as well as he might. The Pope sent him a cardinal's hat, and the King swore he should n't have a head to put it on. They baited him with flatteries, and set these purring and velvet-pawed fellows about him, till they wormed the treason out-of him and caught it. Keep your tongue still, especially when these soft-eyed mousers are smelling about you." "Then -I am only in danger of imprisonment and - loss of goods. Do you see any way to escape that danger?"            - "Certainly there is a way." "And how is that?" said the client, clutching eagerly at his sinking hopes and bringing them up. "Subscribe."   ' W'That! commit perjury to save my property'? Incur the penalties of eternal damnation to escape the penalties of the law?" A bland smile ruffled the florid smoothness of the casuist's face, and his left eye squinted again. c; You do not distinguish between the res in aninmo and the res acta. You may withhold your entire inward consent to what you are compelled to do under duress, and so the act-has no validity what- ever in the court of conscience. Thus, though you subscribe with the hand, you keep your whole in- ward mind and conscience from the deed. Thus it /i..   "EGAL ADVICE.       21 is the mere act of the outward man, not of the mens cast'a penitus, which is preserved entire, and has nothing to do with the outward transaction. This distinction is vastly important, especially in these times of sudden changes." "I do not think I fully understand you," said the client, who had not been initiated into the deeper mysteries of Popery, and never read the works of the Schoolmen. "If I subscribe that oath, it is flat perjury, and I shall have its load to weigh down my conscience as long as I live." "Why, sir, don't you believe in the supremacy of the Catholic Church?" said the casuist, leading off upon another track.  "Certainly, and therefore I can't subscribe the oath." "But what is meant by the supremacy of the Catholic Church, but that she has the sovereign keep. ing of the consciences of men, and the sovereign power in their salvation? I would n't belong to a church in whose bosom I could n't rest in perfect peace, feeling she had- the high prerogative of for- giveness, - who could n't, shrive me from my sins, whether great or small. That is the advantage of the Catholic Church over this upstart Lutheranism, which has no power to save its children either from temporal or eternal fire. Must I be roasted like a Lollard, when my Church has the supreme  power to shrive and to save me? I shall subscribe, not doubting she will save me from damnation." "Do you think, then, that the Pope's adherents will generally subscribe?"  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7721-00000016"/> !2       THE EXILE.            , "Not the least doubt of it. They will come in by thousands." "But I will wait and see. I will keep my lips sealed, and my life will be safe at any rate." "Don't be too confident," said the lawyer, lower- ing his tone, and looking cautiously towards the door; " that hound, Audley, is on the bench, and he'll do anything his master sets him on to do. But wait and see how things will turn. More's trial will be on the 1st of July, and/men are wait- ing the issue of that. There maybe some hope in a jury, and if anybody can inspire them with cour- age it is More. His defence will be gallant and splendid; the crown lawyers are afraid of him, and people are holding their breath till the trial comes. The sum is, you have just four chances of safety," and Lawyer-Leach touched each of his four left fingers as he counted them off. -"First, you may not be called upon to subscribe; mayhap it will only be the upper rank in church and state, in which case you save your head by ducking it down among the people. Or, secondly, you may be called upon, and you can subscribe. That, let me tell yoi, is what most people will do. Or, thirdly, you can leave the country till the storm blows over. Your estate is safe. Your father is yet living, and you may be assured that he will subscribe, - and so the estate will not be confiscated while in his hands. Perhaps you may return and inherit it under a Catholic succession. No one knows what the wheel will turn up at last. Or, fourthly, there may be some spirit among the people, and perhaps the   juries will not all slump in. We shall see Monday. If there is any stand possible against these meas- ures, we shall see it at More's trial. If all these chances fail you, and you are at the mercy of the crown lawyers, - why you can die for abstractions and quiddities like a Lollard, if you like." It is something gained to a patient when his physician has told him the exact nature of his dis- ease; and whether it be medicable or mortal, the patient's pulse is sure to beat more calmly. It is something gained when a possible calamity takes shape and outline, and the portentous shadow can be scanned and measured. So thought and felt the client of Lawyer Leach. vStill'the trial at West- minster Hall on Monday was waited with an inter- est too agonizing to be long endurable.  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7721-00000017"/> CH AYTER IV. THEI PRODIGY. FoR days and nights the anxious client had time to digest the counsel of the -Papist lawyer, and weigh the argument in such metaphysical scales as he was able to hold. He wanted to resolve on some line of conduct in a possible, and every day a more probable emergency, so that when the trial hour should come he might act with manly decis- ion and coolness. His nature was of a robust and sturdy make, and leaned strongly towards the prac- tical. And though he did not comprehend the Jes- uit lawyer's distinction between the res in animo and the res gesta, nor understand how one could take decided damage without the other, yet the new application of the doctrine of church suprem- acy and prerogative appeared to him in an exceed- ingly interesting light. If he admitted the postu- late, which he mhust as a good Catholic, he could not understand why the conclusion was not a sound one. But in all earnest natures there is something to be satisfied beside the intellect; and when the intellect is about leading astray with its   THE PRODIGY.,       25 chaffering logic, the moral nature will rise in its noble supremacy, and brush clean away the bewil- dering web-work that would obscure its vision. Richard had revolved these things till. his brain was fevered and throbbing, and he determined to shake off for a-while his distracting thoughts, and drive away the grim fancies of the future. Wait and see. The issue of Morels trial would inspire men's minds with confidence or with terror, and meanwhile let us hope in God. There was enough in London to divert a stran- ger's mind from himself, if anything external could do it. Just fancy Richard Sayer walking through the Strand into Fleet Street, through the sights and noises that must have met his eye and ear. Not yet had stage-coaches come into use, and so his ear was not dinned with the shaking thunder and the roar of wheels. Not yet had the morn- ing papers been issued, and so all the advertising was done by street-criers in the great thoroughfares, and especially the Strand. Fishwives, orange-wom- en, mackerel-women, costard-mongers, broom-men, chimney-sweeps, pie-men, ahd fruit-men screamed and roared inharmonious fnto the ears of passers- by; while booths in which silks, cloths, and cut- lery were exhibited, and behind which men were bawling, "What lack ye?" gave an agreeable va- riety to the din. Through such a scene as this Richard walked along the Strand; and the cherry- women, who cried, "Cherries in the rise," that is, on the twigs, and more especially, "Ripe cherries from Kent," would perhaps touch a chord of strange and  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7721-00000018"/> 26         THE EXILE. thronging memories, yea, not unlike those which Old Herrick embodied afterwards in his luscious lines: "Cherry ripe, ripe, ripe! I cry; Eull and fair ones; come and buy. If so be you ask me where They do grow, I answer, There Where my Julia's lips do smile,- There 's the land of cherry isle; Whose plantations fully show All the year where cherries grow." But not this, nor all the sights and sounds of Lon- don, have drawn him quite away from his sombre meditations. He has passed out of the Strand, with its jostle and hubbub; he has crossed Temple Bar into Fleet Street, where he is roused perforce from his reflections by a stir quite unusual even in this London hive. A crowd is rushing along with hurrying feet, and before he can look about him they have involved him in the current, and swept him against'the sides of the buildings. They do not stop to pick him up, but are still on the run, pouring over Ludgate Hill and by St. Paul's, and he sees by their wonder-stricken facesthat they are bent towards a common object. He has scarcely gathered up his scattered limbs when another squad comes hurrying on " to see the miracle." He falls into the wake of the stream, -indeed, he could not very well get out of it, --and he is glad of any sight to relieve-him of the agony of his reflections. Down it sweeps, turning to the right through a cross lane into Thames Street, to London Bridge, pouring over it, till men and women and boys and horses and carts are there jammed in together,   THE PRODIGY.        27 The old London Bridge proper was at this time the only one that spanned the Thames. It was not only a bridge, but a street. A continuous row of buildings stood on each side, upheld by the piers, over which the houses sometimes projected, looking as if about to reel and tumble into the water. The street between these houses was sometimes quite narrow, for it varied in breadth from ten to fifteen feet. Great beams or cross-bars extended overhead from  one side of the street to the other, especially where two houses opposite showed a decided incli- nation to pitch contrariwise into the river, and needed to be fastened together to help each other keep their balance. On these cross-beams great, ponderous signs were hanging and swinging,-signs of taverns, booksellers, tailors, grocers, barbers, and haberdashers, each with its symbol painted red, green, black, or yellow, three times as large as life and a great many times more grim. There was the sign .of the Sugar-loaf, the sign of the Angel with his wings and trumpet well battered, the sign of the Lion, the sign of the Bear, the sign of the Bible, the sign  of the Blackboy, and the sign of the Breeches; and whenever a   gust of wind swept over the bridge, sugar-loaves, angels, lions, bears, bibles, blackboys, and breeches, swung and creaked and growled and groaned in strange concert over the din of street noises below. Such was the scene into which Richard now found himself plunged, he knew not for what purpose, except to be rolled onward and see the miracle with the rest. If he looked at his right, soon after coming upon the gk ,I',  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7721-00000019"/> 28        TItE EXILE. bridge, he must have seen another sign, on which was the name of Hans Holbein, the world-renowned painter, for he lived there; perhaps Mrs. Holbein's great red Dutch face was at the window, wondering at the excitement on the bridge, and perhaps the face of the painter himself was looking out from his studio in the breezy attic, and catching all the strange hues of passion and manners as he saw them in the rolling and turbid stream of London life beneath. But Richard cannot stop for this, but is borne on to see the new wonder, meeting on the way the ebb-tide of those who had already seen it and were retiring with big eyes. A little past the middle of the bridge, towards Southwark, rose "The Traitor's Tower," which peered above the houses on either side, and com- manded a fine view of the river for some distance up and down the stream. On the top of this tow- er, all round the balustrade, were stuck long poles sharpened at the upper end, and on the sharp ends, of the poles were stuck--the heads of traitors! This was one of the institutions of royalty de-  signed to exert its salutary influence on the pop- ulace, and with the red fagot symbols, and the real fagots themselves, regulate both the thinking and the conduct of the masses. At this time the poles stood pretty thick around the balustrades, each with its horrible sight to exhibit. There were rows of faces, turned up and down the river, black- ening and consuming in the hot sun; skulls that had nothing left but bone and socket; visages whose features were yet traceable, and which glared   THE PRODIGY,       29 and grinned as the shrinking muscles consumed away; Carthusian monks staring and looking cadaverous; and heads of greater note, that still preserved some semblance of a human countenance. In the midst of all this ghastly array was the head of Fisher, the face turned towards the Kentish hills. Many days had elapsed since it was placed there, but it looked down more fresh and life-lilke than ever. Yea, while all around it consumed and black- ened in the hot air, that saintly face put on every day a more soft and beautiful bloom; and the cheeks that were wrinkled with age assumed a more youthful freshness. Day after day a mid- summer sun had been scalding'down upon it, only to bring out its natural expressiveness and benig- nity. The breezes from the Thames touched his white hairs with gentle fingers, and they still hung undishevelled; and the, eye and countenance were turned down on the gaping multitudes, as if giving them still a patriarchal benediction. We will not stop to subject the fact to a chemical analysis,- we give it as it impressed itself on the minds and imaginations of -the people that thronged to see it, and to whom it was a sign from heaven; as if the very bodies of God's servants were immortal against the touch of tyrants. Here the hurrying crowd had brought up,l and were choked in along the Traitor's Tower, gazing up in silent wonder into that saintly countenance When their curiosity and their love A'S  of marvel were satisfied, they began slowly to re- cede, and a voice broke from the crowd which said, "To-morrow it will speak!" : '"(*I Ae   3*  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7721-00000020"/> CHAPTER    V.

But a Sabbath-day in' London in 1535 was not the Sabbath which comes three cen- turies later, that meek quiet may spread over it her "wings invisible"; and we shall acknowledge, in the comparison, that society has not been going backward. We will make out as well as we can from the too brief diary of Richard, the last Sun- day in June which he passed in that tumultuous city in these tumultuous times. The Strand was not then, as now, entirely filled up with buildings. Splendid mansions had arisen there, along the margin of the Thames, but there were wide openings, both towards the river on the south side of the street, and towards the country   SUNDAY IN LONDON.      31 on the north. In one of these openings, towards the Thames, there was a large clump of old trees, on a site that commanded a most sothing pros- pect, with city, river, town, and country interblend- ing. Hither our stranger in London had walked over from St. Clement's Inn, ere yet the city was astir. It was one of the clearest and sweetest mornings of June, and even a London fog could not hide the sun's face, for he looked through it. On the opposite side of the river lay the village of Lambeth, in which its episcopal palace rose conspicuous, the residence now of Cranmer, and the seat ever of ecclesiastical power.- Beyond Lambeth rose the hills of Surtey, clothed in their greenest summer glories, fading off in the distance to where the fleecy clouds seemed to have slept all night upon their summits, and were just beginning to dress themselves in purple and soar away,- no bad image to represent the souls that rise out of earth's dark night into the pure heavens above. Close by, Father Thames was rolling his noiseless flood, from whose face the mists were creeping off. London Bridge, with its horrible Traitor's Tower, could be distinctly seen, and nearer still a long line of gold and silver sheen, which the sun was making upon the waters, with sometimes the white swans of the Thames gliding through it and tipping their feathers with gold. Out of the city of London rose a forest of church-steeples, and high over them all the dome of St. Paul's, surmounted by its huge ball, now burnished and dazzling like a mock-sun, and the cross that cut its clear outline on the cerulean  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7721-00000021"/> 32        THlE EXILE. ground above. Such was the spectacle on which Richard gazed on that Sabbath morning of the 30th of June, where he sought the soothing influences from nature which he could. not find in human society; and we do not wonder at the bitter words which he records: " O, why should it be that man is the only foul blot which God has made on the face of his works!" And we do not wonder that an historian, after describing the principal events in the reign of Henry the Eighth, raises the, question whether in those days the sun did really shine in London and the skies look blue. But the morning hours are passing, and the Sab- bath bells are ringing, and London is once more emptying its pent-up life into the streets, which is threading its way hither and thither. St. Clement's Church and St. Mary's both stood close by in the Strand, and little companies of worshippers were bending their way into them. But the place of all others to attract a stranger in London was St. Paul's; especially if he was intent on watching the current of events, and the prognostics of coming history, -and to St. Paul's we must follow, for a few moments, the hero of our story. Let not the reader imagine, however, that we are now to be introduced to a gorgeous service in St. Paul's Cathedral, with the organ peals sending through the arches their throbbings of melody and the saints of bygone centuries looking down from every niche of the sculptured marble. The service is not in the church, but the churchyard. On the north side of the cathedral there was a   SUNDAY IN LONDON.      66 large vacant space, which from earliest times had been the burial spot of the city. It was finally en- cldsed, and towards the eastern extremity there was raised a large wooden cross, and under the cross a pulpit. A tree was standing near enough to fling its shade over the pulpit, and protect it in part from the sun's rays. This was the famous "St. Paul's Cross," which had long been a stand from which to make appeals to the popular mind, and in times of excitement and change, London would empty itself into the churchyard to hear the latest proclamation of the ruling power and interest. It served :the same purpose that an administration organ does at Washington now. There politics and religion were both preached, and sometimes in a strange jumble. There Popery had been preached up and preached down, according as the tide ebbed or flowed. Henry had seized upon this position, and the obsequious priests and bishops here piped such music as the Privy Council at Whitehall thought best to have played in the people's ears. The reader then will please represent to himself, that on the clear Sunday morning of June 30th, 1535, St. Paul's Churchyard is crowded full, and the event which has just taken place, and the events which loom up in the gloomy future, have brought them hither with ears wide open to hear. All classes are there. The bishops, earls, and knights occupy conspicuous places on the right and left of the speaker; a lower stratum of humanity forms the central mass; the dregs of London populace float around the circumference, trampling over the graves,  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7721-00000022"/> THE EXILE.            ' or leaning against the walls of the churchyard. Richard, quite as much interested as anybody in the sort of music which is to be piped from Paul's Cross, has wedged himself in between a fat man and a tombstone, and is likely to hear the sermon without going to sleep under it. There is a low platform at the base of the pulpit, raised two or three feet from the ground, and on this are placed some curious specimens, which serve the preacher with ample illustrations.  They are nothing else than three live Lollards, who have been caught in Kent, and lodged several days and nights in Lollard's Tower, -a prison kept for such purposes in the episcopal palace at Lambeth; and hither they have been marched all the way this morning, coming through Westminster and along the Strand, each barefooted and bareheaded, and carrying fagots on their backs, - all the while the sun shining, and the blue sky bending above. The fagots now are real ones, veritable bundles of dry twigs; and the heretics are arranged, each with his fagot, right under the speaker's nose, where he can conveniently swing his fist over their heads, and about their ears, and exhibit them to the audience, somewhat as a geological lecturer might exhibit the monsters of the secondary formations. The specimens, in this case, were a man and his wife, and their only child, a boy say of ten or twelve years. The man was a plain mechanic, who had been thinking out a theology of his own over his lapstone. The woman's face, bent downward to escape the stare of the multitude, was an intelligent   and thoughtful one, meek and placid, but pale as marble, showing all the veins that threaded it, showing traces too of a thousand waves of anguish that had gone over her soul. The boy was a sturdy little fellow, and looked decidedly sullen, and evi- dently, while doing his penance, was cursing the whole race of bishops, and treasuring up hoarded anger enough to make a full-grown Puritan in the end. The preacher rose up and harangued his hearers in a voice that was a compromise between a scream and a howl. He drew his text from the narrative which describes Samson grinding in the mill of the Philistines. He said the mill of the Philistines represented the devil's mill, and the wheat Was the Church of Christ, in danger of being bruised and powdered between the upper and the nether mill- stone. The Pope and his bishops and cardinals were the upper millstone. He then went on and denounced the Pope, and the doctrine of the Pope's supremacy, and told how their power was to be shivered in pieces throughout the kingdom.  He alluded to the late execution, and, pointing towards London Bridge, exclaimed, "So all Popish traitors shall perish, and their heads be stuck up yonder for ravens to pick at."  He alluded to the trial which was to take place to-morrow, when treason again was to be crushed and given to destruction. Then he launched forth on the King's supremacy, made an apotheosis to, the King. himself, who was like the sun shining in his strength, eulogized the new Queen, and came at length to the other mill- &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7721-00000023"/> 36        THE EXILE.         -   i stone, the nether one, on which the devil was seeking to crush the Church of God. This was none other than Lollardism, which denied the doc- trine of transubstantiation, and brought in other damnable heresies. And here he turned to the live specimens before him, and vociferated abundance of pious exhortation, telling them that the fagot- fires, from which their present confession and pen- ance had saved them, would be lighted up with a hotter blaze if they should relapse, and were only the faintest prefiguration of the fires of hell. His face grew red, and his eyes grew big with his ex- hortation; which being over, the Lollards were con- ducted back through the Strand, and thence to Lambeth, a rabble of boys and fishmongers follow- ing with hootings and jeerings. What impression Richard got from the morning service we need not stop to describe. We presume it did not alter the imprestion already recorded, that man was the chief blot which God had made on the face of his works, But he had not yet enjoyed to the full the privileges of a Sabbath in London. He sought again in the afternoon the spot where the day had dawned upon him, amlid the sweet in- fluences from skies and waters. The old trees on the Strand again welcomed him into their embow- ering shade, as if opening to him a sympathizing refuge from human heartlessness and cruelty. The outlook towards the Thames presented the same range of objects, though not bathed in the rory freshness of the morning. The clouds had all gone up from the Surrey hills, and the glare of the sun   SUNDAY IN LONDON. lay upon them; the bosom of the Thames was covered with boats and barges, crossing to and fio  between the .city and the Southwark side, and the breeze came up tired from the water's edge, and languidly made ripples through the leaves. But his eye need not-wander a great way to distinguish still a new feature of the' London Sabbath. In the wide open space back of St. Clement's Inn, then partly filled up with sedges and bushes, was one of those enclosures called a bear-garden.  And farther eastward, and in sight of the spot " where the tall May-pole once o'erlooked the Strand," was another spot dedicated to theatrical exhibitions, ere yet Shakespeare had raised them up and trans- figured them by the touch of genius. But nearer than these, and now right under the eye of our stranger in London, was the celebrated bear-house, with its enclosure, which lay on the other side of the Strand and down among the terraced gardens that descended to the Thames. Here it was that Queen Elizabeth took Mary, her sister, that she. might be edified by the sports of bear-baiting, some years later than those of which we write. The rule was, not that the bear-gardens should be opened all days in the week, Sundays excepted, but that they should not be open any day in the week except Sundays; though the rule came at length to be violated, when the sports were thought to be too good for the Sundays to monopolize.* So   Old Cartwright, in one of his tracts, adduces an original and quite curious argument against the use of a liturgy.

It is now past one o'clock, and the flags from the theatres and bear-gardens are all displayed, in sign that the sport is commencing. As the subject of our story is looking on, the flag from the bear- house by the Thames, under his eye, is flouted by the same breeze that comes up to stir the green leaves'over his head, and the shout and the tumult come up very distinctly to his ear. The exercises in a bear-garden were something after this fashion. The bear is hoodwinked and placed in the centre of the enclosure; a dense ring is formed around him, armed with whips and cudgels; with these the animal is beaten and lacerated, till, stung and maddened with    the pain, he rushes blindly among his tormentors, gnashing upon them with his teeth, sometimes seizing their weapons, and splintering them .between his jaws; the tor-     i mentors meanwhile dexterously eluding him, and sending shouts and peals of laughter to the welkin at every skilful turning and doubling, until the ani- mal is either worried out or worried to death, and ends the sport. If a bear is not to be had, a harm- less ape is made to supply his place, or some- times a brace of cocks, when " cocking," instead of baiting, closes the exercises of holy time. These amusements served pretty well to feed the tastes over it, that the Divine service may give place to the games that suc- L ceed it, which it seems had greater attraction both to priest and peo- ple than the service itself. It would be difficult to show how an ex- temporaneous service would secure its prolongation. The games formed the common finale to a London Sabbath, down to a period much later than 1535.

Tower Hill, or roasting Lollards in Smith- field Square; or, in the imagery of our morning ser- mon, breaking in pieces the upper and nether stones of the devil's grist-mill. Richard had not more than half digested the morning sermon, musing on the probable event of the morrow, his thoughts making quick journeys to Colchester and back again, and anon looking heav- enward for guidance through the gloomy future, when the roar of voices came up from the bear- garden, mingling with the breezy murmur of the Thames. He heard it for some time, growing louder and more tumultuous; saw the red flag streaming from the bear-house, the sun still shining, and the sky overhead looking softly blue, and the hills of Surrey in the mellowing distance looking softly green. Sick at heart, he sprang to his feet, perhaps with the expression on his lips that he put into his diary, "O God! why hast thou made man the sole blot on thy beautiful works?" and walked with a rapid pace down the Strand. An old face had risen before him again; the face of the. Bishop -of Rochester, melting through the mists and clouds of past memories fresh and be- nignant as when it watched over his boyhood in the Kentish vales; and his feet went of their own will towards London Bridge and Traitor's Tower. "Perhaps it will speak," he might have said to him- self, "when the lips of the living speak flatteries and lies." Streams of foot-passengers were still  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7721-00000025"/> 40        THE EXILE. pouring over the bridge, stopping at Traitor's Tower and gazing upward. And there it was again! that saintly face, growing more fresh every day, and com- ing back to its manly beauty, while the horrible vis- ages around it were growing blacker and blacker. There it was again, looking a benediction on the people below, turned still towards the beloved hills of Kent to give the last blessing to its ancient charge, and demanding for this very purpose im- munity from the claiming grave. And it spake! Several people heard it speak. Richard Sayer de- clared he heard it, and could tell what it said, -for the valley, of the Medway swam visible before him, the walls of the old Rochester cathedral, with its groined roof, were around and above him; the tones of the old organ came pealing loud and quivering down all the aisles; and then a heavenly counte- nance was leaning over the chancel, and holy . hands were laid upon his head, and these words came clear and articulate' "Whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him shall the Son of Man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels." And then the vision passed away, all but that saintly face, still looking fresh and meek as ever from among the blackening Visages, and he wtas gazing into it. Those words must have dropped down from Traitor's Tower.   CHAPTER    VI. THE TRIAL. AFFAIRS were hastening to their crisis. The man onewhose fate the nation seemed for a moment -to hang breathless had been lying' fourteen months in the 'rower. He had, held the highest judicial office in the realm, but he saw that Henry meant to use him and his office to pander to his lusts; he would not be so used, and resigned. For a little while he was suffered to remain in quiet at his home in Chel- sea, just above London, where, amid the charms of domestic society and the songs of his robins, he gave himself up to elegant and delightful studies. The oath was at length tendered him by Cranmer; he would not sign it, and was cast into the Tower. Through these fourteen months he had had abun- dant leisure-to count the cost of incorruptible integ- rity, and weigh a good conscience against the dross of earth. From his prison window he could look down into the green yard around the White Tower, and see the spot where Richard sent out Hastings to execution, and where the blood of innocence and beauty was to be poured out profusely, till the grass 4  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7721-00000026"/> 42        TIE EXILE. refused to grow. More had been plied with threats and blandishments, and though he never wavered, his language at the terrible crisis shows the strug- gle in his breast. His wife came to see him. She could not understand the sublime elevation on which he stood. "What the goodyear, Mr. More! I mar- vel that you, who have hitherto been taken for a wise man, will now so play the fool as to lie here in this close, filthy prison, shut up with mice and rats. Do as the bishops and best learned of the realm have done, and come home to your wife and chil- dren." This did not disturb his equable and di- vine patience. But when his favorite daughter, his "dear Meg," wrote him, and urged him to sub-  scribe, it cut him to the heart.. He sent for her, and she came to his prison. There he tried to make her understand how contemptible were disgrace, suffer- i- ing, and death, when set off against the glory of in- corruptible integrity, the sweet peace of conscience,  and the smile of God. Just then some monks were carried by to execution for the same crime as that  of which he stood accused. He took her by the hand and led her to the window. "See there, Meg! See how gayly as a bridegroom those men are going to their death." He succeeded in infusing his own spirit into the mind of his daughter, and making her to share his lofty magnanimity. The 1st of July has at length come. A special commission is appointed for the trial at Westmin-  ster Hall.

They have clothed him in a coarse sack, as a mark of disgrace. They have starved him so long in prison that he walks with difficulty. They dread his learning and eloquence, and they mean so to crush him beforehand that he cannot use his masterly powers, The vast space of Westminster Hall is crowded with spectators, and presents a sea of anxious faces. "Will he make out a defence that will stand with one of Audley's juries?" is a question on which dread alternatives are poised and trembling. The river has been' alive all the morn- ing with the barges of noblemen rowing towards Westminster, and crowds of poor people, to whom More when Chancellor had dispensed justice tem- pered with mercy, have packed the galleries, and are looking down with agonized features. Within the bar sits Lawyer Leach, with his glistering head and his cucumber coolness, and not far off stands his client, watching the prisoner with as deep emotion as if his own life were hanging on the issue, as in- deed he thinks it is. On the bench--that same bench where More had administered justice so im- partially- sits the base, the venal, the cringing Audley, a man who has grown fat on confiscations of which he was the tool, and who is ready, like a hound, either to follow the scent of blood, or to fawn upon and lick the hand of his master. But his person and appearance are commanding, and we see nothing at first to indicate his baseness except the cat-like softness of his manners. Close by his side sits the Chief Justice of the King's Bench, Sir John Fitzjames, early distinguished for his buffoon-  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7721-00000027"/> "       THE EXILE. ery and his ignorance of law, and promoted for his pliancy in the dirty work which tyrants have to be done. There stands at the bar Sir Christopher Hale, the Attorney-General, who has some dignity of char- acter, and maintains a show of candor. Associated with him is Mr. Solicitor, the low-browed Rich, with his large, animal mouth, and his eye bloodshot with ' dagger-ale," -the schoolboy companion of More, who early separated from him because baseness and virtue are repellent forces. There sit the jury, packed and overawed, giving small hope that they are the stuff that a bulwark can be made of to stop the sanguinary flood that is already on the flow.  The case opens, and the indictment is read. It is  long, but the gist of it is that More has, first, refused to acknowledge the King's supremacy, and, second- ly, that he has denied it. After the indictment is read, Audley bends to- wards the prisoner with a feline courtesy. "You see how grievously you have offended his Majesty. Yet he is so merciful, that, if you will lay away your  obstinacy, and change your opinion, we hope you  may obtain pardon."         ; "Most noble Lord," replies the prisoner, "I be- seech Almighty God that I may continue in the mind I am in through his grace unto death." The case proceeds, the witnesses are brought on; the lawyers and judges together think the case is  made out, and Audley with a smirking grace asks his prisoner if he has anything to say. ;'    i More now stands up, and leans upon his staff;  his features are pale and prison-wrorn, but there is I   THE TRIAL.        45 still the twinkling drollery in the curves about his eye, as if he were looking through and laughing to scorn the web-work of sophistry which the lawyers have put together. As he rises, all murmurs cease in the crowd, and Westminster Hall in its remotest corner is silent as death. As soon as he opens his lips, his learning and genius blaze forth in their mild and beautiful splendor. Seeing how weak and pale he is, they offer him a chair, and permit him to sit while making his defence. And there he sits, and quietly riddles in pieces their fabric of accusation and testimony, sometimes with a sparkle of wit, but in a light so broad and luminous that the judges themselves are ashamed of the'case. He quietly reminds them that no evidence has been introduced to show a denial of the King's supremacy. Here Rich interrupts him with a coarse violence in his manner. We have your silence, which is an evident sign of a malicious mind." "Qui' tacet consentire videtur," says More, quot- ing a maxim of law. "He that holdeth his tongue is taken to consent." A laugh runs round the inside of the bar, and Lawyer Leach squints his left eye, and looks to- wards his client, whose courage is rising high as he hears the illustrious prisoner bringing out the point that Leach had before made, and bringing it out with a clearness that tells evidently on the court and the jury. More has closed his defence, and the judges look aghast at each other.

More has     . been wiser than Fisher was. When the mousers purred around him to tempt the treason out of him, he saw through them and guarded his lips, and now all that they can prove is-silence. His defence is  complete, and he has carried the whole audience, --the servile court, packed jury, and all. There is a buzz all over the house, every man looking into his neighbor's face and breathing easy, Lawyer Leach and his client looking wise at each  S other. The court and the crown lawyers fall to a consultation; Audley's head is bent close up to the empty head of Fitzjames. Hale is in as close a conference with Rich as he well can be without    taking too much the fumes of the last debauch. But the buzz stops. Rich has taken the witness stand.  Blood must be had at some rate, and Mr. Solicitor volunteers to perjure himself. He swears that he actually heard the prisoner deny the King's spiritual supremacy when on a visit to him in the Tower.                       i More turns upon the miscreant his pale, honest  L face, and bends upon him the clear gaze of his eye, i and administers to him a rebuke which must have  I rung through his conscience if he had one, and which at any rate. has set him up in the pillory of H infamy for all time. The prisoner's form and fea- .Ai tures dilated into a moral dignity that looked down ! upon the cringing court, and made everybody forget his squalid apparel in the outheaming majesty of   a the man.    THE TRIAL.       47 "If I were a man, my Lords, that did not regard an oath, I needed-not at this time and in this place, as is well known to every one, to stand an accused person. And if this oath, Mr. Rich, which you have taken be true, then I pray that I never see i God in the face, which I would not say were it otherwise to gain the whole world." The prisoner goes on and narrates the conversa- tion that did take place in the Tower, and then, turn- ing round to the false swearer, who dares not meet his eye, - "In good faith, Mr. Rich, I am sorry for your perjury more than for mine ow'n peril. We know, Sir, that neither I nor any man else ever took youi to be a man of, such credit as to communicate to you any matter of importance. You well know that I have been acquainted with your manner of life and conversation a long space, even from my youth up; for we dwelt long in one parish, where, as you can tell yourself, you were esteemed a dicer and a gamester and light of tongue. And your fame is not very commendable in the Temple or the Inn where you belonged." Then turning to the court, -"Does it seem likely to your honorable Lordships that I would trust to this man, reputed of so little truth and hon- esty, the -secrets of my conscience? I refer it to your judgments, my Lords, whether the thing is credible." The address produces a profound impression on the by-standers and on the packed jury.

They obey. In about a quarter of an hour they come in with "GUILTY," and a half-smothered groan goes round the galleries of Westminster Hll. All is lost. The barrier of " twelve good men and true " is as unsubstantial as last night's dream, and the tide of blood must roll on and roll over us. Audley hastens to pronounce sentence. "Wait, my Lords," says the prisoner. "When I was toward the law, the prisoner was asked be- fore sentence what he had to say." "4 true," said Audley, stammering, and blush- ing crimson. "What have you to say why sen- tence of death should not be pronounced?" More now goes on and arraigns the statute, and denies the power of Parliament to pass it. The thing is monstrous in itself, and it is an anomaly in the whole constitutional history of the realm. The Parliament have no more power to make the King head of the Church than they have to vote God out of the universe; and having no constitutional power to make this statute, all indictments under it are worthless as a straw. Audley is nonplussed again, for he knows all this to be true. But he has a resource. The blockhead judge who sits beside him does not know it. Legal asses are mighty convenient things on which to :  i saddle a  false decision.    :1: "What say you, my Lord Chief Justice?" says  Audley, bending, towards Fitzjames and purring   I Fitzjames, C.

He then pronounces the terrible sentence upon the prisoner, concluding with ordering his four quar- ters to be set over four gates of the city and his head upon London Bridge. "Have you anything more to say?" says the velvet-faced Auddley, bending forward. "This further only have I to say, my Lords: that like as the blessed Apostle Paul was present and consenting to the death of the protomartyr Stephen, keeping their clothes that stoned him to death, and yet they be now twain holy saints in heaven, so I heartily pray, that, though your Honors have been on earth my judges to condemnation, we may hereafter meet merrily in heaven together.

THEY were to go back by water to the Tower, and the barge was waiting at the wherry. They led the prisoner out through the crowd, the heads- man's axe being borne before him with the edge turned towards him, on which Fisher's blood was yet fresh. As he walked out of the hall, he was heard to say, "Thank God, I have got the victory!" They did not know what he meant. But he meant the victory of his virtue and innocence over temp- tation; he felt now that they were safe, and it was this thought which at that awful moment turned his pure breast into a fountain of joy. What a scene was that! More walking in triumph before that fatal axe,  himself the only happy man in the ghastly proces- sion! The barge receives them, and bears them along  the silent highway; just as the evening sun is play- ing on the turrets of the Tower. There is a crowd around Traitor's Gate; people have gathered here to look a farewell into the most honest face in all England. He has walked up the stairs, the bloody axe moving close before him. A woman springs   FAITHFUL MEG.-       51 from the crowd, breaks through the guard, spite of their rods and halberds, and locks her arms around the prisoner's neck, and shrieks, "My father! O my father!" It is faithful Meg, and she buries her face in the prisoner's bosom and sobs aloud. He soothes her grief,. and gently pours consolation into her breaking heart, the officials standing still, aad not daring to disturb the holy scene. She breaks away and retreats; looks back, and runs again and hangs on the devoted neck, when the prisoner for the first time is overcome, and weeps like a little child. Even those rough men have to let go their halberds, and wipe from their iron features the trick- ling tears. But Traitor's Gate is open; the jaws of the great structure have closed upon the prisoner, and we cannot follow him any farther. Along with faithful Meg, we take a farewell look of a man who, amid general servility, saw clearly the supreme and all- beautiful law, and obeyed it,- a man whose virtue no interest could bribe, and whose purpose no thun- ders could shake; who had an angel's strength and a child's simplicity; whose affections were gentle as the evening, and whose breast was purer than snow. .  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7721-00000031"/> CHAPTER    VIII.

"Yes, a justice is to come down before long to administer the oath. Perhaps you will find when you get into Essex that the net has gathered you in already." Richard looked up his groom, and ordered him to have the horses ready in the morning. He retired to sleep; but whenever he closed his eyes, the faces in Westminster Hall were before him. Once and again he drove them away into the darkness; but slowly they. would take shape and come up, up, up, and glow with a phosphorescent light, as dis- tinct and bright as evdr. , But he kept dashing them off, till finally they all vanished but two. One was a pale face, with a mild, clear eye, arched round with curves that twinkled and beamed with benevo. lence and humor; but the curves came and went in wavy lines, till they fixed themselves into a look of meek but indescribable anguish. The other was a great red face, with bull's eyes and a large mouth; and the eyes sometimes rolled with a demoniac mirthfulness, and the mouth grinned into a sardonic laugh. These two faces would not down except to come back again, and the first half of the night was spent dashing them off into chaos, and seeing them slowly rise out of it, and come up, up, up, as near and as bright as ever. But sleep of a certain kind came at last, and might have continued for a long time. But some- body has walked into his chamber, somebody's hand 5*  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7721-00000032"/> 54           THE EX-ILE. $  is on his shoulder, shaking him    up; he opens his eyes, arid the broad sunlight is in the room, and a large face of real flesh and blood,.but full of human sunshine, is bent over him.   It is Job, of whom   the reader will know more. "Master Richard, it is late, and the horses are ready."              l "Never mind, Job.    We won't hurry, and I shall go. over to the Bridge before we start."i To the Bridge he goes, drawn by the strange fas- cination of the face on Traitor's Tower, into which he looks for the last time.   There it stands again, benignant as ever, coming back every day to the manly bloom and comeliness of which age -had be- reft it; sending down its benediction on the passers- by, who still throng thither to receive it.'  But while he is looking up, the "King's Barge"' is announced as in sight; and there it is! coming up the river , The following is the curious account of this prodigy, as given by Hall, the biographer of Fisher: - "The head, being parboiled, was prickt upon a pole, and set on high upon London Bridge, among the rest of the holy Carthusians' heads that suffered death lately before him; and here I cannot omit to de- clare to you the miraculous sight of this head, which, after it had stood up the space of fourteen days upon the bridge, could not be perceived to waste or consume, neither for the weather which was then very hot, neither for the parboiling in hot water, but grew daily fresher and fresher, so that in his life he never looked so well; for his cheeks be- ing beautiful with a comely red, the face looked as though it had be- holden the* people in passing by, and would have spoken to them. Wherefore the people coming daily to see this strange sight, the pas- sage over the bridge was so stopped with the going and coming, that almost neither cart nor horse could pass; and therefore at the end of fourteen days -the executioner'was ordered to throw down the head in the night-time into, the Thames."

In these times the Thames was the principal means of Communication between the different parts of London, and between London and the sub- urbs up and down the river. The finest streets in the city were those which ran along the water's side, where a long row of splendid mansions and palaces had arisen, and where, instead of his stables, his horses and carriages, every nobleman had his barge and bargemen, his wharf and wherry: The sight of the Thames of a summer's day was therefore wonderfully lively and picturesque, bearing my lords and ladies from house to house, to the after- noon's dance. or masquerade, the bargemen perhaps keeping time with their oars to music and song. This too was the royal road from-Greenwich to Whitehall, and the royal barge was known at sight by its streamers and decorations., Traitor's Tower stood on one of the piers that supported the draw- bridge, so that passengers up and down the river might have all the benefit of the spectacle, and sail right under the blackening visages above. The royal barge is nearing the bridge, and the crowd of gazers who are choking the street at Traitor's Tower have their attention drawn away, and the sea of heads is instantly uncovered. And here for the first time the hero of our narrative gets sight of the "Supreme Head of the Church," to whose features Holbein himself found it pretty hard to give a flattering touch.'

Passing through the draw, he looks up at the seven days' wonder which has kept the whole city astir for a week or more, and on account of which the Privy Council have once been summoned together. Mis dull, red, rheumy eye, his cheeks bloat- ed and hanging, and blotched with scrofula, reveal nothing of superstitious wonder, but enough of lust, beastliness, and gluttony to make one marvel how there could be so much room for the demon where there was so much of the brute. The- " new He- rodias " was there also, invested with all the inter- est of recent maternity.

TO COLCHESTER.            i  JOB was waiting with the horses. They mount   r and pass Temple Bar into Fleet Street, thence   ! down the Old Bailey, cross over Smithfield Square, turn and look at the spot in the centre burnt black with roasted Lollards, shudder and cross over into Bishopgate Street, and the city is soon behind them, with its death's-heads, and, what is worse, its visages of unmerciful men. Its distracting noises have all died in the distance; it is folded into its own fog and smoke, its blood and sin, and the broad, open fields of Essex are before them, fanned with buxom air. It is time the reader knew something of Job. Retiring as he is in his habits, we shall not get on any longer without his company, which will be found of considerable importance to at least three individuals. Job -was an heirloom in the Sayer family, and now filled the offices of porter and chief butler, besides being superintendent of things in general. Where there was any matter that required great carefulness and perfect trust, Job was always   TO COLCHESTER.      59 in request. If anybody was sick, Job was the chief nurse; and he had closed the dying eyes of at least four members of the family. He was verging now towards his seventieth year, but he was hale as ever; his hair of iron-gray stood up stiff on the top of his head, which gave him an independent and sturdy look, and, though age had abstracted something from his once florid countenance, yet the, ruddy clover had retreated to the centre of his cheek, where it blossomed out fresh as ever, from amid the encroaching snows of threescore and ten. His rather bluff and granitic exterior might conceal from a stranger the rills of tenderness that were always trickling down his heart, unless indeed they brimmed over in his eyes-and adown the clover of his cheeks, which they were rather apt to do. Within his jo- vial and sunny nature there was a vein of plaintive tunefulness, which, in the long leisure hours of the porter's lodge, found scope and exercise in hum- ming snatches of old song. Along with this he had a keen sense of 'the ludicrous, and a broad and, never-failing good-humor, and if he looked upon other people's faults and blunders with other feel- ings .than commiseration, it was only that he might distil out of them a little amusement for himself. Job for a great many years had belonged to the tenantry of the Sayer estates; but the cloud came over his household from which the bolt of death had dropped four times into his family, and his wife and three out of his four children had slept for years together in a humble corner of the village  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7721-00000035"/> 60        THE EXILE. churchyard. But fortune had left him that untold and priceless treasure, whether of the poor man's  cot or the rich man's hall, an only daughter. His dear Charlotte had not quite left him so long as he had her miniature in little Lottie. Lottie had now largely developed into the woman; but to her father she was always a child, for she still sat upon his knee, smoothed his brow, and kept the wrinkles from gathering there; laid her warm, dimpled cheek upon his to keep the clover-blossom fresh; listened i to his songs, and sung them after him with a twinkling humor and drollery in the eye which she must have caught from him; -printed every evening her fervent kiss upon his forehead, and gave him her loving "Good night"; became to -him all his other children in one, while he was to her father and mother and sister and brother; so that Job's af- fections were preserved young and healthful, and  bloomed under the snows of age like an everlasting rose. Job and Lottie had been domesticated in the   i family of Richard ever since his marriage; she was the favorite maid of her mistress, and had become i indispensable to her comfort. * If the glooms ever  gathered about the kitchen, they were sure to get  dissipated, either by Job's songs, or by the laughter  in the dimpling cheeks of Lottie, or the broad beam-  ings of her mirthful nature. And if there is sun-  shine in the kitchen, then, so far as our experience ,goes, it is apt to pervade the whole house, from cellar to attic. So much, for the present, of Job and Lottie, of whom perhaps we shall hearagain when we get to Colchester.   TO COLCHESTER.       61 Pleasant enough. it was to look over the broad, level fields of Essex, where the sturdy yeomen were 'busy with their summer labors, and sweet was the breeze that came from the hay-fields to fan the faces of the travellers. But our two travellers, though! jogging along side by side, have not precisely the same reflections. We are apt to suppose that martyrs are composed of different stuff from other people; that God has them on hand ready made, and that it costs them no great effort to suffer and die. Alas! the long, deep, and silent agony, more terrible than death, the desperate grapplings and wrestlings that precede victory, we do not know ; and the reason why death at last is met so serenely is, that the martyr comes to it out of a more dreadful anguish. The scene of Gethsemane comes first, and O the agony till its victory is accomplished! The struggle had been growing more and more desperate in the mind of Richard, and now it is upon him in its desperate energy. "After all," he says to himself, "the lawyer is right. Who am I, to stand up alone against the opinions of all mankind? I begin to see clearly the distinction between the res in animno and the res gesta. We must conform outwardly to such times as these, and let God's great truth retreat far into the silent recesses of our thoughts, and there be kept safe and bide its time. Am I the man to stand out when all the bishops and lords have given in? Those that comply with the powers that be, and the necessities of to-day, are blest and sniled upon, 6  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7721-00000036"/> 62        THE EXILE. and come to honor and length of days. Does God ask his faithful ones to burn with Lollards and her- etics, when a single thunderbolt of his could give them the victory?" And then there was a lower deep. '"After all, what are virtue and integrity but a name? Other people act according to their self- interest, and why should not I? This servility, that has come over the nation like a flood, bears all with it, except a few crazy people like the Maid of Kent and John Lambert. Christianity has been preached  [ in this island now five hundred years, in all the churches and convents, and yet it is a thing which the King can turn and fashion into whatever he pleases. The King? No, not the King, but Nan Boleyn, or any vile woman he happens to lust for. Protestantism! Catholicism! one or the other, through all this realm, from bishops down to chim- ney-sweeps, according to the notions of the King's mistress! And that is religion, and that is con- science, - a name and a sound!"          [ And there was a lower deep still. "It is all, then, a cheat and a mockery! There   is nothing real and substantial but beef and mut- i ton and ale! The providence that rules in human  I affairs is the royal concubine, and the God we trusted in can be voted out of the state by the Par- 1 liament of a glutton ling! It is a mere matter of forms and conveniences, and the name of God is nothing but a bughear for kings or popes, as the case may be, to scare human animals and keep them in the right enclosures."   TO COLCHESTER.       63 And then the sky above shut over him like a cov- er, and all was empty beyond. Beneath it the owls of Atheism hooted in mockery of human hopes. '( What we can see and touch and taste is, and that is all; and let us hasten to conform to it. We die to-morrow, and then we rot!  Over all graves alike the obscene birds scream and stretch their black wings, but there is no cheerful sound that comes from above them! No virtue, no religion, no God in this world, and we only animals, driven to the crib or to the shambles at the convenience of kings and popes! O, why was I born, or why did I not die, ere I found out that religion was a trick; that this whole word is a jail, and kings and priests are the jailers; that overhead there is nothing but a copper sky, and under foot nothing but graves!" There is something awful in the grief of manhood. Things are very much out of course when strong men weep. He tried to beckon off the giant shad- ows, but they came thicker and colder; he strug- gled against the might that was urging him down the abyss, but in vain; and his stout frame was' convulsed with the conflict, and the big tears found their way, at last, down his quivering features. Job had not spoken a word. He saw the conflict coming on, he guessed something of its nature, and that it was too terrible for his philosophy. With characteristic delicacy he retired from the scene of it. He reined in his horse and fell in the rear, rid- ing on in silence and awe. So they journeyed through the farms of Essex, jogging on at first in funereal mood. Green fields  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7721-00000037"/> T, T  EXILE.   -  and large farm-yards passed them, great barns open to receive their summer treasures, and neat houses looking through the cooling umbrage, as cheerfully as if they knew nothing of the sulphurous cloud resting on higher plades, from which the thunders were growling. Job began to prick up and sympa- thize with the scene he was passing through, and with the sounds of hale and cheerful industry that broke from the fields and from every side, uncon- scious of the reign of terror. He ventured, at length, into a hum-drum tune, though on a lower and more reverent key, as 'if afraid to disturb the awful strug- gle that was going on. Richard had not noticed the tuning of Job; but at length, in a short truce between his conflicts, the hum-drum emerged into clear, articulate song:-   " The cot is surer than the hall, In proof we daily see, For highest things doe soonest fall From their felicitie.   " When God drops down his thundering bolts Our vices to redresse, They batter down the highest holtes, But touch not once the lesse.   "O you may hear the pine to crack That bears his head so hie, And loftie lugs go then to wrack, Which seeme to touch the skie.  " When wrastling windes - hum - hum - hum --"   They had travelled all day, and the sun was wheel- ing down the horizon through a haze of bloody red, when the plaintive sound of a chapel-bell came     throbbing through the air. They reach the top of the hill and the monastery, is in sight. On one side of the building was a grove, in which were walks that led through green arcades to an oratory on the sum- mit of the hill; on the other side there was a large, open field, on which a herd of kine lay ruminating, grateful enough for the cool of the day. On one side of an open court was the refectory of the mon- astery, on the opposite side the chapel, and across the green that interspaced them the monks in their cowls were walking two and two, and entering the chapel at the sound of vespers. Richard woke sud- denly to a consciousness of where he was. The fields of Colchester were around him, for he had arrived at St. John's Abbey; he was in no mood to see his family, and he alighted, and giving the reins to Job, " Take home the horses. Tell the folks they will see me soon, and that I am well; but don't blab of my whereabouts." Job left his " Good night," and rode off droning to himself,   "' Every white will have its black, And every sweet its sour."   And Richard waited upon the chapel-green till ves- pers were over, and then threw himself into the arms of Father Bache.   &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7721-00000038"/> CHAPTER X. GHOSTLY COUNSEL. HENRY had already suppressed a portion of the monasteries, and doomed the rest. When uncov- ered to the light, they revealed frightful masses of corruption, that had passed into the stage of putres- cence; sensuality, laziness, and hypocrisy had got quiet lodgement within them. But this was not all. In times of public violence, persecution, and venali- ty, they had nourished the best virtue and the mos heavenly piety that could be found in the land. What pure mind has not sighed for such a retreat when sick of human selfishness, when society itself is falsely arranged and lies with a crushing weight on individual virtue,--when vice is hon- ored and rewarded, and honesty is in disgrace anid starves? Then away from the scene of cringing venality or outrageous oppression, to retire and contemplate the serene Almighty Justice and be caught up and rapt in its beautiful splendors! So at least many had done, and we are not sure even now that the monasteries had not their full share of the goodness that saved the world from becom- ing an abandoned Sodom of scoundrels.   GHOSTLY COUNSEL.       67 The monasteries in those days did the office of country inrns, and were always open to the weary traveller. But Richard had other reasons for stop- ping now. Father Bache was a noted character all the country round, - noted for his wisdom and fore- cast as well as his sympathizing benevolence. He had a seat in Parliament, moreover, and he knew pretty well the shape of the coming storm.* This was not the first time that Richard had thrown  himself upon his counsels. Slowly and demurely the monks are filing back after their evening orisons, when Richard watches for the benignant old man, and throws himself upon his bosom. He begins to state his troubles. "Say nothing, my son," said Father Bache. "Stone walls have ears in these times; and besides I know your whole case. Go in and refresh your- self, and then we will counsel together. Your heart and your flesh I see are both weary. After night- fall I will talk with you." Richard had eaten such fare as was placed be- fore him, and sat in the refectory looking out upon the green, till twilight had flung its last fading rose- colors over the earth and sky. Then Father Bache appeared before him, and beckoned him to follow. They walked out through a back door of the mon- astery, and were soon in a path that led through the grove on the brow of the hill.

They reached the oratory, which stood in an open space, when the old abbot laid his hand upon the shoulder of his guest and looked round. "Sit down, we are only heard here by God and good angels, and only watched by the holy stars." "Have you heard, Father, that More was con- victed and sentenced?" "Ihave not heard, but I knew he was to die." "And did you know that all the Catholics were subscribing the oath, and that Gardiner and all the bishops have temporized and given in?" "I knew that the evil day had come, and that God was about to purge his floor. What I want to say to you is, that a commissioner is coming shortly to Colchester, and that all your kinsfolk will subscribe the oath. You will be specially called upon, for you are suspected of contumacy, and Rich has you in his eye." "Well, 1 can't pretend to be better than the whole world, bishops and all the rest. To tell the truth, ! good Father, this universal servility oppresses me with terrible doubts, and spite of myself all confi- dence in God and man is gliding out of me. If we only knew of the blessed inheritance, we could die for it cheerfully. But this world seems to -me nothing but a chaos, and human virtue nothing but a  name."   XI         G IGOSTLY COUNSEL.      69 "My son," said the old man, his features- kind. ling with prophetic fire, " you are young and I am old. I have passed through many a crisis like yours, and many a time have I wrestled like Jacob with the Lord, and prevailed. You stand now right at the point where the road parts into two ways, and I will tell you just where each will lead you. Subscribe, as all your kinsfolk will, and you will have your reward. You will have large estates, friends, honors; the sense of perjury will not trouble you a great while; you will wax fat and gross, and live long, and the world will envy your success. You can refuse to subscribe; and that way lie loss of friends, a father's curse, prisons, exile, pri- vations, death,--death on the block it may be, -or what is worse, death in small doses, the cup drained drop by drop to the bitter dregs. But that way too there is a vision of the opening and enclos- ing heavens, and a growing consciousness of the- Great Presence which comes like another sun.

"Ah! but you must pay the price of it. It is the great reward of self-sacrifice. It comes after the sacrifice, not before." "And has it come to you at last, good Fa- ther?

Not three days ago I was praying herel under the midnight stars, and it seemed to me that my inmost spirit lay open and naked under celes-  tial things. The heavenly world was imaged so brightly on my spirit, that I thought I could see the i future in the present, and I know that my days are numbered, and that my enemies will quarter this body and give it to the fowls of the air. But I have lived so much out of the body, that I can  look down upon it as if I had already left it, and were within the enfolding heavens." The moon shone over the rapt features of the old abbot, tinging his locks with a more brilliant- silver, and he seemed almost free of the body and full. of immortality,--a living and tangible evidence of the realities of another world. As they walked slowly towards the monastery, he leaned on the arm of his guest, and discoursed to him of the aspect of affairs, seeming to look down through the future as one not of this world, but already out of it and above it, and surveying its fore and after scenes as 1 one traces from some mountain height the windings of a river below. There was a prophet tone in his speech, and Richard listened with awe. Arriving at the monastery, they passed through the docu- torium," where the abbot gave his guest his good - night and his blessing, as the latter went into his ; room  in the dormitory.

Richard left the door ajar as he retired, and, lying upon his pillow, gazed upon the first-named picture, as the pale moo'nlight- rested upon it and retouched the features that seemed aglow with the beamings of a divine and majestic patience. And when he closed his eyes at last, the face seen on Traitor's Tower was before him, and beyond that long files of other-faces,--of those who had come out of great tribulation, but who now wore crowns and held palms in their hands, -files that grew brighter as they ascended far aw'y to where they ended with a brow bleeding and crowned with thorns; but the thorns changed into radiating sunbeams, whose pencillings darted down over all the rest; and then the- words that dropped from the Traitor's Tower were audible again. Gradually the faces grew dim, and more dim; the radiating thorns have melted away, and the tempted man is in profound sleep at last.  There is music somewhere.   He comes back gradually to his outward senses. The morning light is resting on the picture of Christ in the locutory. The monks are at their matins. Richard rises and dresses himself in haste, and passes though the court into the chapel, The monks are assembled.  The old abbot is on the right side of the " choir " with his moiety of monks, and the prior is on the left with his moiety, and d -  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7721-00000041"/> 72      .  THE EXILE. they are chanting their responsals. It is a place calculated to inspire devotion. Beneath the mosaic floor, with its mural monuments, the sainted dead are in their last holy repose. Back of the high altar is a picture of Christ in his last agony. In one of the transepts is a shrine of the patron saint enriched with various offerings, and in a niche above it is an exquisite sculpture of St. John done by Italian masters, whose mouth and lips have an infantile sweetness and almost womanly tenderness, and whose higher features seem radiant with visions of eternal things. The prayers and responsals be- ing over, the monks, led by the abbot and prior, walk two and two, kneel in turn at'the shrine of St. John, and pass into the court, followed by our wayfaring traveller. There he greets warmly the old abbot, and embraces him as if taking his leave. "Nay," said the abbot, " you are not going this morning. You are to stay here for a few days, and let the storm reach Colchester before you. It will be there soon, for a commissioner will go down to-morrow.  Wait the order of events a little, and shape your course by them You are running right into the lion's jaws if you go now." Richard tarried a few days at the monastery, drink- ing in the old abbot's counsels, walking with him through the long avenues of oak and chestnut, and discoursing on the highest themes under their sooth- ing shades, seeming to himself to have come to an islet of peace that reposed in an angry sea, but where the noise of the billows is only heard as far off and dreamy murmurs.              .   ?:          GHOSTLY COUNSEL.      73 One sweet and quiet morning, when it seemed , ; A as if there could be no more storms in the whole -   beautiful world, he knelt and prayed for the last fi-: time before the Divine Sufferer on the canvas of !d:  Raphael, and took his leave of the kind-hearted old a man.

IF the reader will pause with us here a moment, we shall learn at one glance the precise state of things at what is usually regarded the dawn of the English Reformation." And in order to this there are three or four faces which will come up, and which we must take a look at as they pass by us. Writers of history generally give us the impres- sion, that at this era there were only two parties struggling for supremacy, the Catholic and the Protestant. That certainly is a mistake. There was a third party, and a very important one, which at this time figures largely in the history of Eng- land. They were those who held Roman Catholic opinions entire, the mass, auricular confession, consubstantiation, clerical celibacy, purgatory, saint- worship, rmasses for the dead,-but who had re- nounced the Pope and taken Henry for their head. These men an. elegant female writer terms Henri- cans, for want of a better name. They were men who adhered to the reigning power through thick and thin, and did all its behests, partly from that   I -3-        PORTRATTS.       75 brute conservatism that dreads the spontaneous movements of the human mind as tending to an- i   archy, arid partly because place and patronage lay in the path of conformity. From these three ten- dencies of opinion, Protestant, Roman, and Henri- can, thus early and distinctly marked, the three divisions were ultimately developed of Dissenters, Catholics, and Church-of-England-men. -- First and chief among the Henricans stood STE- PHEN GARDINER, a man of rare talents and energies, an able financier, and of large and statesmanlike abilities. He was a member of the King's Privy Council. He held implicitly all the doctrines of the Papacy, while he rejected the Pope's authority, and wrote against it. He was zealous in carrying out all the measures of the Henrican Church, and estab- lishing and consolidating its authority. He joined hands with Cranmer in divorcing the King from his first and excellent queen; and when his last queen, the gentle. Katharine Parr, who united in her person the rare accomplishments of the scholar, the sweet- est graces of the woman, and the adorning virtues- of the Christian, was suspected of holding Lutheran opinions, Gardiner exhausted all his infernal though baffled ingenuity to alienate the King from her, and :;  bring her down from the throne to a dishonored and bloody grave. His face by Holbein is before us. It has a bulldog's eye and a wolfish visage and a sinister expression, that warrant the remark com- mon with his contemporaries, that, "like Hebrew, he was to be read backward." It was said that he was not originally a bad man, nor void of natural  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7721-00000043"/> 761       THE EXILE. humanity. But it is the sure result with those who attempt-to execute or defend polluted law, that they become themselves polluted, and that the spirit of the law, with all its devils of cruelty, enters into them. Gardiner became a Catholic again in the reign of Mary, and her prime minister, renounced the doctrines of his book, "De Vera et Falsa Obe- dientia," and gratified to the full his bulldog pro- pensities by hunting down Protestant bishops and burning them in slow fires. There was a man by the name of THOMAS WRI- OTHESLEY, another minister of Henry and member of his Privy Council, a Henrican of the genuine stamp, and co-worker with Gardiner -" par nobile fratrum"-in snuffing a trail lfor human victims. He was a dry business man, hard and repulsive in his manners. Lord Campbell, in his Lives of the Chancellors, calls him " conscientious," which means, we suppose, that he was ever faithful to the head of his Church, and enforced all the measures of Henry and the laws of his Parliament with scru- pulous exactness. That was the creed which he never questioned; and the living hearts and shrink- ing nerves which he crushed and wrung in enfor- cing it upon others, were things with which he had nothing to do; or rather they gave zest to the work of hunting down men and women, just as the flutter- ings of the bird give zest to the sport of the fowler. Katharine Howard, the King's fifth queen, was but just out of her girlhood when she was called .to share the tyrant's throne. Some indiscretions which she had fallen into when an unprotected orphan   PORTRAITS.       " girl, but which afterwards she had had the womanly virtue to forsake entirely, were dug up and brought to the hungry ears of Wriotnesley and Cranmer. Straightway they pursued the gentle and amiable woman with wily but determined cruelty, and were at last gratified. when her head rolled upon the scaffold, and her mangled body rested with other victims under the floors of St. Peter's Chapel with- in the Tower. There was a noble lady by the name of Ann Ascew, who had been driven from her house by her Papist husband. Her beauty was the least of her adornments, for she had the graces of learning and piety. She was one of the maids of honor to Katharine Parr, but she did not believe the most essential article in the Church which King Henry was setting up, -the presence of Christ's body in the Eucharist. "Do you believe that the priest has power to change the bread into the body of the Lord?" "Verily," said she, "I have read that God made man, but I never have read that man can make God." She was sent to the Tower, and Wriothesley and Rich thought they could wring something from her which could be turned into evidence against her mis- tress, the Queen. They ordered Sir Anthony Kny- vet, the keeper, to put her to the rack. He obeyed, the miscreants standing and looking on. But the gentle martyr would disclose nothing, when they ordered Knyvet to give the rack another turn. He refused. Rich and Wriothesley threw off their 7* [   &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7721-00000044"/> 78         THE EXILE. cloaks and seized hold of the infernal -machine, which they turned till the tender frame that was stretched upon -it was dislocated and nearly plucked asunder. Knyvet fled appalled and indignant from the spectacle, to complain of it to the King; and even the royal butcher was shocked at the recital. This Wriothesley subsequently became Lord Chan- cellor. He was said to be constitutionally a kindly and humane man; and he furnishes yet another illustration of the fact, that cruel laws always de- monize the men who execute them. Holbein has not left us the picture of this man, but a contem-   ! porary poet has done it: - "From vile estate of base and low degree, By false deceit, by craft and subtle ways, - Of mischief mould and key of cruelty, Was crept full high, borne up by various stays, With ireful eye and glearing like a cat, Killing by spite whom he thought fit to hit."?'  Another of ithese Henricans and women-hunters was THOMAS CROMWELL, too well known in history      E to need any limning from us. He was Henry's pli- ant tool in all things, and though his private ten- dencies were towards Protestantism, yet he held his opinions as entirely ductile to the church and state policy of Henry. His case furnishes as terrible an instance of recoiling and retributive justice as can be found either in history or poetry. He compassed the death of Ann Boleyn, because his family was connected with Jane Seymour,w"ho was to succeed her. He compassed the death of Queen Katharine - .  . .  Cavendish. */S'    ,-   PORTRAITS.       79 Howard, because she was a Catholic; and he got the King married to Ann of Cleves, because she was a Protestant. Ann did not suit the royal Blue-Beard, and he swore vengeance upon the minister who had imposed her upon him. But before he had done with him, he made him drive through the Parliament a law authorizing the attainder and execution of persons charged with treason, without trial. This was done for the purpose of reaching the venerable and innocent Countess of Salisbury. But it so hap- pened that Cromwell was the first victim to the law which he had been the base instrument in bringing in,--not -a solitary instance of those who are plagued by their own " bloody instructions." He got the axe ready which was first to cut off his own head. At the time of which we write, Cromwell was the Vicar-General of England. RICHARD RICH, the crown lawyer and solicitor, the reader has already had a glimpse of, with his red face and drunken leer. He was a Henrican in the full sense of the word, his religion being always that of the government. We follow him afterwards into the reign of Edward, when av&amp;rice has become his ruling passion. Grown rich on confiscated estates and the price of blood, he becomes fearful of losing his own head between opposing factions, resigns office and retires to private life with a vision of the axe before his eyes, but finally dies a natural death with the blood of More unpurged from his soul.

Cranmer has been praised  X by Protestants as their sainted martyr, and honored ': as the father of the English Reformation. But   :: those unerring witnesses, the "state papers," are X likely to pluck away his honors. It is only by an abuse of language that we can call him a Reformer, 1 or even a Protestant. True, he held in his secret  e heart some of the principles of the Reformation, which were denied in his life and on his tongue .! whenever he thought his personal safety required it.

By him Katharine How-  :  ard, a woman to whom history has never yet been just, was inveigled into a confession under promise II of the King's pardon, and then sent to the block, a friendless girl, innocent of the crime charged against her, when there was not a man in the Council to   PORTRAITS.        81 bespeak for her a decent trial. When installed into the office of Archbishop, Cranmer swore to the Pope's supremacy in public, and made record in private that he meant to break his oath. After he had been condemned to death, he recanted his opin- ions under the promise of pardon; and so used had he been to paltering in a double sense, that they made h'n draw up six confessions before they could get one out of him which was not capable of con- tradictory interpretations. When he found at last, that he must burn at any rate, he recanted his re- cantation, and went to the stake, the only time he seems to have acted like a man. Notwithstanding his place in the calendar of Protestant saints, we can make nothing of him but a Henrican, a tool of the existing church power, furnishing another mel- ancholy instance how a really noble nature -for such his originally was --can have all its powers reversed, when it lends itself to unrighteous power, and is swept over by the spirit of polluted law. These were prominent among the men who un- der Henry founded a church, which was neither Pa- pal nor Protestant, and whose final creed determined in what were called 'THE Six BLOODY ARTICLES." These Articles were thoroughly Catholic, with the exception that Henry, instead of Clement, was made Pope, and his ministers, and not those of the Roman Pontiff, had all the diabolical pleasures of persecu- tion.' The Bloody Articles cut two ways,--upon * These Articles were as follows: - The first affirms the doctrine of transubstantiation. The second denies the necessity of communion in both kinds. The third affirms the doctrine of clerical celibacy.  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7721-00000046"/> 82        THE EXILE. Catholics for denying that Henry was the true Pope, and upon Protestants for denying the transubstan- tiation and its kindred dogmas. It would be unjust, however, to say that all the subscribers to the Bloody Articles were after the pattern of Wriothesley and Gardiner. There were a great many persons who stood on just this middle and transition ground. They did not believe in the Pope, and they dreaded Lutheranism and Lollard- ism as the upheaving of all authority, and leading to such irregularities as the Anabaptists were guilty of in Germany. It was an era of perplexing change, and these people clung to Henricism as the last stay against the total wreck of society. In this class, we suppose, the family of Richard Sayer was to be found. The Bloody Articles did not have the formal sanction of Parliament till 1538, though they were virtually in force at the time of More's execution. Who the commissioner was that came down to Essex as apostle of the Henrican Church, to swear in the people, to the true faith, we have no authen- tic record; but we infer from various hints that it was Wriothesley with his "glearing eye," which blasted whomsoever it fell upon. We will show the reader the work which was done, so far as our family history is concerned, and he will judge which of these select spirits of the Privy Council might best claim it as his own.

No persecution on record discloses such an appalling havoc of human life.   Most of these were in hum- ble circumstances, and if the secret story of all these sufferers could be unrolled, it would be a thrilling chapter in the history of earth's unrecorded martyrs. But History has been so busy with the crimes of courts, that she has never drawn the veil from   this lowly province of endurance and wrong.

But it must have been to a great extent in. consequence of religious animosities and persecutions. The dissolution of the monasteries made vast numbers of people homeless and destitute. Then homelessness and destitution were made capital crimes. Those who suffered directly for either Popery or Lollardism swelled the frightful number of victims.

RICHARD came away from the monastery marvel- lously refreshed. Faith in God and faith in virtue had somehow got completely strengthened and re- lumed. The owls of atheism had all flitted away, and left a clear and sunny'sky; 'and the last time he kneeled before Raphael's picture, it seemed to him that he was breathed upon by a whole army of martyrs. On the southern bank of the river Colne the ground swells into a considerable eminence, and on the northern side of this eminence lies the city of: Colchester. Commencing at the margin of the stream, it spreads along up the acclivity, street above street, till it finally crowns the top of the hill. On the continuous summit of this same hill, as it stretched along westward, lay the estate of Richard Sayer,- six miles out of the town, - and on it stood apart by itself, looking northward down into the "The ruins still remain. It had fish-ponds, dove-cots, extensive stables, and a rookery.  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7721-00000048"/> 86        THE EXILE. vales of the Colne, and southward, over an undu- lating prospect, into the fertile fields of Essex. The house, after the manner of country baronial houses, was a quadrangular structure around an inner court. Richard, in coming to it from Lon- don, did not pass through the town, but left the town upon his right,- a fortunate circumstance in the present instance. From the house down to the Colne the sloping fields were covered with crops of grass and grain, through which rolled the lazy and rustling billows under the summer wind. On both sides of the house, north and south, were terraced gardens, through which lay walks, some fringed with flowers, and some shaded with trees and shrubbery. The building fronted south, and was a tolerable specimen of the baronial mansion-houses in the times of the Tudors. At the middle of the south front was a great, well-timbered gate, that seldom grated on its hinges; but in this was formed a small wicket-gate, through which you look into the inner court, and by which you enter it. Passing through the wicket-gate, and turning to the right, you enter the porter's lodge, Job's head-quarters, and through that you pass into the dining-room. Or turning to the left, you enter the chapel, - for the old baronial lords did not often attend the parish church, - and thence you enter the drawing-room or largest parlor. These four rooms occupied the southern front of the quadrangular structure on the ground floor. The eastern side was occupied by an arcade, that, in summer, looked through open arches into a flower- garden, which arches in winter were closed up and   JOB IN TROUBLE.       87 glazed. On the west side was a great, gloomy hall, and on the north side was the immense kitchen, with its long oaken tables. We need not stop to describe the dormitories and chambers of the second floor, any further than to say that the " royal apart- mrients," so called, occupied the'south front over the gateway, the porter's lodge, and the drawing and dining rooms.  In the inner court, and near the centre of it, stood a massive stone figure of Her- cules, holding in one hand a club, that lay across his shoulders; the other resting on his hip, and dis- charging a perennial stream of water into a carved stone basin below.* Richard has walked over from the monastery, and arrived at his house with such feelings as the read- er, provided he has a wife and child, may imagine him to possess, after the scenes he has witnessed in London.  As he opens the wicket-gate into the open court, a boy of about four summers, who does not observe his approach, is leaning over the stone basin, plashing languidly in the water, and some- times catching the spray from the stone Hercules on his golden curls. Richard comes furtively to- wards him and catches him up; and not till he has plucked a thousand kisses from his white neck and chubby cheeks, while the court rings with the child's silvery laughter, does the father observe the big tear-drops that the laughter was shaking down his face, the gushings of some sorrow he had broken in For a more full and detailed description of one of these baronial  country-houses, see a curious book, "Sir John Cullum's History and Antiquities of Hawstead and Hardwick, in the County of Suffolk."  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7721-00000049"/> 88        THE ]EXILE. upon. Before he has time to inquire into the case, his wife is in his arms, and weeping upon his bosom. The night-birds have been here in his absence. "Where 's Job?" "The hounds have got him." "And Lottie?" No answer but choking sobs. Poor Job had mistaken the matter. Not only "Ioftie lugs," but lowly ones too, were in danger in such times as these. Job, quite unconscious of his peril, had provoked the Church authorities, and brought down their power upon his head in its most malignant shape. Notwithstanding his large good-nature, he had a most irresistible propensity to extract his amusements from the follies of other people; and the shams especially which he saw about him were the occasions of infinite fun. Lit- tle Johnny, the boy whom we just saw at the stone basin, was always hanging on his neck for a story or a song, and neither the stories nor the songs were calculated to give him the most exalted ideas of things which some people looked upon with awful reverence. The child would go to bed, and iaugh himself to sleep; and even after sleep had got fast hold of him, his laughter would break out in prolonged eruptions, as the droll images of Job's songs would come floating through his dreams. Fortunate would it have been for Job if little Johnny had been his only admirer; but the porter's lodge at Bourchier Hall had become a famous place for a certain class of people to resort to, and not always till after midnight did the room cease to   t             'JOB IN TROUBLE.         89 shake with the merriment. Job's vanity became a little excited, and, with a fine instinct, he did not fail to discover the train he was to touch, in order to produce a general explosion.  Whoever satirized the priests or the begging friars was pretty sure of a sympathizing audience, and Job's poetic lore was but too rich in material from which to draw. The solemn drollery of his intonations was imitated by worse people than himself; fragments of his songs got popularized in the streets and alehouses, and the whole of the lower stata of Colchester was get- ting infected with Lollardism. A system of fraud- and error, which .will stand before whole batteries of syllogisms, cannot stand very long the assaults of popular lampooning.   With the exception of the following, tradition has preserved to us only short fragments and snatches of Job's melodies of this class; but if this be a fair specimen, we rather won- der how he escaped so long either the real or sym- bolidal fagots provided for such cases. BOXLEY ROOD. "There lived a priest in Maidstone town, Not many years agone; He had a cross called Boxley Rood, Through all the country known; And all around the people came, This Boxley Rood to view, For on the cross an image hung, Of Saint Bartholomew. O, a wondrous thing this image was, Of Saint Bartholomew! "The pilgrims came from far and near, As I've heard people say, ? 8X  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7721-00000050"/> 90           THE EXILE. And paid the priest so much a head, To see the image pray; Its lips would move, its eyes would roll, Its hands it upward threw: O, a wondrous thing this image was, Of Saint Bartholomew! - "One day a farmer lost his wife, And came with a pistole: ' O let the image say a mass For my poor Betsey's soul! The priest he looked a solemn look, And signed him thus - and - so: Out popped the head of Bobbie Brant, 'Bartholomew wont go!' O dolorous joke, the crank is broke, Bartholomew wont go!  "Soft spake the priest: 'A tinker call, As swiftly as you can, And let him mend Bartholomew, And grease his inner man.' O then, good people one and all,' Come on with your pistoles, And Bobbie Brant will grind the prayers IFor your poor, dying souls! O Bobbie Brant, he turns the crank, To save poor sinners' souls!" Poor Job was innocent of any evil design; but the roars of laughter had scarcely ceased to echo in the porter's lodge, before Bobbie Brant became a fa- mous character in all the streets and market-places of Colchester, and even the priests heard his praises chanted under their windows by moonlight. It made the matter worse, inasmuch as the doggerel which Job had picked up was a rather loose and incorrect version of a real fact; for Boxley Rood at that moment was receiving devotees from all parts   JOB IN TROUBLE.           91 of the kingdom, and swelling the revenues 'of the priest at Maidstone; and it was a pretty good speci- men of the trickeries which the opened monasteries were every day disclosing.* They swore to make an auto de fe of the " gray-headed buffoon," and put a stop to his cursed doggerel.   The ultimate fate of Boxley Rood is curiously told in a letter in Latin, given by Burnet. See his Reformation, p. 376 of the Appen- dix. The idol was also called the Image of Ashdod, and the Baby- lonish Bel. After playing its tricks for a long time, the imposture was discovered, and it was brought for exhibition to St. Paul's Cross, where its ignominious end is thus described:- "Here the image once more, with all its machinery exposed, goes through its part. Admiration, rage, astonishment, stir the multitude by turns. The prevailing feeling is one of mortification, that they should have been so shamefully deluded by such a cheat. At length, as the preacher (Hilsey of Rochester) waxes warm in his discourse, and the word of God is secretly working in the hearts of his auditors, the wooden block is thrown down headlong into the thickest of the throng. Instantly a confused, outcry of many voices arises; the idol is pulled about, is broken, is plucked in pieces, is torn into a thousand fragments, and finally consigned to the flames."  "Et hic tulit exi- tum illum." This was Sunday, February 24th, 1538. The whole letter is cu- rious, giving a lively description of the idol's pranks before the impos- ture was discovered. &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7721-00000051"/> CHAPTER    XIII. SONGS IN THE NIGHT. MORE had already been executed. Before Rich- ard arrived home, the judicial crime had been con- summated that sent a shudder, not only over Eng- land, but the whole continent of Europe. There was no man more endeared to the common people than More, and his murder was one of those mon. strous iniquities that make the child creep up closer to its mother, and the mother clasp her babes in terror. "Had we been the master of such a ser- vant," exclaimed the Emperor Charles, "we would rather have lost the fairest city in our dominions than such a counsellor." The commissioners ad- ministered the oath of supremacy, while the gloom of this overshadowing crime lay heavy on the minds of men. They had been to Colchester, as we have said, but Richard Sayer did not appear. They meant to hunt him out. Job is to be used for a double purpose. He is to be used in discovering and con- victing his master, and then doubtless they will roast him in the Colchester market-place as a terror   :,'U? .SONGS IN THE NIGHT.        93 to all Lollards, and especially those that sing ballads and lampoons. There was a priest named Dyers* convicted af- terwards of gross sensuality, who undertook to be Job's confessor, and who very likely instigated his arrest. Job was lodged in the common jail, and Dyer cane and talked sweet and softish at first, holding out finally very unpleasant prospects, both of temporal and eternal fire, yet intimating a par- don on conditions. Where was his master? And what had he heard him say? Job was dumb. The priest threatened, but in vain. At length the last ad hominem argument which tyrants resort to was produced, -the rack. Job's hair rose up stiffer on the top of his head. "I will be plain with you, Master Dyer, and savze you all that trouble. You may tear my limbs apart, but I cannot betray my master." We will not stop to describe the agonies of the faithful old servant. They did not reach the place where his secret was kept, and he hugged it closer, and sent it deeper into his heart, in the midst of his tortures.  But the fiends of cruelty have an inexhaustible ingenuity.

The royal butcher began with Elizabeth Barton,--the epileptic "Spiritualist" of those times. Thence he proceeded to ladies of gentle blood, and sent his queens to the block as remorselessly as a Devon- shire drover would drive his cattle to the shambles. The gray-haired Countess of Salisbury followed, - hacked in pieces on the scaffold and dragged round it by her hoary hair, - the account of whose execu- tion we cannot read, now that three centuries have passed, without a feeling of self-degradation that we and Henry the Eighth belong to a common species. The noble-minded Ann Ascew, with a train of others, followed in her turn, and after her Joan of Kent, whose innocent blood stains eternally the robes of Cranmer,- -and, we are sorry to add, of John Rogers, the famous martyr.  It was a question among the vultures of Essex, put on the scent doubtless by Rich, the brutal and cringing crown lawyer, who was doing his best to earn the chancellorship and clutch his share of con- fiscated estates, whether they would attempt to get hold of Richard through his wife or his servant. His wife was a lady of gentle blood, and there were difficulties in the way, The hard fate fell upon poor Lottie, who was supposed to be thoroughly infected with the Lollardism of her father. She was arrested and lodged in another apartment of the same jail.   I         SONGS IN THE NIGHT.     95 The wits of these night-birds were infernally keen, and would have honored a Solomon in a good cause. Lottie proved as intractable as her father. They could not win the secret from her by blandish- ments, nor frighten it out of her by threats. But they contrived a rack for her, whose tortures were sharper than any which poor Job had yet suffered. They put her purposely where she could hear most distinctly her father's groans, and thought to break her in through the tortures of agonizing love. All day she had heard at intervals the creaking of the rack, followed by the piercing ejaculation, " O Lord, save! O Lord, forgive " with the assurance that any moment she could put an end to the dreadful business, by telling where her master was to be found. Her first truthful and womanly instinct was to refuse even unto the death, but every new turn of the rack sent a knife through the tenderest spot in her heart, and what she would have done in her distrac- tion we cannot tell. Happily, however, this was not an agony to be long endured; and as the day" closed, the dingy prison-walls grew darker and swam before her eyes, and presently all sights and sounds were as nothing to poor Lottie, and she lay insen- sible upon the dungeon floor Night has set in, and the vultures have left their victims to themselves.

She listened for the sounds from   the adjoining cell. There were moanings of pain, made in loved and remembered tones. But they grew fainter, and all was still; and there came the bitter reflection, that he whose good angel she had aspired to be, and whose pillow she had hoped to make smooth in the last strange hour, had met that hour alone. But Job was alive, though he did not know what had befallen his child. He was turning over his lore to find something that suited his case and would enable him to forget his pains. Presently the low humming and tuning so familiar to Lottie's ear greeted it again. She listened with all her life, and anon an old and much-loved strain emerged, feeble and tremulous at first, but gaining strength and volume as it swept along. "Night has shut the prisoner in, Night of horrors, night of sin! Vain for light my eyeballs roll, Darkly here I dwell in dole; On my bed I plain and mourn, Bleeding with the twisted thorn. "What arises dead and still? O 'tis Calvary's awful hill! O the drooping Sufferer there t O the unprevailing prayer! O the temples gashed and torn,  Bleeding- with the twisted thorn!"

"What arises dread and still? Lo, Ascension's holy hill! See the rifted clouds retire, Flaming with the fleecy fire! Through them see a form upborne,- He who wore the twisted thorn!

Job was bewildered.   He thought of other and better men before him, who had sung songs in prison, that brought down angels to open the doors. He thought he knew the voice, and in his pain and be- wilderment he looked   up, half expecting his lost Charlotte to melt through the darkness upon his vision.

The duty of obedience to government was urged upon him. He stoutly argued that there was a higher law than that of Parliament, and a higher King than Henry. They urged, that for an individual to set up his opinion against the King and the Parliament was flat re- bellion. He replied, that it was better to rebel against human government than the Divine. They urged that he was not the proper judge of what was the Divine law. He replied, that he thought his judgment as good as that of the King's harlot, and that thq Church in which he was baptized and educated was a better judge than either. They urged the danger of anarchy and the Ana- baptist disorders in Germany. He replied, that a tyranny that sent such men as More and Fisher to the block was as bad as the, disorders of the Continent, and that the true safe- guard against both was the authority of the ancient Church. They urged his duty to his family, his aged parents, and his wife and child, whom he exposed to certain calamity. "Alack!" said he, in a voice becoming tremu- lous, I will give up everything of my own to please and comfort you. But truth is not mine, and when the choice lies between that and perjury, I must know neither father nor mother nor wife nor sister nor brother."   CONSULTATIONS.      101 He had passed the Rubicon, and Lawyer Leach's distinction even could not save him now. They gave him up sorrowfully, as utterly intractable, and left him to himself. His plan was soon formed. It was to leave the country, and wait for better times. He had been married about five years, and no blight had fallen upon his domestic peace. His wife's family were firm adherents of the government,-Henricans in the fullest sense, - and he determined to resign her to their powerful protection. She had experienced nothing but tenderness and sunshine, and he did not mean to involve her in his evil fortunes. ' You are to be my good angel no longer, nor the light of my home, and I will see that you are sent safely to the shades of Ashwelthorpe, where 'you will remain till this storm has spent its rage.

We have known men who had wives whose worth they never had the fortune to discover. It is one of the benefits of calamity that it reveals the clear gold in woman's character; and Richard did not know what his treasures were till this hour. His wife clung to him when all the rest had left him to his fate. "Talk not," said she, "of Ashwelthorpe I Do you think I will desert you in such an hour as this?

You will be worth more to me with a con- science undefiled, and an unbroken manhood, with all its hardships, than living a dishonored life in Bourchier Hall."  He reminded her that she would incur her own father's displeasure, as he himself had already done. "I will take care of that," said she. "Go and leave everything to me, and, God willing, I will follow you, and bring your child in safety to you at last. Go, for the hounds may overtake you." There was danger of it. Not many hours after this conversation, they were at the door. But the game had fled. The Sayers owned estates in the neighboring parishes of Copford and Aldham. Richard retired to the latter place, and remained some days among his tenantry, through whom he made arrangements for his escape out of the country. There was a vessel lying down the Colne, in which he intended to embark for Holland, and news at length came to him from his wife that the vessel was ready to sail, and that he could trust himself on board. Emerg- ing from his retreat, he went a little out of his direct course in order to take St. John's Abbey in his way, and receive the farewell blessing of the good father whose counsels he had sought, and whose meek but unconquerable spirit he had imbibed in his hour of darkness. He passed once more the ora- tory on the hill, where under the solemn stars he drank in the spirit of self-sacrifice, and where im- mortality brooded on his soul once more, and made   IllX CONSULTATIONS.            103 it strong. He walked again under the arches of the old chestnut-trees, whose shades had soothed his chafed and wearied spirit, as the old man dis- coursed of heavenly things; and finally he emerged from the grove and came in front of the monastery. But a ghastly sight was before him. The aged form of Father Bache had been hacked into four quarters, the head severed from the body, and the mangled fragments hung over the gates of the monastery. The deed had just been done. No monks appeared on the chapel green, and no bell ringing for matins poured its music through the grove. All was desolate and still. The monastery had been "dissolved,"-which .means that the ab- bot had been executed for refusing the oath of su- premacy, the monks turned adrift t6qtarve and beg, and perhaps be gibbeted afterwards on a charge of vagabondism, and the income of the abbey lands put into the clutch of some greedy Privy Councillor. It was perilous for Richard to venture in, but a strange power drew him farther, and he passes under the yet dripping quarters of his venerated friend, into the green court of the monastery. Within the buildings were three or four men, who, in merchant phrase, were " taking account of stock," making an inventory of church plunder, among which were the offerings at the shrine of St. John, the picture of the Crucifixion, and the two pictures, Christ bearing the Cross, and the Virgin and Child. One of these men had a " glearing eye," that looked very much like the eye of Wriothesley, though it might be the eye of almost any of Cromwell's commissioners.  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7721-00000057"/> 104       THE EXILE. The image of St. John lay prone on the green in the court, where it had been pitched out, and the head broken off. The mosaic of the chapel floor had been taken up and placed in piles; coffins, dug up and rifled of their silver ornaments, lay here and there; and the horses of the " commissioners " stood in the chapel, tethered to the high altar, the least brutal of any of the inmates just now. In such wise was "dissolved" one of the houses which "had been inns for the wayfaring man, who heard froim afar the sound of the vesper bell, at once inviting him to repose and devotion, and who might sing his matins with the morning-star, and go on his way rejoicing." Our traveller fled swiftly from the sickening spectacle, and reached his ship, which was soon dropping down the Colne. His eye rested upon the receding turrets of St. John's Abbey, till tears, not distance, shut out the view, and a hearthbreak- ing sigh breathed out a last farewell to his native land.    THE W't E. THE wife of Richard Sayer was barely twenty- three years of age when the storm, broke upon his household. It came to her out of a clear sky. No cloud before this had ever passed over it. She was the eldest daughter of Sir Edmund Knyvet of Ash- welthorpe in Norfolk, whose family name had been distinguished now for a century in English annals. Sir Edmund Knyvet appears in'the genealogical tables with the addition of "Sergent Porter to Henry VIII."  What that means precisely we can- not say, only we know he stood well in Henry's' favor, and supported his government both against Popery on one. side and Lollardism on the other. We find his family occupying a distinguished place in the pageants of which Henry was so fond, even as early as the rejoicings occasioned by the birth of his first child.* * For a description of one of these occasions at Westminster Hall, and an amusing incident connected with Sir Thomas Knyvet, a brother of Edmund, see Lives of the Queens, by Agnes Strickland, Vol. IV. p. 79.  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7721-00000058"/> 106       THE-EXILE. The wife of Sir Edmund and the mother of  Anne Bourchier Knyvet was Jane Bourchier, only  surviving daughter and heiress of Lord Berners, who was also an adherent of Henry and a supporter of his government. The wife of Lord Berners was Katharine Howard, daughter of John, Duke of Nor-  folk, and therefore not a remote' kindred of the ill- : fated Katharine Howard who became the queen of Ienry.  The Lady Anne Bourchier Knyvet, therefore, who married Richard Sayer, was connected by her maternal grandmother with the Bourchiers, whose line runs up directly to Edward the Third, and by  her mother and maternal grandmother with the house of Norfolk, now, next to the throne, the most powerful in the realm. The blood both of the Plan- tagenets and the Howards was flowing in her veins; but better blood than that of either was also there, as we shall see before we get through with the his- tory of this admirable and noble woman. Her father by his marriage acquired the manor   of Ashwelthorpe; and there Lady Anne was brought up and educated until Richard took her, with the bloom of eighteen summers upon her cheek and the enthusiasm of romantic love in her dark eye, and made her the light of his home. Life's prospects at first sparkled before her as with the beams of the morning. Her husband was as  -full of hope and promise as herself, not without a tinge of romance that threw its rose colors over all things. He was the undoubted heir of large  estates; he selected for his own residence a favorite :'Id   THE WIFE.       107 ancestral mansion, named it Bourchier Hall after the second name of his bride, adorned its grounds with everything which he thought would please her eye, and placed within it the most tried and faithful servants that he could find from among his ten- antry. Little Johnny had come, and grown into his fourth year, and, with his laughing blue eye and his merry-making voice, made sunshine through the house, if there was any spot not already illumined- with the quiet humor of Job's songs, or the laughing dimples in the fat cheeks of Lottie. Five years of these domestic enjoyments had flowed on without disturbance, when they all had to be sacrificed for what Lawyer Leach called an abstraction.  All the family influences on both sides were brought to bear upon Lady Anne, to draw her away from the involving ruin of her husband's fortunes. She did not share his opinions, and why should she share the hard penalties which attached to them? All that heart could wish she could have still; her child, friends, luxuries, the glare of outward grand- eur, all but the joy of that one unchanging, un- dying passion, - woman's devoted and faithful love. She had but just come out of her girlhood, and nothing till now had occurred to show of what metal she was made.  Her form was of rather slender and delicate mould. But she had a high and serene forehead; her raven hair hung in glossy ringlets down her neck; her features were pale, but exquisitely moulded; and her large black eye, that sometimes changed its liquid softness into quick flashings of light, would lead one to think  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7721-00000059"/> 108       THE EXILE.  that she had a power in reserve, and a Plantagenet energy, whenever occasion might require it. The occasion had come. In looking about her after the bolt had fallen, her first care was to provide means for her husband's escape. She was on the watch till she found a vessel ready to sail in which  he might venture with safety. She had things pro-  vided for his comfort, and yet eluded the vigilance  of the hunters; kept him secretly advised of every- thing; and, finally, watched the vessel from the bal- cony as it dropped down the Colne, and faded off and disappeared in a white speck on the ocean. Then she thought of her two faithful servants. But what could she do? It was perilous to take the part of heretics. Even to ask a mitigation of : punishment exposed one to the fatal suspicion of sympathizing in their opinions. Hence, when a ! person was arrested for heresy, everybody else cried out and reviled him. Even his own kindred would  turn against him, in order to save themselves. No darker feature is revealed of those dark times, than  the power of persecution to abolish the tenderest  ties and yearnings of nature. The father of Ann  Boleyn accused and vilified his daughter as she  went to the block, innocent though she was; and : Norfolk, the uncle of Katharine Howard, saw his  niece sacrificed without a word to save her. The victim always went to the stake amid the jeers and  scoffs of the crowd, who took good care to prove  their orthodoxy by their brutality. Lady Anne, by  all the dictates of prudence and the prevalent moral-  ity, should now have maintained a guarded silence;  1I   THE WIFE.        109 or, as she was herself unde some suspicion, she should have cleared herself by giving in evidence against the victims of power. What she really did, as soon as her husband was safe, was to present herself before the jail-keeper and demand to see her servants. The keeper' said- he must first get the consent of Master Dyer. Mas- ter Dyer said lie must get the consent of Wriothes- ley, whose eye we conclude was "glearing" some- where in the neighborhood. Nevertheless permis- sion came, and she was admitted. There lay poor Job stretched upon a plank, with a groove at each end, in which a roller was made to turn. His feet were lashed with cords to the roller at one extrem- ity, and his hands at the other, and a man was turning it occasionally with an air of unconcern. Master Dyer, a man with a broad, stolid face, sat writing at a table. Job was beyond any complaints or remonstrances. His breathing was thick and hard, his eyes turned and glazed; the clover-blossom had left his cheek, which was deadly pale; cold beads like death-dew stood over his forehead and temples,' and his lips were shrunk and quivering. His kind- hearted mistress, who had heard nothing of what was going on in the jail, uttered an involuntary groan, and kneeled down and buried her face on the breast of her faithful old servant. Recovered from her first agony of heart, she turned and asked, in deprecating tone, "Good Master Dyer, what is this for, and who has ordered it?" Master Dyer explained: "The master of this man lies under a charge of treason, and has con- 10  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7721-00000060"/> "O       THE EXILE.           ' cealed himself somewhere. The man can be re-   ' lieved any moment, by just telling what he knows. Or his master can relieve him, by just giving him- self up." And Master Dyer went to writing again with a look that said, "Don't interrupt me again." "I think," said the good woman, " that I am the person to give you this information. I know my husband's whereabouts better than this man does, of which matter, I assure you, he is cqmpletely ig- norant r "Why did n't the old fool say so then?" said Dyer, in a guttural voice, looking half round from his paper. "You must release him, Master Dyer, or a higher ?: power will take him out of your hands. He is fast going where no secrets are told."         i "I will relieve him, Madam, if you will produce i your husband."  "Nay, Master Dyer, I have not the keeping of my husband; but I will tell you all that Job can tell you, and a great deal more, if you will only let him go." '"Tell where your husband can be found, and thy old ballad-grinder can be relieved; but if not, I swear to you he shall be screwed up till he cracks in two" : ' That I promise you, on my honor, I will tell you. If I do not, you may put me in his place, and torture me to your entire satisfaction." The screws were accordingly reversed, and the hunters had the satisfaction of learning that their game was beyond their reach, and had eluded their toils. l   THE WIFE.        1ll The good woman then raised Job from his hard bed, pillowed his head upon her breast, and wiped the cold beads from his temples. After the strain upon his muscles had been relaxed, there was an involuntary quiver in his flesh, but his limbs hung loose and flexile, and he sank into that entire un- consciousness, the last gift of mercy to our poor, suffering nature. She bathed his flesh gently in tepid water, but with no result; and she sighed to herself, "Alas! he has sing his last song." The tears were dripping fast down upon his cheek, when he opened his eyes and looked :up into a familiar face, sweeter to him at that hour than the face of an angel. For long weeks he had looked only on the hard features of cruel men, and he had to collect his wits before persuading himself that he had waked up in this world. "Ah, good my Lady Anne!" was all he could say. She nursed him for days, doubtful whether the fluttering life would stay in his half-dislocated limbs. She sought the apartment of Lottie, and did what she could to pour healing oil over her lacerd ated sympathies. Stretched in spirit on the rack of her father, all her nerves had been wrung till her mind was on that verge that separates between reason and maniac frenzy, Her eye was wild, and already saw the spectral tormenters, and she heard shrieks that were not of earth; till reassured on the breast of her beloved mistress, her nerves were soothed and stilled, and in the thought that, her father was relieved from the torture, the crashing agony was lifted off her heart.  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7721-00000061"/> "2       THE EXILE. And now the question came back to this good woman: Have I saved these people from the rack, only that they may be kept for a more terrible fate? The charge of Lollardism was still in reserve. Job had touched the quick of theologic hate, a passion never known to be appeased except by blood since the world began. I%            : /' '/i   CHAPTER      XVI. GOING TO COURT. ON the 29th of May, 1536, there was one of those pageants in London, so often enacted during the reigns of -the Tudors. It was not a coronation; a coronation for every new queen was too expensive a matter for the purse of Henry. There were splendid banquetings and masqueradings at Mer- cer's Hall, - the place where Henry chose to intro- 'duce a new queen to his people. It was one of the pageantries in which the satellites of royalty were required to shine their part, and in which the Kny- vets and the Bernerses generally appeared. Who- the "Lady Knyvet"' was who figures among the "Iadies and gentlewomen attendant," we do not know, but judge from the circumstances that it was one of the sisters of our " good Lady Anne," or one of her cousins, the daughters of Sir Thomas.* No riatter.

And in the evening, Mercer's Hall is filled with rejoicings and-congratu' lations, in the centre of which is a rather prim and' sour-looking lady, with high cheeks and a somewhat Tartar profile,-flaring in jewelry, and who is writ- : ten down by historians, as doubtlessin duty bound, "the beautiful Jane Seymour, the most prudent of all the queens of Henry."            : This beautiful and prudent Jane, whose Tartarli face the unerring pencil of Holbein has preserved to us, was Queen Ann Boleyn's "maid of honor," which honor she manifested by coquetting with the  King, supplanting and circumventing her mistress; and at an hour when her mistress was in special need of feminine sympathy and support, she sent a X pang through her heart by her treachery, that de- $ stroyed a promised heir to the throne, and left the :  mother to the brutal insults of her royal husband. This beautiful and prudent maid of honor prepared , for her wedding-day, while her queen mistress was i under that awful sentence of death which her own treachery had procured. She wedded the King on  X the 20th of May,--the day after Ann, her rival,  X was. sent to the block, and while her mangled and  once lovely form was lying yet warm under the floors of St. Peter's chapel. Such is the new star to which the gentlemen and gentlewomen of Eng-  landare summoned to do homage. There must  have been gloom and depression of spirits under this    GOING TO COURT.      115 outward glare. There must have been sadness of heart to a large extent under the silks and starred velvet at Mdercer's Hall. At that moment the exe- cution of Ann lay heavy on the hearts of Protes- tant subjects, and rebellion was looming up sullenly in the northern counties among Catholics. The latter bewailed'the desecration of their faith, the abolishing of their festal days, and the dissolving of the monasteries, whose outcast inmates, both men and women, were swarming in thousands over the land, and begging for bread and shelter. WShile this show of rejoicing was going on among the gentry at London, victims hung gibbeted in chains over the country; and soon the banks of all the rivers in the North of England were to be lined with rows of quartered traitors.  ; It was in this state of things that a woman ap- peared at Mercer's Hall, on this 29th of May, for other purposes than to do homage to the new star, with those who were ducking around the court of the Blue-Beard King. It is none other than our good Lady Anne, seeking her father among the starred velvet, and pouring a child's earnest entrea- ties into his ear. We are not admitted to the inter- view between the father and the afflicted but well- beloved daughter, now before him in her beauty and tears. But we know pretty well what passed between them, - that Sir Edmund used all his per- suasions to rescue her from the falling fortunes of her obstinate husband, and that she used every ar- gument which she thought could reach a father's heart to intercede for the royal clemency.

He was too cautious to touch upon the subject of the attainder of Saver in the  royal presence, for he was too finished a courtier not to know that to disturb the question of the oath of supremacy   would   pitch him  pretty suddenly, not only from the office of "' Sergent Porter to the King," but   from  any  comfortable standing-place whatsoever.                            , Howheit, our good    Lady  Anne  returned to Col- chester with a   brave heart, glad, we may  be sure,  to get out of the  sphere of the  hollow  rejoicings of  Mercer's Hall.   She sought   Master Dyer as soon as  she arrived.  Master Dyer exercised  the double function of priest and  keeper  of  an  alehouse, -  functions less incongruous   than often were united in the-same   person in these times.*  She demanded     , of him  the release of her servants, in terms  rather  more lofty than  he had been  wont to hear, and,  while  her Plantagenet blood   was up, denounced  him for' his baseness and his cruelties.  In reply, he swore that her servants should go to the stake, and  See a  curious letter to Cromwell, in the state papers, quoted by Knight, PictorialEngland, Book VI. Chap. I.

A name was on the paper at which stouter men than Master Dyer had turned pale. He became soft and pliant enough, ducking his square head in a thousand obeisances, and was not long in writ- ing an order for the release of Job and Lottie. As she left him, she fixed her black eye upon him, while he quailed under it. "If I hear a word more of your cruelties, know, sir, that I have the means at my command of hanging up your carcass to swing as a sign over the doors of your own alehouse." Truth is, the lampooning of .priests and monks was the most venial of all offences in the eye of Henry, - always providing the supremacy and tran- substantiation were undisturbed; and if he had heard the song of Boxley Rood, he would have shaken his huge dropsies for an hour afterwards. Job and Lottie were taken from prisonD where now they had remained for months, and carefully nursed in Bourchier Hall. It was some timte be- fore Job could sit in his chair; one of his joints was plucked asunder. But ere many weeks were gone, he was sitting in the porter's lodge, with little John- ny climbing over him, brushing his cheek with his yellow curls, and teasing for a song; and as the song came, for it never failed, the little fellow would shake with laughter, till the tears started, and he finally rolled in convulsions over the floor.  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7721-00000064"/> CHAPTER    XVII. FAREWELL. ON one of the calmest evenings in the month of June, a vessel was lying in the small harbor of Col- chester waiting for a favoring breeze. Bourchier Hall, we have said, was situated six miles above. The river Colne is only navigable as far as the city Between the Hall and the city the passage is by a small boat or skiff, and in this the exiles have em- barked, after nightfall, to pass down the stream to the waiting vessel. It had been the policy of the Knyvets to detain perforce the Lady Anne, and pre- vent her from going to her husband. She was vir- tually a prisoner in Bourchier Hall for nearly a year after Richard's escape. But she has found means to elude the vigilance of the watch, -a vigilance  which became rather sleepy, probably through de- sign. She and her child and servants-have found' their way to the skiff, and two sturdy boatmen are rowing them down the stream. She watches the  receding fields, clothed in the dearest of home mem- ories, now sleeping under the silvery sheen of the unclouded heavens. Bourchier Hall is watched as ::I   AREWELL.        119 it recedes, long visible on the top of the hill, its tur- rets tipped with moonbeams and cutting their out- I  line on the blue sky beyond. The grounds around it can be distinguished, the walks with fringing if flowers, even the clematis that climbed up over the doorway and hung down its white blossoms, - all fading off into dimness for ever. She sits statue- like, with folded arms, her face fixed towards the spot where, a short time ago, she- came a -rejoicing bride. But they;soon reach the vessel, in which they safely embark. They drop down the Colne; the city of Colchester grows dim and far off. They pass into the great German. Ocean; the day dawns only upon the boundless waters, and England, with all its oppressions and miseries, has sunk in the Western main.  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7721-00000065"/> CHAPTER    XVIII. AT SEA. THERE was a gloomy silence on the deck as the exiles sat and looked blank into the sea; while the vessel tossed them over the waves. Lady Anne and her two servants sat cowering towards the stern, looking away in the direction where Old England had disappeared. Presently Johnny appeared upon deck, fresh from the night's repose. What were the past and the future to him? Lottie had im- pressed two things upon his mind: first, not to lose his cap overboard; secondly, not to fall over him- self and get drowned in the great German Ocean. He readily promised to do neither. In fact, he had no intention of it. So he ran to and fro, cap in hand, his feet pattering over the deck, throwing back his head, and giving his face to the breeze, that played fantastic tricks with his streaming curls. Then he tossed his cap straight up towards the top of the mast, leaving to the cap the whole responsi- bility of coming straight down again; but it sailed off into the sea, where it could be seen by its silver lace tossing on the waves. Lottie gave him fresh f-   AT SEA.          i21 instructions, but before they were finished he was off again; and in his next appearance he rained down upon her head, crushing her bonnet into a trapezoid. The sea-breeze agreed with him. Job sat leaning his chin upon the rail, looking 'down into the vessel's track of hissing and flashing foam, humming pensive snatches from    the "Song of Exile," which ran something in this wise:-- "The ghostly moon above the hall Was hanging pale and still; It showed the hawthorn up the lane, The woodbine on the hill. "The ghostly moon was hanging low Just o'er the moving mast, And coldly looked the gloaniing stars, When Mary looked her last. "The ghostly moon was on the fields; The fields did seem to mourn; The harebells hang their pretty cups Till Mary shall return. "The ghostly moon was on the sea; The wind sang soft its lay; Yet sighed the wiad right mournfully To bear the baik away." We think there was more of it; but here the ubiquitous boy appeared suddenly, caught the hat of the old minstrel, and was off and away. Job soon came to himself, and was in full chase after his property, expecting to see it sail into the water. Master Dyer had not improved his agility, though, after doublings and turnings, he came back with his hat, exclaiming, with his biggest oath, "Saint George! I believe that boy is getting vicious."  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7721-00000066"/> 122          THE EXILE,                 ; The boy followed him, teasing for the other exile song, which Job    refused  to sing, -as   altogether    F unsuited to his present feelings, and totally inap- propriate; but, like   other singers, he   yielded  to     - importunity:-  Ie The raging sea, the boiling sea! How wild the waters foam!          -    J But blithely rolls the raging sea           J That bears the exile home.              A "The windes from off the Norseman's hills  Doe shriek a dismall song: There's music in the shrieking windes         ? That drive my barke along. ' "The hills are rising near and fast Out from the breaking sea: O now I see my father's house, Beside my father's tree! "I see the orchard on the moor Where I and Jennie played: -- O what if Jennie should be trothed, Or Jennie should be dead!              : "Mayhap a lovelorn maid she sits, To watch the heaving main: - O  there are Jennie's twinkling feet A-tripping down the lane! "And now to find a welcome home, From tossinigs to and fro, On Jennie's cheeks and cherry lips, Where rareripe kisses grow!" There was a    pause again, and Job grew    solemn, and, looking   at Lady  Anne, intimated that he    had      a  better exile song than  this, and perhaps   better suited to her feelings.   The   good soul was thinking of his mistress, and   how he  could comfort her.  !(Til   AT SEA.      I     123 "What is it, Job?

I often listen when you don't know it, and envy almost your gushes of happiness, that come up so freshy out of misfortune." The faithful old servant tuned his pipes anew, looking up into the heavens; and this time he sang with such unction that it brought all the clover back to his cheek, and sent all his soul into his eye.

Time river Amstel is a small stream, that rolls its lazy waters through marshy grounds into an arm of the Zuyder Zee. At the beginning of the thirteenth century its banks were in possession of a set of bur- ly lords, whose vassals rowed their fishing-smacks down the river into the open sea; and in process of time a small fishing village sprang up at the mouth of the stream. It was under the control of the grim lords of the Arnstel, aikd its commercial privileges were few and insignificant. But one of these surly governors became implicated in the murder of Count Floris of Holland, and the Hol- landers fell upon them, attacked and plundered their Rf' village, overthrew their little dynasty, and tookli governors, the fishing village rose into importance and privilege, and grew rapidly into the great city of Ate nsterdam, the Venice of the Northern Sea. By {he year 1537 it had become rich and prosper- ous. It lay on' the Zuyder Zee in the shape of a half-moon, bending its two' horns up to the water s2*-i1 p v e sa  i n  i c  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7721-00000068"/> 126       THE.

The Am-    stel flowed through the middle of the crescent,  dividing the city about equally.- Around the land i side, and forming the outer curve of the-crescent,  was raised a huge -embankment, buttressed with stone, wide enough on the top to be planted with trees, and be converted into walks and boulevards. Here too, at regular intervals, stood wind-mills, , always swinging their gigantic arms, both to pump : l up water and grind the corn.            The ground on which the city stands is lower   l than the ocean, and lower than the river. The houses are built on piles driven into the marshy I earth; but the marshes have all disappeared, and X given place to winding canals. The streets are polygonal, and correspond with the bend of the  : crescent; and the three which form the outer verge of it- the Heeren, the Keysers, and the Princen- 3 are even at this day as fine as the streets of any city  in Europe. The intersecting canals divide the city I into ninety islands, so that when you enter it you r do not order a carriage, but a canal-boat, on which i you move by water to any quarter of the town. As you pass, you look upon paved walks bordered by rows of trees that extend continuously on either side of you their grateful umbrage, in front of the endless rows of brick houses with their gables to- wards you. Should your boat take you into the Keysers or the Princen, past the rich merchants and the burgomasters, you shall find these houses -o be splendid structures of five stories. Such is the great, busy city, in which there is no sound of   AMSTERDAM.        127 rattling wheels. Curious it is, that, though one of the most commercial places of the world, its in- habitants never " go down to the sea in ships,"-- they always go up.

The min gled sounds of Dutch trade and jargon come up to your ear, not much mellowed by distance. Here our old friend and fugitive fron tyranny, Richard Sayer, has been pacing nearly every day for twelve months, looking down sometimes into the city of Dutchmen, - seeing the boats glide among the shade-trees, hearing the noises of strange, tongues from the life that swarms along the canals and about the warehouses, - looking away, we may be assured, over the expanse of surging waters, with   &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7721-00000069"/> l  128       THE EXILE. wearisome expectations and longings. Every sailr  that nears the harbor is watched with anxious spewc ulation; and it was one of those moments which gather up into themselves the rapture of years, and atone for long months of exile, when his eye dis- tinguished, on the nearing deck, his child and two  faithful servants and when again he held to his  heart her whom he " singled from the world."  Lady Anne arrived with her faithful charge some X twelve months after her husband had left her.   1 Thus early had Amsterdam begun to be a city of refuge, and many were already there who had escaped the tyranny of the Blue-Beard monster  - who now disgraced the English throne. The Neth-  erlands at this period belonged to the dominions of Ad Charles the Fifth. The Roman Catholic religion  was the reigning and established one, and there  was not yet perfect toleration for Protestant sub- i jects, The struggle was yet before them which was to establish the great principle of religious liberty, that struggle against the tyranny of the cold ? and ruthless Philip the Second of Spain, in the progress of which shone forth the most heroic vir-  tues of which man is capable, and which issued in giving to the united Netherlands the enviable glory  of being the first nation to establish the doctrine  of religious toleration.

In the Netherlands, Richard Sayer with his persecuted family was sure to find a peace- ful asylum. As he received his family and ser- vants, and took them by boat through the city, they witnessed sights and sounds very strange to Eng- lish eyes and ears. Amsterdam already was choked and crammed with life. Under splendid mansions were cellars occupied by the poorer classes. Out of these, dirty children and dirty women were swarm- ing with a perfect Babel of tongues. Boats they pass, on which lived whole families who had no home except upon the water; whose parlor, dormi- tory, and kitchen were upon the upper deck, which emitted all sounds and smells of cookery. Great warehouses they pass, where boats are -unlading the products of every clime, and where the jargon of trade heard in Dutch gibberish makes double confusion. Things improve vastly as they pass into the Princen, and are drawn up the silent high- way between rows of shade-trees. There, away from the din and the tumult, they land at a five- story dwelling, whose two upper stories they take possession of, and whose windows at the gable-end are shaded by stately chestnuts, and sometimes brushed by the quivering boughs. *           ,        .    &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7721-00000070"/> CHAPTER XX. "FE AND DEATH IN AMSTERDAM. FOR three years the'iles lived in their new residence, deprived of many of the outward com- forts which pertained to Bourchier Hall, but il the full enjoyment of that never-failing fountain of peace, a conscience undefiled. There is a beautiful law of compensation to those who attain to a clear consciousness of Divine favor through therugged path of self-sacrifice. As the outward enjoyments are given up, the inward satisfactions become in- tense and pure. Richard found himself, not only an exile from his country, but disinherited from his paternal fortunes. But he had enough for the wants of to-day; he had cast himself on that Providence that guides all things to their consummation; and, in his retreat from the angry storm, he waited the issue in all tranquillity. One truth at least his trials had revealed to him in clearer brightness, the real- ity of human virtue; for the heroic woman who shared his fortunes, and the faithful servants who held their lives secondary to his safety, gave grate- ful demonstration that there was a nobility in hu- ,   "FE AND DEATH IN AMSTERDAM.  131 mankind which could not be crushed out by ty- rants. As for Job and Lottie, they found full scope in domestic responsibilities for all their assiduities, and they kept the house lit up with their sunny be- nevolence. Slowly, nevertheless, rolled the heavy years of the exile. Sometimes he paced the boule- vards, casting a longing look towards England. Sometimes he sought the society of his brother exiles, and talked over the affairs of home, from which fresh news arrived almost every day of the atrocities of the new Pope, "the Supreme Head" of the Church of England. Sometimes he sat at the windows in the Princen, looking down into the navigable street and watching the boats as they glided along. Nothing, however, disturbed his tranquillity of mind, or broke thq strain of thanks- giving that never ceased to go up from his heart, that he had followed and obeyed the supreme law, and preserved the whiteness of an innocent mind. But his short and troublous life was nearly done. The climate of Amsterdam, though well enough adapted to Dutch habits and constitutions, was ill adapted to one bred on the Colchester hills. An offensive, mephitic air always rises from the canals; and so low is the site of the town, that the winds find small chance for its thorough ventilation. They sweep above the city with sufficient fury from the German Ocean, setting the windmills awhirl all round the boulevards, without changing the air beneath that lies dead along the streets and canals.

Oppressed with pain and languor, he had walked the afternoon upon the boulevards in order to catch the breeze; but coming in at night, it became evident that the fever was fixed fast upon him. For long days and nights trains of confused and ever-changing imagery swept in fantasy through-the hot and throbbing brain;- long processions wheeling through endless streets, led on by the headsman and his bloody axe; then changing into pompous cavalcades, that march in sight of his home on the Colchester hills, himself marching with them till parched with thirst and -worn with fatigue, yet getting no nearer to his an- cestral bowers, that mock and tantalize him in the distance; then walking alone through files of grin- ning faces, among which are his own kindred, looking for his wife and child, and looking in vain; toiling again through'wilderness-paths, seeking the way home, but/ finding no one to direct him thither. So the days of delirium passed on, till he sank at last into profound and unconscious sleep. When he came out of it, he looked up into, a face bent anxious and sorrowing over him, and felt a soft hand bathing in cordials his burning brow. It was the face of fiis faithful Anne; and he came to him- self and looked round on the familiar things of his exile-home in the Princen. "Is there any unusual light in this room?" he asked his wife. "I can see none," she-said. "Then," said he, "the light of eternity is coming on "; and he called for his child and his: servants. He asked to be raised up, and,   "FE AND DEATH IN AMSTERDAM.   133 resting his head on the breast of the Lady Anne, he took Job and Lottie by the hand, thanked them for all their faithfulness and truth, and breathed a dying prayer for their welfare; and then, with his hand laid in blessing on his child, charging him and them always to obey the Eternal Law for its own exceeding great reward, he looked up and saw the beckoning angels and the opening gates, and passed through them to where the wicked cease from trou- bling and the weary are at rest. He was buried in the land of strangers, according to the rites of the Catholic Church, in whose faith he died. There were English exiles that followed him to his last resting-place on earth, but none, after the tried and faithful wife, poured over his grave a more copious sorrow than the gray-haired old man and his daughter, the girl of warm and sunny heart, who had encountered racks and dun- geons rather than betray him to his enemies. The Lady Anne did not return to England. She would- not have her child educated amid the cruel- ties and the mockeries of the Henrican Church. She brought him up in the great commercial city, where she lived to see him a bold and successful navigator, and where at last she slept beside her husband, whose fortunes she had shared faithfully to the end. 12 &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7721-00000072"/>  PART II.

Bessie thought she never saw her mother have such a look of distress. "Why, mother, there have been worse storms than this, and I never saw you take on so. Have you -dreamed anything?" Nothing, my chubby. But I felt from the begin- ning that the Lord wouldn't prosper this voyage. I did n't dare ask him to, and I'm fearful my prayers have n't been effectual as they used to be." "Why, mother, what's in the wind now?" "Tush! sleep while ye are innocent, and dream of the angels. A bad world is this, my darling, and ye 'll learn that full soon enough." Bessie slept as she was bidden, but her mother lay awake with torturing thoughts and fears, while the wind shrieked around the windows, dashing floods of water upon the panes, and up the harbor came all night the fierce complainings of the angry sea. It was past midnight before the good woman was at rest; and hence, while the morning sun is up and the storm has spent its rage, and the waters of the harbor are empurpled with light, Bessie and her mother are still asleep, while their neighbors are astir. Knock, - knock, - somebody is at the door trying to shake it in pieces. "Are ye all dead inside? Molly! Bess Hawkins! are ye all dead, I say?"

Hawkins shambled in with his load, laid it carefully upon the floor, put a cushion under the man's head, and then turning to his daughter, and catching her up in his brawny arms, - "Why, you chuck, you bird, you little flamingo, where 's your mammy, and what 'a murrain d' ye keep locked in like a jail for in the. middle of the day?

Plymouth Bay divides into two harbors, the east- ern, called the Catwater, into which runs the river Plym; the western, called the Hamoaze, into which runs the river Tamar. The two harbors are in fact estuaries of those streams. They are about three miles apart, the space between being a rocky prom- ontory, on which the town of Plymouth stands and overlooks the bay. Furnished with these two excellent harbors, it is, after Portsmouth, a seaport of the first' importance in the naval history of Eng- land. It was nearly a year before the scene described above that Captain Hawkins, named in the old rec- ords with the addition of "right worshipful and val- iant," sailed out of the Catwater in command of the famous Jesus of Lubec, " a ship of 700 tunnes, be- longing to the Queen," the Salmon, a ship of 140, the Tiger, a bark of 50, and the Swallow, of 30, " be- ing all well furnished with men to the number of one hundred threescore and ten, and also with ordi- nance and victuall requisite for such a voyage.", It was on the 18th day of October, 1564, that Madam Hawkins saw the little fleet sail out of the, bay, with many presentiments of evil; and it was on the 20th of September of the following year that it anchored at Padstow, " with golde, silver, pearles, and other jewels great store." Old John has crossed over from Padstow, where he left his vessels in port, and, in the midst of his loving congratulations with Molly and Bess, had well-nigh forgotten his man, until the man half turned upon the floor and fetched a groan. ,    THE ADVENTURER.      141 "Why, John, whom have you brought here? That man looks dreadful sick."  He Is worth saving. Too good meat for the sharks, Molly. You must cure him." "I cure him? Why did n't you leave him aboard with the other sick. Do you expect our house is to be a hospital for the fleet??" "I tell ye, Molly, that something more than ye ken of hangs on the thread of that man's life. If you and Bess let him die, you 'd better be sunk in the sea." "But he 's nearly dead now, father.. Do ye think mother can work miracles, and raise a man out of the grave? Look! poor man, his eyes are set now. We can't raise the dead, father." "Tut, yes you can," pinching both her cheeks. "Did n't Molly warm into life Tom Woorley of the Swallow, after he had been frozen stiff and stark and, lain dead three days? I must be off to Lon- don with my freight, and if when I return this man is not hale and strong, the Lord's curse will be upon your house. Mind ye, I will- require his life at your hands." "But who is he?" "Adam's great-grandchild in the forty-millionth degree. - Don't be inquisitive about names, chuck, in these perilous times." Mrs. Hawkins by this time was bending over the sick man. He had evidently been sick a great while, and the fever had passed into the worst form of typhoid. His eyes had sunk away into their sockets, his breath and pulse were nearly gone, and  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7721-00000076"/> "2      THE ADVENTURER.          i sometimes a prolonged moan was the most decisive indication of life. She got ready his bed in a spa- cious room that looked southward upon the sea, ordered his sailor's dress to be removed, and provid- ed a warm bath and fresh linen, so that before an  hour had elapsed he had emerged from his old garb,  impregnated with accumulated fever, and was lying in comparative comfort between clean sheets, and  breathing a plentiful supply of pure air. Doctor Pomp comes in. He is a large man, well rounded in front, sixty years old, wears a white cravat, doubled wide and starched stiff. He is a man of few words, but of very significant looks. He stands by the bedside, his chin sunk behind his cravat, his under lip working in and out, while his eye surveys the patient o'er and o'er. He deals out his powders, leaves his orders, and takes up saddle- bags to quit. Mrs. Hawkins follows him out of the room.  "What do you think of the case, Doctor?" 4"The man will die," quoth the doctor, projecting 1 the under lip, by way of confirmation. An awful pause ensued.  "That is to say, madam, the man will die ac- cording to the laws of disease. What science can do in rendering the case exceptional remains to be  seen, -and he walked off, with his chin behind  his cravat.  ' I suppose he meant, mother, that, if the man  dies, science is not to blame for it; but if he gets well, science has worked a great miracle, and Doc- tor Pomp's science in particular."    THE ADVENTURER.      143 "Doctor Pomp is very skilful, my dear, and we will hope for the best. His patients very often re- cover after being desperately and mortally sick,"- and Mrs. Hawkins looked queer, from under her eyebrows. John Hawkins comes in, takes a long and medi- tative look at the wan features, waddles out of the room and out of the house, like a dab-chick, just the same as if the house and the solid land were rock- ing in a trough of. the sea, and is off to Padstow, and thence to Lo don. And now came on the decisive contest between the forces of life and death. That ugly sister whom they call Atropos hovered over the couch with her fatal shears, the edge keen and glistening for the occasion. Then Doctor Pomp would come in and stick out his under lip, and Atropos would flee his presence. But the doctor gone, the stealthy hag was sure to come back, trying now this lane of life, now that, and getting the slender and vital thread between her scissors. But Mrs. Hawkins and Bess were both on the watch for her, and ere she could give the final clip, they would dash into her face one of Doctor Pomp's powders, or one of their own cordials, and she would take herself off again, perfectly disgusted with apothecary and aromatic smells. Meanwhile the poor patient was perfectly unconscious of the hand to hand contest that was going on about the seat of life within him. He had sunk into an iron stupor which looked very much like death. "Is it all over, Doctor Pomp?   &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7721-00000077"/> "4      TIE ADVENTURER.

Early in the morning Doctor Pomp was standing in the door surveying the field of operations. "Science has done the business, Mrs. Hawkins," -and the doctor nods, and sinks into his cravat. Mrs. Hawkins is relieved of responsibility. The thread on which such mysterious consequences seem to hang is now past the danger of being clipped. They have time to speculate on the fea- tures of the stranger.

"I must lie down and make up for broken rest, and you, Bess, must give those drops once an hour." He sleeps on, long past the morning hour, sweet and placid sleep, as if unseen angels had driven   THE ADVENTURER.      145 Atropos clean out of sight, and infused healing fra- grance from their hovering wings. At length he opens his eyes; clear black eyes they are, and look unnaturally large from their deep sockets. On the opposite side of the room hung sea-shells, plumes of tropical birds, stuffed skins of strange animals, golden gewgaws. And on the side of the room at the right of him, a pair of lustrous eyes were watch- ing him. Where he had been and what had hap- pened to him, what nightmare dream had come over him, and in what place he had woke out of it, or whether indeed he were not dreaming still, were matters he could not very well make out. Bess Hawkins came to his bedside and asked, in a whisper, as if afraid of her own voice in the sick- room, "Is there anything you would have, sir?" The bewildered man did not know what he would have, and if he did know, he had not strength to speak; and so he could only gaze silently into the fair face and eyes that hung over his pillow. She guessed how it was, offered the drops to his lips, which he swallowed obediently, wiped away the dew which had gathered over his forehead dur- ing sleep, and bathed it softly in cordials, and, whis- pering in his ear, "You are better, sir,- you will be well,"--trod lightly out of the room to tell the good news to her mother. 13  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7721-00000078"/> CHAPTER II.

"And to Mrs. Hawkins and her daughter Bess, I reckon. But where 's Master Jack, and where 's the Jesus of Lubec?" "Gone to London, stored full of gold, silver, and pearls, which I suppose you helped in getting." But the man was too weak as yet to answer ques- tions. Nevertheless, he grew stronger, his wan features began to fill "out and lose their sallow- ness, and he would sit up on his couch, propped with pillows, and look out through his window upon the tumbling waves.

Get the arm-chair, Bess, and a cushion, and that bottle of spice-waters, before he faints clean away ";- and the good woman took hold of him and deposited him carefully in the chair, while Bess smoothed the pillow with her pretty white hand, and bathed his temples with the spice-waters. "Don't be troubled, my good woman. I have lain and looked so long at those stuffed pelicans and armadillos, that I have fairly looked them out of countenance, and I thought the sight of your sweet and loving faces would be an agreeable change." gAnd now Mrs. Hawlins's turn had come. She surveyed the .handsome stranger o'er and o'er, his features and manners spiritualized by the refining touch of sickness. Had he not developed into this comely manhood, under her own nursing hand, from a mere death-skeleton? and why should she not be as proud of her work as an artist, when he brings an Apollo out of the marble? And had she not a right to know something of the stranger, - who he is, and where he came from, and how he got sick, and what sort of a voyage they have had?- matters on which her husband maintained a most mysterious, and therefore a most provoking, silence. iia  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7721-00000079"/> "8      THE ADVENTURER. Was the gratification of her woman's curiosity more than a just compensation for her kindly watching and care? Y"You have friends, sir, I trust." "Very many, madam. Indeed, the human race are my friends." "You are not an Englishman, I judge." The stranger bowed courteously. "You have a father and mother, and brothers and sisters, perhaps." "I have certainly a mother and sister," said the stranger, bending his eye alternately upon Mrs. Hawkins and Bessie, till a tear started out of it, and rolled down his pale face. "I suppose you were one of Captain Hawkins's men, in his late voyage." The stranger bowed again. "And you can tell us something about it. You had a hard voyage, I reckon. Fell in with Spaniards and pirates, perhaps." A shade came over the stranger's countenance. But he replied after a pause, and an evident effort to choke down his feelings. "Alas, my dear good woman! the voyage lies in my memory like an ugly dream, and a great part of it is a blank to me. Pi- rates and Spaniards!-yes, I have fought them for the last three months, as they trooped through my poor, hot brain, and I verily believe that nobody but you and your daughter could have driven them away from me."

Two or three days after, as he looked out at the window, and saw the waves coming up into Plym- outh Bay, line after line, rank beyond rank, like an endless army, and where they crossed the sun's an- gle of reflection flashing like cohorts clad in steel, he was seized with an irrepressible longing to get out of prison, and bound like a sea-bird over the waters. There is no sense of life so intense and exquisite as in that exuberant flood-tide that comes from returning health. a"If you will steady me over the threshold, I will get out doors and drink a little of this sea-breeze that comes up the bay." And Bessie led the inva- lid into t-he sun, and along the brow of the hill that overlooks the Catwater. Looking away to the southeast, his eye traced a richly cultivated border lying along the bay under the dreamy haze of a September sun, orchards bending with fruit, fields yet green over which the bullocks were grazing, and plenteous shocks of golden grain. "What country is that?" "That, sir, is in Devon. That region is called the 'South Yams,' or sometimes the 'gardens of Devonshire.' They say it is one of the finest tracts in Old England." "'T is a sweet country, Miss Bessie; but you should see the tropics, where the tall forests are al- ways green, and it is spring the year round, and grapes hang from the trees, and birds with crimson I "13  I        '*     .  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7721-00000080"/> 150      THE ADVENTURER. --          i feathers flit through the branches, and among the wild fruits that hang over your head like great gold- en drops; and the air is so sweet with a thousand perfumes, that breathing is a luxury, and you lie down on a pillow of spices, and make your coverlet of roses. Those are the gardens, Miss Bessie." And the stranger went on with his discourse, while the. girl's eyes grew bigger and bigger with admiration and wonder. With the luxurious and bracing sea-breeze, and the joy of new existence bounding through all his veins, an hour with the stranger'had sped rapidly away, and quite as rapidly with Bessie, hearing the glowing description of wonderful lands. "Are ye crazed, both of you?" said - Mrs. Haw- kins, who came looking after them. "Are ye mad, ye silly girl? and is this the way ye take care of a sick man,--keeping him out here till nightfall, and bringing the fever back again?" And she led him in and laid him upon the bed, as if he were a little child. "Trust ye with an invalid again, I reckon!" said Mrs. Hawkins, coming back into the parlor. "Forgive me, mother," said the innocent girl, "but you don't know what wonderful things the man has seen. I forgot we had been out so long: I would n't get him 'sick for the world "; and her lip quivered with wounded sensibility. "I know you forgot, chubby; girls are apt to, sometimes. You need n't take care of the stranger. I 'll mind him and look after him. Did he tell you anything about the voyage?"   THE ADVENTURER.      151 ' He told of a paradise away in the tropics, a great deal more beautiful than the Devonshire gar- dens."'  "Meseems he's grown mighty communicative all at once,"--and Mrs. Hawkins looked wise, while a blush found its way into Bessie's cheek. "Not a word could Iget out of him, save bows and com- pliments." "Now, mother! He IlI tell you when he is strong enough, and we 'll ask him about the Enchanted "Islands, and the fire-birds that make it light all night long-with their flashing'wings; for that was what he was telling me of when you broke off his dis- course." -Not at all damaged by the airing he had taken, the stranger wallked into the parlor the next day with a yet firmer tread, and a more glowing and healthful color upon his cheeks, and was cordially welcomed to the easy-chair. Mrs. Hawkins began again on another tack, her curiosity by no means allayed touching the mysterious invalid. He felt it was almost cruel to keep up a reserve about him- self with people whose hearts had warmed towards him with so much kindness, and without which he might now have been sleeping at the bottom of the sea. "My dear good woman, you have saved me from death, and you have a right to know something of the life you have preserved. I don't know how much Captain Hawkins wants his affairs bruited in England.

With this condition he plunged into his story, and found ready and open ears.   CHAPTER     III. "'i ore God, your looks trouble me; for your eyes have a most particular appearance." "Gramei'cy, I was musing the story." "My connection with Captain Hawkins com- menced years agone, while he was carrying on a prosperous trade with the Canaries. I was a father- less boy, and I used to sit on the wharves of Am- sterdam looking at the ships as they cast off and sailed away, till they disappeared as a speck upon the ocean. One day I saw an English captain with a broad and open countenance, and I asked him to take me into his service. He consented, and my first voyage was on board the Pelican while she was engaged in the African trade, and the frank-hearted captain proved to be the renowned commander, Hawkins. Never within my memory had I been outside the bastions of Amsterdam; and so you may conceive of the transport which I experienced as we sailed into the tropic seas. The air was so trans- parent that all objects seen through it seemed to stand out as if coming to meet you, and the sea was a broad and living sapphire, into which you  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7721-00000082"/> 154      THE ADVENTURER.         ' could look fathoms down, and inspect the wondrous life of the great deep. How many hours have I lain at the forecastle, and looked down to watch the streaks of fire as they would shoot away out of sight, made by the fishes in their gambols, every motion of which seemed to light up a phosphores- cent train. Well, we came to the island of Madei- ra, and put in at the harbor of Funchal for a cargo of wines. The island rises suddenly out of the sea, lifted up on perpendicular columns of bapaltic rock, and sharp isolated peaks pierce the sky like needles. As you sail towards them, you would not guess from the craggy appearance what a paradise was embosomed among them. But they are terraced far up towards their summits, and you wind around through a succession of gardens and vineyards, the sea view expanding upon you meanwhile. We be- gan to -ascend one of these peaks from Funchal; we passed the green bananas with their beautiful feathery tops, the orange-trees hanging -out to us' their golden fruit, plantations of coffee-trees, the splendid coral-tree, the tuli'-tree, with its snowy bells mingled with the scarlet hibiscus. There were sidewalks over which wide-spreading plane-trees and willows of gigantic growth were bending their slender arms, and beneath whose shade streams murmured down the hill. We came to the vine- yards, where the vines were carried on trellises over the road, and great bunches of grapes hung within our reach. Hedges of geraniums, fuchsias, and he- liotropes bordered the narrow paths and shaded us from the sun. Higher up grew the yam, prickly-   THE ADVENTURER.      155 pear, dragon-tree, and cedar, - the aloe, agave, and sweet potatoe, - and heaths and pines crowned the summit. We passed groups of natives, in compa- nies of eight or ten, sitting under palms, and eating their morning meal, and we met others on their way to the town with fowls, bunches of yellow bananas, and strings of crimson pomegranates. S   What was very remarkable, those of our crew who had been sick, and one man who said he had coughed up his lungs, seemed to breathe in health at every step, and breathe it with the whole frame. "We left Madeira and went to the Canaries to complete our cargo, taking in large store of wines and tropical fruits, and though I did not think that these islands were quite to be compared with Ma- deira, yet they did charm us with their fertility and climate, for they seemed to have a golden summer at whatever season of the year. You will not be    surprised, I think, that I enlisted in Captain Haw-  -   kins's service; for next to living in those sunny isl-   ands, it' seemed to meiF most blessed thing to sail i   thither every year. I got the confidence of my I   commander, he trusted me largely in his affairs, and finally he let me share liberally in his gains."

The ' Pike,' as they call the principal peak, lifted its head into the clouds, white with its crown  of snow, and down to     its base we could trace the climate and the vegetation of all the- zones. They told us there of the wonderful Rain- Tree, which we afterwards found in Africa. .You must know that it seldom rains in these islands from  the sky, but the dews fall plentifully, and there is one tree that rains and supplies the ground with moisture." "A tree that rains!" said Bessie, who had been filling up with wonderment till she could not con- tain it. "A tree that rains, Miss Hawkins, and supplies the land with showers." "Does the tree thunder too? ' '"Not that we heard of.    It sends its roots so deep, among the springs, and sucks up so much water, that it trickles adown from the leaves, and men and cattle come and drink of it.      A marvel- lous thing, Bessie,-thatS, Miss Hawkins,--a kind  of vegetable well, that draws water of it- self.,"* * "In one of these islands, called Fierro, there is, by the reports of the inhabitants, a certaine tree that raineth continually, by the drop- ping whereof the inhabitants and cattell are satisfied with water, for other water have they none in all the Iland. And it raineth in such abundance, that it were incredible unto a man to beleeve such a vertue to bee in a tree, but'it is knowen to bee a divine matter, and a thing ordained by God, at whose power therein wee ought not to marvel, seeing he did by his Providence, as we read in the Scriptures, when the children of Israel were going into the land of promise, feede them ,with Manna from heaven for the space of forty years.

We kept sailing southward, and I began to wonder whither we were bound. There was one of our crew whose name was Mark, a rough, swear- ing, and drinking Dutchman, and I saw he knew more about it than I did. I suspected sorne iniqui- a   1ty ahead, for Captain Hawkins grew mighty par- * i   ticular about the daily prayers, which before had : been rather irregular.

Well, we sailed along through- those beautiful sapphire seas, and passed some small islands that aforesaid we saw in Guinie many, being of a great height, dropping continually, but not so abundantly as the other, because the leaves are narrower and are like the leaves of a peare tree."--Narrative of H Ilawkins's Voyages in Hakluyt, Vol. II, p. 596.

We anchored by a small island called Alcatarsa, and there we encountered a new marvel. We did not find any negroes, for the island was not inhabited, but birds of beautiful plumage came in flocks around us, and piped their songs. As they curved around our heads, almost alighting upon us, inviting us to reach out and take them, I could not help thinking of the awful curse and wickedness that have put civilized man and  these innocent creatures at enmity. And yet -we killed them by wholesale, and loaded our boats with them, though it did seem to me a betrayal of the confidence put in us by these innocent birds.* There was another island not far off; La Formio, inhabited by a people called Sapies, and two of our barks with their boats went thither in quest of human plunder. Eighty of our men landed there; but the natives fled before them to the woods, shooting terribly in their retreat with their bows and arrows. Our men shot at the natives with arquebuses, and it ws curious to see, when one of them was wounded, how he would look upon his wound and wonder how it came, as he could not see the missile that caused it. We tookl no captives at this place. But a few days after, the Jesus came and anchored at one-of the islands called Sambula, abounding in tropical fruits and cultivated fields and inhabited towns." a "The birds called by the Portugals Alcatarses, who -for that cause gave name to the island, not being used to the sight of men, flew so about us that we stroke them down with poles." - Hakluyt, Vol. "I. p. 597.   EI XTHE ADVENTURER.                .159 A' Towns! Do the negroes have towns ? I thought they were all savages, and lived out ,doors or in caves.l "These people lived in towns, Miss Hawkins, and I have often thought of this little island as a gem in the ocean. Their towns were built in the form of a cross, two principal streets intersecting each other, on which their, houses stand in longS and regular rows.   They are made round like a dove-cot by stakes covered with palmetto-leaves and over the roof thereof, for the better garnishing of the same, there is a round bundle 'of reed, prettily contrived, like a lover's knot. Inside they have a loft stored with provisions; and pretty apartments divided off by the rind of the palmetto-tree.  In the centre of the town, or at the intersection of the cross, there is a larger house, called the ' Consulta- tion-hous'e,' where the governor and elders dispense justice. Around these towns were cultivated fields and ,gardens; fields of mill, rice, roots, pompions, and date-trees'; goats  Ceding in flocks; palmetto- trees tapped and dropping their juices into gourd- shells, from which came rich and delicious wines." "But the people were all heathens, I  suppose." "The natives of the island were called Sapies; they were a mild, peaceable, industrious people, belonging to the negro race; heathens, I suppose, but not half so bad heathens as you find here in England. They never roasted people alive for their opinions that I   know of." " But they eat each other,' said Bessie. "Troth, I'd rather be eaten than roasted.  But &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7721-00000085"/> 160  -    THE ADVENTURER. no, Miss Hawkins; these Sapies are not man-eaters, but live on fruits and cattle, whereof they have- great abundance." "Have they got any religion?" said Mrs. Haw- kins. "Yes, madam, and a very curious religion it-is. In their dreams they see various personages whom they take to be gods. So they paint, as well as they cany the imagery of their dreams, as setting, forth the things of the invisible world." "How strange!" "Not so very strange, Miss Bessie, for that is precisely what they do here in Old England. Ev- ery man worships the god of his own imagination, and I infer that the Sapies dream out better gods than they do here in England, because their prac- tices are a great deal more just and peaceable." "' Why the mercy! Do you think us worse than   - the Africans?" said Mrs. Hawkins.  "I beg pardon, madam. If a Sapian were to     : witness the scenes of Tower Hill or Smithfield Square, I fancy he would be shocked at English   - barbarism, and perhaps would like to send over a  : few missionaries to convert you to his milder faith ; for, on my soul, he dreams out a more merciful re- ligion when asleep than your bishops and priests  e do when wide awake. At least, I judge so by its fruits. However, these Sapies were not' the only people of the island. About three years before our S visit there, a people called Samboses, from beyond Ad Sierra Leone, had invaded the island, and made   ; slaves of the Sapies."   THE ADVENTURER.      161 "How cruel those Samboses must be, to make war on such inoffensive people!" said Bessie. "Yes, Miss Hawkins, they must have got a little Christianized," said the stranger, with a peculiar curl of the lip. "However, that is the way they build up society in this world. These Samboses were warlike, lazy man-eaters, so they conquered the peaceable Sapies and made slaves of them." "Is that what you call building up society?" "Why yes, Bessie,--Miss Hawkins, I mean, - precisely the way English society was built up, tier above tier. First were the native Britons. Then came the Saxons and piled themselves top of them. Then came the Normans and piled themselves top of the Saxons; and by this time you may well con- ceive the pile grew rather heavy for the poor devils that were undermost.  That is the  way, Miss Hawkins. And as I was saying, these Samboses having got a little touch of our Christianity, which perhaps, they learned of the Portugals, at Sierra Leone? came and piled themselves upon the Sapies." "Those Samboses must be a   dreadful, horrible people," said Mrs. Hawkins. "Quite horrible," said the stranger. -However," (his lip curling,) ," they had n't got thoroughly Chris- tianized like your English bishops. TAey only cook men after they are dead. Here in England, men are cooked while alive." "Why the mercy!" said Mrs. Hawkins. "Not   much mercy in either case. However there came along to this same island another peo- ple, yet more powerful than the Samboses." 1 -4 a-  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7721-00000086"/> 162      THE ADVENTURER. '"And I suppose they formed what you call the topmost tier of society. How did they treat the Samboses?" interposed Bessie. "I will tell you, Bessie, how they treated both the Samboses and the Sapies. I have described to you their towns and villages, lying in the shape of a cross, here and there about the island, surrounded by palmetto-groves and luxuriant and cultivated fields. Well, this third set of invaders landed upon the island, stole slyly by night through the date- trees and palmetto-groves, deployed round the vil- lage, on which the moonlight lay in a broad sheet of gleaming silver, revealing the whole town in its soft and silent glare. Why, Bessie, the moonlight of the tropics is almost equal to the sunlight of England! These invaders, having lurked all about the town, would set fire to it in several places at once; and then what furrows of flame would plough in all directions through the palmetto-leaves and thatched roofs, till the whole town was in- volved in smoke and blaze! And then what shrieks of women and children just walking from sleep! Men and women rush frantic, emerging in all direc- tions from the involving ruin, and fall bewildered into the hands of the invaders, who, in the tropic moonlight, make sure of their prey. The palmetto- leaved village becomes a blackened waste, and such of the naked inmates as have not perished in the fray are carried off captive." s' O horrible, to think such things are done!" said Mrs. Hawkins, her mouth and eyes both open with wonder. "And what were these last dreadful sav- ages called?"   X            THE ADVE1TURER.   X    163 " Captain John Hawkins and his crew," said the stranger,* emphasizing each particular syllable. This was rather too much for the good woman. She turned pale as marble, her gaze bent on the narrator, compelled now to hear the dreadful tale she had evoked. -" But do you think," said Bessie, her eyes brim- ming over, "that those poor creatures mind such things as we should?" " I will tell you how they minded them. Three hundred of the poor wretches had been stowed on board the fleet, and we had already weighed anchor, and put out to sea. Presently a Sapian girl came skimming the waves like a swan, clear up to-the ship, looking into our faces with imploring agony. They took her on board, and before she could be chained, she bounded like a fawn to her mother's breast. Her mother was bleeding with a wound from an arquebuse, of which she died afterwards, but. the child clung frantic to the warm corpse, till it was torn fiom her, and plunged into the waves. She slipped through the hands of the man, and plunged after with a wild shriek, and the tnerciful sea closed over them both together " " But why did n't you raise a mutiny, and stop this ? " " Tush! It is n't so pretty a business to raise mutinies, Miss Bessie. And there was one quite cogent reason why I could not. I got poisoned  *  The cool complacency with which these exploits are narrated by one of Hawkins's men, and by Hawkins himself, is marvellous.

They have a venomous cucumber, in the juice of which they dip the heads of their arrows, so that a wound from them  is generally fatal.  I was glad of my wound, for I would not for the world have aided in the capture of those innocent and simple-minded Sapies. I expected to die, and hardly know why I did not, for the blood in all my veins seemed to turn into fire, till it ended in delirium; and then I know not how long I was fighting with Spaniards in my dreams, or running and shrieking through burning villages. We sailed to the West Indies, where Captain Hawkins sought a market for his human cargo." * "His money will never enrich him, got in this way," said  Mrs. Hawkins.    "I have fasted   and prayed over: this voyage, for I suspected what he went out for, and   I had a presentiment of some dreadful calamity." * "The 29th of this same month'(January of 1565) we departed with all our shippes from Sierra Leone, towards the West Indies, and for the space of eighteene dayes we were becalmed, having nowe and then contrary windes, and some Ternadoes amongst the same calme, which happened to us very ill, beeing but reasonably watered for so great a company of negroes and ourselves, which pinched us all, and that which was worst, put us in such feare, that many never thought to have reached the Indies without great death of negroes and of themselves. But the Almighfie God, who never sufereth, his elect to perish, sent us the 16th of Februarie the ordinary Brise, which is the northwest winde, which never left us till we came to an island of the Canybals, called Dominica." Such is the account of "John Sparke the younger, who went upon the same voyage, and wrote the same." His application of the doctrine of election is unique. See Hakluyt, Vol. III. p. 601.   THE ADVENTURER.       165 "Well, madam, his way of finding a market for his goods was quite as peculiar as his mode of get- ting them. We anchored before a Spanish town called Burboroata, where the Captain offered his negroes for sale. The Spaniards would not come to his terms. So he landed one hundred men, well armed with bows, arrows, arquebuses, and pikes, with which he marched towards the town; and this had a sudden influence on the state of the market." "Did he burn out the Spaniards too?" asked Mrs. Hawkins. " No; but he sold his negroes at -his own price. Afterwards we sailed for thie Florida coast, which we ranged and explored. There we saw serpents with-three heads,` fishes that fly in the air-" " And men that walked on their heads, perhaps,'' said. Bess, looking droll. " Fishes that fly in the air, Miss Bessie, rising in flocks from the surface of the water, and catching the sunbeams on their' slimy wings, and turning them-into a thousand rainbows;  Then we saw dolphins of goodly color and proportion to behold. We sailed up the rivers, and saw flamingoes, that fly through the woods, as' red as blood, and seem to set the woods on fire.

Sailing from Florida towards Newfound- land, we had contrary winds, and scant provisions, so that we despaired of getting home. So Captain Hawkins got all the crew together, and called upon God in fervent supplication and prayer." * "Mr. Hawkins can pray." "Yes, madam, when there is no swearing to be' done, Captain Hawkins can pray. And what with the praying, and the wind, and the swearing withal, we came safe into Padstow, as you are already in- formed. But long before this, my sickness had set- tled into a low chronic fever, and I owe it to the best of- motherly and sisterly care and kindness that I am living in this wicked world, and on the only quiet spot I have found in it for many a long day." * "In which state of great misery wee were provoked to call upon God, by fervent prayer, which moved him to hear us, so that we had a prosperous winde." -John Sparke's Narrative of Hawkins's Voy- age.

"The history of my family is a strange one, but I have no wish to conceal it. My father was ban- ished during the bloody times of Henry,'and died an exile in Amsterdam. I barely remember him, for I was not six years old when he died. But my mother often led me to his grave, and there we have sat hours together while she would tell me the story of his wrongs; and the lesson which she breathed into me, or rather which she burned into my soul, was detestation of tyranny, and religious tyrannies in particular. Her great black eye would flash fires that almost made me afraid, when she told me of my father's exile; and not half so fervently did Hannibal make his son swear hatred to Rome at the altar, as she made me take the vow against op- pression on my father's grave. She led me every Sunday to the old St. Nicholas Church, where I knelt and worshipped with her arm around me; and it seemed to me that God's spirit always entered my heart by first passing straight through hers, and that it lost none of its sanctity on the way. It was not long before my mother drew attention upon herself and her orphan child. One Sunday evening there came a lady of noble carriage to our house, which stood on a street called thfie Princen Gracht, and I remember her soothing speech and dignified manners. I found they were in consultation about me and my education, but I did not get the drift of it. ' Who was that tall lady,' said I, after she had left the house, ' ad what is she going to do with me?'  She is going to take you into her school,' said my mother. 'Does she teach school?' I asked,   THE ADVENTURER,      169 rather surprised. 'Nay, but there is a school under her patronage to which her son passes by every day, and he will call to-morrow and take you there. The tall lady is the Lady Egmond; she has a son considerably older than yourself, who attends school on the Keysers, and is just closing his studies there, and you are to go there with him to-morrow morn- ing.' "The young man came along, a youth with a florid and blooming countenance, and I put my hand in his and walked to the Keysers. He took me un- der his particular care, and there was' something so noble and generous in his bearing, that he was not long in getting my confidence and love. He watched the friendless boy with a brother's eye, for I was the youngest in the school, and stammered Dutch rather awkwardly. But if alny big boy at- tempted to jeer me or lord it over me, it was enough to know that Lamoral was on my side. So I got along mighty well, and learned Dutch and naviga- tion, until, as' I told you, I fell in with Captain Hawkins, enlisted in his service, and sailed to the Canaries." ' And your mother is alive yet? ' "I have not seen her since the memorable day when I left her at the Princen. I was to sail in the Pelican early in the morning, and I went to her chamber to bid her good-by. She had risen, and was not there. I followed on till I heard her in her closet, praying for her child, - that God would keep him upon the great deep, and above all keep him from the temptations of evil men.

She rose and printed a kiss on my forehead, which is burning there yet. I fell upon her bosom, and there all our family wrongs rolled hot through my memory,-- those wrongs which had fallen so heavily on her noble heart, but had not been able to crush out either its energy or tenderness; and there I took the vow to be true to her, my guardian angel. We parted. Her sweet image has been my talisman by land and sea. I hasten back to that room on the Princen Gracht, and woe is me if the living image / is not there still. You have brought me through this ? terrible sickness, and if it were only to do two things, you have laid me under an eternal obligation,--if  it were only to clasp'my mother once more, and tell her how her prayers have prevailed, and to find out !! him who was the generous and manly boy, or rath- }i er young man, for he was my senior by fifteen years, and who when I had neither father nor brother be- came both to me.

I've sworn eternal hatred to all sorts of oppres- sion, on my father's grave."  "This voyage never will prosper, John," said e Mrs-. Hawkins. "It is such gold as this that the Scripture calls cankered."

Before we take our leave for the present of Nimble John, whom by this time the reader has discovered to be the Little Johnny of Bourchier Hall, well devel- oped into John Bourchier Sayer the navigator, we must follow him for a few moments to Amsterdam. 15*   &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7721-00000092"/> 174      THE ADVENTURER. He took leave of Mrs. Hawkins with ten thou- sand fervent thanksgivings. "What can I do for you, madam? you have saved my life." "Speak not of it. I knew you had a good mother, for none other can have so good a son"; and she graciously received on her cheek a warm kiss from the stranger's lips. Then he put his hand into the gripe of his late commander, bidding him change his business and prosper; and the old sailor, though outwardly hard- ened by fight and storm, choked down his feelings as he gave him his blessing. Then, looking round the room: "I do not see your daughter; but I owe her too much not to thank her for all her goodness to a sick man." "She 's away this morning, minding some neces-  sary affairs. May the Lord give ye safe to your mother." The stranger walked down to the harbor, and his  vessel was soon afloat in the Catwater, and as he : turned back with a yearning heart towards the house, his quick eye saw a female form watching him from the balcony. He waved his hand, but it quickly disappeared. When Bessie came down stairs that morning, with a cheerful nonchalance her mother drew near, and spoke with unusual tenderness. "I knew how it would be with my chubby. She' has heard too many charming stories for her peace of mind. But never you be carking your little heart about it.  The stranger saw it too, and meant it, for I watched him; and he 's a good son and would n't do a mean   THE ADVENTURER.      175 thing for all the world.

John Bourchier Sayer is again in Amsterdam, after an absence of six years, during which, he has sailed over half the globe, and encpuntered all hard- ships and all specimens of human nature. He floats up the canal into the Princen Gracht, be- tween the same rows of trees, till he comes to the chestnut that still brushed the- windows of the old home. With heart almost leaping from his bosom, he hastens to the old apartments, and knocks tremulous at the door. A strange Dutch face makes its appearance. "Is the Lady Anne Sayer within?" "Nay, sir!" "Will you tell me where she lives, my good woman?"  "In the upper world, I 'm thinking. She was a saintly woman, and has gone up tp the mansions, I reckon." "Where 's her family?" "Her boy went away in an English ship, o'er the wide world." And her servants?" "I cannot tell ye, but they be gone from here." With these words knolling through his brain, he sought the residence of the Lady Egmond,  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7721-00000093"/> 176      THE ADVENTURER. "L ike one who from a distant land Returns his home to see, And starts to see -the stranger stand Beneath his father's tree." Lady Egmond was the proper person from whose lips to receive the dreaded tale. It came from her in a soothing tone of consolation, mingled with words of a serene and rejoicing faith. She had been a fast friend of the exiled family, sat by the Lady Anne in her sickness, and followed her to her last earthly rest. "Your mother died about six  months ago; her last talk of things below ran upon her absent boy, and her last look was fixed on the glories of heaven, in full sight of which she seemed gently to fall away." He learned, moreover, that Job, five years since,.had sung his/last song, and slept beside his master, and that Lottie, since the death of her mistress, had returned to England. Lamoral, son of the gentle Lady Egmond, the  generous youth who had protected his childhood, left Amsterdam long since for his patrimony in Flanders, where he had become the idol of the people, and been appointed Stadtholder, as a reward for his brilliant military achievements. Having heard this recital, he went out and paced the streets in solitude, alone in the great city and the great world. He paced back and forth by the old school-room on the Keysers, and came at last to an enclosure behind St. Nicholas Church. In one corner was a spot reserved for the burial of 'Catholic English exiles, and there was his mother's grave. It was beside her husband's, and still looked  fresh, and was without a monument. He fell down '^ '  2   THE ADVENTURER.      1" upon it, andsthere the pent-up agony found its way. The old story of the family wrongs came up more fresh than ever,-those wrongs which had at last crushed down the form of the sainted one beneath the clod on which he lay; and the waves of bitter- ness broke long and heavy upon liis soul; and even when the dusk of twilight had settled over the graves, and the moon had wheeled up the sky, his agony was not yet over. But at last a sweet image seemed to swim before the eye of his faith, as if to say to him in pantomime, I Comfort, my boy! press hither, where there are no wrongs nor troubles." He left the spot with new-made vows, and two days after, there was a simple monument upon the grave with these letters: MY MOTHER SLEEPS HERE TILL THE GREAT MORNING. *^  ' '    i  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7721-00000094"/> CHAPTER VI.

Wonderful people! it is hardly meet that such a pen as mine should describe your achievements; but I will attempt it so far forth as to make the way clear for the thread of my narra- tive. And first, let me put my reader into a clairvoyant mood, and take him to Holland on a sail up its rivers and canals. The canals intersect the whole country like network, as thick as roads in New England; and what is curious, the canals are higher than the country that lies between them. They are not dug, but built, built through what once were bogs and marshes and lakes; and then the bogs and marshes and lakes are pumped dry into them of all their water, and turned into blooming fields and gardens. So you sail along and look upon the farms away beneath you, sometimes thirty feet below high-water mark, where the men are at work in the fields, and the flocks are feeding in clo- ver. A bad job, a Yankee would think, to pump up all that water into the canals, - yea, to pump -his farm dry every morning! But look at those rows of windmills all along on the banks and dikes, with their great brawny arms whirling and whirling! These do the work. Boreas comes sweeping and howling from the Northern Sea, and why should he not be put to some use, and do the drudgery of the country?  He will do more labor when properly managed than three millions of negro slaves, and ask you for neither pork nor corn-cake in return.

Down towards the middle of the polder,--for so they call the reclaimed morass, -the windmills pump the water up into the lowest set of water-courses, then others into higher ones, and others still into the canals. So there the grim giants are standing, these lusty Briarsei, one row above another, handing water to each other by mil- lions of barrels, till it gets to the sea-level, but leav- ing the polders impregnated with an inexhaustible fertility; thus doing whaltDame Partington could not, and keeping the Atlantic Ocean swept clean out. A great country does not always measure its greatness by the extent of territories annexed. Neither Attica nor Sparta was much larger than some -counties in Massachusetts; and these Neth- erlands we have described, this country scooped out of the sea, with its polders teeming with cattle and corn, could be laid snugly into the two States of Massachusetts and Connecticut, with considerable margin to spare.* And yet, before this little country of polders and windmills, Spain, then the mightiest monarchy in the world, wielding the strength of Europe, with the gold of America pouring into her coffers, shrank crippled and cowering into the dust. In the times of which we write, 4he Northern *We mean the Northern or Protestant Netherlands.   THE ADVENTURER.      181 Netherlands consisted of seven provinces; namely, Holland proper, which, being the strength and back- ' bone of the whole, ultimately gave its name to all the rest, Zealand, Utrecht, Friesland, Groningen, Overyssel, and Guelderland. Just take your map and see these provinces clustered around the Zuyder Zee, and leaning lovingly towards each other, as if expecting to join hands against oppression. You could put them into almost any two of the New England States. And Holland (the province we mean), which singly would not greatly overlap some of our counties, was the leading power among them. South of these, and on the other side of the Meuse, lay the Spanish Netherlands,-called? thus distinctively because they did not throw off the Spanish yoke,  the two principal provinces of which were Flanders and Brabant, corresponding in part to what is now Belgium. The people of these had not the Dutch temperament and man- ners, but the French rather, and among them the Catholic religion prevailed. North of the Meuse, and among the seven prov- m inces, the Protestant doctrines had spread among all classes, but particularly in Holland, Zealand, and Utrecht. Spite of penal laws and persecutions, the people had imbibed the new opinions through the bent of their own original genius, and through the influence of the Bishop of Utrecht, and of Eras- mus, who lived and wrote at Rotterdam. All these provinces, north and south, belonged to the dominions of Charles the Fifth, Emperor of Ger- m any; and when that monarch resigned his empire, 16  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7721-00000096"/> 182       THE ADVENTURER. they passed into the hands of his son, Philip, King of Spain.* Philip visited the provinces to receive their allegiance, and swore "to preserve to all the no- bles, towns, commons, and subjects, -Whether lay or clerical, their ancient immunities and privileges." After this, the Netherlands, with the consent of the several states, were declared permamnently united under the government of one sovereign, with all their ancient rights severally secured. During a four years' residence among his Nether- land subjects, for the settlement of affairs, Philip did nothing to gain the love of the people, but dis- gusted them with his bigotry, and his austere and chilling manners. When about to depart for Spain, in 1559, it became necessary to appoint some one to govern the provinces in his absence, and it was a question of vital interest to the people on whom the choice was to fall. Two men rose prominent before them, around whom their hopes and affec- tions most fondly clung, and both of whom were destined to figure largely and fearfully in coming events. One of these was William, Prince of Or- ange. In his wisdom, foresight, and integrity the people had unbounded confidence, though as yet he had seen but twenty-six years. He was thin, pale, and thoughtful, and acquired among his ene- mies the surname of the Taciturn, keeping his se- crets profoundly locked within him, yet pleasing and affable to all who approached him. The other * This is the Philip familiarly known to English readers as the husband of the "Bloody Mary," and the real adviser and author of the Marian persecutions.   THE ADVENTURER.      183 was Lamoral, Count of Egmond, whom we have already had a glimpse of, as the youth of frank and generous bearing, but who has since become the bril. liant military commander. He was a Dutchman by birth, but had the warm Southern temperament and love of profusion and show. Though older than William of Orange by fifteen years, he lacked his judgment and penetration into the motives of men; he was generous and confiding, his countenance still open, fresh, and blooming, and his heart full of the unchilled enthusiasm of his childhood. He had a wife whom he tenderly loved, was the father of eleven children, three sons and eight daughters, all of whom regarded him with a warm idolatry. His wealth was unbounded, being Count of Egmond in Holland, and Prince of Gavres and Steenhuyzen in Flanders. There was a well-known saying, - "Brederode the noblest, Wassenaar the oldest, and Egmond the richest, of the noble families of Hol- land." Overlooking both these idols of the people, and probably for the reason that they were such, Philip placed at the head of the government Margaret, Duchess of Parma, his natural sister, whom accord- ingly he, had summoned from Italy. She was a woman of masculine appearance and strong un- derstanding, though not without natural goodness; of stature tall and large, and with 11 something of a beard on the upper lip and chin "; but what recom- mended her to Philip was that she was a most devoted Catholic, having been a pupil and penitent of Ignatius Loyola. She took up her residence at  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7721-00000097"/> 184      THE ADVENTURER, Brussels in Brabant, and a Council of State was appointed to assist her in the conduct of affairs. The Prince of Orange and the Count of Egmond were both made members of this council. Separate Stadtholders were placed over all the Provinces, ex- cept Brabant, in which the Governess herself resid- ed. The Prince of Orange was made Stadtholder of Holland, Zealand, and Utrecht, the Count of Aremberg of Friesland, Overyssel, and Groningen, - the Count of Megen of Guelderland, and the Count   of Egmond of Flanders.                Through all these smooth appearances the keen eye of Orange saw a black speck in the horizon. The Governess had been received in the country   1 with great pomp, and in a public audience the King professed his paternal care for the welfare of his  states; but at the close of his address admonished the Governess, and every member of the government,  to be diligent in executing the edicts against heretics. i Coupled with this declaration was the fact that some twelve thousand Spanish troops were left in the Netherlands. This alarmed the Deputies of the Provinces, who were then assembled at Ghent, and ? they presented a petition to the King, headed by the names of Orange and Egmond, that the troops might be removed, and the execution of the edicts !:, intrusted solely to Netherlanders. He consented,  A but those two conspicuous and illustrious names seared his eyeballs, and he never forgave it. All things being arranged, however, the King set - sail from Flushing. As he was about to embark,  1:! a number of the principal nobility came to bid him ; I   THE ADVENTURER.       185 adieu, Orange among the rest. Philip, who before had well dissembled his resentment, now inparting bent an .angry countenance upon Orange, and charged him with impeding the execution of his measures.  "It is not my act, sire, but that of the States," said Orange. "Non los Estados," exclaimed Philip, seizing his wrist and shaking it violently, " mas vos, vos, vos!"  Philip embarked, however, with flattering expec- tations on either side, in a fleet of fifty large and forty smaller vessels. Just before he reached the port of Laredo, a violent tempest overtook him; the ship in which he sailed foundered and went down, and all his baggage and jewels with it. He barely escaped with his life, and in a small boat reached the land. He bowed in worship before the miracu- lous Providence that had preserved him, and made a vow to devote his life to the extirpation of heresy. As soon as he landed in Spain, he signalized his gratitude by assisting at the burning of a number of heretics, among whom were fourteen ladies of gentle blood, the savor of whose dying agonies he sent up to the throne of mercy. It very soon became evident that the "Council of State " in the Netherlands was the merest shad- ow, and that none but the creatures of Philip had any share in the government. Among these crea- tures there was one man who stood conspicuous, and who alone had the ear of the Governess. This "Do Not the States, but you, you, you!"The form of expression was one of contempt among the Spaniards. 16            -   &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7721-00000098"/> 186      THE ADVENTURER. was Anthony Perrenot de Granvelle, a man of al- most unparalleled resources and abilities, and fit to be made the iron tool of oppression. He spoke seven languages, and was eloquent in all of -them, dictated at once to five amanuenses, worked all night with- out fatigue, was an unscrupulous and bigoted Pa- pist, and had complete control of affairs. One of his first measures was to thrust upon the people fourteen new bishops, nominated by the King, and confirmed by the Pope, and get himself made Arch- bishop with a cardinal's hat, and bring in the Inqui- sition with all its hateful cruelties. "On all sides came up murmurs from the people, that grew loud- er and louder, and broke in a storm of hatred around the person of Granvelle. The whole country teemed with lampoons and pasquinades, and the new bish- ops were threatened with death if they attempted to enter upon their sees. As the foreign troops had , hot been withdrawn, agreeably to the promise of the King, the States refused to contribute funds for their support, and the Zealanders declared- they would leave the dikes unrepaired, and their land to be swallowed up by the ocean, rather than preserve it to be overrun by a foreign soldiery. Orange and Egmond, finding themselves entirely disregarded in I the government, withdrew in silent dignity from the  Council of State, addressed a letter to the King, -described the threatened ruin of the country, and prayed for the removal of Granvelle. For the present the storm was stayed. Granvelle was not recalled, but voluntarily withdrew, and the troops were removed from the country. Orange   THE ADVENTURER,      187 and Egmond returned to the Council, and were con- sulted by the Governess as the representatives of the "patriot" party. The edicts remained unexecuted, and the enjoyment of security and liberty of con- science diffused universal contentment among the people, and the angry waves of turbulence sank down into a calm. But it was specious and delusive, and owing to the prudence of the Governess, and not to the altered determination of the King. Despatches soon arrived from Spain, ordering the decrees of the Council of Trent to be published throughout the Netherlands, and enforced to the letter, the Inquisition to be pressed down upon the people with the whole au- thority of government, and the penal edicts to be executed with' rigor. Surprised and chagrined as she read the despatches, the Governess spread them before her Council for advice. She knew the temper of her people, and she saw the blood that must flow. A stormy debate arose. The King's partisans ad- vised that the despatches be kept secret till an am- bassador be sent to explain to Philip the state of the country. Then Orange rose, and by a stroke of policy for which he incurred afterwards the censure ,of both friends and enemies, precipitated the crisis which he saw must come. He and his party insist- ed that the King's pleasure should immediately be made known, and the despatches published. That he saw the result cannot be doubted. That he ad- vised wrong is not so clear, since he knew the tem- per of the King and of the people, and that a col- lision must come at last. Right or wrong, his \                '   &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7721-00000099"/> 188      THE ADVENTURER.  advice prevailed; the decrees were sent to all the Stadtholders, and the magistrates were commanded to aid the inquisitors and enforce the edicts. Everywhere the people answered' the despatches with lowering anger, which soon burst into tumult. Inflammatory pamphlets were circulated; placards were posted on the walls of the towns, exhorting the people to resist the Inquisition and the Spanish tyranny, and every effort to discover the authors was made in vain. The nobles saw that an insur- rection must come, and that they must either guide and control the rising turbulence, or else have their own estates plundered and involved in the ruin. They banded together in a confederacy, which was signed by some hundreds of the nobility and prin-  cipal merchants, pledging mutual support in resist-  ing the Inquisition and defending the lives and prop- erty of each other. They went up to Brussels with a petition to the Governess for a redress of griev-  ances ; they went through the city on foot, unarmed i and plainly dressed; others joined them and swelled  their numbers; they formed a procession numbering from three to four hundred, and marched-to court four abreast, slowly and in solemn silence, while the crowds stood mute and the streets. were hushed before the imposing spectacle.' Seeing them plainly dressed as they came up, the Count of Barlaimont remarked to the Governess: "Fear not, they are only a troop of beggars (g'ueux)." The taunt was  taken up by other lips, and turned into a watchword  of liberty. The answer of the Governess did not  i satisfy them, and they assembled in the evening at , i   THE ADVENTURER.      189 a feast, where their vows of patriotism became fer- vent and strong. "Long live the Gueux!" rang round and round the apartment, amid mirth and wine; and the name of contempt became their boast and glory. It was adopted everywhere by those who opposed the measures of the government. They dressed themselves in a beggar's costume of gray, with a wooden cup bound in their caps, such as mendicant monks were used to carry, and made these the honored badges of liberty. Orange and Egmond did not sign the petition, and they kept aloof from all violent measures. They even informed the Governess faithfully of the con- federacy, and pledged themselves to support her. But the people were aroused, and nothing could now stay the tide except the repeal of the edicts. Margaret, the Governess, sent to the King for instruc- tions, suspending their execution meanwhile. The Council petitioned for a moderation of the edicts. The King consented to soften the decrees, in that Reformed preachers, composers, and printers should be Hanged instead of burnt, and that the punish- ment of death should be changed to banishment only, for the common people. "This moderation is murderation," said the populace, and the Reformers went on more boldly than ever. Instead of meeting in woods and by-places, they assembled in the broad fields outside the walls of the cities, flocking together in thousands, to show, they said, - how many the Inquisition would have to burn, slay, and banish." The first of these assemblies was held near Oudenarde. The people, to the number of ,   ,  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7721-00000100"/> 190      THE ADVENTURER. seven thousand, went out of the city into an open plain; the wagons formed a circuit, and girded the enclosure, on which guards of armed men were sta. tioned; a pulpit of rough planks was raised in the centre; women and children formed round it, while about the women stood serried ranks of stern men; I eoe Herman Stryker, a Reformed preacher, mounted  i the platform; a death-like silence was on the sea of faces while the deep intonations of the preacher were borne upon the wind, and rolled over the vast  multitudes; their red-hot passions took mould and form beneath his words, and became settled resolves; the congregation lifted a psalm together against the blue heavens, and then wound slowly to the gates  - of the city, and dispersed, every man, with closed lips and a knit brow, to his home. Such scenes as  these occurred through nearly all the towns of Hol- land.                        Disgraceful transactions ensued. A congregation  at Ypres in Flanders, returning from their field-wor- ship without the walls, passed by Catholic church- es with their crosses and images. "Why," thought they, '( should we be driven in disgrace, to worship God outside the walls, while the Papists sit secure amid their splendid mummeries within?" And the crosses and images became in their eyes the hate- ful badges of a religion that sought to crush them. They fell upon the churches, and emptied their sa- j cred furniture into the streets; the ways became strewed with torn pictures and broken statues. The fury was contagious. It spread frolm city to city, and from town to town.

Never were outrages more ill-timed or more ruinous to a good cause. The native Catholics, who before had sympathized with the popular mind, now took sides with the govern- ment. Margaret found means to raise troops and suppress the riots. She brought the ringleaders to condign punishment, and before many months she had restored order in the Provinces, completely broken up the confederation of the nobles, and abol- ished the public worship of the Reformers. They had built several churches. She had them pulled down and made into gibbets, on which dangled the corpses of image-breakers! ,     &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7721-00000101"/> CHAPTER VII.

THE city of Brussels stands on a theatre, across which have passed the thrilling events of the drama of history, from the days of the resignation of Charles the Fifth to the day of the most decisive battle of  Modern Europe.   The river Senne flows through a valley of beautifully diversified scenery, flanked on either side by sloping heights, and on one of these slopes is the city of Brussels. As you approach it from the west, you see it rising from the Senne as a splendid amphitheatre of houses, fill it covers the summit like a queenly crown.   At the foot of the hill, where are the quays and canal basins, the city swarms with commercial life; but as your eye rises up the acclivity it meets with   green parks and squares, surrounded by ducal palaces. At two of these squares we will pause for a single moment. The Grand Place, sometimes called the "Horse- Market," is in the centre of the upper city, a noble   THE ADVENTURER.      193 square, containing the gorgeous old Hotel de Ville, -a civic palace in the florid Gothic style, with its quaint sculptures and pointed turrets. Its pyram- idal tower rises to a summit of nearly four hun- dred feet, from the top of which you look away over the level country and along the whole valley of the Senne, and nine ,miles to the s9uth see the Waterloo plains, two hundred and fifty years from the events we are describing, to be watered with the Biood of Europe. There is another square, the large palace garden called the Park, surround- ed by four uniformly built streets, which compare well with the finest streets of- European capitals. On one of these, the Rue Bellevue, or the Street of Beautiful Views, is a spot consecrated alter- nately with as much domestic happiness and an- guish as any spot in the world. Here stood the residence occupied by the Count of Egmond, over- looking the palace garden, whose statuary gleamed through linden-trees, overlooking, far below, the soft luxuriance of .the valley of the Senne. Hither he was wont to come from the debates in the Council of State, to caress his infant son and be the sun- light of his family and bask himself in its charms. He had now four daughters in the freshest bloom of early womanhood, the oldest one happy in her recent betrothal, and he had several younger chil- dren, who kept his home alive with their prattle and play. Of his son Philip, now about nine years old, we shall hear again. In this domestic scene, which caught its sunshine from the exuberant joyousness of his own heart, he was called to decide between 17  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7721-00000102"/> 194      THE ADVENTURER. two courses of action, on which a prudent man would-have pondered well. He was summoned to the presence of the Governess, and a new oath was demanded of him and the Prince of Orange. They had not joined the "Gueux"; they had both been active in suppressing the recent disturbances. Both were Catholics.* But they were opposed to the Inquisition. They were idols of the people, and both their names were on that petition for the re- moval of the troops which first roused the secret ire of Philip. The new oath required of them " to use their ut- most endeavors to uphold the Catholic Church, to punish the sacrilegious, and extirpate heresy; and that they should treat as enemies all those whom she declared such in the King's name." Egmond and most of the Council took the oath. Orange steadily refused it. Soon after, a private interview took place between -these two nobles, and long and earnest was the con- ference. Orange charged Egmond with deserting the cause of the country, and painted in glowing colors the bloody future that was not far off. Both had received letters from the King, containing most gracious assurances of the royal favor. But the keen eye of Orange looked through the whole. Beside his unrivalled sagacity, he had secret sour- ces of knowledge. He had a spy in the court of Philip, who kept him informed of all the counsels and purposes of that wily bigot. He knew that a V Orange became a Protestant afterwards,   THE ADVENTURER.      195 Spanish army was to be sent into the Netherlands, and he knew the work they were to do. "I assure you, my dear Egmond, that we have safety only in two things. We mustlform a league among the nobles, and oppose the coming of the Spaniards, or we must fly." "No, no," said Egmond. ' Away with these gloomy suspicions! I shall do nothing to offend my sovereign. I have offended him too much already. But I have abundant assurance of his grace and clemency, and I know, from the impor- tant aid I have rendered in suppressing the riots and punishing the image-breakers, that I have everything to hope.

Orange revolving his gloomy thoughts, Egmond with a buoyant spirit seeking again his family on the Rue Bellevue, and rejoicing in conscious security. Pomp, luxury, ease, emolu- ment, the favor of a court, domestic peace, were not to be given up without the sublime philosophy which raises man above the present;-and this belonged not to Egmond. With his defection from the popular side, and the withdrawal of his immense influence, the cause of liberty in the Netherlands was hopeless for the present. But Orange was to be gained over if possible. Margaret knew well that all Holland and Zealand "waited upon his woYd. She plied every art to re- tain him and induce him to take the oath. A last memorable meeting was appointed. It was at Willebrock, a place on the Rupel, between Brussels s  , 'fi'.  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7721-00000103"/> 196      THE ADVENTURER. and Antwerp, and such important consequences were thought to hang on the decisions of the con- ference, that a Calvinist spy concealed himself in the chimney to hear it. Along with Egmond, Mar- garet sent her secretary, Berti, and the young Count Mansfeld, that their combined argument and' elo-  quence might shake the resolve of the Prince. Orange appeared with the same pale and thought- ful face, and with all the secrets of Philip's cabinet buried in his breast, where his spirit brooded upon them by night and day. Of course the combined eloquence of the three fell on him as on a rock of flint. Then Egmond took him one side to a win- dow, and used all the entreaties of ardent friendship. "It will cost you your estates, Orange, if you persist in your purpose." "And you your life, Egmond, if you change not yours. To me, at least, it will be a consolation in my misfortunes, that I dared in deed as well as in word to help my country in her hour of need. But you, my friend! you are dragging friends and country with you to destruction." "You will never persuade me, Orange, to see things in the light in which they appear to your  mournful prudence. The King is good and just.  I have claims upon his gratitude, and I must not  forget what I owe to myself and my wife and chil- dren." "Well, then," said Orange, with bitter anguish, "trust if you will to this royal gratitude; a mourn- ful presentiment tells me that you, Egmond, will be the bridge by which the Spaniards will pass over I   Aijnn AJu V TNi'1' UKRE.   7 into the Netherlands, aid when they have used you for that purpose, they will destroy you without mercy." Then Orange drew him to his breast and clasped him in his arms. Long and tenderly, as if the sight was to serve him for a lifetime, did he keep his eyes upon him, till the tears were flowing fast. They parted. "Adieu, Prince, sans terre," said Egmond. "Adieu, Count, sans tte," said Orange.* Orange resigned his seat in the Council the next day, and retired to Holland. Egmond went on towards the awful and bloody chasm whose mouth was concealed by the pendent flowers and lilies. Order has been restored, the band of the Gueux broken up, the image-breakers punished, and Mar- garet is now expecting to enjoy her regency with her people. But the hate of Philip is not satisfied. An army of twenty thousand Spanish veterans is on its way to the Netherlands, men hardened to the work of carnage in the wars of Italy. They are led on by the Duke of Alva, already famed as the wholesale butcher of men. They march at leisure with two classes of attendants, - priests and cour- tesans,- nevertheless under admirable discipline. So the vindicators of the true faith are coming! In vain does Margaret remonstrate. In vain does * These last words, given on the authority of Aubery du Maurier, Davies discredits on account of their" coarse and cruel irony."

In vain does her woman's heart prompt her to plead for clemency and conciliation with the gloomy council at Madrid. The Netherlands wait breathless before the com- ing destruction, yet with vague hopes of concilia- tion. One hundred thousand persons leave the country while the storm is yet distant. Egmond is full of hope, declaiming of the royal clemency and justice, soothing the fears and exciting the hopes of the people. He puts himself at the head of the nobles, and they go to the frontier with a pompous retinue to meet Alva. "We bid your Excellency welcome,' said Eg- mond. "Welcome or not, I am here," said Alva. Alva was a man of consummate abilities, of distinguished eloquence, of great military skill, and sternly faithful to his king. He was tall and gaunt, his face long and cadaverous, his eyes deep sunk in his forehead, whence they lowered rather than looked. He had been the most successful commander of his time, and had learned to shed the blood of his fel- low-men with as little compunction as a beast of prey. He leads the Spanish army into Brussels  amid silence like that of a tomb. Business leaves the streets, the windows of the houses are closed, and the Grand Place in the centre of the city is made a garrison for Spanish soldiers, while a deep gloom, like the pause before the thunder-crash, spreads over the city and thence over all the Prov- inces.   CHAPTER VIII. "So as she thus melancholicke did ride, Chawing the cud of-grief and inward paine, She chanced to meet, toward the even-tide, A knight that softly paced on the plaine." Faerie Queene. VERY good and proper people say that young women have no right to get in love, until some particular gentleman kneels to them, and thaws out their hearts with a profession of particular pas- sion; of which rule all young women will doubt- less take due notice. You are to behave well and proper towards everybody, but you have no busi- ness to know there is any such thing as love, and the young, handsome Duke of Castle Hall is to be precisely the same to you as Tom Snooks of Shoveldom, so far as all this matter is concerned. You are to be like Maud, and wear a cold and clear- cut face, "faultily faultless and icily regular," till some one undertakes to find the perilous way to the warm springs away in your inmost hearts, through successive layers of frost and snow.

As surely as you wake  up elsewhere, and see that other eyes have been  watching you; or as sure as you take your fever- powders from fairy fingers ;i or as sure as too soft a hand fixes and smoothes your pillow; you become completely magnetized, and your senses from that day forward are-not like the senses of other men. But enough of advice. It comes too late for poor  Bessie. In the warmth of her goodness, she took care of a sick man, till she saw health blossoming on his countenance, and she listened to his stories, told in tones quick and tremulous with gratitude. He went away, but the vision has staid with her,- and she has looked many times down the bay where the sail disappeared. But it is a year ago. And Captain Hawkins is gone, too, on another perilous voyage, and Mrs. Hawkins and Bessie both are bending anxious eyes over the bay for his returning sail, and trembling at every storm that sends its wailings into the Catwater. They are sitting at the south window one warm October af- ternoon. Mrs. Hawkins has been particularly ten- der towards her little flamingo, for she cannot help seeing that her brightness has somewhat faded, and mirth has departed from her song. "Is not that the Jesus of Lubec, mother, beating up the bay-?" "Nay, my bird, the Jesus is longer and deeper; and don't you see she has not the sign of St. George upon her colors? It 's a Dutchman.".   THE ADVENTURER.     201 Sure enough, a dozen Mynheers were on the wharf in less than an hour, greeted by divers other Myn- heers from the town, with their "Hoe gaat het," and Bin uw be kant mit Mynheer," blending with end- less and undistinguished jabber. It was not long before a tall and comely gentleman was making his way to Mrs. Hawkins's door. "Why the mercy!" said Mrs. Hawkins, " it 's Nimble John," - and all the color went out from Bessie's cheek. ' And. how is my good mother?" said he, as he entered the room, kissing her reverently; and then, turning to Bess, and taking both her hands in his: May I kiss her too?" "Why yes! and bring back into her cheek the crimson blossoms "; and the long-smothered secret of both hearts found its full utterance. He looked into her face, and the pent-up feelings of twelve months melted into her eyes as they gazed into his. He saw indeed that the laughing roses had left'her cheek, once so round and full, and that the delicate lily had come in its place, and the whole meaning of Mrs. Hawkins's words flashed upon his mind. "Why, I did wrong, very ng  ng. I never ought to have left you with this secret smouldering in both our hearts; but upon my word I did not know how it was with you. When I first woke out of that horrible fever, I thought you was the angel of my dream, and when I found that I was broad awake, and that you did not melt into air, you seemed more of an angel than ever.

I thought  when we parted company that he would be for put- ting me into one of his arquebuses, and blowing me  up against the sky. So I would not think of doing  anything that looked like plucking his bird out of his bosom." Inquiries now are made concerning the mother of the young man, and the story of grief and wrong has to be told over. "And the young Lamoral Egmond?" "Not young now, Bessie, but grown to be the Stadtholder of Flanders. He lives in Brussels, on the Rue Bellevue, where I saw 'him not a month agone, and three of his daughters, in whom his own joyous and sunny nature has been copied. Two of them, Maria and Magdalena, are not far from your age, and their wit, mirth, and bird-like songs are the life of Palace Garden. I was fitting out a merchant-ship to sail for the ports of Spain. The times looked squally, and I went to the Count for passports from the government, knowing that he stood high in the King's confidence. He was pro- fuse and generous as ever, and procured me all I wanted. But just as I was leaving Brussels, this letter was put into my hand. "' MY GOOD COUSIN: "'Put your faith in no one!

Nimble John and Bessie are among the old haunts again, in the communings of the most delicious of friendships, sitting once more and looking over into the Southern Yams of Devonshire, now brown and golden under the colorings of an October sun, when an old face appears upon the scene. "What do you here, my nimble fellow?" said the new-comer. "Whence now, Bullhead?   Anything in the wind?" "Yes, a good deal," he answered, with a big oath. "Softly, if you please. Swear in Dutch, if you swear here. This is Miss Hawkins." And the burly-headed fellow made a bow, and both sputtered Dutch for the space of half an hour. He was a stout fellow, with a red face, thick neck, and fist like a sledge-hammer, which he swung in the air when he wanted to emphasize his words. Bessie surveyed him from head to foot, with a girl's wonderment, till he turned on his heel and disap- peared. "Is that another specimen of the tropics?"

"From these may grow A hundred-fold, who, having learned thy way, Early may fly the Babylonian woe." EGMOND is indeed in the dragon's jaws. Alva at first affected to treat him with confidence, and seek his co-operation. He is summoned to the sittings of the Council; all his suspicions, if any he hias, are lulled under fair appearances. He is asked into a private room,.as if for secret consultation, where he is suddenly arrested for high treason. At first he is stunned and turns pale; but he recovers himself and delivers up his sword, saying, "That sword has done the King some service." He is taken off to Ghent, under a guard of four thousand Spaniards, and kept for trial. The trial comes on. Before-whom? Not before his peers, as he had a right to demand, in virtue of the ancient privileges of his order, but before the creatures of Alva. Alva had organized what he called the "Council of Troubles," but which soon got the name of the Council of Blood. It consisted originally of twelve; but such was the work de- manded of it, that all decent men left it, and it 18  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7721-00000108"/> 206      THE ADVENTURER. came to consist of three, - two of them bloodthirsty -fellows named John di Vargas and Jacob, Hessels, and the third a Spanish priest. Hessels generally slept during the consultations, only when a vote was to be taken he roused up enough to belch out, "To the gibbet! to the gibbet!" Before this tribunal Egmond is summoned. He denies its jurisdiction; but his plea is of course disregarded. He is charged with high treason on ninety different counts, all of them either groundless or frivolous, and he is convicted and sentenced to die. On the 5th of June, 1568, was enacted that scene in the Grand Place or Horse-Market of Brussels which turned the land- pale. A scaffold is there erected, covered with black, and around it are formed the Spanish soldiers in serried ranks. Out- side of the soldiery all Brussels has gathered, and among them many of the Gueux, disguised and' secretly armed. Through the serried columns Eg- mond is led forth to execution, attended by the Bishop of Ypres. He shows a desire to address the people. "You would excite an insurrection, said the Bishop, and plunge your friends in destruction."' He desists, but paces the scaffold with noble dignity, having on a black Spanish cloak fringed with gold lace. But he cannot even yet believe that he is to die, and turning to Romeo, the officer in attendance, - "Is there no hope of pardon?" Romeo shrugs his shoulders, and looks upon the ground. Egmond throws off his cloak, kneels and prays, and gives his neck to the fatal stroke. The !   THE ADVENTURER.      207 blow fell on every heart, and loud sobs broke the appalling silence. Tears rolled down the stolid faces of the Spanish soldiers themselves, and even Alva, who watched the execution from a window of the town-house, wiped his eyes as his victim died. As the ranks of the soldiers began to give way, the people rushed in from every side to dip their hand- kerchiefs in the blood, and take the secret vow that blood so noble should be avenged. In that crowd two men found themselves side by side. The fierce countenance of Mark meets the pale face of Sayer, on the spot' stained with the sacrifice. "Are you here then, my nimble fellow?" said William Mark. "I swear to you that this beard shall not be cut till this blood has been avenged." "It will be avenged, Mark, as true as God is looking down." It was Egmond's last wish to die honorably for his country. But never could he have died in a manner which was really more propitious to her cause. - Not all the horrors of the Inquisition, not all the blood which thus far had flowed, inspired men's minds with so much of detestation, or wrought within them such mighty resolves. Every drop pf the blood now shed was to spring up an invincible army. As Sayer was retiring from the Grand Place, a paper was put into his hand from the crowd, hav- ing on it the picture of a gibbet, and under it the single sentence, "Beware!--your name is before the Council of Blood." It had no signature, but he knew the handwriting. Nevertheless, he passed over into the Palace-Garden Square, and down the  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7721-00000109"/> 208      THE ADVENTURER. Rue Bellevue, and paused before the house whose windows were hung with black. All was silent, for grief too deep for utterance turns the face to marble. He sent in these words: "My vessel is at Antwerp, and at the command of the Lady Egmond," - and received in answer, "The Lady Egmond and family will sail for Amsterdam to- morrow night." To-morrow night came, and an aged woman, the one who had been the friend of Lady Anne and her orphan boy, has come to Antwerp,'under the pro- tecting shadows that tenderly veil her grief from human gaze. Her grandchildren are with her,- the children of the murdered Count. The sunshine has left the Rue. Bellevue, the bird-like songs are hushed for ever, and beneath the black mantle of sorrow these female forms, with their young charge, tread the deck of the vessel, which soon bears them away to Flushing, and thence to Amsterdam. What a scene do they leave behind! All Flan-. I ders and Brabant have become a charnel-house. Besides Egmond and Van Hoorn, eighteen of the Netherland nobles were executed. Eighteen hun- dred persons perished in a few weeks, and yet the cry every day by the Council of Blood was, for a hundred victims more. Every one who had either joined the Gueux, or at any time sympathized with them, was declared a traitor; and that included nearly every man and woman in the Netherlands. All the ways leading to Brussels and the principal  cities were lined with gibbets; yea, the trees were loaded with corpses, and the living walked through aD   THE ADVENTURER.      209 the fetid avenues of the dead. Alva declared that the whole land should be a desert rather than a, single heretic remain in it. The very men who had brought in the Inquisition fell victims to it, several being put to death on the charge of remiss- ness, and none but Alva's bloodhounds themselves were safe. The Gueux, who lurked in all the provinces, were hunted out with tenfold ferocity. Thousands of them escaped out of the dragon's jaws, and crowded into the southern towns of Eng- land, - Maidstone and Canterbury were filled with them. Others lived upon the sea,- a terror to all Spaniards upon the deep, - and acquired the name of the "Water Gueux'." So the country was emp- tied of its best population as the crimson billows swept over it. Orange had retired to Germany in season to save his life. When Granvelle heard that Alva had. the principal of, the nobles in his power, he asked quickly, "Has he caught the Taciturn?" and on being answered in the negative, "Ah! then," he re- plied, "if he is not in the net, Alva has caught nothing." Sayer landed his precious freight in Amsterdam, at the ancestral mansion of the Counts of Egmond. He belonged to the Gueux; the Council of Blood was septing his track, but in a few days his vessel was safe anchored in the Catwater. as - - ,t;.   18* \  .

IF we were writing a novel, we suppose we ought to begin with love, proceed through fearful labyrinths, and end at lastwith marriage. But we trust the reader has found out by this time that we are writing truth instead of fiction, simply because the former is the more marvellous of the two. We only reserve to ourselves a little background, and a small margin of romance, in order that the truth may look out in bolder relief in front. Sayer is in Plymouth, safe from the scent of the Spanish hounds, though looking back with a bleed- ing heart to the horrible work of the Inquisition in his adopted country. The name of Gueux, as- sumed at first as a title of glory, has come, indeed, to express again what its name properly imports. Hundreds of thousands, who once gloried in the name, are now  driven to starve in woods and hiding-places, or to hang on trees and gibbets; to live in wild adventure on the deep, or to beg for home and shelter in foreign lands. Happily for our adventurer, he has escaped, with his vessel and a-   THE ADVENTURER.      2" good share of his property, and is safe in his old asylum, which stands on the promontory that over- looks Plymouth Bay. There is no news from Captain Hawkins, though the month of January, 1569, has set in. Any allu- sion to the voyage causes Mrs. Hawkins to sigh, and ejaculate a prayer. A sail at length is beating up the bay, before a stiff northern gale. But it is not the Jesus of Lubec. It is the Minion, and she looks shattered and forlorn enough; and as she comes into the Catwater, about twenty human be- ings, quite as shattered and forlorn, crawl out of her. And Captain Hawkins is among them. He reels and totters, but his foot has scarcely touched land before his flamingo is at his side. Pale and haggard, he comes up to the house, leaning on her shoulder, and breathing hard and short, and she hands him to the great arm-chair, and falls upon his neck with kisses. The strong man is bowed down, and weeps like a child in his daughter's arms. Mrs. Hawkins is full of tenderness, but cannot help putting in hints about her presentiments, and about the advice thab she- gave; but an imploring look from Bessie, which seems to say, "Not now, mother, - pray don't," prevents all this, and there is nothing but condolence and sympathy for the broken man. As Nimble John appears before his old master, a faint smile plays over his master's sallow face, while he takes the hand into his feeble grasp, and groans aloud: 4 O my good fellow, never cease to thank God for the misery you have been preserved from!"  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7721-00000111"/> 212         THE ADVENTURER.

Hawkins and his men took between four and five hundred negroes from the coast of Guinea, sailed with them to the West Indies, and there disposed of them. But passing by the west end of Cuba towards the coast of Florida, they encountered the "Furicanos," which shattered the fleet, and they put into the Spanish port of St. John de Ulloa, to refit. Soon after, a Spanish fleet of thirteen great ships hove in sight, and came into the, harbor. Captain Hawkins made with them a treaty of amity, which the faithless Spaniards only used as a snare. When matters were ripe for an outhreak, the viceroy blew a trumpet, and, as Hawkins relates, "Of all sides they set upon us. Then all the ordinance upon the ilande was in the Spaniardes handes, which did us so great annoyance that it cut all the mastes and yardes of the Jesus and sunke our small shippes." - The upshot was, that only the Minion, and a small bark called the Judith, escaped. Nearly all the men were either massacred by the Spaniards or per- ished miserably afterwards. This remnant of the fleet came into the harbor of Cornwall, January 20, 1569, "lean, rent, and beggared," both- by Spanish shot and the strumpet wind. Captain Hawkins closes his melancholy narrative in these words: "If all the miseries and troubelsome affaires of this sorrowfull voyage should be perfectly -  and thoroughly written, there should need a painfull man with his pen, and as great a time as he that wrote the lives and deathes of the Martyrs."

Under such nursing as he had, Captain Hawkins was not long in rounding out to his ancient dimen- sions, and recovering from the collapse of starva- tion. He is sitting in his chair, with Bessie in his lap, who is combing out the knots and tangles of his shaggy beard, and smoothing back his long hair from his temples, till she has made him look almost as apostolic as he claimed to be. "I guess you won't be wicked any more, nor con- vert any more of those poor Sapies, as you call it." "Nay, old Jack Hawkins will mind his little birdy, for the Lord has touched him with his finger. Old Jack must-reef his sails a little," and a tear was starting in his eye. "Now will you mind your birdy, though?" and she held his head between her hands, and looked with strange earnestness into his face, as if explor- ing his honesty. Yea, - yea. Old Jack has but just escaped the whirlpools that well-nigh had gulped him down.

"'Nay, but Nimble John has taken me and put me into his heart, and I'm to go off with him among Spaniards and Inquisitions, and be his omen of mercy, he says; and now what will you do when you come home wrecked and a-weary?" "But Nimble John won't do any such thing with my silly girl. He won't take her among Spaniards without asking me, nor steal her from her dear old father!" "Nay, Johnny won't do that, but he will ask you, and you won't cry him nay." The great breast on which the ocean storms had beat for so 'many years heaves convulsively, and the iron features are wet with the trickling rain. Nimble John, at length, is called into the room.

The shops are all shut, the inns are closed; the brewers will not brew, the bakers will not bake, and the garrison cannot be supplied with provisions. Then Alva determines to hang seventy of the principal shop- keepers before their own doors, and ladders and ropes are already prepared for the purpose. But before the hour comes, Alva hears news that makes him pause! The Gueux had been driven from the ports of Sweden and Denmark,-and England was the only country that gave them shelter. In her southern ports their vessels had sought a refuge from the Spanish rage. Alva remonstrates with Elizabeth against her harboring heretics and rebels, and de-        I?t  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7721-00000114"/> 218     'THE ADVENTURER. mands of her that they be driven from her domin- ions. Elizabeth is not now in a condition to break with Philip, and complies. She issues her procla- mation, and commands the Gueux to leave thy ports of England. Alva in his blind fury does not know the thunderbolt he is forging for -his own head. Sayer was watching anxiously the progress of events, when the mandate came which would eject both himself and vessel from the Catwater. Whith- er? The last refuge in Europe was now denied the Gueux; not a foot of solid land was left for the soles of their feet to touch upon, and they had, only to betake themselves to the open sea and the God of nature. At the time of the Queen's proclama- tion, Sayer had resided three years in Plymouth, amid his own household, made bright with the love- light of Bessie, and musical with her song. Another Johnny Bourchier is just peeping into this trouble- some world; a little-fellow of two summers, who has stolen some of the rose, though none of the laughter, out of her cheek, and in that little paradise of wedded love is all unconscious of the wicked- ness outside. Sayer, on hearing of the proclama- tion, goes up to the old mansion by the Catwater, leaving his flamingo and her little charge at bo- peep with each other. "I am to leave you, my old commander, and you, my best of mothers, and I must put my birdies un- der your wing for a little space.

Don't fire your arquebuse too quick, man!" "Nay, my old commander, but I must clear your port, and. I'll take the best aim I can, when time and opportunity come." Three days more, and he is sailing out of the harbor. There are sorrows and forebodings in all hearts but little Johnny's, who "dances up high" in his mother's arms as she looks her last. Sayer puts on his bravest look, for men are wanted now, and sails out of the bay and out of sight, and dis- appears from our story at present. May we meet him again! Hunted out from their last places of refuge, the Gueux are mustering and preparing to quit the har- bors of England. Dover is their place of rendezvous, and there twenty-four ships have come together laden with death, and with men ready to brave anything in the last struggle for a final foothold upon God's earth. What desperate-looking fellows they are! They have encountered all the winds of heaven, and all the storms of the deep; they have sailed a thou- sand times into the throat of destruction in the chase after Spanish galleons and transports; their faces are scarred and seamed, and frightful to be- hold; one has lost an arm, another a leg, and an- other an eye ; but halt and maimed as they are, they are thirsting for revenge, and doubly nerved to get it. Their hatred of Spaniards amounts to a frenzy, but they are under admirable and exact discipline, and their red-hot passions kept under for occasion. &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7721-00000115"/> 220      THE ADVENTURER. On the cap of each is a silver crescent, bearing the motto, "Rather Turk than Pope." Such is the force which Alva has driven together, and he de- mands of Elizabeth that they shall quit England. They will quit undoubtedly!. Already they are lying off Dover, and lowering down upon the Netherlands more grim than the ferryman of hell. And the fiercest and grimmest among them is in command. It is WILLIAM VAN DER MARK, his hair and beard uncut for four years, he who took the vows of vengeance over the smoking blood of Egmond, and who is now the Admiral of the "' Water Gueux." We trust the reader is not one of those foolish people who read histories and historical novels with- out a good map before him. Please then look down upon the little, devoted Netherlands, and search out the towns of Briel and Flushing. The first stands at the mouth of the Meuse, and commands its navigation; the- second is on an island near the mouth of the Scheldt, and commands the naviga- tion of that. These are the two principal rivers that drain the Netherlands. So that, even if you have not much of military genius, which we hope is the case, you may still see that these two seaports are the keys of the country, and that he who com- mands these, lets in destruction or keeps it out at pleasure. The c"Water Gueux" have left' Dover, with Mark at- their head; he who swore terribly in Flanders, and who swears terribly yet. They sailed for the island of Texel, at the entrance of the Zuyder Zee, but stress of weather has diverted them, and brought    THE ADVENTURER.      221 them around into the Meuse, and they suddenly ap- pear before Briel. The Spanish troops have been removed into Utrecht to harass that province, and so Mark seizes upon Briel, in the name of the Prince of Orange; and within twenty-four hours, thirteen Romish priests and monks are hanging upon gibbets, and the Romish churches are stripped, and the images smashed in pieces. This news comes to Alva at Brussels, just as he has got his ropes ready to hang the seventy shopkeepers; but he stops suddenly. He has something else to do. Flushing is next surprised and surrenders, and the Gueux take possession. Then one town after another in Holland raises the standard of revolt against Alva. The Spanish garrisons have been enfeebled, because the soldiers are wanted to crush Utrecht; Mark is on the watch, and sends in sup- plies and succors to the insurgents, and within three months from the capture of Briel not a single town in Holland, with the exception of Amsterdam, re- mains in .subjection to Alva and his governor. The Gueux have come with a vengeance; they have liberated Holland from the garrisons; the little state stands erect and defiant to the Spaniard, and through all her towns the Orange flag is floating on the walls. Alva himself begins to quail. He asks the deputies of Holland to assemble, and offers to remit the tax. They do assemble, not in the spirit which he expected, but to assert their free- dom, and throw off the dominion of Spain. ,But a conflict is to come. As soon as Alva can settle affairs in the Catholic Netherlands, he rein- 19*  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7721-00000116"/> 222      THE ADVENTURER. forces his veterans to subdue once more the rebel- lious province. Sneering at the peaceful pursuits of the agricultural Hollanders, he expects soon to crush them again, and swears he will "smother them in their own butter." Before we see the little state lie torn and bleed- ing under the tusks of the boar, let us look at it one moment as it is described by a contemporary writer, who resided among its people just before the troubles began. Guicciardini, who sailed over its canals, lined with rows of willows and ilxdustrious windmills, and looked down into its polders, and had intercourse with its inhabitants in town and country, says: "- This little corner of the earth abounds with people, with riches and virtue, and everything that the heart of man can desire. Not the most minute portion of the land is without its production; even the sand-hills afford food and shel- i ter to vast quantities of rabbits, esteemed for their  delicate flavor; and on every creek of the sea are to be found incredible numbers of water-fowl and , their eggs, both of which form a valuable article of export to the Belgic provinces." The men are de- scribed as "brave, active, and industrious, devoted to freedom, but faithful and obedient subjects." They are also " humane, benevolent, and affable, lively and facetious, but sometimes rather licentious i in their jests "; they are "' upright and sincere," but addicted to two vices, covetousness and drunken-   i ness. They are fond of learning and the arts, and have large numbers of scientific men, and even the peasantry "can read and write well." The women   THE ADVENTURER.      223 - have extraordinary beauty of shape and counte- nance," are remarkable for their chastity and pu- rity, but are in no degree " timid, shy, or reserved." They " walk and travel alone in confidence and security "; they " mingle in all the active business of life, such as buying and selling," which, the au- thor observes, with great want of gallantry, "must increase their natural love of domineering and grum- bling, and there can be no doubt makes them impe- rious and capricious."' Such are the peaceful Hollanders; but Alva will probably find it difficult to " smother " them. Their little strip of land measures some seventy- five miles by thirty, and could be laid snugly away in the State of Connecticut, with considerable room to spare. Philip is to force the Inquisition upon them, and for this purpose he has the strength of Italy, Germany, and Spain, the Southern or Catho- lic Netherlands, the most experienced commander of the age, and all the gold of Spanish America to carry on .the war. Fearful odds!--but God is looking on. x Quoted by Davies, Vol. I. pp. 486, 487. 1   &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7721-00000117"/> CHAPTER    XII. ' Nature provides exceptions to every rule. She sends women to battle, and sets Hercules spinning." - MARGARET FULLER. THE troops of Alva are on their march towards the devoted province, and wherever they have passed there is a track of carnage and desolation. They have pillaged Zutphen, and now they are coming into Utrecht to the town of Naarden, close on the borders, of Holland. Naarden surrenders, on the condition that the lives and property of all the in- habitants shall be preserved, and that they shall take a new oath to the King of Spain.  The burghers are summoned to the guild-hall to take the oath, and the town overflows with Spanish soldiers. The hall is filled with the unarmed citizens, while the soldiers stand in front, headed by a priest, who turns suddenly towards the people, and bids them prepare for death. Then the muskets are levelled towards the defenceless multitude, and at a signal given five hundred lie dead on the floor of the guild- hall, which is immediately set on fire, and wrapped in flames. And then follows a scene of slaughter in all the streets, compared with which the policy of Herod were mild and humane; all of which   THE ADVENTUHEIt.      O meets with the highest approbation of Alva. Hol- land looks on aghast, and sees in Naarden her own portending doom; for the way is now clear, and the butchers march through Amsterdam, and invest the city of Haarlem. The citizens waver, and hesitate at first whether to make a defence. They see the weakness of their fortifications, and the numibeys and discipline of the enemy, whose hands are yet reeking with the blood of Naarden; and the government of Haarlem sends secretly to make terms with the Spaniards. But one Wybald van Ripperda stands up, and with his rousing eloquence touches every chord of hero- ism; the people answer everywhere with a shout of enthusiasm, and they arm for the defence of their town. A memorable siege follows, in which the uncon- querable spirit of the Hollanders begins to appear. They build an inner wall, higher and stronger than the old one, and for this purpose men, women, and children join in the work. There is a lady of noble blood, Catharine Hasselar, who forms a regiment of three hundred women, and they not only use the pick-axe and spade, but with the sword and musket they deal death to the enemy from the top of the walls. These probably are some of the "impe- rious" women whom Guicciardini speaks of, but who have learned to do something a good deal more practical than " grumbling," and who have no idea of being smothered in their own butter. For seven long months do the citizens of Haarlem hold out against the besiegers, in hope of succor from the  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7721-00000118"/> 226      THE ADVENTURER. Prince of Orange. The besiegers try the effect of cruelty and intimidation, and hang their prisoners in sight of the town. Whereupon a row of gibbets appears on the walls, from which an equal number of Spanish prisoners dangle in the air. It is un- christian retaliation, but it is done. The besieg- ers throw over the wall into the city the head of one Philip King, whom they have taken prisoner in an unsuccessful attempt to relieve the city; and on it is this inscription of cruel irony: "This is the King who should have relieved Haarlem." They are answered with irony quite as sharp and cutting. Eleven barrels come rolling down from the walls towards -the enemy's camp, bearing the inscription: ' This is the tithe, with interest, for the payment of which Alva has besieged Haarlem." They open the barrels, and find them full of decapi- tated Spaniards. Unchristian retaliation again; but we 'cannot help it; for it was done. For seven long months this siege and defence are carried on, but no relief comes to the doomed city. It falls at last, but not till it has cost the lives of twelve thousand Spaniards. Ye could conquer the Inquisitors, but ye could not conquer starvation and pestilence, not the three hundred brave women even, with' the no- ble Lady Catharine at your head. It capitulates, and the hateful Spanish garrison comes in with the usual bad faith and cruelty which render the Span- ish name a stench in our nostrils. And now comes the hour of despair to the little, devoted commonwealth. What can she do before the invading foe? Her army is no match in the   THE ADVENTURER.      227 opensfield for the veterans of Alva, and the dispirit- ed exiles who had returned to their country prepare for a second hight, and all the towns expect, in mute and gloomy despondency, to share the fate of Haarlem. Alva says, if they do not submit, he will exterminate them with fire and sword, and give-the land to strangers. Now then the powerful voice of Orange is heard, rousing all the energy of the little commonwealth, and touching that deep chord of religious enthu- siasm which heknows how to touch so well. "The King of kings," says he, "is our ally, and in him will we put our trust. Is it because the misfortunes to which all men are subject have fallen upon you, that manly courage has fled entirely from your hearts? If God has done what it pleased him with Haarlem, is it therefore that his arm is shortened? Has he forsaken his Church, that it should deny him? Cast away from you all idle fears! Rouse within yourselves the courage of former days! Do your duty, and the blessing of God shall be yours!" All murmurs cease; new fire rolls through all the veins of the little state; the towns and cities repair their fortifications; the finances are replenished; the army is put on a better footing, and they wait still, but determined and defiant, before the invaders. The town of Alkmaar comes next in turn. Alva has sent his son, Don Frederick, to lay siege to it, at the head of 16,000 men.  Look on the map and see it, lying up north of Haarlem some eighteen miles, amid meadows of sweet clover and fat kine, where Alva will find plenty of butter; a town well  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7721-00000119"/> 228      THE ADVENTURER. fortified, with the canals flowing through it and all around it, shaded with beautiful trees. Thirteen hundred armed burghers have mustered upon its walls, with eight hundred soldiers, to welcome the invaders. And is this all ye have, ye gallant few, to oppose to Alva's sixteen thousand human bulldogs? No, it is not all. The spirit of those " imperious ' women is up again. Companies of women, and girls without any consumptive symptoms, help drive back the onslaughts of the Spaniards, even where the fight is the thickest and the hottest. The wife and daughters of Mynheer hand to him the stones and burning missiles as fast as he can use them, and say to him "Ply them surely and plumply on the pate of the Spaniard, or else make way for us." Plump and sure they fly, till not a Spaniard dares lift his pate above his bulwarks, or if he does, he gets it cracked in two. But a month has gone; no reinforcements can be conveyed into the town through Don Frederick's thick line of forts, and the provisions begin to fail. "What can we do now?" cry the despairing burghers; " for neither men nor girls can fight without food, and the Spaniard is gaining upon us." Drown hinm," is the quick and desperate resolve. And no sooner resolved, than the dikes are opened; the canals are let loose from their beds; the polders are filled with water; the country around the town is turned into a lake; it rises higher and higher, till it surges over those of the sixteen thousand Spaniards, whose heads the burghers and the girls have left whole; the enemy's -camp breaks up, and they crawl off, half drowned,   THE ADVENTURER.      229 over the dikes, and slink, drenched and dripping, away to Amsterdam, appalled at the new method of defensive warfare. And the cry of victory goes up from the brave men and women of Alkmaar; and the windmills must now go to work and pump the polders dry again! The potent, touch of Orange has stirred up all the national life, and the blessings which he prom- ised have begun to dawn. Mutiny breaks out among the unpaid troops of Alva; the remittances from Spain fail him, and his own bloodhounds turn against him and against each other. They prey upon and plunder the loyal and Catholic por- tion of the Netherlands, and Alva summons the Deputies of the States to assemble at Brussels, in order to- obtain from them a vote of subsidy. They assemble, and Holland sends to them an appeal, which strikes on a chord of patriotism that vibrates as to words of fire. "Rise and join us, and free Zaire, yourselves from Spanish slavery. If all the forces of Spain, .Italy, and Germany have not been able to conquer this little strip of land that makes the Province of Holland, how easy would it be to eman- cipate all the Netherlands, if united in a common cause? If Holland is subdued, Alva will then take vengeance on all the Provinces. But we will not be subdued! We are determined to perish, town by town and man by man rather than submit to so disgraceful a slavery." It- had its effect. Not a single pistole will the Deputies vote for Alva and his bloodhounds.

He sullenly quits the Netherlands, leaving a name behind him which in all time to come is to pass human lips with hisses and execrations. And yet he was only the fitting- tool of the royal bigot at Madrid, who approved of all that his agent had done. Holland has a fearful crisis to come yet, but she has time to breathe a little now, -until a new commander is sent, and the troops are reorganized. -   CHAPTER XIII.

BUT what has become of Nimble John? Alack, he has not been heard from for a whole year since his sail disappeared from the Catwater, and there is all the anxiety and agony and chronic grief of long suspense in the house of the " valiant and worshipp- full John Hawkins." The missing man sailed off with a crew of Water Gueux, among whom was Peter van der Mark, the old comrade of Sayer, and kinsman of the Admiral. He should have joined the Admiral's fleet off Dover, previous to their memorable descent upon Briel, but Briel was taken, and neither Nimble John nor his ship appeared there. Meanwhile, it goes not smoothly with our darling Bess, for she dreams of shipwrecks and truc- ulent Spaniards, and her lost Johnny gone down among the ocean graves. Perhaps, however, he did not join the Water Gueux, not liking the com- mand of their brutal and ferocious Admiral; per- haps he has sailed off on a private venture, and is I   &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7721-00000121"/> 232      THE ADVENTURER. safe somewhere; but then again, perhaps, the Fu- ricanos or the Inquisition have got him, and a thousand other dreadful perhapses disturb the peace of poor Bess and her mother. All the news from Holland, and especially from Amsterdam, is sought and sifted, but they do not sift out the name of Nimble John. Meanwhile young Johnny has fallen ill, as young Johnnies are very apt to do. What ails him we cannot tell, only he keeps up a croupy breathing and barking; and if it is not croup of the most decided and malignant character, we do not know what it is. At any rate, we expect the poor little fellow will strangle and turn black and die before morning, and with the loss of both her Johnnies, we fear, indeed, that poor Bessie would quit for the skies. The doctor is called by sunrise, and a great white cravat appears moving down the street, with Dr. Pomp peering over from behind it. Why can't he stir a little faster," said Bessie, "when the child is a-dying. He seems to be taking a pleasure walk of a summer morning, and he looks cool enough to be a moving refrigerator." "Why, my sweet sister, you must consider that people die almost every day, and if Doctor Pomp ran always at such times, he never would get a chance to stop running." So answered Richard Hawkins, who has returned from a three years' cruise, to find his sister a wife and a mother mean- while. He has a peaked chin, and a bland smile, and we suppose from his self-satisfied look that he has made a prosperous voyage.   THE ADVENTURER.      233 But Doctor Pomp brings up at last to the sick child, whom he looks at for the space of a minute; and we infer from the motion of his under lip, that he thinks science will cure it; for he deals out his drops, and holds up the phial between his eye and the light, and looks through it with a profound squint, which counts every vitalizing particle in the mysterious compound. "Ten drops every half-hour till vomiting begins.- Shocking work in the Netherlands, Mr. Hawkins." "Anything in particular?" said Richard; and Bessie's eyes and ears opene. wide. "Well, sir, they make shocking mutilation there of the human frame, particularly of the osseous portions of it. A man breaks his leg through the regular operation of natural'laws, and there is some pleasure in setting it. But it's bad work when men break each other to pieces. I had a whole cargo of broken limbs and skulls to mend last night. But i    ittle science can do, when her rules are so totally disregarded in the matter of wounding and killing." Were these men brought in from the Nether- lands?" asked Richard Hawkins.  "Yes, sir. One man, sir, had the os frontis driv- en clear into his brain. A moderate blow would have made a fracture that science can deal with. But in this case the osseous portion was driven into the pia mater. Strange that men will fight so like demons, instead of taking it moderately. And there was another man who had the os pelvis smashed fine as pebble-stones. Impossible to do 20*  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7721-00000122"/> 234      THE ADVENTURER. anything with it but make a new one, and that, sir, is out of our province." "Are these Spaniards that you have been patch- ing up, Doctor?" "No, sir. -Ah, the drops are working off the phlegm, - pulse not so wiry, - freer passage. through the trachea. -These were some of the Water Gueux. They lie in wait off Flushing, and watch for the Spanish transports at the mouths of the Scheldt, as a cat watches a rat-hole. Then they bear down upon them, and snatch them, and bring in their prizes to Middleburg. Well, sir, it happened that one of their ships got separated from. the rest, and was chased by the ships of Alva clear into the Channel. At length the Spaniard grappled' the Dutchman; they fought desperately, and the latter was likely to be captured; whereupon one of the crew of the Dutchman, who sat grimly upon the powder-magazine, touched it off, according to his orders, and Spaniards and Dutchmen blew up into the sky together, and rained down promiscu- ously into the water. An English vessel happened along and picked up the fragments." "' But don't it kill people to be blown up?" asked Bessie. "It 's very apt, madam, to injure the cellular tis- sues, and that too beyond the power of science to repair. However, some of these Gueux came down nearly as whole as they went up. They fight like devils, and are about as hard to kill; and it is their rule, I understand, to blow themselves into the air rather than be captured by the Spaniard. But   I.0 ,/     THE ADVENTURER.  they are bad fellows to mend, madam, -very bad, -and it does seem to me a pity, after God has taken pains to make us so wonderfully, that we should unmake ourselves so shockingly, not to say shabbily. Breathes easier, flesh softer. The little fellow will be jumping about the house to-morrow. Good morning." But Bessie followed him out of the door, and, with a heart that doubled its beat, asked Doctor Pomp, "Did you hear anything of my husband and his vessel?" ' I put that very question to those fellows, - at least to what was left of them, -and they said they had heard of your husband doing service under the Prince of Orange, but'they could not tell where. But," he added, in a kindly voice, touch- ing her gently upon the cheek, "don't let this cheek lose all its rubies; your husband won't be blowing himself into the sky by physical force; he is too sensible a man for that, and when the time comes, and' not before, he will go up there the natural way."  Small consolation was this to Bessie, for she knew very well that her husband's kinsman, Sir John Sayer, was in the service of the Prince of Orange, and that the two might very easily be confounded. But it is something to build a hope upon, and she forms the brave resolve of going to find him. But what can you do, Bessie, and how can you think of going, without chart or compass, "  into that sea of blood and storm?

"Nay, answered Bessie, but I promised to be his dove of good omen, and hover about him in- the hurricanes, and I shall certainly go along with you till we find him." "Mad,  mad, - ye silly girl!

On one of the polygonal streets that form the outer circle of the half-moon,-the shape, as the reader will remember, of the city of Amsterdam, - was the house of the Lady Egmond. The street was called Heeren Straat, and was away from the noise and turmoil of the business portion of the great commercial city. The canal-boats passed along its silent and shaded highway; but no sound of wheels went by, and the gentle plashing of the canal-waters, or a footfall along the sidewalks under the chestnut and linden trees, was the only noise of passengers. Here in her old mansion is the Lady Egmond and a part of her grandchildren, sons and daughters of the ill-fated Count Lamoral. The eldest is Maria,* who at this time (1574) is some twenty-seven years of age. There are two other daughters who have arrived at womanhood, Magdalena and Christina, one about twenty-one and the other nineteen. Besides these there are three younger sisters who are yet in their girlhood, Anna, Sabina, and Jenne; and there are three sons, Philip, Lamoral, and Charles, their ages ranging x That is, the eldest unmarried. There was an elder sister, L9o- nora, who was now married to the Count van Houtkerke.  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7721-00000124"/> 238      THE ADVENTURER. from six to sixteen. The widow of the murdered Count, and mother of these children, was Sabina, daughter of the Count Palatine of Bavaria, and she has remained in Brussels, poor and desolate, since the cruel stroke that crushed her household. Lady Egmond, the grandmother of these children, is watching tenderly over them for a little space,- she whose benevolent face appeared before the Lady Anne Sayer to assuage the bitterness of .her exile and that of her orphan boy. Alas,! the story of sieges and battles and public executions does not measure the depth of calamity produced by war. In this old mansion on the Heeren Straat is the unimagined sorrow which has sought its silent and protecting shades. Age has slightly bent down the Lady Egmond, and studded her hair with drops of silver; but there is the same curve of benevolence under each of her large and beamy blue eyes. There is one awful image that is never out of her mind, imparting its subduing power to her manner and tone, and even tinging the light of day with ashen hues. Among the six daughters whose melodies charmed the Rue Bellevue, the song is hushed and the lute is silent, and they look into each other's marble faces without speaking that one name which crowds all other names from their memory, or of that one event which crowds all other images out of sight. Three of them are to become nuns in the priories of Brussels, those re- treats into which the noise of human cruelty and' wrong cannot enter, and where the soul shall yearn upward till she sees the gates unbarred by the shin-   *I:       tNTHE ADVENTURER.     239 ing ones, and she shall pass through them, and they shall close and shut, out the earth for ever, and all its hideous sights. To this mansion on the Heeren Straat, covered thickly with the shadows of the linden-trees, a strange footstep has bent its way. It is a woman with a buoyant tread, and with a bright but anx- ious countenance, with a boy beside her, walking, like little Iulus, "haud passibus aequis ", and now we perceive it is none other than our little flamingo. She has found- her way hither, notwithstanding her father's warnings; for she, has come over in the Minion under the care of Richard, whose ship has sailed in the merchant service to the great city of commerce. And if she means to find her husband and hover about him in the storm, she could not do better than consult the Lady Egmond, and for this very purpose she enters the mansion of silent sor- row. The good woman sat and listened to Bessie's story; and when it was finished, the light of her benevolent smile broke through and irradiated the lines of grief upon her brow. "If your husband is in the service of the Prince, or even in the Netherlands, he can probably be found."' And she sat down and dictated a line to the Prince of Orange, who was at the Hague. Then, laying her hand gently upon Bessie: "You will stay here, my good child, till we get an answer. Keep quiet with me, my pretty lamb, and don't go out needlessly among the wolves."   .     #  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7721-00000125"/> CHAPTER     XIV. "Water, water, everywhere." -Ancient Mariner. ALONG one of the mouths of the Rhine, on either side, and extending inward some fifteen miles, lies the district of -Rhynland, quite as remarkable as any in Holland, and for some of its features as remark- able as any in the whole world. In the midst of this district stands the city of Leyden; and if the reader has any Pilgrim blood in his .veins, he will pause at that name' with some degree of reverence and affection. The Rhine before it enters Leyden parts into two streams; these sweep round through opposite portions of the city, and reunite near its centre. These branches are called the Old and the New Rhine. From these streams the canals cir- culate through the city in all directions, cutting it up into innumerable islands,- the silent highways through all its principal streets and -squares. But if you would get a view both extended and minute, you must come along'with us to the top of the town-hall, and look out from its belfry; and nowr the whole city, with its environs, and nearly the whole of Rhynland, is unrolled beneath the eye. ..*   \I  , '        THE ADVENTURER.      241 , What an odd city is this Leyden! What strange- looking houses, with their old gables, standing each with the end towards the canal, with the eave- trough projecting forward so as to empty itself into the water! What a queer jumble of brick inlaid with stone-work! What narrow streets and winding lanes, kept clean by stout women and girls, dashing over them their endless pails of water! How beau- tifully does the Rhine, with its divided .streams; move along through the city, and how oddly do the canals gleam in silver threads all over it, wherever you can see them through the trees that are planted along the banks! How significantly do the church- es point upward their turrets above the masses of houses, and how sweet is the noise of their chimes, aLS they break out almost every hour, and thrill through the air. and around the old gables, and down through the lanes, and along the lazy canal- waters, sometimes sad and sometimes merry, some- times loud and sometimes soft, keeping the whole city bathed in. an atmosphere of fantasticsounds! And then look over the walls of the city, and be. yond through the charming region of the Rhynland, lying level as a floor, and therefore visible far away to where the green fields become hazy, and at length fade softly into blue. Seventy villages are under your eye, surrounded each by rich fields of corn and clover and endless herds of grazing kine. The pol-- ders are spread out before you, in soft, luxuriant green, checkered by the canals, along which the everlasting windmills swing' their brawny -arms. Away ten miles to the south you can see the city 21  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7721-00000126"/> 242      THE ADVENTURER. of the Hague, and a little farther the town of Delft, lying under the half-transparent mantle of dreamy haze. A rich and teeming landscape is this district of Rhynland, with its seventy villages glittering out of the green foliage like gems from a velvet robe. But it is frightful to think that this whole fairy re- gion lies lower downs than the waters either of the ocean or the' Rhine. What if those waters should break through the dikes, and blot out one by one these glittering gems, villages, polders, windmills, and all! But alas for the devoted city! a worse calamity than that is impending now.  The Spaniard, though baffled for a time, has mustered his forces and is coming again. Alva has left never to return, but his successor, Requesens, has been sent by Philip to take his place, reorganize the army, en- force the edicts of the Inqhisition, -and crush out the vital spark of -liberty in Holland. Since the siege and capture of Haarlem, she has had a breath- ing time; the Prince of Orange has been present, to rouse and guide her energies by his masterly statesmanship. But she has lost the services of him who may be said to have been .the founder of her liberty. William van der Marlk, who made Holland mlaster of the 'ocean, who took Briel and was made commander of the forces by sea and land, has been deposed from his command for his inso- lence and his cruelties. He came, at length, to defy the authority of the State and of the Prin'ce himself; he would hang Catholic priests wherever he could find them, and the people complained that   I            TTHE ADVENTURER.      243 ,I,   his rule was not much better than that of the Span- iard. He was deprived of his offices and thrown into prison, but permitted ultimately to retire with his property from Holland; and so his name disap- pears henceforth from her glorious annals. -Requesens, the successor of Alva as Governor of the Netherlands, unlike his predecessor, is a man of clemency and humanity; but he comes with the fame of a slkilful commander, and is fresh from his victory over the Turk. He will not practise the cruelties of Alva, but he will enforce the edicts and reduce Holland if he can. And as soon as he can subdue the mutinies in his army, and extricate af- fairs from the disorder in which Alva left them Requesens despatches his general, Valdez, with eight thousand men, to lay siege to Leyden. They have taken possession of the Rhynland, and com- pletely surrounded the devoted city with a cordon of forts, and wait the slow but sure effect of famine. Remembering the lesson which they learned at Allkmaar, they have left their artillery behind them; but they possess all the canals that' enter' the city; and since there are not three months' provision with- in it, Valdez feels sure of his prey. The citizerns of  Leyden are taken by surprise. They have neglected to lay in a store of provisions, and they have no troops to defend the city but the j    burgher guards. But the burgher guards will de- fend it to the death. They are commanded by Peter van der Werff.  The governor of the city is ?: ,  John van der Does. The names of these two men are not remarkably euphonious, and they would not j                   '        &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7721-00000127"/> 244      THE ADVENTURER. sound very well in Homer's verse, nor keep time with its thunder-tramp; but fortunately they do not need it to make their deeds immortal. Their pictures hang up to this day in the town-hall, and their faces look mild and benevolent, but at the same time full of calm and immovable determi- nation. Valdez summons a surrender. He sends a letter by the hands of some desertersi filled with flatter- ing promises and offers of pardon. He receives from the governor a very short and pithy reply in Latin: "' Fistula dulce canit volucrem, dum decipit anceps."7  Orange is alive to the emergency. , Large col- lections of provisions are made for the relief of the besieged, but he has no force sufficient to break through the line of forts that invests the starving city. The three months' provisions are consumed, and dogs and horses and offal only remain to feed the inhabitants. The young girls eat the lapdogs with which they used to play. Women, with their faces covered, crawl through the streets, or sit on heaps of refuse in search of some morsel to satisfy their hunger. Plague, the attendant of famine, breaks out, and the haggard processions carry out the corpses to burial. Still the women urge on the defence, and keep alive the flagging heroism of the men. "'Leave us to die with starvation rather than submit to the foe." And {he burgher guard comes down from the walls, at night, to find that : "The fowler plays sweet notes on his pipe, while he spreads his net for the bird." *                    2   I           THE ADVENTURER.      245 the wife or daughter who cheered him on in the morning is no more. There is no sound of battle, no din of arms. The Spaniard without awaits his prey in silence, and within there is the fixed and -gloomy resolve, if need be, to starve and die. In this state of things Valdez urges once more a surrender. "You have become eaters of cats and dogs, and these must fail you soon."  And he promises again to grant them generous terms of capitulation. The burghers rush to the walls with their answer: 1' When the cats and dogs fail us, we will eat our left hand, and fight you with our right." And that desperate extremity has well-nigh come, for they can scarcely drag their limbs to the walls. At length the spirits even of these brave men are subdued, and they raise a riot against their com- mander, Van der Werff, and demand a surrender of the city, They throng around him with implor- ing and piteous looks. "Give us food, or else treat With the Spaniards!"This memorable scene has been transferred to canvas by the pencil of Van Bree of Antwerp, and hangs up also in the Burgo- masters' Hall at Leyden; but no pencil can paint the lofty heroism of the commander, as be looks around on his haggard company, and nerves their arms anew by his immortal words: ' I have made an oath, which, by the help of God, I will keep, that I will never yield to the Spaniard. Bread, as you know, I have none; but if my death can serve you, slay me, cut my body into morsels, and divide it amongst you."  The rioters slink away, silent and ashamed, and return to their duty on the walls. 21 -  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7721-00000128"/> 246      THE ADVENTURER. As the Prince cannot break through the line of forts, and throw succors into the city, he meets the deputies at Rotterdam, and lays before them a new plan of operations. "Cut through the sluices," says he, 4 and let in the waters to flood the Rhynland, and on these waters we will float' provisions up to the gates of Leyden." It was a desperate sacrifice'to lay that fertile and lovely region under water. But let it be done, said the deputies; for " it Is better that the country should be ruined than lost." Two hundred flat-bottomed boats are got ready, laden with ammunition and provisions, and Admiral Boi- sot is summoned with his men from Zealand,- the same Water Gueux who had taken Flushing, and commanded the mouths of the Scheldt. The sluices are opened, and the Meuse and the Issel invited to pour their waters over the Rhyn- land. . But alas-! the wind and the tide have con- spired with the Spaniard. The waters will not come in.. The wind is dead northeast, and there it keeps day after day, and drives back the waters of the Meuse; and the Spaniards laugh at the fee- ble and desperate expedient. Day after day the starving burghers strain their eyes from the walls, but nothing comes over the Rhynland. The flat- boats, laden with provisions, wait in the waters of the. Meuse, but they can get no farther. But a change comes at last; the wind on a sudden veers round to the southwest, and drives the Meuse over the polders! The waters rush on, flood after flood, and submerge the Rhynland, rolling around the gates of Leyden, and dashing against the forts of !   THE ADVENTURER.      247 the Spaniard, who looks around him appalled. But' he has something to fear besides the Meuse, with its army of waves. The two hundred flat-bottomed boats float triumphant over the polders towards the walls of Leyden. Grim fellows they are that man them, breathing silent revenge to the motion of the oar, holding each in his hand a long pole with an iron hook at the end, and wearing upon his hat the dreaded motto, "Rather Turk than Pope." The Water Gueux are coming! On one of the flat- bottomed boats, bending silent to his oar, is the truculent fellow who-took a Spanish soldier at Zoe- termeer, tore his heart out of his bdty, and set his teeth into it, and then dashed it on the ground, say- ing, "It is bitter." And there are enough men of the same spirit, who are rowing the flat-bottomed boats over the polders. The Spaniards abandon their forts, and fly in ter- ror along the dikes and causeways. Over these 'they deploy in Indian file, drenched in the waters or swamping in-the mud, but the Water Gueux are after them. With the long poles they hook' them down one after another, and give them to the mercy of the sea. Wherever they deploy, the sound, '( Long live the Gueux in spite of the Mass!" comes shouting afterthem, and then the fatal hook lays hold of them. In their disastrous retreat, a large proportion of them leave their carcasses to fatten the polders, and be turned into Dutch butter,  - a better use, probably, than they ever were put to before! The Water Gueux have come again.

It is the "' Ark of Delft," so called because it was built there; it moves by a wheel worked by twelve men, and thus anticipates in part the invention of Ful- ton. And who is that burly-pated fellow who stands 'at the prow, with his long pole, which he uses sometimes to ease off the boat from some im- pinging chimney or church steeple, that peeps above the waves, sometimes changing ends as occasion offers, and hooking a Spaniard from his slippery foothold on the dikes, and sending him twirling through the air, as a boy would a salmon, till he comes plashing down in the boat's wake, uttering innumerable curses and Ave Marias? The burly- pated fellow looks very much like Peter van derl Mark. And who is the tall man that stands on the deck, and directs the motions of the boat, keeping a keen look-out with his great black eye, that darts hither and thither, and giving orders to his men with earnest gestures of his long arms? -It is Nim- ble John! His vessel is riding in the Meuse, filled with stores for the Leyden sufferers, and the Ark of Delft is transporting the stores over the flooded, Rhynland, and hooking 'off Spaniards from their retreat by the way. All the forts had now been abandoned but one. Fort Lamnmen stands about half a mile from Ley- den, on a slight eminence, provided, with enormous pieces of artillery. The waves do not come quite up to it, and it must be taken by storm. Admiral   i *       THE ADVENTURER.      249 Boisot is doubtful whether he shall master it, and he sends a carrier-pigeon into the besieged city, and requests the burgher guards to be ready on the morrowr to make a sally at a given signal; and the burgher guards stand eager to obey. The morrow comes, and the Admiral has marshalled his boats, and is sailing, towards Fort Lammen. Suddenly a cry of terror runs through the fort. "The Water Gueux are coming!" and the fort 'is abandoned, with nearly the whole of its baggage and arnmuni- tion, and the frightened Spaniards are cowering along the dikes, or sticking fast in the sedges to be fished up by the long poles, and so the last foe dis- appears from before the gates of Leyden. And now the feeble but joyful cry "Leyden is saved!" runs round the walls, and down through the streets of the half-deserted city, and numbers come to the gates to hail their deliverers. The deliverers stand and weep at the sight. What skeletons are these that totter through the gates, or sit along the silent streets, where gaunt famine and despair have reigned supreme, without crushing out a spark of the hero- ism of the people! They pour in provisions upon the sufferers, which are devoured sometimes -with a fatal eagerness; nevertheless the cry of thanksgiv- ing and joy waxes louder and louder, "Leyden is saved "  :*   &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7721-00000130"/> CHAPTER XV. "In this firm hour Salvation lifts her horn;- Glory to arms!" "EYDEN is saved! is the news which comes to Orange as he lies on a sick-bed at Delft, over- whelmed with the cares of the state, and revolving in his gloomy thoughts the salvation of his beloved people. He springs from his bed, his limbs made elastic by the glad tidings, and rushes into one of the churches of Delft with offerings of praise. 'Then he hastens to the afflicted city, to sympathize and rejoice with the late sufferers. For the first few days the care of the sick absorbed all the attention of the deliverers, who saw in all the circumstances of their deliverance a Divine and interposing hand. Im- mediately after the siege was raised, twenty rods of the wall fell down wifhout any apparent cause; an incident which two days before would have been fatal to the besieged, but which now increased the speed of their flying enemies, who heard the noise behind them, and, ignorant of its cause; shouted again the panic-cry, "The Gueux are coming!"  On the very day too that the siege was   THE ADVENTURER.        251 raised, the wind veered round again to the north- east, and drove back the waters of the Meuse and the Issel into their old limits, as if God himself had mustered his armnies, and called them off when the victory was won. A Dutch poet celebrates the victory in these strains:  "Non opus est gladiis, ferroque rigentibus armis; SolE pro Batavo belligeranter aquae: Tolle metus, Hispane fuge, et ne respice terras, Pro quibus oceanus pugnat, et ipse Deus." No need of swords, nor steel, nor armor bright! Armies of waters for Batavia fight. Fly, Spaniard! look not back upon the land For which old Ocean wars, at God's command! And now the- famished men and Women walk erect and strong again, and all'the belfries of Leyden are answering to each other in joyful chimes, - "Low and loud and sweetly blended, Low at times and loud at times, Changing like a poet's rhymes." The admirals are presented with a magnificent chain and medal of gold. The great Church of St. Peter is thrown open for religious service, and the deliverers and delivered together crowd thither, Orange at their head, to give thanks to the God of battles. Among the crowd is Nimble John, with his men that rowed the Ark of Delft, some of them truculent-looking enough, even when their features are relaxed and softened with devotional feeling. The Gueux themselves crowd into the church, and their features, seamed and scarred and  **  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7721-00000131"/> 252      THE ADVENTURER. tanned with fight and wind and storm, become changed, and even tremulous, as they bow before the spirit of prayer and praise that sweeps all hearts before it, and mounts away to the skies. "I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously; Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath- he cast into the sea; his chosen captains also are drowned in the sea. "The depths have covered them; they sank into the bottom as a stone. "Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious in power; thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy. "With the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together; the floods stood upright as an heap. "The enemy said, I will pursue, I will divide the spoil; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them. "Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them, they sank as lead in the mighty waters." These strains have rolled down the nave and back again, and seem to linger in the arches and the hearts of the multitudes as they leave the church and break away to their homes. - As Nim- ble John is coming out -of the door of St. Peter's, nearly the last of the dispersing crowd, a sweet face appears before him, and his wife rushes into his arms.

Did you think I should not find you out?"  You must indeed have been the blessed omen before which the storm was rolling away.

But you must go back to Amsterdam, and not trust your pretty wings here among the thunderbolts." ' Nay, I shall keep about you, for by and by the thunderbolts will alight upon you, and the Spanish shot will get hold of you, and you will lie wounded in your hammock, with nobody to give you water or bathe your head when the fever rages; and then you will die without your birdy." .          22 i   &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7721-00000132"/> CHAPTER XVI.

Leyden and Haarlem  and Naarden rise elastic from the dust. A twelve years' truce is finally agreed upon, and the Spaniard retires, sullen and baffled, from the Netherlands. On the Princen Graat the same old house is standing in which the exiles Richard Sayer and the Lady Anne looked their last upon this world, and in which Job sang to it his last snatches of song; and the same old' chestnut-tree brushes its leaves against the windows. Hither has Nimble John re- tired at last from all his adventures; the house has passed into his hands, its walls fragrant with sweet and pensive memories, and into it he has transferred the flamingo, whose wing has hovered about him through all his escapes and troubles. His ships lie in the harbors of Amsterdam, among that endless forest of masts; they 'come and go, and bring to him wealth and prosperity.' And here we must take our leave of the son of the exile, since we have seen him safe through all his adventures, re- turned at last beneath the shelter of his father's tree. But before we bidhim a final farewell, the reader will step in for a single moment at the house of the Princen Graat, and see how it fares with the inmates. Have a care, however, for that great Dutch girl has trundled her water-engine in front of the house, and is ejecting its contents against the second-story windows, and the spray is descending all over the yard: We think she must be a relative of some of those women that threw rocks on the  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7721-00000136"/> 262 .

But what means this hydro- mania of Katreen van der Speigle?/,for we cannot see that the house is on fire, and she is drenching us as she did the Spaniards before Leyden. It is only a trick which Dutch women have of keeping clean outside as well as inside; and as you enter the house/ the trace of Katreen's hand is everywhere seen. There is no grain of dust, except what you are bringing in yourself,---no speck on the white cur- tains; and from the polished brass on the doors and andirons your own distorted face is shining bright. You find at last our friend Bessie in the midst of her household, but the rose colors are less brilliant on her cheek, and she is no longer the red flamingo. But she has not lost her native mirthfulness, nor any of the genial sunshine from the open and be- nevolent face that first rayed into the heart of Nimble John when he came out of the long deliri- um of his fever. Little Johnny Bourchier is grown up into great Johnny, spite of teething and croup, and three younger specimens, Henry, William, and Richard, have all come, to go through teething and croup in their turn, besides measles, mumps, influ- enzas, and the whole train of juvenile calamities. How they all get through safe is a wonder, and why babies were not born with teeth ready made was always a painful mystery to us.

Nimble John, after all his adventures, is happy at home in the peace and the love-light which Bessie diffuses through his house- hold. His black hair has become threaded with silver; some wrinkles have gathered on his brow, but his eye looks out from under them bright and piercing as ever. But he has roamed the world till he is satisfied, and will be content to leave it amid the angel sympathies that first shed 'their beams around his pillow from the face of Bessie Haw- kins. Lady Egmond has bent lower and lower under the weight of sorrow and years, the curves of be- nevolence under her eyes growing larger and deeper to the last, till her aged frame has sunk into the grave, and the'gentle touch of Death lias turned the woman into the angel, or rather disclosed the angel that tabernacled in mortality, in brighter robes. Of her eight granddaughters, four have become mar- ried and three have become nuns, --one of them, Jenne, is Prioress of St. Elizabeth's cloister in Brussels.

Whereupon Mrs. Hawkins wept and prayed, and said she always knew that an evil star was to hang over him since those dreadful missionary vqy- ages, for which she hoped God would forgive hirm before the- coming of the great day. And for this forgiveness she spent the rest of her life in making supplication, and died happily under the assuaging influence of Doctor Pomp's powders and the bright- ening hopes of a benevolent and pious mind.

What use will they make of their teeth, now they arc all fairly and safely through? Will they use them for the purposes intended, or will they gnash with them upon Spaniards, or, what is worse and more inexcusable, upon mankind in general?

ON the evening before his execution, when the Count of Egmond was repeating the Lord's Prayer, as the words most befitting his awful condition, the thoughts of his family interrupted him. They clung tenderly to the loved ones he was to leave behind him. His devotions were suspended; he called for pen and paper, and wrote two letters, one to his wife and one to the King. That to the King was as follows: "Sire:- This morning I received the sentence which your Majesty has been pleased to pass upon me. Far as I have ever been from attempting anything against the person or the service of your Majesty, or against the only true, old, and Catholic religion, I yet submit myself with patience to the fate which it has pleased God to ordain I should suffer. .If, during the past disturbances, I have omitted, advised, or done anything that seems at 23   &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7721-00000140"/> 270       THE PILGRIM. variance with my duty, it was most assuredly per- formed with the best intentions, or was forced upon me by the pressure of circumstances. I therefore pray your Majesty to forgive me, and, in considera- tion of my past services, show mercy to my un- happy wife and my poor children and servants. In a firm hope of this, I commend myself to the infinite mercy of God. "Your Majesty's most faithful vassal and servant, "AMORAL COUNT EGMOND. "Brussels, June 5th, 1568, near my last moments." The " unhappy " but faithful wife who was thus the object of such, tender solicitude to her husband in his last hour, was Sabrina of Bavaria, daughter of the Count Palatine John, and sister of Frederick, afterwards Count Palatine and -Elector. She was a woman of rare beauty and accomplishments, and she tried every art-which affection could devise to save her husband from his fate. After sentence had been passed, she sought an interview with Alva, and begged for his'life fwith all her womanly eloquence. "Take comfort, madam,' was Alva's reply, " your husband shall be released to-morrow." She did not see the cruel irony that lurked in these words, and went away in the belief that he was to be pardoned and restored to his family. She was overwhelmed by the event, being re- duced to abject poverty and despair. . Egmond's letter seems not to have touched the heart of the treacherous bigot at Madrid. - Alva himself was affected at the sight of her misfortunes, and relieved   THE PILGRIM, ,      271 her wants from his own purse, and wrote- to the King in her behalf. He tells the King that she is the most wretched of women, and has to beg her daily food after nightfall, or pick it up in the streets of Brussels. Relief from poverty, however, came at last. The family were afterwards placed in posses- sion again of the property, which by virtue of the sentence had escheated to the King. Philip, eldest son of the murdered Count, was born in 1558, and was therefore about ten years of age at the time of his father's death. - The intolerable wrongs which the tyrant had inflicted upon his family, a father's blood crying from the ground, and a mother's woes appealing exen to the marble heart of Alva, ought to have roused the son against the tyranny that was crushing the Nether- lands. - But it did not. He must have inherited his father's disposition to fawn upon royalty, and live only by its favors. He had no sooner reached mlan- hood, than he espoused warmly the royal cause against the States, much to the surprise and mor- tification of the friends of his late father. There had been a temporary lull in the disturb- ances of the Netherlands, after the famous truce called the' "Pacification of Ghent."  But it was soon broken, and a party called the ," Malecontents," under the lead of Montigny, raised again the royal standard; and renewed the war. He succeeded in drawing over young Egmond to his party, and gave him command of a regiment of infantry.* * Davies says that Charles Egmond, son of the murdered Count,  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7721-00000141"/> 272          THE PILGRIM. Before his change of sentiments was known, he brought his regiment into Brussels, with the design of making himself master of the city. He marched into the Horse-Market, and, by a most remarkable coincidence, halted on the very spot where his fa- ther had been executed, and on the same day of the month, just eleven years before.     The wary burghers, suspecting his intentions, quickly barri- caded all the streets leading to the Horse-Market, so that he remained closely cooped -up within it, with- out the power, of escape. There for twenty-four hours they kept him and his men, without food or drink; and they did not fail to assail his ears with taunts the most cutting and bitter, for his defection from   the popular cause.    The populace thronged the streets and the tops of the buildings, or mounted the barricades, and poured their jeers upon him     till he wept for vexation and shame. "Do you remember that in that place your father lost his head?" "Have you come in that guise to visit his grave?" "Lift up two or three stones, and you will see your father's blood." is -the person here alluded to. This cannot be, if my genealogy is correct. I have a list of all the children of the Count, with names and dates specified so minutely,/that it must have been copied from authentic family records. According to this, Charles was an infant child when his father was executed, and therefore could not have been in command of infantry eleven years later, - whereas Philip was ten years old at his father's death, was his eldest son, and was therefore twenty-one years old when these transactions occurred. I infer, therefore, that Philip, and not Charles, was the person al- luded to.   THE PILGRIM.       273 The burghers had him completely in their power; but on that spot they could not raise a hand against the son whose father's blood they had sworn to avenge; and after these bitter reproaches they threw down the barricades and let him go. He marched out with his infantry, being stung with chagrin, and perhaps remorse; but he met with better success a few days after, in surprising and capturing the town of Ninhoven. During the progress of the war in the Nether- lands, France became the scene of civil strife be- tween the Catholics and the Huguenots. The Cath- olics had formed the celebrated "League," under the lead of the Duke of Guise, had triumphed in every part of the kingdom, and were in possession of the capital. The Huguenots, with Henry of Na- varre at their head, lately proclaimed King 'on the assassination of Henry III., were gaining strength and besieging the capital, when Philip of Spain ordered a detachment from the ar/ny in the Neth- erlands to support the Catholic cause. "If,"' he writes to Parma, " you wish to make me forget the destruction of the Armada, succor my good city of Paris." Parma, therefore, sent a strong detachment under the command of Philip Egmond, who joined the Leaguers just before -the battle of Ivry. In that a'i  battle Philip Egmond was slain, and: nearly all his troops cut to pieces, and the Huguenots gained a complete and brilliant victory. It is the subject of one of Macaulay's most stirring ballads, in which    Egmond is alluded to. *  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7721-00000142"/> 274        THE PILGRIM. "Now God be praised, the day is ours! Mayenne hath turned his rein, D'Aumale hath cried for quarter, the Flemish count is slain; Their ranks are breaking like thin clouds before a Biscay gale; The field is heaped with bleeding steeds, and flags, and cloven mail." So ended the life of Philip, eldest son of Count Lamoral Egmond. Ingloriously it ended we should say, for it was devoted to a cause whose injus- tice had crushed his father, broken the heart of his" mother, and sent his sisters into convents to pine with sorrow. He is said even to have insulted his father's memory for the sake of gaining the royal favor. He had his reward. He obtained that fa- vor, and his paternal estates were restored to him; but he lost his life fighting side by side with those whose hands were yet red with the massacre of St. Bartholomew, for such were the Leaguers who fell at the battle of Ivry. He was thirty-two years old when his career closed. He had married Marie van Home, sister 'of the Count of Houtkerke, who had married Leohora, his eldest sister. The histories say that Philip Egmond died with- out issue. My genealogical memorials say " with- out issue male," and that he probably left an only child and daughter, Marie Lamoral Egmond. Cer- tainly we find Marie Lamoral Egmond, daughter of Philip Egmond, livifig soon after at Amsterdam. God be merciful to her, and shield her from the storms!

But their little Johnny, who first opened his eyes at Plymouth on his moth- er and Doctor Pomp, came up bravely in some way through croup and scarlet-fever, and ripened into manhood.  Through the hydraulic operations of Katreen van der Speigle he came forth healthful and strong, and meeting somehow and somewhere Marie Lamoral Egmond, the orphan girl, we sup- pose they went through all the preliminaries of love and courtship. At any rate, they were married, and lived, as we imagine, in the old house on the Princen Graat. The accounts say that he acquired through her a large fortune, principally in money. He made long and strenuous efforts to recover also his own ancestral estates in England, but in vain. A few years after this marriage, a little boy who was the fruit of it might be seen in the streets of Amsterdam, playing on the Princen Graat, plash- - ing in the canal, and lounging under the linden- trees. Fortunately, his face has been preserved by the painter, and it appears to us as if more of Egmond blood than English were mantling in his cheeks. He has a mild blue eye, a -florid counte- nance that looks inexpressibly sweet, ruby lips, bright yellow hair that hangs curling down his neck; and he wears the appearance of a sensitive amiability that shrinks from the wrongs and con- flicts of this turbulent world. Ah! he has come into it at the wrong time, and in the wrong place, as we shall very soon have occasion to see. This is RICHARD- THE PILGRIM, the subject' of the story which we now have in hand.

The Spanish war was soon over after that, but upon what other conflict scarcely less fierce and virulent did the- amiable little fellow open his eyes! or how did he get startled by it from his boy-dreams, as he plashed in the lazy canal!   CHAPTER     II. "' Backward to the Past I wandered, To the old, white-bearded Past; Then he bade me sit beside him, By the hand he held me fast." JOHN BOURCHER SAYER, the son of Nimble John and his wife, Marie L. Egmond, were Catholics. Long and bitter and unavailing was the contro- versy with his Protestant kinsfolk at Colchester, England. They were determined to keep him ex- cluded from his paternal estates, and they even charged him with complicity in the "Gunpowder Plot," and threatened to bring him to punishment for it, should -be set foot in England. Our young Richard, then, the pensive boy with the yellow locks, is to be educated in the Catholic faith, through the instructions of both the parents. A difficult task they will have of it, we imagine, where the whole air is reeking with Protestantism. We imagine, too, that, when the boy gets old enough, he will ask who murdered his grandfather, and who killed the Prince of Orange, and by what means. The forty years struggle of the Netherlands with Spain had now come to a close, and tales of indi- 24  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7721-00000144"/> 278       THE PILGRIM. vidual prowess, heroism, and suffering had become nursery stories, to fire the imagination of the next generation, and make its hatred burn unrelentingly against the Spaniard and his religion. Such tales make a more indelible impression upon the young mind than histories of sieges and battles, and the times just ended had an inexhaustible fund of anec- dote for the fireside through generations to come. They have more to do than the Catechism in giv- ing to the young their biases and impressions, and we shall give a few which must have gone a good way to modify Richard's ideas of Catholicism. Among the inventions of cruelty which the Cath- olic Inquisitors had brought into the Netherlands, there was a mode of punishment by burying alive. In the year 1597, there was a single instance of it, which was related for years afterwards, and prob- ably had as much influence in fomenting in young minds a hatred of 'Popery, as the woodcut of John Rogers's martyrdom in the New England Primer had among the children of the Puritans. Executions for heresy had become infrequent, and loud professions of the clemency and mercy of Philip II. had been made, and it was in the very midst of these professions that a spectacle was ex- hibited at Ghent that thrilled the people with new spasms of hatred and revenge. A woman named Annette van der Hove, aged about forty years, in the humble station of a servant, but of unblemished reputation, was tried for heresy, condemned, and sentenced to be buried alive. She was educated in the Reformed religion, and had re-   THE PILGRIM.       279 ceived it in the simplicity of her heart. While in prison, the priest called upon her, as usual, to make .. her retract her opinions. The wisdom and becom- ing modesty with which she answered him were re- ported to the admiration of all. "As far as I am capable of judging, I believe myself to be right; but if not, I am guilty of a mis- take, which in one so ignorant may well be par- doned; but I shall merit the just vengeance of Heaven, if under the influence of fear I should sub- scribe to the truth of what I believe to be false, even though it should prove to be true," The pit was dug, and she was led forth to it, and let down in a standing posture. As the execution- er filled it up, the Jesuit priest who attended her had ample time to ply her with arguments for her con- version. The earth had reached to her shoulders. "Are you willing now to change your faith?" ' I will not fear," she replied, "this dreadful death,-it is for the truth. Into the Lord's- hand I commend my spirit." The executioner continued to stamp the earth around her and above her. The crowd heard her groans and cries of agony stifled more and more until the dreadful business was over. It is said that all the blood which had been shed before the commencement of the war had less influ- ence than the death of this one poor woman. It passed into nursery tales; it was told with pale cheeks and quivering lips; it reached undoubtedly our boy with the bright locks on-the Princen Graat, and sank down into his pensive spirit.  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7721-00000145"/> 280       THE PILGRIM. Among the many incidents in the destruction of Naarden, there was one which took a despotic hold of the imagination, and passed also into the nursery tales. The town had been surrendered to Alva's troops, on the express condition that the lives and properties of all the inhabitants should be preserved, and the citizens take a new oath to the King of Spain. The burghers were summoned, and came unarmed to the town-house for the purpose of tak- ing the oath, while their wives were busy in prepa- rations forit entertainment of the strangers. The town-hall was filled with -the peaceful burghers, and surrounded with Spanish soldiers. A Catho- lic priest walked to and fro before the town-hall for some time, and then turned -suddenly upon the burghers and bade them prepare for death; where- upon the soldiers fired upon them, and instantly five hundred lay dead upon the floor, and the building was set on fire. Then commenced the slaughter throughthe city. One Herbert Williamson, a hardy blacksmith, snatched up a three-legged stool for a shield in one hand, and a sword in the other, and defended the entrance to his house till several Spaniards were laid dead in the passage. But he sinks overpowered by numbers, grasps with his horny hands the blades of two -swords that are plunged into his body, severing his fingers in their way His daughter rushes out and kneels for mer- cy, and for answer the quivering fingers of her father are flung into her'face.

Tales of which these are a specimen were among Richard's first lessons in Catholicism! Stories of adventure and personal heroism were equally abundant, and for a long time formed the staple of nursery anecdotes, setting forth the prow- ess and magnanimity of the Reformers. Among these was the story of "' the boatmen of Liere." ' The town of Breda was in the hands of the Spaniards, and it was important that it should be recovered. Some boatmen of the village of Liere were accustomed to supply the garrison of Breda with fuel, and they intimated to Maurice that the town could be taken. One Charles Heraguire was intrusted with the execution of the plan. He hired a vessel, contrived in the bottom of it a place of concealment capable of holding seventy persons, and covered with boards, over which was placed a cargo of turf. Sixty-eight persons were picked for the enterprise, nearly all beardless boys, but full of courage and patriotism. They were stowed away under the boards, and had to sit close, and in a stooping posture. The vessel sprung a leak, and filled with water up to their knees, and in this state they came into the harbor of Breda. The corporal of the citadel came on board to inspect the cargo. One of the men concealed under it, in the cold and wet, is seized with a propensity to cough, which would betray them all to certain destruction. Where- upon he gave his poignard to one of his fellows, say- ing, "Kill me instantly the moment I make a noise." Fortunately it was not necessary.

The ship, like the Trojan horse, then empties its fatal contents. They encounter the sentinel at the gate, and run him through; they seize the garrison, and in a short time are in complete possession of Breda. - The story of "the baker of Antwerp" and of  "Regnier Klaaszoon," who blew himself up in the midst of the Spanish galleons, belonged to the same class, and helped to make up that body of tradition l -which more than general history tends to fire the young mind with admiration of personal bravery, and detestation of the tyranny that called it forth. The twelve years' truce was agreed upon in 1609, when Richard Sayer might have been about nine- teen years old. If the events which had preceded, and which furnished every tavern, street. fireside, and nursery with their fund of traditional lore, were not adapted to draw a sensitive and thinking mind towards Catholicism, those which immediately fol- u lowed were adapted quite as little to draw it- to- wards the Reformed religion of the Netherlands.   CHAPTER     III. "Truth for ever on the scaffold, wrong for ever on the throne." "OWELL. AFTER the Spanish war was ended, a religious one followed,--a war of sect with sect: and the passions of the human heart blazed aloft as fierce and lurid as before. The boy was educated in the midst of its tumults, and its contentions constituted his daily surroundings, at the period when the mind receives its first religious ideas. It was the famous controversy between the CalvinisLcs and Arminians, which ended in the subjugation of the latter, and the judicial murder of Barneveldt. This contro- versy probably had something to do in causing Richard to quit the country, We will give as dis- tinct an idea of it as we can, in the brief summary of a single chapter. The following are the prin- cipals among the dramatis personce of the contro- versy. MAURICE OF NASSAU, son of the Prince of Orange, was only seventeen years old when his father was assassinated. But he soon manifested military tal- ents unrivalled by any commander in Europe. He carried Holland successfully through the long Span- ] ,  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7721-00000147"/> 284       THE PILGRIM.             ish war. He scarcely ever lost a battle, and he ?I kept the Spaniards at bay, while -his countrymen cultivated the fields; indeed, all the arts of peace flourished within the sound of. arms. But the no- blest virtues are not nourished in a camp. Maurice became imperious, ambitious, and impatient of all ? opposition; and when peace returned was the most dangerous man whom a free state could have among  i its citizens. JOHN OWEN BARNEVELDT was the great states- man of Holland after the fall of Orange. He was first in council, as Maurice was the first in the field. Pure, wise, patriotic, and just, the whole country looked up to him as its venerable and benignant father. When the truce with Spain was under negotiation, Maurice opposed it, and was in favor of a continuance of the war.  Barneveldt saw   A through his ambitious designs, and thwarted them by procuring an .auspicious and glorious peace. Maurice from that time became his secret enemy. There were two Professors at the University of Leyden, who were destined to open a religious con- troversy of wide-spread and fearful consequences. FRANCIS GOIAR was a man of sour temper and turbulent disposition; a teacher of theology, but delighting less in its flowrery fields than its tangles of thorns and briers. His face looks out from one of the huge woodcuts of Brandt's folio history of  : the Reformation; his eye appears hard and stony, and his features have evidently been shaped under the influence of ghastly contemplations. The other Professor was JAMES ARMNIUS, a man  !   THE PILGRIM.       285 of vast learning, mild and amiable manners, and a persuasive and silvery eloquence. In one of his lectures, he seemed to call in question the doctrine of Calvin on predestination, and excited the oppo- sition of Gomar. - The dispute waxed warmer and warmer, the students took sides, and the University became a scene of strife. At first, the dispute was carried on in Latin. But the ministers took up the controversy, and fulminated from the pulpits in the vernacular tongue. The people took it up after them, and in a short time men at their business, ladies in the drawing-room, washerwomen at their tubs, girls at school, and boys in the streets, were spluttering fiercely in Dutch about " fixed fate, free- will, foreknowledge absolute." The dispute waxed hot and virulent, and all Holland was involved in the blaze. From a war of words, it became a war of blows, and Amsterdam was the first scene of violence. There the Calvinists were in a decided majority, and the city government was in their hands. The Arminians had hired a large warehouse as a place of worship, and one Sunday morning they had as- sembled within it for divine service, to the number of eighteen hundred. Scarcely had the preacher opened his lips, .when a mob collected outside, broke in the windows, and rushed upon the preach- er to drag him from his desk. The women, quite as brave as Jenny Geddes, formed a guard about him, and defended him with their stools. The as- sailants then withdrew, and nailed up the only door of the building, and were about to set fire to it, and  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7721-00000148"/> 286       THE PILGRIM. o roast the Arminians alive together. But the latter broke through the door and made their escape, the minister at the peril of his life, when the building was plundered, and the tiles stripped from the roof. The magistrates, being Calvinists, refused to punish the rioters.  Encouraged by this impunity, the mob assembled in the streets the next Sabbath, at first in knots and companies that stood in evil consultation. Passing the house of a wealthy Arminian by the name of   j Bishop, a brother of the famous Episcopius, some  one cried out, "Here the Arminians preach." It was the signal for assault. They broke into the house, and plundered it from garret to cellar, the . police refusing to defend it or stop the rioters. The family escaped with their lives through a back door. The next day the mob assembled for fresh outrage, and the principal merchants threatened to leave the city. Considerations of trade brought- the magis- trates to a sense of duty, and soldiers were immedi- ately stationed to restore order. It is mentioned as a cqrious instance of sectarian conscientiousness, that the Calvinist clergy, who had preached with great solemnity against dances, and gay dress, never expressed the slightest disapprobation of these at- tempts to rob and murder the Arminians. The example was contagious. In other towns and cities where the authorities were Calvinist, mobs rose upon the Arminians, and were encour- aged in their violence. At last, the persecuted sect appealed to the government for protection. Bar- neveldt was at the head of the -State Council, by   THE PILGRIM.       287 whom a decree was issued, that there should be a new levy of troops in all the principal towns, who should enforce order and keep the peace. Maurice had watched his hour, and it had now come. He allied himself with the Calvinists, in opposition to Barneveldt, and formed his plan to subvert the government, and rise to despotic power on the down-trodden liberties of Holland. He fa- vored the scheme of the Calvinists, of a general synod to condemn the Arminians, and he ,put himself at the head of two companies of infantry, marched into the towns and cities where the new levies had been raised, and disarmed and disbanded them. This open defiance of the civil power was followed by more atrocious outrages. Barneveldt and three of his ftiends were arrested by the body- guard of Maurice, and thrown into prison, without the least color of legal authority. The famous Synod of Dort was convened, com- posed of the most violent enemies of the Armini- ans. It was backed by the authority of Maurice, and was a clear usurpation of the rights of Holland. By the terms of union between the seven provinces, each retained the exclusive control of its own relig- ious affairs. But the Synod assumed that control, and condemned the Arminians, who, by the States- General, the Assembly of the seven provinces, with Maurice at their head, were sentenced to silence or banishment, and they generally chose the latter. Then followed a scene, which sent a shudder through the civilized world, The aged Barneveldt, t  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7721-00000149"/> 288        THE PILGRIM.  grown gray in his country's service, the incorrupti-  ble patriot, Christian, and sage, around whom, in the  hour of distress, the people had clung for protection, " as children around a father, was led forth from  prison to a mock trial, and condemned to die. His only crime was the levy of the new troops, to pro- tect the citizens from Calvinist mobs,--a course perfectly legal and necessary, - though other char-i ges of a frivolous nature were brought against him.  It was a most affecting sight, when the old mani was led forth to execution, leaning on the arm of a  faithful servant, through the multitude, many of  whom averted their .faces and wept. Had Wash-  ington been led to the scaffold at the close of his  glorious services, the sight could hardly have been  more afflictive to good men. As he ascended the , platform, he repeated the lines of Horace:-- "Justum, et tenacem propositi virum,^ ; Non ci-tium ardor prava jubentium,     o Non vultus instantis tyranni  Mente quatit solida."             In front of the saloon of the court-house, where the ambassadors of the haughty Philip had come     -i to him and sued for peace,-the old patriot and sage bared his neck to the axe, and his gray head rolled  upon the scaffold.

Still they assembled. Outside the city 'walls, in woods, in deserts, at midnight and under the watching stars, they lifted up to the naked sky their low and tremulous song. But the hunters were ever on the scent, and armed men would break in on their lonely devotions, and turn the place of worship into a scene of massacre. The old Spanish cruelties were acted over again, and Calvinism, with the decrees of the Synod of Dort, committed pre- cisely the crimes against human nature that it had. complained of so bitterly when Philip, with the de- crees of the Council of Trent, was forcing the In- quisition on the Netherlands. 25  &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7721-00000150"/> O14 CHAPTER     I V           CT.

If the penal edicts were relaxed, they petitioned the States- General, and, calling themselves the "Sorrowing Church," deprecated calling off the hunters from their appropriate work. With his warm religious temperament, what must have been the feelings of our young man, when he found himself cut loose from the religions of his day, and adrift on a sea of doubt and speculation! The question must have pressed painfully upon him as he walked the streets of Amsterdamn: "Is there any religion which is true, amid this tumult, bloodshed, and wrong? - and, with his constitutional love of peace, he must have sighed for some far-off spot over which the waves of bitterness hid never rolled. He found it. I do not know what first called him to Leyden, or at what precise point of time. But we find him there during the troubles described in the preceding pages, joining his fortunes to those of an obscure company of strangers, who had fled to Holland out of England for protection. As Richard Sayer was never a Calvinist, but held in after life the tolerant sentiments of the Arminians, there is some reason to believe that he sympathized with them at this time, and it is quite possible that the schouts and bailiffs may have been upon his track. At any rate, we find him at Leyden joined to aZ small but meek company of worshippers, who met every Sunday at a private house, and whose sim-  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7721-00000151"/> 292       THE PILGRIM. pie worship, primitive manners, and loving spirit were calculated to charm a young mind which had a tinge of religious romance, and was yearning for : a communion which had never been tainted with  the principles of intolerance. A company of three hundred persons came to  Leyden in 1609,-just iabout the time of the armistice with Spain. They must have been there several years when Richard joined them. They excited little notice at Leyden, except as an indus- trious and sober people, honest in their dealings, * plain in their dress, pure in their lives, at peace A among themselves, and warm in their affections  towards each other. Public worship was not al- lowed them, as only the Presbyterian form was tolerated by the government, but they met unmo- lested at the house of their pastor. This was none other than John Robinson, a man who leaned on the bosom of his Lord all the year, there to get 1 comfort and strength in his many and bitter trials. Never since the primitive days had there been such a flock with such a pastor as assembled in that house at Leyden. Trial and hardship had pencilled their features with the lines of care, but at the same time it had clothed them in the meekest of the  Christian graces, made them patient and gentle, for- giving towards their enemies, and tolerant towards all the disciples of the Lord Jesus. Common dan- gers and hardships had knit them to each other bye the strongest ties of love, and even a stranger, as he looked in upon the little company while they were engaged in worship, would be touched   THE PILGRIM.'      293 with sympathy, especially during the singing and the prayer; for their faces would be rapt like Stephen's with visions of supersensual glory, and their fervid psalms, touching a thousand memories of dark dangers and Divine deliverances, would bring the tears of gratitude from all their eyes in a sweet and gentle rain. "It was the sweetest melody," says one of their number, "that ever mine ears heard." While the noise of tongues was sound- ing everywhere else, and the billows of strife were dashing on every side, this flock at Leyden occu- pied a charmed spot, which was never disturbed, as if"Peace, be still!" from the lips' of the Master, were breathed over it in perpetual benediction. The reader will please take his map and cast his eye over the northern counties of England. You will find two counties, Nottinghamshire and Lin- colnshire, lying adjacent, and both cornering up on the line of Yorkshire. There, as you perceive, a pin's point touches upon those three counties; and about that point there are three towns which were never large enough to have a place on the maps, but which nevertheless contained the elements of a mighty empire. These towns were Austerfield, Scrooby, and lBawtry,--lying near to each other in the three counties severally; the first in Lincoln- shire, the second in Nottinghamshire, and the third in Yorkshire. They are agricultural towns, and the whole region surrounding is an agricultural region, and in the times of which we write was occupied by a population in a happy medium be- tween poverty and riches.

Away from court     X influence, away from the town with its luxuries or its destitutions, they dwelt amid corn-fields and  sheep and kine, read little, saved something from  their hard earnings, and thought somewhat about  God and futurity. * The English Church had been established. Con-    t formity with its rites of worship was required by act of Parliament, and non-conformity punished  with fine and imprisonment. Wealth, rank, sta-    : tion, and respectability were with the Established  Church; the throne, and the aristocracy next to it, were firmly allied with prelacy, and they pressed down with a weight that either crushed out non- conformity or ground it to the earth. The English Episcopal Church had also its bloodhounds, that sought out and Worried the non-conformists in a  manner much as we have described that of the Calvinists in their treatment of the Arminians in Holland,  But in that class which constitutes the middle stratum of English life, made up mainly of the Anglo-Saxon element, there was a growing number who desired a more ascetic religion, and a more se-  vere morality, than were to be found in the Estab-  lishment.

This growing number of people who kept the Sabbath, and who prayed not by reciting from the prayer- book, but wrestled with God in secret, got the name of Puritans; and so early as the reign of Elizabeth were said by Sir Walter Raleigh to comprise twen- ty thousand people throughout England. These were the descendants of " the men that wore fag- ots," and their co-operators and co-thinkers, de- scribed in a former page. Puritanism was simply Lollardism getting ripe and going to seed. They had no visible organization, and they sought safety in obscurity. We find them now and then gather- ing to a head around some nucleus of a conventi- cle, and among the earliest of these manifestations were those in the neighborhood of the obscure towns in the North, - Austerfield, Scrooby, and Bawtry. /     &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7721-00000153"/>  CHAPTER V.               "Till men's persons great afflictions touch,  If worth be found, their worth is not so much,  Because, like wheat in straw, they have not yet That value which in threshing they may get."  THERE was a man by the name of Davison, Sec-      retary in the Court of Queen Elizabeth, who fell  under the sore displeasure of that royal termagant. It is a curious story, and is not generally told truly in the popular histories. Elizabeth signed the death- warrant of her cousin, the Queen of Scots, and gave  it to Davison that he might take it to Walsingham to receive the royal seal. Meanwhile, before the warrant was to be despatched, she devised means of getting Mary taken off, so as not to bear before the  world the fearful responsibility herself. She fore-  saw the odium it would bring upon her. She there- fore ordered Walsingham and Davison to write to  Sir Amyas Paulet and Sir Drue Drury, keepers of  Fotheringay Castle, and let them know that it was  the Queen's pleasure that they should have Mary  put out of the way secretly, and on their own re- sponsibility. The horrified keepers refused the busi- ness. Still Elizabeth brooded over a private mur-   THE PILGRIM.       297 der. Meanwhile, her Council, knowing the fact, and fearing that the Q ueen would shift the burden on their shoulders, or delay the affair from. time to time, and die before the deed was done, sent off the death- warrant privately, and without her knowledge. Ma- ry was thus executed at the very hour when Eliza..,  beth was lamenting that some one who professed to love her would not take the business off her hands; and she actually did not know, of the execution till she heard the bells of London ringing in honor of the event. She was enraged with her ministers for deceiving her, but she vented her wrath principally on Davison. She imposed a ruinous fine upon him, and sent him to the Tower.* This event had an influence on the fortunes of another person, very interesting to those who like to trace the causes of events, and the inter-connection of each with all. Davison while in favor at court had in his employ a private secretary named Wil- liam Brewster. He was a man of good abilities and unswerving honesty, and withal given to relig- ious meditations. After the fall of Davison, he still clung to his patron as a friend, visited him in pris- on, and did everything in his power to soothe his grief and alleviate his misfortunes. But he had seen the vanity of human greatness, and in the mock-sunshine of the court had learned thoroughly the lesson which Wolsey learned too late, and Da- vison after him. * All this is proved beyond doubt by the "State Papers," and by private letters given in Miss Strickland's Lives of the Queens, Vol. VI. pp. 50 - 64., /  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7721-00000154"/> 298        THE PILGRIM.'  "Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye!  I feel my heart new opened. O how wretched  Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favors!  There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to, That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin, More pangs and fears than wars or women have; And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer, Never to hope again." Brewster, being now  about thirty-eight years old, sought a place of retirement, far away from  court, where he might give up his mind, unmolested, to religious exercises and contkmplations. He se- lected the little town of Scrooby in Nottingham-  shire, already described. There was an old manor- house in the village, which had formerly been occu- pied by the Archbishops of York, but which had fallen into neglect and decay. Brewster rented it, and retired thither with his wife and family. The parish church was close by, but Brewster did not attend it, preferring private worship in his own fam- ily; and on Sunday, around "the old blessed Bible that lay on the stand," he and his wife, with the - children, Jonathan, Love, Wrestling, Patience, and Fear, gathered for a special exercise of exhortation and prayer. Godly neighbors came in and joined     them, - people whom the formalities of the Church1 ritual did not satisfy,.while they hungered for the bread of life. The old manor-house gradually gath-  ered within it a little congregation, that hung with  rapt attention on the prayers and prophesyings of Brewster. He was something of a scholar, had studied at Cambridge, was fully imbued with the Puritan theology, and withal had a singular gift "            THE PILGRIM.      299 "in ripping up the heart and conscience before God." It was not long before the congregation gathered at his house so regularly, as to require the work and oversight of a regular pastor. Not far off from Scrooby, in the town of Bab- worth, lived a gray-haired old man by the name of -Richard Clifton, who had been a rector of the church in that place, but had embraced Puritan sentiments, and probably been silenced for non-con- formity. At any rate, he came to Scrooby, and was chosen pastor of the congregation that met at Brew- ster's house; and such was his sanctity and his gift at exhortation, that he drew to him devout people from the rural towns in the neighborhood. He had "a great white beard" hanging down upon his breast, and with such power and pungency did he send home the arrows of truth, that it seemed as if one of the old Apostles had risen from the grave. Among those drawn to Brewster's house by the preaching of Clifton, was a boy from .the neighbor- ing town of Austerfield, which lies just over the line in Lincolnshire. Mark the boy well, for Providence has great designs in bringing him hither! He is not more than twelve or fourteen years old; has a pale, meek face; sickness has made him thoughtful, and the opposition of his own friends and relatives has given him a pensive air. His father died when he was only two years old, and left him in the charge of two uncle, Austerfield was a place of licentiousness and wickedness, and the boy has grown up in sight and hearing of it; but his long- continued sickness has kept his mind fixed on bet-  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7721-00000155"/> 300       THE PILGRIM. ter things; he has read his Bible much, and, as some one conjectures, has had access to a choice library  in possession of one of his uncles, where slaking  his early thirst for knowledge has only made him thirst the more. He walks every Sunday over the Idle, - a brook that flows languidly between Aus- terfield and Scrooby, and the sermons of the old man with " a great white beard" have made an in- delible impression on his soul.- His uncles oppose the course he is taking, and  there are profane wits enough in Austerfield to scoff at the young Puritan for his precocious pi- etism. But it is all in vain. A special Providence is training him and leading him on; for that little band at Brewster's house are to colonize a mighty empire, and that pale boy is to be its guide and stay through its first dark and perilous years. This  boy is William Bradford,-the future Governor of the Plymouth colony. Not long after this, the congregation received  another accession. John Robinson had been a preacher of the Established Church near Yarmouth  in Norfolk, but he had been " harried" for non- conformity, and his friends almost ruined in theH ecclesiastical courts. Seeking obscurity and the quiet and unmolested Worship of God, he also found his way to Scrooby. Never since the apostoliq days was there a character in which the opposite qual- ities of firmness and meekness were more beauti- fully blended. He separated from the English Church without a particle of bitterness towards its; communion; he embraced the rigid theology of the   THE PILGRIM.       301 Puritans, which he held with a gentle and an all- comprehending charity. The hardest trials made his temper more mild, and his piety more serene; and persecution and wrong only set free in a more signal manner that spirit of toleration which breathed from his heart like a heavenly perfume. He was associated with Clifton in the pastorate of the church in Brewster's house, and when Clifton removed to Amsterdam, Robinson was left in sole charge of it. Thus and in an obscure corner originated the congregation which in a preceding chapter we have described as being at Leyden, where Richard Sayer found them, and joined their number. Why they left Scrooby and removed to Leyden, and through what perils and hardships, has been de- scribed by Bradford, who became the historian of the Pilgrim church. It will be readily conceived that the old manor-house at Scrooby did not con- ceal them a great while, or shield them from the tender mercies of the bishops and the officials of the ecclesiastical courts. They were fined, impris- oned, and worried, till they finally resolved on re- moval to Holland. They went in separate com- panies, first to Amsterdam, where some of them remained, the aged Clifton among the rest; but most of the Scrooby congregation came finally to Leyden; Brewster, Robinson, and Bradford being the leading spirits of the enterprise, and infusing through its affairs an immortal energy. 26  &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7721-00000156"/> CHAPTER VI. "Wild heather floors and rolling convex skiesi Their temples now." WITH what delightful emotions must the hero of  our simple narrative have listened to the preaching ! of Robinson, as he first joined the Pilgrim congrega- tion at Leyden! Except in the persons of the per- secuted and almost extinguished Arrninians, Chris- tianity had been exhibited to him only as a gloomy and bloody superstition. We have reason to sup- pose that he sought Robinson at Leyden, and was drawn to him by the magnetic power of spirit upon  spirit, much as Bradford had been drawn to Clifton at Scrooby. The longing heart and fond imagination ! of his dreaming boyhood had pictured on his fancy  a church and a Christian polity which had nothing corresponding to it in the state of things around him. From what fulness of heart must he have poured into the ear of the Pilgrim pastor the story  of his ancestral wrongs, and the sighings of his soul after a religion that came to bless, and not to curse! And what a contrast must he have felt as soon as he crossed the threshold into the sphere of that meek  and loving fellowship, which was like an "orb of  tranquillity" in the midst of storms! oa    THE PILGRIM.       303 Robinson believed substantially with the Calvin- ists of Holland, but his whole spirit was that of the Arminians, and their fundamental principle of "God's word above the Catechism and Confession, he adopted, defended, and impressed on the minds of his people. He disputed with the Arminians, held a controversy with Episcopius in the Univer- sity, wrote in defence of Predestination; but no barbed words ever fell from his tongue, and no drop of gall ever flowed from his pen.* He was a ripe scholar, and his piety was^ not less constant and fervent than his learning was varied and profound. It is probable that the struggle was long and se- vere, before the-final separation of the tie between Richard and his kinsfolk at Amsterdam. We have no record of that struggle; but his parents being Catholics, and therefore regarding the obscure band of Separatists at Leyden with no favorable eye, it must have been a grievous disappointment when their son joined the despised company of Pilgrims. How many times he travelled from Amsterdcm to Leyden before he finally embarked his hopes and his fortunes; how the love of home and friends strug- gled with religious convictions and aspirations; how his spirit was charmed with the apostolic be- nignity and heavenly eloquence of the Pilgrim pas- tor, and thrilled and melted by the quivering pathos of the worship, and " the music sweeter than ear * Bradford says he "non-plussed"Episcopius in debate. He must have been a remarkable man to accomplish, single-handed, what the whole Synod of Dort could not, even when backed by the States-General.

But ,at the time Richard joined them, they had come to  the determination to quit Holland, and seek a home  beyond the Western main; and his imagination was just the one to be captivated by the dream of a  Utopia beyond the waters, far away from rumors of strife and dissension, where brethren should dwell i together in unity, and worship God free fromn the, pest of the schouts and bailiffs. There they would  establish a commonwealth where humanity should  :  start anew, and the Church of Christ arise in the ! purity and splendor of her- primitive days, with no  wrinkle on her brow, and no blood-spot on her robes. The Scrooby church had been in Holland only about eleven years, when they resolved on a new  emigration. Their lot in Holland was a hard one, 1 for though they were at peace among themselves,  and their worship was unmolested, yet poverty al-  ways stared them in the face; they were strangers  and sojourners, and the jargon of a foreign language  was always sounding in their ears. What grieved them most of all, their children grew up and left them, sometimes assimilating to the native popula- tion, adopting their habits and customs, which were  often corrupt, some becoming soldiers, others tak- ing them upon far voyages by sea, and others some  worse courses, tending to dissoluteness and the dan- ger of their souls." They saw that, if they remained  in Leyden, they should ultimately disappear, melt- ing away as a soluble element in the foreign pop- IJ    THE PILGRIM.       305 ulation, instead of establishing a Church that from small beginnings should grow mighty, and invite the poor and oppressed to its sheltering bosom. This was their fondest dream, -not only to estab- lish a true church for themselves, but ope that should endure and be a blessing to all posterity. But whither shall they go? Sir Walter Raleigh a few years before had published his "Discovery of Guiana," and the gorgeousness of his description had well-nigh captivated the sober imagination of some of the Pilgrims. He calls it " a mighty rich and beautiful empire, lying under the equinoctial. line,"-its capital " that great and golden city which the Spaniards call El Dorado, and the na- tives Manoa, and for greatness, richness, and excel- lent seat, it far excelleth any of the world."  He sailed up the Orinoco in 1595, in quest of this imaginary city. "On both sides of the river we passed the most beautiful country that ever mine eyes beheld,--all fair, green grass, the deer cross- ing in every path, the birds towards the evening singing on every tree with a thousand several tunes, and every stone we stopped to take up promised either gold or silver by his complexion. For health, good air, pleasure, and riches, I am resolved it can- not be equalled by any region either in the East or West.'"Some, and "'none of the meanest" of the company, were earnest for this land of eternal summer; but they were outvoted by the majority, + Raleigh's Works, Vol. VIII. pp. 381, 398, 427, 442.

What a future was depending on that debate and that decision! It comes not within our scope to detail the  heart-sickening perplexities which intervened be- tween their purpose and the execution. After de- lays and difficulties, the Speedwell is got ready, and is lying at Delfthaven waiting to take its sorrowful freight on another and more perilous exile. The younger and more vigorous portion of the company, numbering about one hundred and  twenty, are to go first; the elder and more infirm are to tarry behind, and follow on when P]ovidence shall prepare the way. But among those who are going are Brewster and Bradford, not now the pale-  faced boy, but the grown man of thirty, schooled in  misfortune, unconquerable through faith, and wise and prudent by experience. Richard Sayer may have been present to witness  that scene, memorable in history, and described in , Bradford's style of Hebrew simplicity and pathos. Delfthaven is the harbor of the fine old city of  Delft, lying on the Meuse, about fourteen miles  south of Leyden. This fourteen miles the Pilgrims are to pass over by the canal. It is the last of July, and the barge takes them over the polders  alive with thriving industry, and past the neat cottages with tulips and roses beneath the win- dows; but the beautiful prospect on either side must have looked sad enough to the departing exiles. They pass through the city of Delft, and thence the barge comes into the "Haven," which is   THk PILGRIM.

And now the barge has reached the wharf, where the Speedwell lies ready to receive them. Many of the company who are to be left behind, Robinson among them, have accompanied them to the ship, to bid them farewell. They all kneel down together upon the wharf, with faces turned heavenward, and the tears streaming down their care-worn cheeks, while Robinson in tones of be- seeching earnestness sends up his parting prayer under the open sky, and before its last plaintive tone has died away the whole company with break- ing hearts are sobbing aloud. Some burly Dutch- men who stood not far off brushed the tears from their eyes as they witnessed the holy scene. Then, after embracing each other again and again, they parted, - many of them never to meet more. Those left behind waved their hands till the bark faded away on the Meuse towards the open sea, straining their eyes after it till it melted in the blue distance, and then returning with heavy hearts to Leyden.

What a wonderful Providence was that, which led on the little company that met for prayer in that old manor-house at Scrooby! The pale-faced, conscientious boy, who walked over every Sunday from Austerfield to hear Clifton preach, has come in the Mayflower, a full-grown man; he has prayed much and studied much,- has learned Greek and Hebrew from an insatiable desire to read the Divine oracles in the original tongues, and 4 see them in all their native beauty." Meanwhile Richard Sayer is with the remainder of the congregation at Leyden, and with them is waiting a favorable opportunity to join the new exiles. His father had made strenuous exertions to recover the paternal estate at Colchester, and a long and bitter controversy had been the conse- quence, It ended in total alienation between the Sayers of Holland and the Sayers and Knyvets of England, and the former were threatened with a criminal prosecution if they set foot again in the land of their fathers. This, with the motives al- ready given, may have urged him to quit Holland for ever. His father died in 1629, and not till then does the way seem to have been clear to him to embark his fortunes with the Pilgrims. He then came in possession of his paternal inheritance, and he made immediate preparations to carry his purpose into ex- ecution.

He died  in 1625, longing for a reunion with his absent flock. The portion left at Leyden, and the portion I who had gone to New-Plymouth, seem to have    Al been like two lobes o a heart torn cruelly asunder,  and seeking to be joined again, and to beat in  unison.  Robinson's letters to the absent portion show the  most ardent affection and tender solicitude. Why he never came over does not appear very clearly in  Bradford's History, or in the letters which passed  between the two divisions of the Pilgrim church; but,  it since appears that the jealous eyes of James and  his bishops were upon the whole enterprise, watch- :n ing all its movements, and that the agents of the Virginia Company had secret and positive orders tot keep Robinson separated from his Plymouth flock. i? Always longing to look once more upon the faces  so cruelly parted-from him at Delfthaven, he yeti died without the sight, and tears of a truer and - more tender affection never fell upon a good   ! man s grave.  After Robinson's death, the remnant of the Ley- : den congregation came over and joined their breth- ren. In 1629 came thirty-five, with their families.  In 1630 came sixty more, and among them. was Richard Sayer. He had settled his affairs at Am-  sterdam, after his father's death, given up, all hope  of recovering his paternal estates at Colchester, be- come heart-sick with the controversy arnd with the , selfishness of man, sick with the noise of sects that  filled the country with strife and had but recently [   THE PILGRIM.       3" stained its beautiful fields with blood; and, sighing for a peaceful retreat, and a pure and unmolested worship, he gathered up his fortune, which must have been considerable, and embarked with the Ley- den exiles, with whom he landed at Plymouth, May 8, 1630. His company was the last that came over from Leyden, it being the last of the Scrooby con- gregation that remained in Holland, and with them all of it that survived in this world was gathered once more in sweet and loving fellowship in the Western wilderness. How joyous must have been the first songs which they lifted up to the cold sky, when no hounds were on the scent, anc only God and his angels were listening!  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7721-00000161"/> CHAPTER     VIII.  "Among the watching hills a nook they found  Where the hushed winds a holy Sabbath keep; Where war's red foot had never dyed the ground, Nor ravening wolves disturbed the gentle sheep." THEIR first settlement at New Plymouth was  along the street still known as Leyden Street, made  up at first of rudely-built houses, surrounded by  a palisade. In the midst rose a, larger building, which served both as a council-house and a place of worship; and here, until they found a pastor,  they gathered as at first around the godly (' Elder Brewster," who in teaching " was very stirring," and t "had a singular good gift in prayer." Among the   a commendable qualities of his prayers, brevity was one; and perhaps to this he owed that other of pith  and searching pungency already described, whereby he " ripped up the conscience before the Lord." Outside the palisade the field was staked out into lotsi in which each family cultivated its patch  of beans and Indian corn. Notwithstanding their trials and hardships, sometimes from the winter cold, sometimes from the drouth of the summer     heat, 'sometimes from sickness and famine, and  /'   THE PILGRIM.      313 sometimes from fear of the savage, their cheerful faith never deserted them; their hymn rose every morning over the forest woods, and those who sank into the grave departed hence full of the hope of immortality. They never looked back with regrets or repinings, being, as one of them had said, " well weaned from the delicate milk of their mother coun- try, and inured to the difficulties of a strange and hard land." It soon appeared, however, that they had pitched upon a spot whose soil was poor and barren. We fancy that those of the company who had been strenuous for removal to Guiana thought their counsels had been unwisely set at naught, as they contrasted in imagination the sand-fields of New Plymouth with the banks of the Orinoco, and their plains of refulgent green, where the birds sang a thousand tunes, and " the deer came down feeding by the water's side as if they had been used to a keeper's call." At any rate, they began to grow dis- contented with their situation, and file off in little companies in search of greener spots and a kindlier soil. Hence we find, that, within fourteen years af- ter the last remnant of the 'church at Leyden had'- been brought over, serious apprehensions arose lest it should be dissolved, because many of the inhab- itants had left the town, and others still contemplat- ed leaving on account of the "barrenness of the place." Not less than three little sub-colonies had gone out from the parent colony, so that, in the lan- guage of the records, "this poor church was left like an ancient mother grown old and forsaken of 7  &#xD;<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7721-00000162"/> 314       THE PILGRIM. her children, in regard to their bodily presence and  personal helpfulness; her ancient members being  most of them worn away by death, and those of  later times being like children translated into other families; and she like a widow left only to trust in God. Thus she that had made many rich, became herself poor."  Oddly enough, however, as it seems to us at this distance of time, they sought better situations by re- moving farther down the Cape, over its downs and  sand-hills. Two sub-colonies went forth in this di- i rection, and formed settlements near to each other in'localities known by the Indians as Sursuit and  Mattakeese, the sites severally of the present towns  of East Dennis and Yarmouth.* These two settle- ments were seven or eight miles from each other, and were both at first included in the same town- ship. One of them, that of Sursuit, it lies in my way to describe.' As you travel eastward from Plymouth, passing  down the Cape on the northern shore through the modern towns of Barnstable, Yarmouth Port, North  Dennis, and East Dennis, you very soon discover what must have been the attractions which drew the children away from their poor mother at Plym- outh, till she felt forsaken. Between the gentle ele- vations along the shore, and the sand-hills that rise farther inland, there is an interval which contains  rich alluvial deposits watered by unfailing springs. They form some of the best soil in Massachusetts, - Mattakeese, however, extended some distance within the present limits of East Banstable, -         r   THE PILGRIM.       315 and are like oases in the desert. Along these hollows and basins lay the region of Mattakeese. Passing farther on through Yarmouth into Dennis, and as- cending an elevation called Scargo Hill, you look over into green meadows, with rank waving grass, through which "Sursuit Creek" and   Quivet Creek" wind with soft music to the sea. These are the meadows of Sursuit, on whose margin the pretty village of East Dennis now stands, but which in the Pilgrim days had only here and there an In- dian wigwam with its smoke creeping lazily into the air.  About the year 1643, a company led by Richard Sayer left Plymouth, passed down through Matta- keese, which had already begun to be colonized, kept on to Scargo Hill, and looked down upon the meadows of Sursuit and Quivet, shut in on three sides by sand-hills, and open on the left to the sea. Could there be a more charming retreat from schouts and bailiffs, or a place less likely to be dis- turbed by the noises of the world and the strife of tongues? Descending into this quiet nook, he and his company pitched their'tents and selected the sites of their future habitations. Between the two creeks whose Indian names we have given above, there was a tongue of land called Quivet Neck," made up in part of alluvial depos- its, and forming therefore the best and most fertile soil. Richard Sayer purchased the greater part of this neck of land, and built his house upon it. On this gentle swell he could hear the crooning of the two brooks on either side of him as they wound /  &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7721-00000163"/> 316       THE PILGRIM. through the meadows, and he could look over the green interval into the broad blue ocean, always sounding with the march and countermarch of its waves. After two hundred years, the house which  he built has disappeared; but the precise spot is still to be seen where his household gods found undis- turbed repose. We do not know all the names of the first company, but some time afterwards we find among his neighbors and associates John Wing, Kenelm Winslow, John Dillingham, and Zachariah Paddock. Kenelm Winslow was a brother of Gov-  ernor Winslow, and settled afterwards at Marsh- field. Of Zachariah we shall get a glimpse in, the following chapter. Notwithstanding his peace-loving habits, the Pil- grim, as tradition says, held a military office, and  lost an arm by a gun-shot wound in some conflict with the Indians. He also appears on the records as constable of Yarmouth, and once on some com- mittee in ecclesiastical affairs. , .4, X}   CHAPTER IX. "And may thd sun of life, when near its setting, Clothe in more beauteous gleams the distant hills." RICHARD SAYER, before he left Plymouth, had mar- ried Dorothy Thacher. She was a sister of Antho- ny Thacher, who removed from Plymouth to Matta- keese, and whose name is familiarly known in the Pilgrim annals. The children of this marriage were three sons, Knyvet, Paul, and Silas, and one daughter named Deborah. With this family gathered about him, he passed the latter half of a long life in this peaceful retreat, whose seclusion seems to have been fully congenial with his gentle spirit. Before we take leave of him, we will endeavor, from what material we have, to reproduce his surroundings, and put them as dis- tinctly as we can hpon the canvas. It is a picture of primitive manners, which contrasts strangely enough with those two hundred years later among the descendants of the Pilgrims. On Quivet Neck he has built a house one-story high, roofed with thatch, and fronting south with such precision as to serve as a sun-dial and indicate the hour of noon. The fireplace is made of rough 27*  &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7721-00000164"/> 318       THE PILGRIM. stone; the chimney, of boards, plastered over in- side with clay. Both the fireplace and the chim- ney-flue are of immense capacity, so that, after a rousing fire has been kindled on a winter's evening, the family can occupy both the spaces on each side of it, and lookl up through the chimney opening, and gaze at the stars. What visions of other days must have come over the old Pilgrim, as he sat there and heard the whistling winds and the roaring on the sea-beach, and looked up through his chimney- flue and saw the same planets that twinkled upon him on the Princen Graat of old Amsterdam! But  the neighbors come in during the long evenings, to talk over the news of the Colony, and be regaled with mugs of cider and barley-beer. John Wing, John Dillingham, John Grey, Richard Taylor, and some others, have also nestled into the quiet nook of Sursuit; but of all the neighbors Zachariah Pad-  dock comes oftenest-and stays the longest, yea, gets close up to Deborah in the chimney-corner, and stays there till all the reAt have retired; and they two look up together through the flue and count the stars. Zachariah is the son of Robert Paddock, A who was the son of Zachariah, who came over, say my family papers, in the Mayflower; but he cer- tainly did not, for hit name is not on the list, as everybody may see by looking at it. But no mat- ter. Zachariah Paddock got over some way, and  his grandson Zachariah is bent on star-gazing in the chimney-corner with Deborah Sayer. Deborah has grown into a comely and healthy maiden, without any hacking cough, and with no   THE PILGRIM.      319 occasion for either valerian or homceopathic glob- ules. Well she might, for she wears in cold weath- er a flannel gown, and in warm weather a gown of linen homespun, both of which she had to spin and weave herself; the latter from flax which the boys, Knyvet, Paul, and Silas, raised on Quivet Neck. It is very fortunate for Deborah that she is thus getting strength and bloom for future years, for by and by she and Zachariah will have eight children to bring up as a contribution to the rising Colony. A meeting-house had been built between the two settlements of Mattakeese and Sursuit, but much nearer to the former, and there the inhabitants of both villages met together on Sunday, to listen to Rev. Marmaduke Matthews; an exceedingly good man, but whose goodness sometimes lacked the ballast of common sense. It stood not far from the site of the present Orthodox meeting-house in Yar- mouth, and thither on Sunday morning the people might be seen wending their way, from either set- tlement, for -the worship of God. The meeting- house has neither bell nor steeple, but a thatched roof, and perhaps port-holes; with the muzzles of muskets, if need be; grimly pointing through; for though there is no danger of interruption from po- lice officials, yet there may be from Indian savages. The Colony Court has passed a law, that, ' if any lazy, slothful, or profane persons,'in any of the towns, neglect to come to the public worship of God, they shall forfeit for every such default ten shillings, or be publicly whipped," for our good  &#xD;<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7721-00000165"/> 320       THE PILGRIM. ancestors judged that people had better be brought to a knowledge of Christianity through flagellation, than not at all. As South says, ironically, of the Roman Catholic penance, they made thongs and whipcord essentials of salvation. Imagine, then, on a calm summer's morning, the people of Sursuit summoned to the place of prayer. No bell pours out its solemn music, but in the place of it some one "beats upon the drum," and that is the roll-call to church which is borne on the breeze over the Sursuit meadows. It is six or sevenl miles to church, and there is not a vehicle in the  place, for they had not yet come into use, and both the old Pilgrims and young must go to hear Marma-  duke Matthews. The procession is soon on its way; Richard Sayer is on horseback, with his 'wife Dor- othy behind him; and they ride just half the dis- tance, and fasten the horse by the way-side for  - Goodman Wing and his wife to take it and ride in their turn. By this arrangement the same horse accommodated two or three neighbors, the elderly people always riding a part of the distance, while the young men and maidens walked the whole six or seven miles without weariness. In this way came the procession, winding round Scargo Hill, the old people riding and walking alternately, the young people walking the whole distance, which was short enough when such persons as Zachariah Paddock and Deborah Sayer happened to fall into company with each other. Deborah has doffed her home- spun, and appears in clean calico, one dress of which serves her for a lifetime. It has short sleeves, * ,' ,  *'S E:   tHE PILGRIM.       321 with three ruffs on each arm, and she wears long gloves, made of horse-hair, that come up to the elbow. Her shoes are made of broadcloth, with wooden heels and peaked toes turning up at the end. But she carries her shoes in her hand till she arrives at church, except when Zachariah has the gallantry to relieve her of the burden. Arrived at church, how grateful and fervent must have been the devotions of these people, after all their sacri- fices, escapes, and lAbors. , Their songs of praise need not be suppressed now, but sound full and joyous over the woods and hills. They sit in their plain and neat attire under Marmaduke Matthews, who measures out his sermon to them by the hour- glass. The sexton turns the glass wlen the sermon begins, and the preacher must keep on till the sand runs out, whether his ideas have run out or not. It is not a very difficult rule, however, for Father Matthews, who is said to have used words without much reference to thoughts, and to have been called to account by his brethren for preaching heresy when he was not aware of it. Richard Sayer lived to be the patriarch of the little colony of Sursuit, and to see his children and his children's children settled around him. Fields of corn, of beans, and of flax covered the gentle acclivities, and the tall grass waved along the green margin of the brooks; and without wealth or want the little community thrived and prospered. Indus- try and frugality were in the place of riches, and piety and virtue brought down the Divine bless-  &#xD;<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7721-00000166"/> 322       THE PILGRIM.  ing without interruption. These homebred virtues were guarded by strict laws and social maxims. It is related by an old chronicler, that a certain neighbor of his father had four sons, whose habits of profusion excited the alarm of the village; " for I the oldest got a pair of boots, the second an over- coat, the third a watch, and the fourth a pair of shoe-buckles"; and the neighbors all shook their heads, and whispered to each other, "That family is on the high road to insolvency." The posses- sion of any one of these articles of luxury would perhaps have done serious damage to the suit of Zachariah Paddock. Richard Sayer was once or twice summoned  from his seclusion, as Deputy to the Colony Court at Plymouth. But he seems to have found what he sighed after amid the strifes and the tumults of the Old World, -a place far away from the ru- mors of oppression, deceit, and bloodshed, where he might worship God with a free conscience and breathe out his soul in peace. He lived to a green and honored old age, and died in 1676. He had    seen eighty-six years ere he rested from his labors; and the people of the village of Sursuit that grew up around him followed him to his peaceful grave. Children and children's children were there to talk of his virtues around his bier. His ashes repose in the old Yarmouth churchyard, where one of his descendants, with filial reverence and affection, has erected a costly monument to his memory. * Pratt's History of Eastham, pp. 177j 178.

WE  will not take our final leave of the good men whose labors and sacrifices we have been re- viewing, without a filial tribute to    their virtues. This we do, because, with all the eulogy bestowed upon them   by popular historians and orators, we doubt if their principles are yet fully understood. They are constantly confounded with the Massa- chusetts Puritans, whereas they were entirely differ- ent in character, temper, principles, and policy. We have already stated that the three leading minds of the Scrooby church were Robinson, Brew- ster, and Bradford.   Their spirit and doctrines be- came the soul of the Pilgrim enterprise from the beginning. Of the first we have said enough per- taining to his large, heavenly, and tolerant spirit. Brewster lived to a serene ola age.     He died in   THE PILGRIM.    '  325 1644, aged 84 years. 'With all his perseverance and energy, he was a man of great kindliness and modesty. Eminently qualified for the pastoral office, his diffidence and profound reverence for it prevented his assuming it, though in the humbler station of '"Elder he virtually discharged all its duties up to the year 1629, when a regular pastor was settled at Plymouth. More than any other man the originator and father of the Pilgrim church, he shared as a private citizen in all its toils, spent his fortune in the enterprise, and almost to the day of his death worked with his hands in the field. But all the more for his meekness and modesty did his, example shed its hallowed light and diffuse his be- nignant and pious spirit through the rising colony. Almost to the day of his death he kept about his humble duties, and at the last he seemed not. so- much to die as to subside into the bosom of God's love, like a wave sinking into the bosom of the sea. He took one day to his bed, where he lay without a pang or a groan; but as the evening was coming on " he drew his breath short," and some minutes before his last he (" drew -his breath long,-',ahd on that tranquil- sigh his spirit was wafted away, Bradford died in 1657, aged 69. He was born and bred to agricultural pursuits; and if the words of the aged Clifton had not touched his youthful heart, he would probably have lived and died among the yeomanry of Old England. As Governor of the Colony'through most of the first thirty years of its existence, he managed its affairs with consummate wisdom. He was just even to a scruple in all his 28   &#xD;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7721-00000168"/> 326       THE PILGRIM.

As a writer and historian, he has rare merits, for he tells his story with the perspicuity and ease of the scholar, yet with the unconsciousness of the child. With none of the pedantry of Cotton Math- er, his style has sometimes a peculiar charm and pathos on account of its artlessness, and steals on the reader's heart like the plaintive narratives of Scripture, which must have been his classic model. More than all, though the faith of Bradford was strongly puritanic, it had not the least tinge of fanaticism, but glowed with the ardors of Christian charity. I    v Other names will readily occur to the reader, especially those of Winslow, Cushman, and Carver. But the men now described, more than any others, stamped their characters on the young Colony, and shaped its ends. And it is not a violation of his- torical verity to say, that no people ever carried out their principles more faithfully than the Pilgrim church and its dependencies. Constantly confound- ing the Plymouth men with the Massachusetts men, it is common for writers' and speakers to apologize for their "bigotry" and "intolerance-"' with that stale and wretched excuse, "the spirit of the age," as if it were not the very purpose of a true church to rise above the age, and illumine its darkness and reform its abuses.* These men need no such * A late writer, referring to this impotent plea, though totally   THE PILGRIM.        327 apology, and there is not a church of the nineteenth century which is competent to teach them a first lesson in the principles of toleration. It will be seen from the preceding narratives, that the Scrooby church was gathered from the mid- dle and humbler walks of English life; from a class that had never been corrupted by the possession of power. After they were "'harried" out of Eng- land, they dwelt twelve years in Holland, shut in from the great world among themselves, and draw- ing closer than ever around the Head of the Church. During that twelve years, those who were children and youth when they came out of England had grown up into men and women under the influence of the saintly Robinson, so that when they came to Plymouth these were the active portion, the very muscle of the Colony. They had imbibed the spirit of Robinson, as it glows through his farewell address. The church at Leyden owned fellowship with all other churches that owned Christ as their head, and they- brought the same principle with them in the Mayflower. So early as 1641, an ordi- nance passed the General Court at, Plymouth, that 4; NO INJUNCTION SHOULD BE PUT ON ANY CHURCH OR CHURCH-MEMBER, AS TO DOCTRINE, WORSHP, OR DIS- CIPLINE) WHETHER FOR SUBSTANCE OR CIRCUMSTANCE, misapprehending the Pilgrims, says., with much pith and force of argument: f"If a persecuting model may thus be copied or pleaded as ample palliation, wlhy may not the Church of England refer her accusers to the persecutions of the Church of Rome, and the Church of Rome' hers to the persecutions of the Pagans, and the Pagans theirs to their persecutions of each other "--Coit on Puritanism, p. 85.  &#xD;<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC7721-00000169"/> 328         THE PILGRIM. BESIDE THE COMMAND OF THE BIBLE." *    They made the acknowledgment of the Bible as supreme au- thority a fundamental principle; the State as well as the Church was founded upon it; but they left -each man free to interpret the Bible for himself. They required no relation of private experiences, no assent. to special articles of faith, but godly living alone, as preliminaries to admission into the church. They were friendly to all sects, not excepting the Quakers and Anabaptists; and when Roger Wil- liams had been driven from   Massachusetts, Wins- low sought him   out in his exile, to cheer and comfort him.  He made a journey from Plymouth to Providence, to take him by the hand. 1"That great and precious soul, Mr. Winslow," says Wil- liams," melted and kindly visited me at Providence, and put a piece of gold into the hands of my wife for our supply." t The Massachusetts Colony came over nine years later than the Plymouth, and it was gathered from alt entirely different class of people. Its leaders were men of rank, wealth, and legal acquirements. They were descendants of earls, gentlemen, and lord mayors. At the time they came, Puritanism t Thatcher's Plymouth, p. 291. t I have said nothing of the church of John Lothrop, which settled early in West Barnstable, and became a constituent part of the Plym- outh Colony. But Lothllrop and his flock were also refugees from persecution; and though they originated in a different part of- Eng- land from the Plymouth people, they were of a like temper with them, and had learned the same lesson from adversity. It is said that most of them came originally from Kent.   '    THE PILGRIM.       329 was rising rapidly into power and consideration in England, and was soon to overturn the throne. The Massachusetts Company was formed in Lon- don, and men who were "large proprietors" em- barked in the enterprise. They were not separatists from the Established Church, and some of them were in full communion with it. They came from amid-  the refinements and comforts of English life, and had never been schooled in poverty and persecution. They had high notions of church prerogative and infallibility. They encountered no hardships in emi- gration which can be compared with those of the Pilgrims, but came over, fifteen hundred in a year, bringing their wealth with them. What a contrast have we here with the humble congregation of Scrooby! The leader of the Massachusetts enterprise, be- fore the arrival of Winthrop, was John Endicott, a hard, cruel, and persecuting spirit, and the com- plete opposite of William  Bradford. Hence the whole bearinrg and temper of the Massachusetts Colony were in contrast with those of the Plymouth, and its spirit from the very beginning was one of persecution and intolerance. The Pilgrims natu- rally looked up with deference to the Massachu- setts men, and the only time when they swerved -from  their principles was when they followed the evil counsel of their neighbors. This was in 1657-60, when the excitement against the Quakers ran high in the Massachu- setts Colony, and cruel laws were enacted against them. Some of the persecuted sect found their 28* -.  &#xD;<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7721-00000170"/> 330       THE PILGRIM. way into the Plymouth Colony, and letters came down from Massachusetts, urging the Pilgrim set- tlements to adopt the same policy. Prince was Governor. The just and pious Bradford had gone; and, with few exceptions, the first generation of the Pilgrim church had passed away. Some of the mag- istrates, among whom appear the names of Allerton and Cudworth, rose in opposition to the proposed measures. But they were overruled. At first the Massachusetts influence prevailed. Prince yielded to it, and the odious law was enacted. But the re- bound was sudden and universal back to the first tolerant principles of the Colony. The odious law was blotted out, the discarded magistrates who had opposed it were restored to favor, among whom was a son of John Robinson, who had imbibed the principles of the Quakers. No blood was shed within the Plymouth jurisdiction, and the few pun- ishments inflicted were more for contempt of court than on account of religious opinion. Tradition says, that in all these controversies the patriarch of Sursuit was on the liberal side. The early legislation of the Pilgrim Colony was statesmanlike, just, and liberal. Hardly an instance will be found among the laws on the Plymouth records of that meddlesome interference with private rights, or that espionage over household matters, that disgraces the records of Massachusetts and Connecticut. No code of "blue laws" was ever enacted by the Pilgrims. An enlightened forecast, and a severe and practical common sense, are every- where apparent. We have alluded to the law for   THE PILGRIM.      331 the fine or the flagellation of non-attendants on public worship; but it applied only to " lazy, sloth- ful, or profane persons," who were sometimes found hanging about the infant settlements, to corrupt the morals of the youth, and it was designed to put them in the most direct way for a better course of life. In all their dealings with the Indians, the Pil- grims treated them as men,- not as Pagans and Canaanites, to be preyed upon by God's people; and they scrupulously'observed with them the obli- gations of humanity and justice. Once, in the ex- tremity of hunger, they found and appropriated a quantity of corn that belonged to the natives, but afterwards took the earliest opportunity to seek out the owners, tell them what they had done, and ren- der to them the most ample remuneration. If any Englishman wronged the red-man, he was sure, if found out, to be brought to punishment. In one in- stance, three men who had robbed and murdered an Indian, and who came back to Plymouth for protec- tion and security, were apprehended, tried, and sen- tenced, and expiated their crime upon the gallows. In the eye of the Pilgrim, every man, heathen though he was, belonged to the same brotherhood with himself, and had equal rights and immunities before the Eternal Justice. Such a case of shocking bar- barity towards the Indian as may be found detailed in Savage's Winthrop,* and which Coit cites with much point in his attack on Puritanism, could iever have occurred within the jurisdiction of Plymouth.

The Plymouth people derived their ideas of government from the inherent rights of man. , To the latter belongs the undying honor of originating and diffusing the principles of Congregationalism in New England,- the doctrine that each separate church is complete in itself, is responsible to no synods or councils, but to Christ alone. Before they left England, and while yet in the humble seclusion of Scrooby, they "shook off the yoke of Antichristian bondage "; and they pledged themselves to each other, "to walk in all the ways of the Lord made known, or TO BE MADE KNOWN, unto them, according to their best endeavors." * Thus from Brewster's old mansion in Nottinghamshire they brought away the doctrine of the sacred rights of the human mind. No church had any authority over it, but Christ alone, nor could any church shut out from its own members the light "to ibe made known," and thus deprive them of a glorious future,-living doctrines to them, strug- gling away from the cold prison and the wintry night of prelacy into Christ's free Gospel, which they hailed as a reviving spring. These doctrines were the precious freight of the Mayflower. The Massachusetts men brought with them no such principles. They had not separated from the Church of England, and they fell into its intolerant practices. They believed in the highest * Young's Chronicles of the Pilgrims, p. 21.   THE PILGRIM.       333 governmental prerogatives, both in the Church and the State. The individual was of no account before the Juggernaut of Arbitrary Power; and the eccle- siastical polity of Massachusetts was at first, in point of fact, a church despotism of the most absolute kind. A good many others besides Roger Wil- liams and Ann Hutchinson found out this to their own bitter experience. The spirit of the Plymouth men, however, in some measure diffused itself as a boon of priceless value to the sister colonies. "Some of the chief of them," writes Winslow, "' advised with us how they should do to fall upon a right platform of woiship, and de- sired to that end, since God had honored us to lay the foundation of a commonwealth, and to settle a church in it, to show them whereupon our practice was grounded; and if they found upon due search it was built upon the Word, they should be willing to take up what was of God.  We accordingly showed them the primitive practice for our warrant, taken out of the Acts of the Apostles and the Epis- tles, together with the commandments of Christ the Lord in the Gospel, and our other warrants in every particular we did, from the book of God. Which being by them well weighed and considered, they also entered into covenant with God and one an- other to walk in all his ways revealed, or as they should be made known unto them, and to worship him according to his will revealed in his written word only." * * Young's Chronicles, p. 386. s! i'   &#xD;<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC7721-00000172"/> 334       THE PILGRIM. In nothing do the Plymouth men appear with more honorable distinction than in their freedom from the wretched and drivelling superstitions which afflicted Massachusetts, and fixed an inef- faceable blot upon her fame. They were not only men of piety and liberality, but of that broad and clear common sense which secured them against the delusions of their day. It is not generally known that there were trials for witchcraft in the Old Colony also, as the account of them is only found reposing in her ancient records. It is not a record that she has reason to be ashamed of; and ode of her sons has recently searched it out and held it up as a specimen of Pilgrim legislation, on a subject that requires the historian of Massachu- setts Bay to plead " the ignorance of the -age." It is short, but pithy and to the point. In 1676, Mary Ingraham was tried for witchcraft, and promptly acquitted by a jury of twelve men. But sixteen years before, there was a trial which exhibits yet more signally the beauty of justice as it was administered in the Old Colony. In 1660, Dinah Silvester, of Scituate, accused the wife of William Homes of being a witch. An examina- tion is held, and Dinah is produced as a witness. We condense the account, and give the substance of it. Court. You say that William Homes's wife is a witch. What evidence have you of the fact? Dinah. She appeared to me as a witch. -Court. In what shape? Dinah. In the shape of a bear, your honor.   THE PILGRIM.       335 --Court., How far off was the bear? Dinah. About a stone's throw from the highway. Court. What manner of tail did the bear have? Dinah. I cannot tell, your honor, as his head was towards me. Court. Let this examination be recorded for the clearing of William Homes's wife. Ordered, THAT DINAH SILVESTER BE PUBLICLY WHPPED, or else pay the sum of five pounds to William Homes. Or in case the said Dinah make a public acknowl-1 edgment of her crime, she shall only pay William Homes the charge he has been at. And then follows the acknowledgment of Dinah Silvester, that her accusation was false and mali- cious.*  Such in the Pilgrim courts was the summary disposition of a matter which, with precisely the same beginnings, in the sister Colony went on till it involved the whole community in a contagious fanaticism, turned the wits of the clergy and the lawyers, and doomed twenty innocent men and women to a horrible death. The "ignorance of the age," which lay like an, Egyptian night on the fields of Massachusetts, did not even for a moment obstruct the sun's clear shining on the sand-hills around Plymouth Bay. The transactions at Salem are generally excused on the ground that the age believed in the reality of witchcraft. Indeed! and so does every age, though the form of the belief may be somewhat - The account of these trials may be found in the books of "Pub- lic Records," kept in the Court-House at Plymouth.               /   &#xD;<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC7721-00000173"/> 336        THE PILGRIM. -variant. Its vital element was the idea of an in- fernal worldn11 such proximity to the natural that it had the power of projecting its sorceries into the minds of men and women who were willing to re- ceive and entertain them,*  an article of faith cherished as extensively now, perhaps, as it was in the days of the fathers. The Plymouth people held it, and passed a law which made "'solemn compaction or conversing with the Devil by way of witchcraft or the like?? a capital crime. But the difference between them  and their neighbors of Massachusetts Bay was this, -that, when a case presented itself for trial, the former applied to it the wisest rules of evidence and the most enlightened principles of common sense; the latter outraged all the rules of evidence and all common sense, and so plunged without chart or compass into the most hideous and bewildering superstitions. In these remarks, we mean no disrespect or dis- loyalty towards Massachusetts. We mean simply to rescue the name of the Pilgrim from an odium that does not belong to it, and, so far as we are humbly concerned, to place it before the world in that meek but unstained and immortal lustre which is all its own.        '  The Plymouth Colony, comprising the Pilgrim church, with her several daughters about her, was * Consult Cudworth onSorcery, Intellectual System, Book I. Chap*. IV, and' especially Mosheim's notes. Augustine regarded theurgists and sorcerers as "deluded by the fallacious rites of de- mons under the name of angels," -a belief in harmony with his whole system of theology and pneumatology.    THE PILGRIM.      337 "swallowed alive by Massachusetts" in 1692. It had an independent existence of only seventy-one years. It was merged in Massachusetts against its own will. But to this day the Pilgrim blood flows with less foreign intermixture than elsewhere through the veins of the people of the Cape; and in tolerant principles, genial spirit, and generous bearing, in religion without bigotry, and faith warm with the ardors of charity, may be traced, after two hundred years, some moral lineaments of the Scrooby congregation. 29  &#xD;<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC7721-00000174"/> rs\  Z  l /       /   NOTRE. I GIVE here a specimen of the skeletons I have attempted to galvanize. The following items are taken principally from Burke's "Visitation of Seats and Arms in Great Britain and Ireland," and from private records and documents preserved in a family of the Old Colony. A great many'disconnected facts, and names which stand in broken lineage, occur in the early English annals, but the ances- tor of the Colchester Sayers, whose fortunes have been described in the preceding pages, was Adam Sayer, who died possessed of the manor of Hougham, near Rochester, in the county of Kent, in 1346. He had a son, who was returned to serve in Parlia- ment in the reign of Henry VI., and a grandson who was created a Banneret by Henry VII. after the battle of Stoke in 1487.  But the first name among his descendants that stands at the head of an unbroken line is that of 1. John Sayer of Colchester, alderman of that city, a man of considerable wealth and dignity, who died in 1509, and was bur- ied in St. Peter's Church under the south aisle,-- a mural brass memorial recording, in Old English letters, his name and honors. At what time the Sayers removed from Kent to Colchester does not appear, but long before the above date they had held the highest offices in the corporation of that city, and exerted an extensive influence -in its affairs. John Sayer left three sons, viz.: 2. John, Robert, and George. The eldest of these, John, died in 1562, and was buried near his father, with a similar brass memorial. He left two sons, viz. :- 3. Richard and George. Richard was born at Colchester in  &#xD;<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC7721-00000175"/> 340            NOTE. 1508, and married Anne Bourchier, daughter of Sir Edmund Knyvet of Ashwelthorpe, in the county of Norfolk. It was  during the time of Richard Sayer that religious animosities and persecutions attained their height, excited by the violence of Henry VIII. Richard became a warm and zealous partisan on the side opposed to his own relatives, as well as the existing gov- ernment, and found it necessary to escape with his wife and oth-. er refugees into Holland, where he settled at Amsterdam, in 1540. The lot of his wife - the noble Lady Anne - was a hard one, but bravely and cheerfully borne. Because she took the side of her husband, anid clung to him in adversity, she incurred the lasting displeasure of the Knyvets. Her father seems to have become so bitterly estranged from her as to erase her name from all his family records, that she might be forgotten. - He regarded her in fact as if dead, and gave her name, Anne, to a younger daughter while she was yet living. The exiled and persecuted woman long survived her husband, living in Amsterdam in charge of her orphan boy. George, in consequence of Richard's flight, secured for himself possession of the patrimonial inheritance. There was a long and bitter controversy for the ancient estate between him and his heirs on the one hand, and Richard's heirs on the other, ending in total alienation and non-intercourse. George died in 1577, and was buried with his ancestors in St. Peter's Church, Colches- ter. A beautiful marble monument erected to his memory in the south side of the chancelbears a quaint epitaph, which has re- niote allusions to the family controversy. The first portion of it is as follows : - "O happier Sayer that here in grave doth lie, Whose body resteth now in Earth, whose ghost with Christ on high, His youthfull race he ran with travayle and with troth, His middle and his aged years with wealth and worship both; Full thirty years or more, cheef rule or place he bare In this his native ancient town whereof he had great care; With justice he did rule, and eke with mercy mylde, With love he lyved many years of man, woman, and child. A monument he made, for ever to remain, For ayde to poor and aged wights which are oppressed with payfe."'   NOTE.           341 The " poor and aged wights" seem to have got a little of the patrimony which belonged of right to his injured brother, - not an unusual expedient which some people have in this world for getting on in the way to heaven. The flight of Richard was in 1537. There is a single anachro- nism in the text of Part II., which, though slight, ought to be men- tioned. Richard is there made a witness to the scene of Father Bache's execution. Father Bache was not, in fact, executed un- til about a year after Richard left the country.- The execution then took place precisely as related, it beingo anticipated a little in the narrative, to make the picture more complete. Richard the exile left an only son, viz.:-- 4. John Bourchier Sayer. He'became, at the death of his grandfather, heir to the family estates in Essex. But the same difficulties that forced his father to quit England still existed, and he was excluded from the succession. He was of a bold and ad- venturous disposition, and sought renown by his own exertions. He fell in with -Sir John Hawkins, the distinguished navigator, obtained his confidence, accompanied him in many of his voyages, and obtained the hand of his daughter "Bess." He lived through the trying times of the war in the Netherlands, in which he is said to have taken a part. He died in Holland, leaving by Eliz- abeth Hawkins, his wife, four sons, viz.: - 5. John Bourchier, Henry, William, and Richard. The first married Maria L., daughternof Philip Lamoral van Egmond, and acquired with her a large fortune, principally in money. The family papers assume that this Philip L. van Egmond was the son of the murdered Count Egmond, the victim of Alva. The Count had a son of that name, who fell at the battle of Ivry. There is reason, however, to believe that the father-in-law of Sayer was another Philip, belonging to another branch of the Eggmond family. - This John Bourchier Sayer purchased with his wife's fortune t property in England,adjoining the patrimonial lands which he hoped to recover. But his return to England was resisted stout- ly by his kinsfolk there, who charged him with participation in the "Gunpowder Plot," and threatened him with a trial-for treason should he set foot in England. He wrote them a long  &#xD;<pb n="342-343 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC7721-00000176"/> 342           NOTE. letter, which closed the controversy. The letter was extant not a great many years since among the family papers, and was spoken of by those who had seen it as remarkably able and excellent. He died in Holland in 1629. By Maria L. van Egmond, his wife, he left two sons, viz; :- 6. Richard and John. John went to England; Richard, dis- gusted with the ancestral controversy, and sick of the distrac- tions of the times, - for the Calvinist -war in Holland was at fts height, -joined Robinson's congregation, and embarked his for- tune with the Pilgrims. The likeness which fronts the title-page of a private edition of this work was copied originally from a portrait in the gallery of the Egmond family in Amsterdam. THE END.

Price $1. "This book should be in the hands of all those who would learn to read and translate French in the shortest period of time possible, especially if they under- take to do so with little or no assistance from a teacher.

It employs the best and most rapid method, and is the best book of the kind we are acquainted with. Teachers and others should examine it." - Telegraph. GLEANINGS FROM THE POETS, FOR HOME AND SCHOOL.
