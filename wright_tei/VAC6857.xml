               <p>At the time our story opens, the State of Maine was a Province of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and called the "District of Maine". It has long since risen to an eminent position. It is famed for the intelligence of its inhabitants, the talent and enterprise of its merchants, for the beauty of its women, its fast-sailing ships, its adventurous mariners, successful sea-captains, and its literary men. Its sons are proud, leading citizens in all States and in all lands.</p> 
               <p>In this State the first scenes of our story are laid.</p> 
               <p>If the reader is not already familiar with the Kennebec River, one of the most beautiful and romantic in New England, let him glance at a map, and following its winding with his eyes, rest them upon the sign (O) about forty miles from the sea, of a pleasant town which stands upon the banks of this river, and which, thirty-five years ago, contained about two thousand inhabitants. It was a rural and quiet place, shut in close to the river-side by a low ridge of hills, partly pasture-land and partly wooded, and the favorite resort of the village-boys of a Saturday-afternoon for beech-nutting and bird-nesting; while <choice>
                     <sic>futher</sic>
                     <corr>further</corr>
                  </choice> back still from the hill was a blackberry-meadow, well known to all the little rosy-cheeked girls.</p> 
               <p>To the eye of one ascending the river, the village presented a picturesque aspect, with its neat white two-story houses of the "gentry", that is of the merchants, lawyers, and doctors, and a judge or senator or two; its three church-spires, and pretty streets. It looked like an attractive home, where one would love to dwell apart from the noise of the great world of cities and of commerce.</p> 
               <p>Along the sides of the hill on which the town stood, street rising above street, were several villas of more pretension, embowered in trees and inclosed by gardens. Altogether, the town had a genteel and well-to-do air. Several rows of brick stores, interspersed with more humble wooden ones, stood with their backs to the river in a long line, with here and there a wharf at which one or two gayly-painted sloops or schooners, unloading from Boston or Portland annually, constituted all its commerce present at one time.</p> 
               <p>Opposite the town, and near the cliff-like bank on the opposite shore, were a pair of small green islands, on the upper one of which stood two fishing-huts. To swim to this island was a famous feat of the youths of the town, the distance being three hundred yards; and in the dark, narrow passage of clear water behind it, the boys of the village, crossing over in canoes or yawls, borrowed from the good-natured skippers of the sloops, learned to swim.</p> 
               <p>This was in the days innocent of steam-boats to disturb the primeval quiet of the beautiful river. In this day there was but little known of religious differences. All the townspeople had been of one mind as to doctrines, and sat under one minister, a Puritan Congregationalist, who had grown gray among them, until a Baptist preacher came among them and created a division, and by-and-by built a church with a tinned cupola and yellow front. Then arose discussions, and <choice>
                     <sic>neigbors</sic>
                     <corr>neighbors</corr>
                  </choice> loved each other less. By-and-by, some of the merchants and lawyers who had waxed rich and worldly, having been up to Boston, and heard a great and fashionable Unitarian orator, returned, and said that they must have a Unitarian church. So the good old Puritan, Rev. Dr. Willett, saw some of his richest people set themselves off, and erect a handsome Unitarian church, after the plan of the Parthenon, remotely imitated in wood.</p> 
               <pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6857-00000003"/> 
               <p>This became the church of the town. It was carpeted, cushioned, had a chandalier, and a velvet-adorned pulpit, and carried all before it.</p> 
               <p>The Baptists ceased to grow, and the old Orthodox meeting-house, which had served the citizens for half a century, was regarded as quite behind the age-and its venerable minister, too!</p> 
               <p>The rural innocence of the town was gone forever, with these innovations. Then came into the village a great revival-Methodist. He drew immensely, and orthodoxy suffered still more. The venerable pastor's voice found every Sunday more and more echoes from empty seats. What with the Baptist church, with its very genteel preacher, in white vest and gold cane; and the Unitarian, with its learned, and scholastic, and eloquent clergyman, who had even been in Europe; and what with the Methodists, with their exciting preaching-Dr. Willett, and his old church, and his old-fashioned orthodoxy were quite given the cold shoulder. The ancient church, on the fairest Sundays, had no more than a rainy-day congregation. A few of the old-stock families, a judge or so, his bald-headed deacons, and some half a score of the old merchants, and his family-physician, with the remnant of "God's poor", stuck to the old church and their saintly pastor.</p> 
               <p>There was no fund in this town for ministers whose salaries fell short to draw upon. The Great Head of the Church founded no bank to pay parsons. He draws at sight on men's hearts and consciences. These are the vaults in which He keeps His treasures to pay those who preach His Gospel. The Rev. Dr. Willett, therefore, kept no bankbook other than his Bible. The secessions from his parish fearfully diminished his means of support; and he had, like Jacob of old, a family of many sons and daughters. At the beginning of his thirty-second year with his people, the parish-treasurer announced to him, in the following note, the result of the separations to the new doctrines: <q>
                     <p>"VENERABLE AND DEAR SIR:-It is with pain I in form you that the subscription to your salary the current year will barely reach four hundred dollars, instead of the nine hundred which you have hitherto received."</p>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>Let us be present in the reverend man's study when the freckled-faced son of the deacon placed the note in his hands!</p> 
               <p>The abode of the aged man of God was a large, rambling, two-storied mansion, marvelously out of repair, the chimney-tops shattered by winds and storms; the clapboards loose; the whole house leaking in every rain, and growing old and poor like its inhabitant.</p> 
               <p>For twenty-four years he had occupied this dwelling, and no sound of hammer nor saw had been heard about it since he entered; for every ninepence the minister received had to repair the waste and tear of his own, his wife's, and his children's tabernacles, by food and clothing, and little had he left for the decaying house; so the winds and weather, and old Time, had their own will and way about the ancient clapboard-castle. The north gales, laden with snow-sleet, sifted icy particles through the crevices of the doors and loose windows, which looked out upon a desolate old field, badly fenced, and in which the parson's old h use was supposed to be fastened in, when he had, in fact, the range of the town and its grass-grown lanes.</p> 
               <p>Altogether, it was a dreary abode, which had known better days; and although within ten years past his people had met to raise a little money to restore it, nothing beyond the "resolutions to raise" had ever come of their spasmodic liberality. Of course, now that the congregation had been divided and subdivided, and greatly diminished, the idea of spending money on paint and shingles was abandoned for the more absorbing idea of providing meat and bread for their minister and his eight children.</p> 
               <p>At the head of the broad stairs of this faded parsonage, a door opened into a small room. Upon this door was stuck a piece of paper, on which was written, in large text-hand, "Study".</p> 
               <p>It was at this door the little snub-faced boy of the Deacon timidly knocked, after a bright-faced, curly-headed little girl, who had shown him the way up, had left him.</p> 
               <p>"Come in!" said a gentle and manly voice within; and the boy, lifting the latch, entered.</p> 
               <p>The room, small as it was, was rendered more confined by shelves of old books and manuscripts, which filled two sides of it; by a table on the third, and by an arm-chair at the window from which the minister could obtain a pretty view of the town, the river, with its sloops and plying ferry-boats, and of the opposite heights.</p> 
               <p>The reverend old man was seated at his table with a sermon before him, and a goose-quill in his hand, for metallic pens were then unknown. He was about sixty years of age, tall and slender, with the precise exterior of a gentleman of the old school; and no one excelled the venerable Doctor in the elegant courtesies of manner and address which characterize the thoroughly well-bred man.</p> 
               <p>His hair was silvery bright, and fell in their locks about the collar of a faded calico dressing-gown, which had seen many years of scholastic service. He wore an old pair of cloth slippers, and a once black vest and pantaloons, grayish and shining with long use till they looked like bombazine; nor did they disdain patches. But this was his home-suit, for he had a less-worn costume of black to wear to church on Sundays.</p> 
               <p>His noble face wore a calm and finely chastened air of peace and patience. He looked like one of those old apostles who have "learned to be content" with what they have, and how "to endure hardships." There was a dignity and gentleness in his aspect that even had men loved to contemplate, and which attracted children to his side.</p> 
               <p>As the door opened he looked up, and seeing the lad, said, kindly:</p> 
               <p>"Ah, it is you, Andrew-come in! What have you there for me?"</p> 
               <p>"A paper father told me to fetch to you," answered the boy, abashed at the presence of the minister, and dropping his straw hat on the floor, in his timid awe; for in those days the young reverenced both ministers and aged folk more than at the present. No boy of any denomination would think of passing the Rev. Doctor Willett without taking off his hat to him; no little girl without courtesying to him. If a group of children were at play, they would stop until he passed, all bowing, and eyeing him with reverential awe. Indeed, the respect he inspired in the village was universal; and due both to his sacred office and the excellency of his character.</p> 
               <p>"Give it to me, my lad, and go and play with the children until I see what answer I shall send."</p> 
               <p>The boy quickly departed, and the Doctor opened the note and read it, without change of countenance; but the paper trembled a little in his hand, as one has seen the aspen-leaf shake when the branch was motionless, and the wind still. He sighed; and after raising his eyes to Heaven, as if he was familiar with that source of consolation and of hope for suffering humanity, he said: "The will of my Heavenly Father be done. He who fed the prophet by sending the ravens, will not suffer me and my little ones to want." Four hundred dollars! This is very little for so many little claimants. It will hardly pay my bills for the past year at the stores. But God will provide. Poor Mortimer! This will decide the question with him! He will have to leave college. It is with a fearful struggle and the hardest economy he has been kept there the past year! Poor boy! to have his bright hopes crushed by poverty! But I will not murmur-nor will he! He has been raised in the school of privation, and learned early to submit to the sacrifice of his will to his father's narrow means! But I must call my daughter and talk this over with her. She is wise and prudent; and now that her mother has left us for a better world, she has discretion and judgment beyond her years, as if her sainted mother's mantle had fallen upon her. I will see what Charlotte will say."</p> 
               <p>He rang a little bell which stood at hand, and in a few moments appeared in the room a young lady. She was tall and graceful, with a face of singular beauty of expression and loveliness of character. Her eyes were a clear blue, and bright with sensibility and sweetness; and her mouth was the most charming mouth, which even rivaled coral in color or Cupid's bow in symmetry. <choice>
                     <sic>Altogther</sic>
                     <corr>Altogether</corr>
                  </choice> she was a most captivating person, with perhaps nineteen summers' experience of this world and its vicissitudes; and with a poor clergyman's daughter the vicissitudes are by no means few or far between.</p> 
               <p>"How was she dressed?" I hear some fair girl inquire; as dress is everything in a heroine, though we do not promise that this tall, fine-looking girl is to be a heroine in our story.</p> 
               <p>She was attired modestly in a maroon-colored shilling calico, with a red and white sprig in it, and admirably did it fit her graceful figure, revealing her shapely shoulders and molded waist in all the attractive symmetry of their faultless outline. A white apron, which showed service in the kitchen, was tied in front, and her hands were a little sprinkled with flour; for they were too poor to keep a girl, and Charlotte served in the kitchen alternately with two younger sisters, for the whole study of that holy household was to economize, to pay their noble brother's way through college. This young man was the centre about which the hopes of the father and the prideful affections of the three sisters revolved. For him they did all the domestic work, dressed in calico, and spent nothing that could possibly be saved. Who but that Eye which ever beholds the habitations of men saw or knew the secret privations endured cheerfully by that noble family. If the law of the house was economy in all things, for Mortimer to get an education in college, where he had now been two years and a half, before the reception of the Deacon's note, what is it to be now that the certainty of their deep poverty is sealed by it?</p> 
               <p>"Sit down, Arly, my dear," said her father.</p> 
               <p>She perceived a tremor in his voice-saw the note in his fingers, and instinctively felt that he had heard some painful news. Her first thought was of her dear brother, and flying to her father's side, she cried:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, is brother ill?"</p> 
               <p>"No; not ill-not ill-my darling; but it is bad news for him. Read it!" he said, giving her the Deacon's note.</p> 
               <pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6857-00000004"/> 
               <p>When Charlotte had rapidly run it over, she said, with a look of relief:</p> 
               <p>"I was so afraid from your manner, dearest papa, that Mortimer was ill, as we heard last week that sickness was prevailing at the college. But this is only confirmation of what we already knew. Have you received in the last six months more than three hundred dollars, and did not the Deacon say it was hard to get even that, and he feared it would be still more difficult this year. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid, dear father!" she said, dropping the letter upon the floor, and laying her cheek against his. All we must do is to economize more. It will be enough for us."</p> 
               <p>"But there are so many little mouths," he said, with eyes moistened with emotion, for old age seldom weeps. The fountain of tears, the troubles of life are exhausted ere the three score years and ten.</p> 
               <p>"Father," she said, pointing to a little geranium in the window, "see how many leaves that plant has; yet all are as green and fresh as if it bore but one. There are a thousand acorns on yonder tree, yet each receives as much nourishment from the good God as one only would. We are of more value than many leaves, many acorns, many sparrows!"</p> 
               <p>"I am rebuked, my dear child," he said, affectionately embracing the fair girl. "I do not fear that any of my little ones will perish; oh, no! But my son! I think of him. How the news will affect him and his fortune! This makes me thoughtful."</p> 
               <p>Charlotte sighed. She felt all that her father felt. Of herself, like her father, she thought not.</p> 
               <p>"Poor brother! will he have to leave college?" she asked earnestly.</p> 
               <p>"There is no alternative. You know how he has struggled for an education that will enable him to win his way in the world, and be a stay to you all when I am no more. How has he taught school in his vacations in country-districts to eke out his, tuition and board-money! How has he gone without suitable clothing in winter, and without necessary books, borrowing where he could of his fellows, to enable him to get through! Better would it have been for him to have gone into a store, as he wished."</p> 
               <p>"He would have been without power, as a clerk, dear father, to help you and his brothers and sisters for many years. Do not regret that you wished him to have a liberal education, that he might succeed you in the ministry. God orders all things for the best, and especially for good men; and I know no man is so good as my dear father!</p> 
               <p>"No, no, child; don't say so! I know myself, and that I have nothing to show for my goodness before a holy God! Tell me what shall be done."</p> 
               <p>"It is a shame, father, that you are left in your old age to struggle with poverty. It is a reproach to your people that you should be reduced to this strait after you have served them faithfully these thirty years!"</p> 
               <p>"It is because I have grown old, daughter, they leave me, as men desert the old house that has sheltered their youth. They think I am too old to preach-that I am behind the times. They need younger men, so they turn me not off, lest it should grieve me too much; but they say if I remain I must live on what scarcely two people can live upon, and we are ten! But I murmur not. See my old horse in the bleak meadow there. He has served me twelve years, and lo, I turn him out to fare as he can! So will the master."</p> 
               <p>"But old Charlie, father, fares well. There is not a nook of soft grass in town that he does not know the taste of, and he crops all the rich green borders of the sidewalks in the unfrequented streets, and not a boy in town so bad that would throw a stick at him to drive him off. He lives, if he is too stiff-kneed to work for you. But you are able to work. You preach your two sermons a Sabbath (and I am sure you write better and better, dear father, every one of them), and have your Wednesday-evening lecture and your Friday-night prayer-meeting, and your Saturday-lecture preparatory for communion; and you visit the sick and bury the dead, and do all things as faithfully as when younger. It is true, the young people don't marry as they used to in former days; and they take a fancy to the Unitarian or Baptist ministers because they are young and showy, and have them married in Church. Don't mind it, dear father!"</p> 
               <p>"I think not of myself, darling, but of you and Mortimer, and the rest of my lambs," said the aged pastor. "What shall we do about my poor, proud, noble boy? Here is his last letter: let me read it again:</p>

                           <p>"My heart ever turns to home, dearest father, after the night's hard studies are over. I think of you in your study, poring over your theological books and your Bible and commentaries, to learn how best to teach your people! In imagination, too, I see you at secret prayer for strength to go in and out before them with the power and grace of the ancient Baptists. Home is the sun of my heart! Its light comes only from that dear circle. I know how you all struggle with penury-you all, who are refined, intelligent, good, and sensible enough to be a household fit for a king's palace-how you undergo cheerfully, privations, that 'dear Mortimer' may complete his studies and enter upon a profession that will enable him to support an aged father, whom his people fail to sustain in comfort, and lovely sisters and helpless brothers-all yet to be educated-how, I know not-except by the miraculous grace of God! In a year and a half I shall be through college, and then I shall study law, and in two years I hope to be practicing. Cheer up, my dear father! All will yet be well. Although so many of your people have left, affiliating with the new sects which have come into our town, yet those who remain are able to give you a full support; and they ought to come up more strongly to your aid. But if human nature, which always finds excuse to give as little as possible to ministers, prompts them to refuse to increase their subscriptions, I know not how you will get along. Your trustees will meet soon to decide on what you are to receive for the coming year. Do not fail to let me know what they do! I hope they will show themselves men and Christians, and not desert you in your venerable years, when you have worn out your strength in their service-married them, baptised their children and grandchildren, and buried their fathers! If they fail you, let me know. I will at once leave college, and try to help you by teaching; though the pay is but little. At any rate, I will no longer be an expense to you and my sisters; for I have remained there since I learned the decreasing pay you receive, only to oblige you, Sir, and to gratify them. Let me hear from you, dear father, as soon as your income for this year is fully known. I have no confidence in any increase!"</p>

               <p>"Dear, dear brother," said Charlotte, sorrowfully, "the news will shock him!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; he must be written to at once to come home," said the venerable pastor, with a tremulous voice. "He is just twenty-one-two years your senior, Arly-a mere lad. What can he do? If he gets a school, it will give him not twelve dollars a month!"</p> 
               <p>"I will write for him, dear father; when he comes we can then talk it all over together," said the maiden, with a cheerful voice.</p> 
               <p>"It will be with a weary heart I go into my pulpit to-morrow," said the aged minister; "I feel this to be a rebuke-a dishonor to me and my children!"</p> 
               <p>"If the church and deacons wished to get rid of you, why not come out like men and say so?" said Charlotte Willett, with, indignant emotion.</p> 
               <p>"Daughter! my child!" said her father, with gentle reproof in his voice, "this is the spirit of the world, of which thou savorest, and not the spirit of Christ.</p> 
               <p>"Forgive me, dear father; but when Christian people calculate to a figure how little they can give, instead of seeing how much they can give their minister, I burn with shame and indignation for them.</p> 
               <p>She kissed her father-once, twice; smiled until she caused him to smile back again with tenderness, and then left him, saying:</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
               <p>The following evening, a group of young men stood about the Post Office in Brunswick, the handsome village in which Bowdoin College is situated. They had congregated there awaiting the mail, and eager for news from home; for it is the love of home and its dear remembrances that render absences from the fireside of boyhood cheerfully borne by the student in his lonely halls.</p> 
               <p>Among these young men were the sons of the rich, of the widow, and of the poor citizen, all seeking an education-or, at least, the reputation of one-before entering the world, to battle for its places and honors.</p> 
               <p>The distant horn of the stage was at length heard in the still twilight and then the far-off roll of its wheels across the bridge which separated Brunswick from Topsham. In a few minutes, a cloud of dust, which the evening-sun tinged with gold, rose above the trees near the river; and soon the four fleet horses, followed by the laden-down stage, came in sight, dashing up the broad street of the village.</p> 
               <p>"Where are you northern part of the State, boys?" said a student from Portland, who was smoking a cigar, and idly swinging his cane; "for it's only you'll get letters to-night; my turn comes by to-morrow's mail, when I'll get the old gent's remittance of a cool fifty!"</p> 
               <p>"I'll go you halves on it, Dana," said another rather flashy young man, with a Greek book underneath his arm.</p> 
               <p>"Thank you," answered Dana; "I have debts enough about town to swallow it up, as Jonah swallowed the whale-whole! Ah, here's Willett's coming. He gets a letter every mail."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, but little cash in 'em, I fancy," said a foppish young fellow, in a ruffled shirt. "They say he's as poor as a church-mouse."</p> 
               <p>"No poorer scholar for that, Dick," answered another student. "He has helped you out of trouble in many a hard lesson."</p> 
               <p>"Well, he has a right to work hard at his books, for he has to get a living by 'em by-and-by: but I have a fortune coming to me; and if I can only squeeze through college so as to get my diploma, to make a gentleman of me, I shall ask nothing more of old Bowdoin."</p> 
               <p>"They say he has a right handsome sister. But then, what is a pretty face with no other jewels than a pair of turquoise eyes!" remarked a fine-looking youth, who had a gold watch, seal, and three finger-rings.</p> 
               <p>The young man alluded to now approached, in company with one of the tutors. He was plainly if not poorly clad, but his appearance was singularly genteel and graceful. His eyes were dark and piercing; his face, oval and intelligent; his figure, tall, and with a certain noble bearing which would have distinguished him anywhere as superior to his fellows. Yet he moved along in a quiet, unobtrusive way, answering with a pleasant-nay, more than pleasant, a sweet and engaging-smile the salutations of his fellow-students<pb n="8-9 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6857-00000005"/> students. He had just the face which interests the beholder and invites confidence.</p> 
               <p>"You'll get a letter to-night, of course, Willetts?" said Dana; "for you always do."</p> 
               <p>"I hope so," answered Mortimer, smiling with his fine eyes.</p> 
               <p>"So much for having a whole batch of sisters!" said a little fellow near, with a pout. "Nobody writes to me but Aunty, and that's not once a month. I wouldn't give a fig for the stage to come in-not I."</p> 
               <p>The rumbling coach, laden behind with trunks, and five passengers outside, now thundered up to the post-office door, in a cloud of dust. The red-faced driver, in his seven-caped coat, threw the mail upon the doorstep, and, with a loud crack of his long whiplash, dashed toward the tavern, which he reached by a skillful half-circle sweep, greatly to the consternation of the outsiders atop, and to the marvel of all less practiced Jehus and ostlers who admiringly stood at the corner of the inn; for the arrival of a stage-coach in those days was an event quite as important as that of a train of cars in the present.</p> 
               <p>The postmaster, an old man in iron spectacles, and a pen behind his ear, having, in a dignified manner, as became so distinguished an official of the Federal Government, stooped and picked up the tan-colored, chained bag, retired with it mysteriously within his office, for the purpose of emptying and separating its contents.</p> 
               <p>In the meanwhile, the impatient young men stood without, talking and laughing and jesting with one another, each addressing the other by some sobriquet or familiar nickname, instead of his baptismal or proper patronymic.</p> 
               <p>Mortimer Willett, it could be easily seen by the manner in which he was surrounded, and spoken to, was one of the most popular in the group. Although his coat was thread-bare and his whole appearance betraying the closest economy, even the richest-dressed young fellows seemed to pay a sort of deference to his opinion and to court his companionship. A college is an epitome of the great world, and there are all grades of social feeling, from the aristocratic scion of a senatorial sire to the only son of the poor widow, who has to pay his way through college by keeping school during the vacations. The line of demarkation in these institutions between the sons of the rich and of the poor is as positive as in the world itself. It could be only, therefore, by force of talent and a superior mind that the son of a poor clergyman, who had to pay for his tuition by teaching three months in the year, could get to be, as Mortimer was, the most popular young man in college. This was due as much to his noble personal disposition, his manliness of character and kindliness of heart, as to those marked talents which made him a confessed leader in his class, and the ornament of the recitation-halls.</p> 
               <p>"Who do you expect a letter from, Haverhill?" asked Mortimer, of a handsome, carefully dressed young man who had been betting that he himself would be the only one who would get a letter.</p> 
               <p>The young man blushed, and swung his cane carelessly, as if hesitating how to reply, when a tall student, in green goggles, with whitey locks, said, with a laugh:</p> 
               <p>"From his young lady. Don't you know, fellows, he's engaged to be married?"</p> 
               <p>"A Benedick-a Benedick among us!" was the merry outcry of half a dozen voices. "We'll send you to Coventry, Ned, if you are going to dignify the Sophomores by being engaged."</p> 
               <p>"I am not engaged, boys; I only-"</p> 
               <p>"Only correspond!" said the tall young man.</p> 
               <p>Haverhill looked embarrassed, and cast a peculiar, quick, and inquiring look at Mortimer, who, however, was not regarding him, his attention being directed to the post-office window, which, at this moment, was thrown open, and to which the young men rushed with eager expectation for letters from home. Some received the expected treasures, and with smiling faces tore them open, and walked aside to devour their contents. Ah, when a mere letter to the absent one can confer such pleasure, who will, from indolence, or "want of time", or indifference, withhold the happy missive! It is but seldom we can make one another happy; but when it can be done so easily as by a letter, who is so selfish-who so occupied-as not to be able to confer this happiness?</p> 
               <p>Some turned away with the "No" of the postmaster sounding sadly in their ears, and with looks of regret and disappointment, if not of positive unhappiness. These enviously called the former "lucky fellows" and "fortune's favorites". When the non-reception of a letter from "home" gives such sorrow, who at home will voluntary cause it? Nothing but the frequent interchange of letters between those at home and the absent can relieve the sense of loneliness. Next to prayer to God, is conscientious letter-writing to those who are far away. It is a sort of domestic piety-a holy home-religion, to keep the fire of affection alive in the hearts of the absent ones.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, Willett," said the rich and good-looking Haverhill, "you are a favorite of Mercury. You always get letters."</p> 
               <p>Mortimer smiled upon his friend-for friends they were, though one was the son of 
                  <figure> 
                     <head>MORTIMER'S GRATITUDE.</head>

                   a rich merchant, and the other of a poor minister-and joyfully broke open the letter, which the well-known superscription showed him was from his sister.</p> 
               <p>Haverhill also saw the address, and said:</p> 
               <p>"What a graceful hand your sister writes, Mort!" he said, admiringly. I hear she is singularly beautiful; and if one can judge by the hand writing, she must combine all the graces in her person."</p> 
               <p>"To me, dear Ned, she is beautiful!" said Willett, as he and his friend walked slowly toward the college. "You promised to visit my native village in vacation, and you shall then see her; but, as I have told you, we live in a very humble way at home. My father and all know you; for I have often spoken of you as my roommate, classmate, and best friend."</p> 
               <p>"You are very kind, Willett! But I prevent you from reading your letter. Ah! here comes Rutland with an open letter, and beside himself! What dreadful news has he got? Hear how he weeps, as if his heart would break! Let us see what is the matter."</p> 
               <p>As he was speaking, a young man came reeling forward, in one hand a letter sealed with black, his forehead clasped with the other, and the wildest grief visible upon his face.</p> 
               <p>"What, oh, what is it, my dear Rutland?" said Mortimer, who had not yet read a line of his sister's letter. "Let me console you. Do not give way to such terrible grief! Who is dead?"</p> 
               <p>"My mother! my mother! My dear, dear mother!" he cried, leaning his head upon Willett's shoulder, while Haverhill held him sympathizingly by the hand.</p> 
               <p>"Come with us to your room," said Haverhill. "Try and control your grief, my dear fellow! We deeply grieve with you."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, you have our whole sympathy, George!" said Mortimer, his voice betraying the sincerity of his emotion. "We will go with you to your room. Come with us, and we will stay with you until you are more composed."</p> 
               <p>How sweet is sympathy, even when consolations are offered in vain! The young man's violent sobs gave way to silent weeping; and leaning upon the arms of his fellow-students, he walked slowly onward to the college, soothed by their kind words.</p> 
               <p>When at length they reached his room, the young man was calm enough to read, at the request of Haverhill, the letter through. It told him how his mother, who resided in Boston, had been instantly killed by being thrown from her carriage, with which the horses had run away. Fearful news to an only son! The two young men felt that, at such a time, mere words of comfort would be vain, wisely leaving him to his silent grief; for the sorrows of earth must have their full tribute of tears, and nature resists their undue repression. The heart, like the parched earth, needs refreshing from the rains of sorrow; and it is good for men to weep at times. All sunshine would turn the green earth into a desert; and the sun of joy, ever cloudless, will parch that noble earth-the human heart-until it will bear neither the flowers of love nor the fruits of affection. Thrice the Lord of Glory is said in the New Testament to have wept-once for the dead friend whom he loved; and thus has sanctified tears through all time.</p> 
               <p>"I am so very sorry for Ruland!" said Haverhill, as he walked along the corridor toward his room. "I did not know he had such deep feeling. He is always so cold and reserved! But grief opens a man's heart, and tells what is in him. I respect him more for his sorrow. I never liked him much! No bad news in your letter, too?" he suddenly inquired, as he saw his friend's face turn pale; for he had been reading his sister's letter as he walked along the entry.</p> 
               <p>Mortimer made no reply; but, compressing his lips, silently entered his room, and sat down by his desk, with his face resting sadly in his hand. There was no deep emotion-only silent sorrow.</p> 
               <p>Haverhill observed him closely, and again said, with the sympathy of a friend:</p> 
               <p>"No unpleasant tidings, I trust, from home?"</p> 
               <p>Willett seemed to struggle for composure; for the letter had deeply agitated him. Suddenly, he rose to his feet, and paced to and fro his apartment with nervous strides, his face pale, his brow frowning, his mouth firmly set. His countenance wore the expression of mingled indignation and grief.</p> 
               <p>"This shameful avarice that degrades humanity!" he cried. "Not even Christianity can melt the heart of gold that is in man! To make the Gospel the world's beggar; to starve the preachers of eternal life in this life by withholding from them the common necessaries of roof, bread, and raiment; to see how little they can afford to give to the faithful minister of Jesus Christ! Out upon such Christians! But I must not suffer myself to become so roused. But, Haverhill, my indignation is kindled by this gross wrong done my venerable and pious father. For thirty years he has toiled for the souls of his people, and in his old age they desert him, and leave him to-to-what shall I call it?-to die for the want of means to live! Even the Indian's faithful dog, when he can no longer hunt for his master, is fed and nourished for the service he has done. Who should be so<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6857-00000007"/> well cared for as a minister of the Gospel? Yet who suffers from want like him? I am a minister's son, Haverhill, and as such have been raised to the closest economy. From a boy, I have learned the just value of every cent. My father has never had enough. How has my now sainted mother schemed, and planned, and devised with his counsel, and that of the older children, to make one dollar do service for five!-make a month's salary cover three months' wants! Neither myself nor my sister had toys and little luxuries, like those of other families. Bread, clothes, books to study our lessons out of-these absorbed all. Can Christians, without guilt, thus render their pastor's life a continual martyrdom of personal and domestic sacrifices? Many a time have we been without enough on the table for all our mouths! In silent dignity my father bore all-suffering in the world with Him who suffered for the world. How all my angry feelings rise when I reflect what years of privation that noble Christian man has suffered! And now, now!" and he struck his finger upon the letter his sister Charlotte had written him, "now comes the last cruel blow!"</p> 
               <p>"My dear Willett, what is it?" asked his friend, with delicate hesitation in his tone and manner.</p> 
               <p>"That I must leave college, Haverhill?" he said, sinking into a chair. "You are my friend! You ask me what is the news? Hear it in one word. They have cut down my noble gray-haired father's salary to the miserable pittance of four hundred dollars! The ox that treadeth out the corn, after muzzling all his years, they have turned loose to die of hunger! What marvel is it that the laborers are so few in the church, when to enter upon its 'works and labors of love' is to chain one's-self and one's wife and one's little ones to the ever-revolving wheel of penury. Ah, my dear Edward, you who have been raised in the lap of luxury, whose every wish has been gratified, who have never known in boyhood or in youth the want of as much money as you desired for all your whims and desires, who have never thought about 'what you should eat, or what you should drink, or wherewithal you should be clothed', having all things provided by your father's wealth!-ah, how little can you appreciate the pains, the mortifications, the anxieties, the self-degradations of poverty! How little idea have you of the value which I have been taught to regard a quarter of a dollar. How little can you realize a whole family of refinement and respectability sitting down to table without enough to eat, without bread or meat enough to go all round that each may have some; and often the father going without that his children may not be without! [Tears came into the listener's eyes.] How little can you conceive of a Christian family, more or less hungry all the time, while the parishioners have enough and to spare; trying sacredly to keep secret their sufferings from the cold world! How often have I seen my dear little sisters cry for want of enough to eat, and in winter for enough to wear! Conceive what must have been my father's sufferings! Yet he complained not! The salary his people gave him he tried, with God's blessing, to live upon! His threadbare cloak, which he had worn for many winters, now half protected him! But what am I saying to you! Enough, my dear friend! I see you are moved! I was not aware I was talking so openly! I did not mean to arouse your sympathy!"</p> 
               <p>Haverhill advanced toward him, and laying his hand upon his shoulder, said:</p> 
               <p>"I know you did not. Yet you have painfully interested me, dearest Mortimer! I sympathize with you in all your indignant feelings against the cold avarice of a Christian people-if such I may call them-which receives the services of so able and talented a pastor and permits him to suffer. I know you came to college to acquire an education to enable you to help support your family and relieve your father. Before you are fame and opulence, my dear friend; for your brilliant talent will soon place you high in the profession of law which you will enter upon, by-and-by!"</p> 
               <p>"By-and-by! Now. I must act now! I must withdraw from college! I must go into some business that will bring me in months' wages-for my family cannot wait! They need these hands! No, no, Haverhill! All my views of the future terminate in the present need of action! I cannot remain here a year and a half and expend the little means I make in teaching on myself! This crisis demands my presence at home! I must seek work! I am idle here while my father, and sisters, and little ones need me! My mind is made up! I leave college and go home to-morrow!"</p> 
               <p>"No, no, dearest Willett!" cried Haverhill, in a generous outbreak of warmth, "you shall remain here! Listen to me! Nay-say not a word until you hear me!" and he playfully placed his hand upon Mortimer's lips. "You know that I am to be rich-that in a year I shall be one-and-twenty, when I shall command my fortune! I am allowed now one thousand dollars a year. I do not need more than half of it, let me spend money as foolishly as I choose. Stop-don't interrupt me! I know, Willetts, when I have offered to lend you money to help your bills out, you have obstinately refused-"</p> 
                
               <p>"How could I borrow without the prospect of repaying, Haverhill?"</p> 
               <p>"But you are not to refuse now! Let me lend you five hundred dollars for the next two years! Let us chums go halves in purse as we do in rooms!"</p> 
               <p>"Noble Haverhill-generous-hearted friend-I thank you with all my heart!" cried Mortimer, with moistened eyes and tremulous lips; but it is impossible! God bless you for being willing to make such a sacrifice! But-"</p> 
               <p>"Tut-tut! If I can't live on five hundred, when you have lived on less than two hundred, I ought to be made to learn how! Not a word of objection! You shall have the money to add to your venerable father's paltry four hundred, and remain in college and study law, and by-and-by enrich your family by your commanding talents!"</p> 
               <p>Mortimer grasped his friend's hand, and even in his grateful emotion and admiration of his character, pressed it to his lips.</p> 
               <p>"How noble and great your soul is!" he said, feelingly. "But no, my dear Edward! As firmly as I have hitherto declined your kind offers when fortune pinched me full close, do I now decline them! I cannot borrow! I shall lose my self-respect! I "cannot repay you!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes you can-though, if I had my will, I would you should accept the whole as a gift from me! I shall have more than I shall know what to do with, by-and-by!"</p> 
               <p>"Thanks, thanks; my whole heart overflows with gratitude! But, my dear Ned, I cannot place myself under obligations which I can never repay. I will leave to-morrow and visit my father, and seek employment. Perhaps I may find a clerkship in Boston, where, by rigid economy, I can contribute to the comfort of my father and family, and still retain my independence. I have a horror of debt. It is servitude of the soul! Nay, not even to you, my generous Haverhill, can I sacrifice my liberty!"</p> 
               <p>Haverhill smiled at his warmth, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Not for your father's sake?"</p> 
               <p>"I will work for him."</p> 
               <p>"Not for the comfort of your sisters?"</p> 
               <p>"These hands shall minister to their necessities. I feel strong, and equal to the work before me. No, no, Haverhill, do not tempt me with money!"</p> 
               <p>The next day, Mortimer disposed of his few books and furniture; and as he had no debts-a rare thing in a young collegian-he was enabled to leave for home, thirty miles distant, northward, up the valley of the beautiful Kennebec. He took leave of the President, who expressed his profound regret at the circumstances which rendered his retirement from the college necessary, and assured him he should be glad always to hear of his prosperity. Having also bid good-bye to the professors and tutors, and his more intimate college-friends, he lastly grasped, at the gate of the college, that of Haverhill, who had been with him to take leave of the unhappy Rutland, who was to depart the same night for Boston, in obedience to a letter from home.</p> 
               <p>It was well known in college, that Willett was to leave, in order to enter upon business to contribute to his aged father's support, and that of numerous brothers and sisters. But it was no new thing for young men to leave college for want of means to get through. Many a poor but ambitious and intellectual youth, who sought to secure a liberal education by teaching in vacations, had been compelled from ill-health, induced by twofold taxing of the mind and body, to abandon his hopes and studies. And what is this teaching in vacation? It is after a hard session of close study and privation, to buy books and fuel and economizing in course apparel for the noble student of indigence, to walk into the country to hunt up a school, while his more favored fellow-students load the stages, to be driven with the highest speed of four horses to their comfortable homes and the society of loved ones, to spend the two months of recreation. But for the poor student the only change is from the close halls of the college to the close air of a district-roadside school; and at the close of the college-vacation he returns to his studies with perhaps sixty or seventy dollars earned by teaching, to pay his tuition for the next session, and his humble board-bill; happy if he can borrow the necessary books for his studies-happy to make an old coat serve for another winter-happy to make three little sticks of wood answer for seven-happy to keep himself warm in winter by pacing his floor while conning his lessons. Heroes these young men are! Every college in the land has more or less of them. Martyrs of science and learning, cheerfully enduring all things that they may achieve a scholar's education. Some of these even save from their pittance something to send home to a widowed mother, or to purchase little articles of dress for a sister, or books for the younger brother at school. Noble donations of money to college by rich men, in part to support such students without the necessity of so much privations, are termed scholarships. But in this college, when Mortimer was there, were no such noble scholarships-no one or two hundred dollars a year placed at the disposal of the president for the aid of poor and worthy students.</p> 
               <p>Mortimer, as our readers have seen, was one of these poor students. Yet, with all his<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6857-00000008"/> own necessities, he laid aside something every quarter for home. It was not much, but it was something; and when it came, how acceptable it was! It enabled Charlotte to retrim her last winter's bonnet, and to buy an unexpected hat for Charlie, or stout shoes for his romping little sister Isabel; or perhaps a new umbrella for his father, and a pair of fur gloves for winter. Little gifts, but like angels' visits in the joy their presence gave.</p> 
               <p>"Good-bye, dear Edward," he said for the third time, pressing his friend's hand. "You must forgive me for not accepting the fifty-dollar bill you would force upon me. I have sufficient for the wants of home. I shall soon get something to do. Thank God, we are not in debt. My father owes no man anything but love. So there is no struggling to lift out of the mire, only to keep out of it. We are all schooled to self-denial and economy at home; and though we may have to suffer a little with head-winds, we shall weather the rocks. Heaven bless you!"</p> 
               <p>"Heaven bless you!" answered Haverhill. "While I admire your firmness and independence, I must say you are very wrong to let your dear ones at home suffer, just for a notion of personal pride."</p> 
               <p>"It is not pride, Haverhill! But I detain you, for there is the college-bell. My father shall hear of your generosity, and I will teach all at home to love you."</p> 
               <p>They shook hands again and parted.</p> 
               <p>Haverhill followed with his eyes his retiring form, as, with a small bundle and his stick, he walked rapidly away toward the village, and murmured:</p> 
               <p>"There goes a true man, heart and head. What noble qualities! I would rather be Mortimer Willett, with all his privations so bravely and truly borne, than myself with all my wealth. But I will not be disappointed in my desire to do him service."</p> 
               <p>The wealthy young Bostonian then slowly turned away toward the college, leaving Mortimer to pursue his way homeward, not in the stage (for how could he spend a cent where it was not only virtue but filial charity to save), but on foot.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER III.</head> 
               <p>The distance before the young student was nearly thirty miles. It was a bright autumnal morning as he traversed the broad avenue of the village, with his face resolutely turned in the direction of home. At length, he left behind him the snow-white mansions embowered in crimson-leaved foliage and inclosed by pretty gardens, and entered upon the long bridge which connected the college town with the opposite village of Topsham. For a few moments he paused to gaze upon the roaring cascade into which the river was wildly broken up just where the bridge spanned it, and his eyes fell upon a broad and beautiful rainbow arching the tumult of waters. He cheerfully accepted it as a sign of a brighter future before him.</p> 
               <p>After traversing the romantic bridge, he ascended a hill beyond the village, and, looking back, took a farewell of the distant chapel-tower and roofs of the classic halls where he had dwelt as a student for two and a half years. He sighed to think that he must bid adieu to his favorite and ennobling studies, and that his bright prospects of fame and usefulness, at least in this direction, were forever darkened. But his sadness was but momentary in its continuance. He was now a wanderer-from duty and the Providence of God! It was in the performance of the most sacred duties to those nearest and dearest to him in life that he had abandoned his literary pursuits to turn his hands to labor. Duty in itself contains a mighty power! Duty is the noblest exercise of humanity. Angels can perform no more than duty, and to do less were in them sin. With man, duties are holy works. They carry a sense of peace with them, and their reward goes with them. All true happiness, in this world, if not in the next, is embraced in the word "duty". In youth we ask, "How shall I enjoy life?" Later, manhood asks, "How shall I perform my duty?" Old age has achieved life. It asks for neither pleasures nor duties, for it can no longer perform the one nor enjoy the other. It simply asks, with tremulous hands leaning upon its staff, "Let me enter into rest!"</p> 
               <p>Mortimer was young-the season when youth asks, "How shall I enjoy life?" but poverty had bridged the river of pleasure and placed him, ere twenty-one years of age, amid the stern realities of manhood's cares. Duty, not pleasure, was now this young man's future. Life was to be to him henceforward a chain of duties-sacred ones-to his father, to his sister, to his little brother, and in and through these to his God.</p> 
               <p>So he marched along the roadside, trampling beneath his earnest tread the fallen leaves of autumn, like the faded emblems of pleasures of youth dead forever to his young heart; and the great limbs, gnarled and black, divested of their foliage, seemed to stretch over him their iron arms, like destiny.</p> 
               <p>As he walked on he became more cheerful, for he was naturally light-hearted and cheery. The scenery, as he tramped over the great hills, around which the stage-road wound, drew his attention, and he stopped more than once to gaze off upon the broad farms and meadows, and the wide, merry-meeting bay, with its white-sailed sloops and fishing-boats. Some of these vessels were ascending the river before a stiff breeze, and would in a few hours pass within gunshot of his father's door, while it would be many hours before he, on foot, could reach the parsonage.</p> 
               <p>But on he went, without murmuring at the pinched fortunes which would not enable him to take passage either by water or land. Tall, strong, healthy, and with a conscience void of offence toward God or toward man, the student went gayly on, catching the freedom and spirit of nature around him. The song of birds pleased his attentive ear, the sight of the farmers' boys getting in their golden corn, or the young girls gathering apples in the orchards, or of the farm wife in her door spinning, were all in agreeable harmony with his heart. He had a cheery word for the sun-browned sturdy yeomen, who knew him to be a traveling student, perhaps going to get a school; a smile for the maidens who stole sidelong glances at his handsome face, and pleasantly returned the badinage of the cloutish young farmers who asked him "What was Greek for turnips?" or "How he would make a dog talk Latin?" for country-lads will always have their jokes at college-lads.</p> 
               <p>At length he came to a grove of dark pine-trees, just at noon. Near it was a clear brook, by which he sat down to rest himself. There was an inn but a mile before him, and he began to deliberate between hunger and economy. His walk of sixteen miles had made his appetite as sharp as a mower's scythe. He opened his purse and counted over his money, all that he had in the world. It amounted to about twenty-seven dollars and sixty-three cents. He regarded every penny of this little treasure, saved from the sale of his effects, as sacred to the necessities of home.</p> 
               <p>In itself, money has no real value. It is worth just what it cost to obtain it, just what it has the power to do! Without question, this sum in Mortimer's purse was as dear to him as three hundred dollars would be to Haverhill in his purse. One must be poor-must have no more than enough to buy a meal-to understand the true value of a quarter of a dollar.</p> 
               <p>"It is true I am very hungry," he said, "but to dine at the tavern will cost me two shillings. These are too precious to spend on my own wants. I will fast and save them."</p> 
               <p>At this moment, he heard the clear notes of a stagehorn, and knew the mail-coach was coming with its daily load of passengers. He started up and pressed forward, hoping to pass the inn where it was to drive, before it should overtake him. As he gained the hill-top, he saw it rattling down the road on the opposite declivity, swaying from side to side and rolling up a cloud of dust, while, shrill and clear, the horn sounded, echoing through the dale, to notify the hostler at the inn to have the fresh teams ready, and the landlord to bestir himself with his dinner for the passengers. While the coach was slowly ascending the hill, Willett got well on in advance; but it soon drew near at a rapid rate, and he stepped aside to escape the dust as it thundered by and dashed up in front of the tavern. He noticed a handsome, richly-attired young gentleman on the seat with the driver, smoking and talking. Did he envy him his ride? No such feeling crossed his mind.</p> 
               <p>Was it pride or what was the feeling which led him to stop and wait some distance off until all the passengers had got out and gone into the house? Did he shrink from being seen on foot and thus openly confessing his poverty? If so, it was probably very natural. But what more noble motive than that which led him to deprive himself of the ride and of food! If his pride kept him aloof, it was not very censurable. Although we may accept poverty as our lot, and endure it with patience, yet we do not care to let the world know of it; for instinct, if not experience, tells us that the poor are regarded by "the world" with contempt; and that in the eyes of four-fifths of people, a man is valued not by what he has within his head and heart, but what he has in his pocket and bank. Sensitive young men who are poor, keenly feel it. Mortimer was sensitive; and though he made no complaint against Providence, he did not wish to be labeled "a poor young student".</p> 
               <p>So he stood aloof beneath an oak-tree and partly concealed by its huge trunk, until they had entered the inn-all but a stout man in mean attire who began to eat his bread and cheese economically on the doorsteps. Mortimer rapidly walked forward and got by it, as he believed, unseen. But there sat upon the fence by the signpost, an awkward-looking and ungainly lad, or young man, in an old fur cap and coarse canvas trowsers, eating apples. He had been sitting there when the stage drew up, but without stirring or seeming to notice the passengers descending from it. His face was thin and sallow, and a scattering whitish beard covered his lip and chin, which evidently had never known a razor. His light yellow hair was cut close to his head. His hands and feet were enormous in size; and he looked altogether like a rustic young giant, loosely put together, but capable of great strength. His homely, vacant face indicated dullness of intellect, and yet a kindly nature. Swinging his legs against the bars, he eyed our foot-traveler with a curious stare out of his coal-black and half-shut sleepy-looking eyes. Mortimer had barely<pb n="16-17 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6857-00000009"/> noticed him, but recollected having on a former occasion seen the same person around the inn, and heard him called "Idiot Joe".</p> 
               <p>As our hero was entering a wood about a quarter of a mile beyond the town, and thinking as he went what a good thing a nice dinner with the happy passengers would have been, and feeling more hungry and weary at the thought, he heard a heavy step behind him. Looking about, he saw Idiot Joe coming after him, who made signs to him to stop. When he came up, he chuckled and laughed in an extraordinary way, and his whole visage shone with mingled delight and cunning.</p> 
               <p>"Got som'at for poor college-schollard! Joe knows schollards be poor, coz 'ey can't eat bookens. Joe could never eat bookens! Mam' say all students be mighty poor, never have no money. Seed you go by, Joe did! Run'd to the kitchen, and got you this half chicken and bread and napple sarse and this big piece o' punkin pie!"</p> 
               <p>As he spoke, he displayed, in a bit of brown paper, those tempting comestibles to the eyes of the young student.</p> 
               <p>"But, good Joe, hungry and poor as I am," answered Mortimer, smiling, "I can't take this dinner. You are very good and kind; but it isn't yours!"</p> 
               <p>"Isn't mine!" answered the young fellow. "I guess it is. It's mam's and dad's! They keep the tavern. What's theirn is mine, I guess. Gorry!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, to eat yourself, but not for you to carry off and bring here! Your mother cooks to sell to travelers! I thank you, my good fellow, but I can't take it!"</p> 
               <p>The idiot looked at him with wonder and a puzzled expression in his great unintellectual visage, and then said, in his gruff, deep voice:</p> 
               <p>"P'raps you ain't hungry!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes I am, Joe!"</p> 
               <p>"I know'd you was, coz I see'd it in your face, and that's what I got this for; coz I never see'd none o' the schollards what goes by here to hunt after schools but has no money. Mam al'ays has to give 'em dinner. If you'd stopped, she'd give you your'n. She en't pesky stingy, like some boys' mam's I know on."</p> 
               <p>"You must take the dinner back, Joe," said our hero, kindly. "Do you know it is like stealing, for you to take it?"</p> 
               <p>"Then you won't take it?"</p> 
               <p>"No, Joe. It would be wrong!"</p> 
               <p>"Would it be wrong for me to go and eat as much as I want to of mam's dinner?"</p> 
               <p>"No."</p> 
               <p>"Suppos'n I eat this right here now for my dinner! I han't had no dinner yit. Would it be a stealin'?"</p> 
               <p>"No, Joe."</p> 
               <p>"Wall"-and the idiot seemed to reflect a moment, as if his dark mind was struggling for light upon some reasoning process he had started-"wall, suppose this was my own dinner, and I chose to give it to you, would that be stealin'?"</p> 
               <p>"No, Joe, I think not," answered Willett, with a smile.</p> 
               <p>"Wall, then, it is my own dinner! I'll have no dinner but this. Now, if I set down and eat it here, and not go home for no more today, will it be a stealin'?"</p> 
               <p>"No."</p> 
               <p>"Then it is my dinner! But I won't eat it, coz you must! I'll give it all to you; and you shall eat it, coz you are pale and hungry, and I ain't; and if I be, I can make it up, and eat two times as much dinner to-morrow. Now just sit down and eat it on this rock!"</p> 
               <p>"But I can't rob you of dinner," said Mortimer, as he regarded the face of the idiot, which was full of a sort of stupid goodness, with emotion at such a display of kindness in one to whom was denied the higher attributes of reason.</p> 
               <p>"I don't want any dinner. You shall eat!"</p> 
               <p>"I will do, then, as you say, good Joe!"</p> 
               <p>The idiot spread out the carefully brought dainties upon a flat rock, and when he saw his guest commence eating, he clapped his hands and evinced child-like joy. All at once he seemed to recollect something, and with a loud whoop he bounded off in the direction of the inn. Mortimer enjoyed the repast so singularly brought to him; and having discussed the chicken, was about to turn his appetite upon the pumpkin-pie, when Joe re-appeared with a blue quart mug.</p> 
               <p>"Here's some real good buttermilk! I al'ays drink a quart on't for my dinner! I've been and brought it to you; and here's some doughnuts, coz I al'ays ends off with six on em! So here they are. You've got to eat and drink everything I does! I ain't goin' to eat nothin' to-day-honor bright!"</p> 
               <p>"I fear I shall hardly be able to pursue my journey if you compel me to eat your own huge allowance," said Mortimer, amused at his large hospitality and pertinacy. "What I can't eat I'll take with me, if you say so," he added, seeing the idiot's face look gloomy.</p> 
               <p>"That'll do then," he answered, his cheerful looks coming back.</p> 
               <p>Our hero made an excellent dinner-albeit he felt generous misgivings at thus compelling him to fast at his expense. When he had ended, the idiot began diligently to gather up the residue, which he wrapped in the paper and carefully tied it up with a whip of dried grass, and thrust the parcel into Willett's bundle.</p>

               <p>"Now," he ejaculated, "now you'll do! How far've you got to walk!"</p> 
               <p>"About fifteen miles!"</p> 
               <p>"Joe was never so far off. Joe want to go. Joe don't do nothin' nor see nothin' but the old stage, and al'ays them same nine men with different faces on, every day gettin' out and eatin' the same dinner every day. Joe is tired o' seein' 'em. Han't you got a home?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Joe," answered Mortimer, resuming his bundle.</p> 
               <p>"Don't you want a man-coz Joe's a most a man, born twenty years agone-to cut your wood up, and do your chores, and tuk car' yer hoss and keow, n'hoe in yer garden? Joe can do it if Joe be a born natral fool as everybody tells him I is. Joe likes you! Nobody likes Joe! nobody loves Joe! They say, 'Git out, Joe,' 'Hush your mouth, Joe!' 'You fool, Joe!' 'You idiot, Joe!' I hears nothin' but names. Nobody loves Joe but mam, but she's kind o' shamed o' Joe, and keeps him in the kitchen when company comes. There's some more world than's 'bout our tavern, I guess; for whar does the stages come way off from, and whar does it go way off to? and the people as travels, thay come from somewhar and go somewhar! But Sally, the cook-woman, tells me that there an't no more world than I can see from the top o' dad's sign-post. where I see the blue sky come chuck down on the ground way over by Deacon Braden's woods. But I knows everybody I see a-goin' and comin' don't stop in Deacon Braden's woods."</p> 
               <p>"You are right, Joe. The world is a great deal longer than that," answered Mortimer, with a feeling of profound pity for an intellect struggling in its wall of flesh for higher knowledge, like a prisoner in a darkened dungeon who has no light from the world without, save the dim rays that come faintly into his prison-cell through his grated windows.</p> 
               <p>"Let Joe go with you; nobody cares for Joe or will miss him! Joe loves your face. Where you live Joe'll live. Joe's strong-see!"</p> 
               <p>As he spoke he lifted from the earth a huge rock, which Mortimer was sure he himself could not have raised from the ground, and hurled it with gigantic power far from him. "See! Joe can work for you! You can learn Joe from your great scholard books for his wages. Joe know X and Q, with the tail to it; and Joe've most learned to know crooked S when he see it, coz it looks so like a snake. Joe's hungry to know somethin'. Nobody learns Joe nothin'. Joe axes fayther to buy him a speller, and he says 'Get out, Joe, you're a nat'ral. You can't learn nothin'.' Joe don't know what a nat'ral is, but Joe know as how Joe knows there be a God."</p> 
               <p>"Who taught you so much, my poor fellow?"</p> 
               <p>"Wall, nobody. I, Joe, have heard Him talk in the thunder-clouds and seen His eyes shine in the lightnin', and seen Him smile in the sunshine, and seen Him cry in the rain. Nobody told Joe. Nobody tells poor idiot Joe nothin'; but Joe found out the great God by hisself."</p> 
               <p>"Poor fellow! I wish I could take you with me," said Mortimer; "but you must remain at home. I can not take care of you. In fact, I have no home. I have one to seek. Good-bye, Joe! You have done me a Christian kindness. I will not forget you. Here is a ninepence for you. I wish it was more."</p> 
               <p>Mortimer shook his huge hand, and was turning to go, when Joe forced the piece of silver back into his hand, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Joe don't know no use for money. You're a mighty poor young man, Joe knows. Let Joe go with you. Joe'll carry your bundle. He'll fight for you, work for you, and get money for you. How can you work?" he asked, looking with curiosity at his handsome hands, as soft and white as a woman's; for a young student may have fine hands without effeminacy; and Mortimer's hand, as well as his whole person, were the perfection of symmetry. The idiot looked at them and patted them with looks of marvel, hiding one of them completely in his mammoth paw: "You can only read and write booken. Joe can work like a horse and pull like a bullock."</p> 
               <p>"Your parents need your labor. Go home, good Joe. I must now walk on; but I shall never forget how you have given up your dinner to give it to me, and I shall now travel with more ease and vigor. Good-bye, Joe. Heaven bless you and give you hereafter an angel's intellect for your deprivations in this world. If Providence has denied you a brain, he has bestowed on you a great heart."</p> 
               <p>Thus speaking, with another, warm grasp of the hand, and a kind look in his sorrowful face, Mortimer left him standing and looking sadly after him. He thought he saw great tears, such as wounded stags weep, roll down his face. As far as he could discern his tall and awkward height, he beheld him still standing and gazing after him. At length, a bend in the road shut him out from his view; and he went on wondering at the mystery of life, wherein all grades of intellect are moving forward with more or less development, into the eternities where progress will be ceaseless, and where even the poor idiot's intellect, in the course of ages, may come up with that of Newton's, while Newton has<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6857-00000011"/> reached the point where aforetime archangels stood, who are advanced in proportion into infinite heights beyond his ken!</p> 
               <p>"Thus," he said, "all is motion, onward and forever, in the universe of mind; and the march of systems of worlds in the physical creation is but the type of that of the generations of the creatures of God!"</p> 
               <p>Near the close of the afternoon, the stage having long since passed him, Mortimer beheld upon a hill before him the tall spire of a stone church, which he knew rose above the village of Gardiner, that covered the declivity beneath it, facing the Kennebec River. He soon came under the shadow of the sacred, gothic edifice, and rested against one of the buttresses, resting his pack upon the ground. The view before him was strikingly picturesque. At his feet reposed, in the evening-sunlight, the fair village with its foaming waterfalls, and its bright, beautiful river, with its green, villa-adorned banks. For nearly a league the river was visible, winding amid pleasant shores, and bearing upon its bosom the humble coasting-sloop or the more ambitious schooner. Row-boats filled with schoolboys from a "lyceum" near by, flashed across it, the shouts of the venturesome rowers being heard even on the hill where he stood.</p> 
               <p>From the church, it was not four miles to his native village, and he strained his eyes to catch, in the golden haze of evening, the spire of his father's church; but the shoulder of a distant, intervening hill shut out the view, though he could see a group of far-off trees, which he knew could be seen from the window of his study.</p> 
               <p>"Never mind; I shall be home in an hour," he said, with hope illumining his fine features. "Perhaps they are looking for me in the stage, which has already, long since, reached there, and have given me up; but sister Arly will know me so well that she will expect me on foot, for the sweet girl and I have had too many long talks how to save money, or make a little go a great way, for her to suppose that I would spend two dollars for a ride in the stage, when I have health and strength to walk. So she'll look for me until bedtime; and there is another-dear Annie-who will expect me; I know. Arly keeps no secret relating to me from her! She will have told her that I am expected tonight! With all this happiness belonging to me-with love such as Arly's and Annie's, with such prideful affection as my father entertains toward me, with such tender loves as the children feel for "brother Mortie", ought I to be sad or unhappy because I am poor? Love is better than gold-affection of greater price than rubies! Come, my heart, be brave! I am rich in affection! My conscience is clear before God any man of all wrong-doing! I have health and hope-come, Mortimer Willett, en avant!"</p> 
               <p>With these cheery words he resumed his bundle, and was going down the steep hill from the church, when he suddenly came upon the upturned stage, which he had last seen at the inn, twelve miles back. It was lying on the roadside, with the fore-wheel gone, a panel stove, and its axle broken, while a dead horse, with a terrible gash in his breast, lay entangled among the ruins. Several boys stood about it, and one or two men in aprons, looking like workmen, were inspecting the wreck.</p> 
               <p>"What has happened?" he asked, coming quickly near them.</p> 
               <p>"There's one man killed, and four 'most killed," answered eagerly, two of the boys, glad to impart exciting news to a stranger.</p> 
               <p>"Who is killed? how happened it?" he inquired of one of the men.</p> 
               <p>"The leaders got frightened at a kite some boys were flying, which came to the ground directly before them, and turned round short upon the wheelers, which overran them and became unmanageable, when the whole concern came tumbling in a mass together, oversetting the stage, and killing one of the passengers who sat outside with the driver, and hurt pretty badly three others."</p> 
               <p>"Who was killed?"</p> 
               <p>"It was Mr. Hall, the merchant, of Hallowell," answered the man; "and what is strange, he came by the stage all the way from Boston, instead of in the vessel, because it was stormy when the sloop that had his goods sailed; so he feared to come in her, and came by land! But there she is now, Sir," the man added, pointing to a sloop under full sail, not half a mile off, "and he lays dead in the tavern below here?"</p> 
               <p>"There's no gettin' 'round Providence," said the other workman; "a man can't fly from fate. I believe in predestination; and what is to be will be. Afore Mr. Hall was born, it was writ in heaven he was to come to his death by this coach fallin' on him! It wasn't his own will that made him quit the sloop afore it sailed, 'cause he was afeared it might be lost, but the fate that was born in him! A man's death is woven into, welded, as it were, into his very nature and being when he's made, and he'll follow it out and come to it in spite of everything; and when he thinks he's savin his life, he's just doin' nothin' but bringing about the foreordained end on't."</p> 
               <p>"Don't be talking theology now, here, Deacon," said the other man; "but let us see what can be done to this here stage, to set it on its wheels again. The town-officer ought to be here to drag this dead animal away into to the river! It's a 'mazin' ugly sight to look at! It's mighty lucky, Mr. Willett-for I guess you be Parson Willett's son-you was a walkin' instead o' ridin'."</p> 
               <p>Mortimer agreed with him, and felt that his life had probably been saved by his self-sacrifice. But the blacksmith, who was the Deacon, remarked curtly:</p> 
               <p>"It wasn't predestinated for him to be on, or in this coach, or he'd ha' been there!"</p> 
               <p>Having uttered this oracle, the Deacon began to pull and haul at the wreck, while our hero, more satisfied than ever with his economical purpose, resumed his way. At the foot of the hill, the steep street intersected the main or river street, and a few doors from the corner was the stage-tavern. Around it was still quite a crowd of curious people, though the accident had happened two hours before. Mortimer delayed a few moments to try and learn who had been hurt, but as no one seemed to know their names, with sympathy for them and their families, when they should hear the sad tidings, he continued his journey. As he left the village, he crossed a long bridge over the foaming torrent of the Cobbiseecontee stream, and thence entered a pleasant, riverside road, bordered with villas, among which was the mansion of an eminent senator, adorned with columns, piazzas, and a flowering parterre, from the terraces of which a full view could be had of the village and the river with its craft, and the green hills and meadows on the opposite bank; and of all rivers in New England, the Kennebeck presents the most changing bits of scenery.</p> 
               <p>It was now sunset, and the shades of a roseate twilight enveloped land and river; yet it was not obscure enough to conceal the brilliant tints of autumn, with which the maple, beech, and elm trees were enriched. The swelling hills that overhung the water were great masses of gorgeous colors, as if, to use a child's figure, a hundred rainbows had been broken up, and scattered all over them!</p> 
               <p>Now and then he met a person in a chaise, or on horseback who recognized and spoke to him, and from whom he learned that his father was well. The golden light of the skies became brown and then dark with shadow, when the stars came out, here one there another, now by twos and threes, until soon the whole heavens were a "spangled frame", glittering with the splendor which knew them "ere ever the earth was".</p> 
               <p>From an eminence known as "Loudon's Hill", where a few houses constituted a hamlet, he caught sight of the lights in the houses of the town dimly seen by the moonlight, which at this time was rising, but yet low in the east. With the quick eye of love, he singled out the burning candle which shone in the humble parlor of the parsonage, mid-way the hillside on which the village stood. He now quickened his pace. His heart was happy. He was grateful to Heaven that he had not come in the fatal stage! He was full of anticipation of the coming meeting with his father, and sister Arly, and the rest, whom he had not seen for seven months; for his vacations had been too closely occupied by teaching for him to find time or money to visit his loved home. There was also mingled with his bright hopes and with his happiness the fair face of a maiden who had all his heart, and whose own fond heart was his! Sisterly love, filial love, is stronger; but love-l'amour (in its most delicate sense, we will call it, to distinguish it from all other heart-affections)-l'amour is strongest of all loves! Therefore, it will be no reproach to him if he dwelt more tenderly upon the thought of seeing Annie Temple than upon meeting his equally lovely sister Arly.</p> 
               <p>And good cause had our hero to dwell with calm joy upon the recollection of his love for the maiden, as yet unknown to our readers. The only daughter of a merchant in his native village, once wealthy, but reduced by losses at sea and by trade to an economizing respectability, she had no dower but her beauty and rare graces of mind and heart. Dwelling in a neat cottage-residence, to which Mr. Paul Temple had removed (after selling his great house and showy furniture), which was situated a little out of the town, and not very remote from the parsonage. She and Charlotte Willett were great friends; for Mr. Temple attended the Orthodox Church; and visiting and friendship often go by "denominations".</p> 
               <p>It could not be that two sweet young girls should be bosom-friends, and one with a handsome, clever brother, that the handsome, clever brother did not have his share in one-half of the friendship. Thus Mortimer and Annie were lovers before she was fourteen and she seventeen! And what pure and unselfish love it was that they entertained for each other! Pure it was as that of angels, in whose loves we believe that there can be no passion-only a holy and sublime union of souls. As Annie grew from charming fourteen to lovely seventeen, his boldness in her presence became timidity, and his love became a sort of adoration of a mortal divinity. In his eyes, Annie was fairer than all other maidens; had the sweetest smile, the richest brown tresses, the most beautiful hazel ayes, and exquisite figure ever created or known! Her voice was to him the soul of music; her presence was joy; the touch of her small hand in his thrilled him with indescribable happiness.</p> 
               <p>Educated at Madame Remington's then<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6857-00000012"/> celebrated academy, Annie's pure mind was developed, and her tastes cultivated. But her crowning beauty and most glorious attraction was her disposition. She loved all the world (not as she loved Mortimer), and everybody loved her, but not just as Mortimer loved her.</p> 
               <p>When her father failed, and retired to the humbler abode which he now occupied, she met the change in her fortunes and social position with a sweet and becoming humility, that showed how superior she was to most maidens whose parents' reverses bring with them a loss of luxuries, and even of "respectability", so to speak; for a broken-down family is soon sent to Coventry, as they can no longer dress in fashion nor entertain in style; and equality of position in this world demands equality of dress, equipage, and mansion. Money lends the wings by which the worms fly above the ground as butterflies; and when this fails, the butterflies creep again upon the earth, whence they rose; but on the ground, or, with gilded wings sporting in the sunshine of Fashion, they are equally worms!</p> 
               <p>When Mortimer went to college, to try and acquire an education, to enable him by a profession to aid his brothers and sisters when his aged father should enter into his rest, he kept up a correspondence with Annie, though they were not engaged. It was the most natural thing in the world that they should correspond, for Charlotte showed her all his letters, and wrote to him all about Annie, and gave her tender, blushing messages to him, word for word; and so, at length, said the good-natured sister, both to Annie by word of mouth, and to Mortimer with her pen: "I don't see why you can't send your own messages to each other, and not take up so much of my letters and time." And so Mortimer's first letter was timidly answered; but, by-and-by, their correspondence grew, until they lived, as it were, by writing to each other.</p> 
               <p>In that day, letters were very costly affairs, with twenty-five cents postage. To Mortimer, a quarter of a dollar was a very valuable coin: and though for it he could get one of Annie's precious letters, he was not able, with so little to wear and eat at home, to pay this price. But love is never at a loss. There was a small river-sloop, which once a week run on the river, between Bath and his native village. Now, Bath was but seven miles distant east from Brunswick, where he was at college. Now, as Cupid would have it, on this sloop was a little cabin-boy, the only son of his poor, widowed mother, who was bed-ridden, and whom the kind Arly almost daily visited. It was at Arly's notable suggestion that this little river-lad should do the service of the god Mercurius, and carry letters to and fro, up and down the river.</p> 
               <p>In this way, their correspondence was enabled to be frequent and economical; for the grateful boy, thankful for Miss Willett's care of his mother, did the duty of letter-carrier without charge. Whether he was breaking the laws of the land, he did not inquire; nor did young Mortimer imagine that he was infringing natural rights or robbing the Government. Questions of State dignity seldom trouble lovers.</p> 
               <p>Sometimes, Nix, the boy, would watch the opportunity, and served the letters to the college by some person going to the college; but many a night has Mortimer walked, at the usual time of the ship's arrival, to Bath for his letters, left another for little Nix to take to Annie, and perhaps one to his sister, and be back again before day-fourteen miles in all! and yet be as fresh and correct at his recitations as if he had been till the mid-night-hour poring over his books by the pale night-lamp".</p> 
               <p>We now return to him, as he descends with a light heart, yet somewhat tired step, the dark-wooded hill which leads down to the entrance of the village. A romantic, clear, gurgling stream, called the "Cascade Brook", flowed across the road, and shaded by several tall, graceful elm-trees. There were two bridges crossing this, one on the main road into the River street, and the other a mere foot-bridge, higher up, and out of the stage-road. Where this side-path led off from the road, he saw several persons, who seeing him advance toward the style, and one of them called to him:</p> 
               <p>"Are you just from Gardiner, Sir?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, he replied, advancing, so that the moonlight fell on him.</p> 
               <p>"Is it you, Mr. Willett?" said several.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, it is I, my friends," he replied. "What is the matter?"</p> 
               <p>"What about the stage upsetting, and four persons killed there? Do you know anything about it?"</p> 
               <p>"I passed the stage in ruins, and a horse dead under it; but only one man was killed."</p> 
               <p>"Was it Mr. Hall?" inquired they, eagerly.</p> 
               <p>"Yes."</p> 
               <p>"And the others?"</p> 
               <p>"Were only wounded badly."</p> 
               <p>"We heard four were killed outright. A dreadful accident as it is. It is fortunate Mr. Hall has no family to mourn him! How did it happen?"</p> 
               <p>Mortimer explained, and leaving the men discussing the accident, and wondering who those were that were hurt, he was about to go on, when a man on horseback come galloping along, and thundered across the bridge. He was hailed by the group; but in reply, without stopping, called out certain names indistinctly, saying that another stage was coming with the rest of the passengers and two of the hurt.</p> 
               <p>"One of the names he mentioned sounded to me like Dutton," said one of the men.</p> 
               <p>"No, it was Sutton," said another.</p> 
               <p>Mortimer did not delay to hear their discussion, but hurried across the foot-bridge, and entered a narrow path which led up the side of the brawling brook. Passing round an old mill well known to him, he began rapidly to climb the steep path along the overhanging rocks. In a few minutes, he was making his way beneath the dark shadows of pines that grew near the brook, which fell in roaring cascades of white foam and steely water adown the descent close by at his left hand. Every step of the path was familiar to him. He had traversed it a thousand times from boyhood, both by day and night, but oftener by moonlight, since he had learned the sweet lesson that lovers talk most affectionately by moonlight, and love most fondly by the side of whispering waters.</p> 
               <p>This wild scene in the bosom of which he found himself has not its equal in all that makes up the romantic in a confined space in New England. So near the village that the murmur of the cascades as they leap from rock to rock to seek the river at its base, can be heard on still Sunday-afternoons in church! Yet so wild and picturesque and in a loneliness complete that the wilderness has no place more retired. It is the favorite trysting-place of lovers, the frequent walk of the young, and the coveted haunt of the sentimental and of the poet. "Vaughan's Cascade" has given inspiration to song-writers, and been the scene of half the engagements of the matrons of the town when they were maidens.</p> 
               <p>After a climb of seventy feet up the roughest part of the glen, Mortimer reached a more level space, and a graveled path which wound round by the waters where for a few yards they ran deep, and stilly, and black as night in the shadows of the larch and fir-trees. Through the openings in the trees the moonbeams fell in masses of splendor, while all else was darkness. Another cascade was ascended, and another winding path was followed, until he came to a broad carpet of verdure, around which huge moss-covered rocks lay in picturesque confusion, presenting a hall of nature where Queen Mab might have given a moonlit festival to her fairy court.</p> 
               <p>This spot was dear to Mortimer, for it was full of recollections of Annie. On that velvet green rock they had sat by the hour talking of the heaven of lovers, wherever that may be, in what star or in the bright moon! On that projecting mass they had stood looking down upon the falling waters, his strong arm holding her lest she should be giddy; for in the estimation of lovers, maidens are very delicate and helpless beings-something between a fairy and a moonbeam-sublime angels that a breath will destroy. They must be assisted where there is no roughness, guarded where there is no danger, guided by the hand where there is no possibility of stumbling, and watched, and tended, and looked after as if they were made of glass and would break, or of roses and would wilt. And the angelic creatures smile and wink at this their imaginary helplessness-the little hoydens who can out-run, out-jump, out-hollo, out-ride, out-mischief the best of their beaux! But then it is so pleasant to be waited on and almost worshiped as feminine divinities. Many a chasm had Mortimer assisted the unresisting Annie over, which, when she was alone, she had bounded across like a deer. Yet Mortimer hardly believed she could, without assistance, get over two rails of a fence, when she could climb, as all other girls of sixteen can, a six-barred gate, better than lubberly boys, and with grace too.</p> 
               <p>"Sweet, dear Annie!" he murmured. "How this romantic spot recalls you! Will fortune ever bless us, that we may by-and-by be one?"</p> 
               <p>He walked on a few steps and stood on a shelf which had a stone seat and an arching tree above it-a sort of rude bower close to the waterfall which he had arranged, and which he called "Annie's Bower"-though many a pair of lovers had told there the sweet story of their young hearts.</p> 
               <p>But time was failing. He felt that he ought not to delay there, restoring in fond memory Annie to his side; and he was about to <unclear>enter</unclear> the side path which led forth to the street on which the parsonage stood, not five hundred yards off, when he heard a merry laugh. It was that of Annie! He could not be mistaken! It came from the upper cascade. He bounded forward, and turning round a high rock, he beheld three persons standing in the full moonlight. A glance revealed his father, Arly, and Annie! They were evidently admiring the glancing of the waters through the dark gorge of rocks beneath them. He was not surprised to see them there. It was not only a favorite walk of his sister, but of his father, who was not so old that he could no longer enjoy the loveliness of Nature. Many of his sermons he had studied there amid the mingled voices of the living waters, the whispers of foliage, and the songs of birds. Mortimer heard his name spoken by his sister. He stopped and listened.</p> 
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6857-00000013"/> 
               <p>"He will certainly come to-night, dear Annie, for he would not delay after my letter longer than two days. I said he must come to-night. My wishes are laws to him! You may think, Annie, that he obeys you-but me sooner! I don't mean you shall a greater influence over him than I have. You may laugh, but, dear Annie, I am quite in earnest!"</p> 
               <p>"I see my presence is necessary to prevent a quarrel," exclaimed Mortimer, with joy trembling in the tones of his voice.</p> 
               <p>"Brother!"</p> 
               <p>"My son!"</p> 
               <p>"Mortimer!"</p> 
               <p>These three ejaculations were almost simultaneously uttered, Annie's voice coming out a little behind.</p> 
               <p>The next moment the venerable man of God held to his hand and heart his long-absent son. Arly embraced and kissed him, and expressed her joy; while Annie stood aloof, trembling all over in the happiness, not knowing what to say or do-only waiting for him to see what he would do. The fair girl, whose superb beauty looked glorious in the moonbeams, had not long to wait.</p> 
               <p>"Are you not going to speak to Annie?" asked Arly, with playfulness, as her brother released her. "Why, Annie, you look as if you had never seen him! Shall I introduce you both again?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh no, Arly," answered Mortimer, as he took the maiden's hand, and held it between his own, all trembling like a young robin which he had caught. "Annie and I ought to know one another without such formality."</p> 
               <p>With these words he pressed more closely the little fluttering hand folded in his. The moonlight was bright enough to reveal the rich carnation of Annie's cheeks to Arly's eyes, and she whispered in her ears:</p> 
               <p>"Now you are so happy, dear Annie!"</p> 
               <p>A brilliant smile was the only response which she made, for she dared not trust her lips, and repeat:</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I am so happy!"</p> 
               <p>As for Mortimer, he did not attempt to conceal his happiness. His fine eyes drank in, almost, to intoxication, the beauty of her face-the enhanced beauty which had been increasing since he last saw her with the days and months of youth and health. Annie also looked lovelier than ever. With them, Time had been a painter in colors and form; but with the venerable Doctor, Time had been a sculptor-carving deep and strong into the aged face the sharp lines of age and wisdom. Mortimer could not but feel that if his sister and Annie had grown more beautiful during the seven months since he had seen them, his father had grown much older. As the old minister stood regarding pridefully his son (whose improved appearance all noticed and admired), his long silver locks floating upon his shoulders, his noble countenance revealed in all its patriarchal majesty, and in the holy beauty of age, Mortimer thought of Abraham, of the venerable prophet Samuel, of aged Simeon, of St. John in his old age, of Wickliffe, of all the reverend historic and sacred personages whose names have illustrated the past. He gazed upon him with reverential feelings.</p> 
               <p>"My dear father," he said, releasing the warm hand of Annie with a parting pressure that told her, more eloquently than a whole volume, that his heart was still all her own, and as true as her hopes in him; "my dear father, I am so happy to find you well and strong. It is a glad surprise for me to meet you so unexpectedly here! I am so pleased to see that you enjoy moonlight-walks to the cascade as in former times! It is a surprise to find you all here. I was on my way home by this way.'"</p> 
               <p>"We came for a walk, brother," said Arly. "The moon shone so deliciously. Father said it was too fair an evening to stay within doors. I told him it was probable we might meet you; for this is not the first time you came home from college this cross-way. I knew," she added in an undertone, "you would not come in the stage."</p> 
               <p>"How did you leave President Allen, my son," asked his father, "and Professor Cleveland, and all my old friends in the classic shades?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, dear father; and they sent their kindest regards."</p> 
               <p>"I thank them; I thank them all!"</p> 
               <p>"Have you heard any news about to-day's stage?" asked Mortimer.</p> 
               <p>"No," answered Arly. "What is it?"</p> 
               <p>"It is sad news! There was an accident in descending the hill at Gardiner, and the stage was overturned. One passenger, Mr. Hall, was killed, and four others hurt; but their names I could not learn."</p> 
               <p>When the startled surprise with which they received the intelligence had subsided into expressions of sympathy and regret, they walked slowly homeward. Mortimer would have offered his father his support.</p> 
               <p>"No, my dear boy; I am yet young enough to go alone," he answered, with that sort of self-reliant pride which belongs to failing old age.</p> 
               <p>"Walk with Annie, brother, and I will walk with 'pa," said the noble girl Arly, in an undertone. "I know that you have a good deal to say to her! and I will let you walk as slowly as you choose; only do not be too long coming home."</p> 
                
               <p>The brother pressed her hand with grateful appreciation of her thoughtful kindness; and while his sister took lightly her father's arm, he offered his to Annie, with his heart full of joy.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> 
               <p>The lovers walked with a loitering step, in silence. Fainter and fainter became the receding forms of the father and daughter.</p> 
               <p>"Annie!" in the softest and tenderest manner.</p> 
               <p>"Mortimer!" like a gentle echo of his voice, deep down in her heart.</p> 
               <p>Both were afraid to trust their voices. He sought her small warm hand, and nestled it in his, and for a few moments not a word more was spoken. Their steps grew shorter and slower, until scarcely they moved forward, lingering in dear delay to make most of the sweet time. The tall form of the minister no longer was visible, nor the graceful figure of Arly by his side, who was longer seen of the two, for the light robes she wore.</p> 
               <p>The path had left the dark wood behind, and the lovers were moving, if it could be called moving at all, along the way which skirted the meadow that separated the cascade and its romantic dells from the village, which, with its spires, its shining river, and gleaning roots, was visible close at hand. At length they stopped in the mid-path hidden from the street by a few low shrubs and gazed into each other's eyes. Bright did the moonbeams light up their eyes, and soften, while it increased, the depth of their expression. Rarely did the gracious light of the moon shine on a fairer pair. Mortimer, a head taller than she, handsome as Adonis, and manly in his form and bearing; she, graceful as Niobe and beautifully less in person, leaning with a sort of holy trust upon his strong arm. With pride and joy he gazed down into her sweet eyes in which heaven seemed reflected with its glorious stars; and she with touching confidence returned his glance and looked up to him as if he was all-in-all to her in the world.</p> 
               <p>O love, beautiful love! earnest of eternal joy and happiness! What so pure on earth as the tender flame which burns on the twin altars of two young hearts. Love without passion-love which adores and thinks only of loving is like the love of the blessed.</p> 
               <p>Hand in hand, heart throbbing against heart, form entwined with form, they stood in silent, exquisite delight.</p> 
               <p>"Dearest Annie!" sighed Mortimer, his face all radiant with the glory of his noble affection. "It is long since we have met; but I have never ceased to think of you."</p> 
               <p>"Nor I of you, Mortimer," she answered in a low voice, dropping her eyelids. "I am so happy you have come."</p> 
               <p>"I am so happy to fold you to my heart once more, dearest. How much you are improved! I thought you could never be more beautiful when I last saw you."</p> 
               <p>"It is the flattering moonlight, dear Mortimer," she said, with a smile.</p> 
               <p>"No-have I not gazed on you by moon-light ere this?"</p> 
               <p>"And you have become taller and more noble-looking, Mortimer. How proud Annie must be of you."</p> 
               <p>"She is a good and kind dear girl, Annie. I hope she will one day find a clever fellow to love and be loved by."</p> 
               <p>"Wouldn't you be jealous if Arly had a lover?"</p> 
               <p>"Not if I liked him and knew him to be suited to her. She has qualities to render the best young man in the world perfectly happy. But we are quite alone. Shall we sit here upon the stile or cross it and go after our party?"</p> 
               <p>"Just as you choose, dear Mortimer."</p> 
               <p>"Then I choose to linger here awhile beneath this elm, which sifts the moonbeams upon the sward like flakes of gold fallen upon it. In this quiet spot, where more than once we have sat, let us enjoy, in sweet conversation, the happy moments vouchsafed to us. I have something, dearest Annie, I wish to say."</p> 
               <p>He was silent, and she stole a glance into his face, and saw that it was agitated.</p> 
               <p>"I will listen," she answered, with a sweet tremor in her musical voice; and her face seemed to reflect the emotion of his own.</p> 
               <p>"I have long loved you, dearest Annie! This you know. I love you still, and more fondly than ever. Separation has only deepened my regard for you. When I last saw you, it was with a great struggle that I refrained from offering myself to you. Nay, do not tremble. Are you displeased?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh no, dear Mortimer!"</p> 
               <p>"But then I was a poor student. Long years were before me ere I could hope to obtain a competence by a profession. I therefore restrained my heart's impulses. I returned to college, leaving you fancy free. I loved and honored you too much-thought too much of your happiness to bind you to me perhaps for many years of waiting, when your beauty and graces would at any time win you a husband-"</p> 
               <p>"Mortimer-"</p> 
               <p>"Do not reproach me, or be displeased. I wished to leave you free because I loved you. But now there's a different future before me. Instead of nearly two years to be in college, and three more spent in studying law and pulpit, as many more before, I can maintain<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6857-00000014"/> even myself. I am free to choose my own field. My father's reduced circumstances has rendered it necessary I should leave college, and go at once into some business. I can command, as a bookkeeper or clerk, perhaps, one thousand dollars a year in Boston. Perhaps in three or four years I may be enabled to support a-shall I utter the dear and sacred word?-a wife."</p> 
               <p>He paused and looked earnestly into her face. There was nothing in its sweet, agitated expression, and mantling blood, to alarm him lest he had gone too far. Her fingers slightly pressed his, and the waves of her young bosom rose and swelled with a quicker motion-that was all; so he went on and said.</p> 
               <p>"I am poor, as you know, dear Annie; but as a merchant I shall be rich; and sooner, in this direction of my labor, than in a profession Therefore, I have made up my mind to ask you if you will betroth yourself to me now, and wait for me three years."</p> 
               <p>"My answer is just as you wish to word it, dear Mortimer!" she answered, with the thrill of vibrations of joy in her tones. "You know I love you. I can love none other forever! For your sake, I will wait not only years, but for life! For your sake, if you are never able to marry me on earth, I will wait and hope for a reunion in heaven! You have all my heart and soul that it is lawful to give to a mortal! That of love which is in my heart that is not yours is God's!"</p> 
               <p>"Sweet, dear Annie, I knew that you loved me, or I could not have felt for you the deep affection I do. The truth in you has been responded to by the truth in me. We are one because we can never be two, loving as we do. Heaven bless you for your love for me, when all I can give you is my heart, and when young men of fortune are ready to offer you their hands."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, hands only, Mortimer! But what are hands and untold gold in them without a heart?"</p> 
               <p>Mortimer silently folded her closely in his arms, and pressed a pure kiss upon her forehead. For a moment, they remained in silent happiness. Angels passing in the air on their errands of love might have paused to bless with smiles their sacred love.</p> 
               <p>"My plan is this," he resumed. "To go to Boston, and seek a position. It is necessary for my dear father's support in his neglected old age. I feel fortune will smile upon me; and by-and-by we shall be united. I know it is selfish in me to bind you, dear Annie, to me for four years."</p> 
               <p>"Jacob served fourteen for Rachel. I will wait as long," she answered, playfully.</p> 
               <p>"Then we understand each other?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh yes. Your thoughts are my thoughts; your plans mine; your hopes and fears are mine, dear Mortimer! From this moment let us be one."</p> 
               <p>"We will be! Fortunate am I that you are not an heiress, Annie, as you once were; for then I should have no hopes, poor as I am. Your ambitious father would look higher for you than the poor clergyman's son."</p> 
               <p>"For your sake, Mortimer, I wish I were an heiress; for then I could enrich you, and be a blessing to your venerable father with my means."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, if you were rich, I should never fold you to my heart as my wife!" he answered. "Is it not because we have nothing but each other that we love so tenderly and devotedly?"</p> 
               <p>"Yet, for your sake, I wish I were rich!" she murmured, smiling.</p> 
               <p>"You are rich in beauty, virtue, gentleness, and every grace of the person and mind."</p> 
               <p>"Now, you flatter me, Mortimer; and true love can never give or receive flattering."</p> 
               <p>"Extremes meet! True love is full of flattery. Its every speech is a compliment, a praise, a flattery. The whole of lovers' conversation is on both sides made up of mutual flatteries."</p> 
               <p>"I believe you are half in the right, Mortimer. Hush! There is the nine-o'clock bell. I must be at home."</p> 
               <p>"Malisons on the English King who established the Curlew in his dominions. At the Curfew bell every honest person was to cover fire, put out candles and go to bed! Here, in New England, this custom of a thousand years prevails, and at the nine o'clock bell every body must start and say: 'It is time to be at home.' It breaks up the pleasant dance, the evening-gathering of old-folks, terminates the lovers' stroll and stops their whispered tale of love! Out upon the curlew which makes nine o'clock the ending of every social evening! But I suppose we must obey it, Annie; for in this grave and pious town it is as much as a young man's character or a fair maid's fame are worth to be seen out after nine o'clock!"</p> 
               <p>Thus laughingly expressing his views upon the tyranny of the New England curlew (in the Southern States unknown), Mortimer rose, and assisting Annie over the style carefully, as if she were eight years old and had the rheumatism at that, they gained the village-street and took the direction toward her home.</p> 
               <p>At the trellissed alcove over the door they parted, a kiss sealing their just-formed engagement, when, as he was leaving the steps to depart, a voice called from the window, "Is that you, Annie?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, dear father!"</p> 
                
               <p>"Who came with you?" asked a female voice.</p> 
               <p>"Mortimer Willett, mamma!" was the embarrassed reply.</p> 
               <p>"Willett?" repeated the paternal voice! "Has he come home? Ask him in? Perhaps he can tell me the news."</p> 
               <p>Mortimer, though desirous of being at home, turned back, and was met in the door by a stout, fleshy lady, who shook him heartily and cordially by the hand, and only released him to let her husband, Mr. Paul Temple, the broken merchant give him an equally warm welcome.</p> 
               <p>"Come in-come in, Mortimer," said the lady. "We heard you were expected! How you have grown-and bless me! how handsome! An, Annie, when your father wondered why you stayed, I told him, says I, 'Why can't you guess, husband? Mortimer Willett has come from college, and mark me if he doesn't walk home with her.' You see I was right! I am always right, Mr. Temple!"</p> 
               <p>"Always, my dear!"</p> 
               <p>"You know if you had followed my advice you would never have failed! I told you how it would be-and you see my words came true!"</p> 
               <p>Mr. Temple had no doubt that should they not have come true, that she would rather he had lost his property. There is great comfort in saying, "I told you so," to husbands who have thought themselves wiser than their good wives!</p> 
               <p>"What is this about the stage, Mortimer? Did you come in it? I hear a rumor that it was upset and somebody killed?" asked the merchant-a thin, spare, dark-complexioned man, with gray full whiskers. "If you came to-night, perhaps you know!"</p> 
               <p>Mortimer made known the facts; and while Mrs. Temple was expressing her joy that he was not in it wondering, at his escape, (not reflecting that we are all every day escaping from a thousand unknown dangers to life) he was trying to make up his mind to let the parents know of his engagement, as became an honorable young man. At length, the courage to do so was attained; for it is not difficult to do right, though it is very difficult to command the courage to do wrong-we mean in the young, before wrong-doing becomes a habit.</p> 
               <p>"You know, Mr, Temple," he said, with a sort of husky baritone produced by a choking sensation in the throat, a disease common to lovers asking for daughters, "that Annie and I have long been very great friends-"</p> 
               <p>There was a pause. To fill it, he desperately went on: "I may say, not only friends, but lovers!"</p> 
               <p>"Oh yes; everybody knows that," said Mrs. Temple, with a wink at her husband.</p> 
               <p>"But it is my duty to inform you-"</p> 
               <p>Here Annie rose, all confusion and beautiful blushes, and rustled out of the room. She had not anticipated anything like such a denouement. It was a business-view of heart-affairs that had never occured to her unsophisticated mind. "Love in a cottage" is an imaginary heaven to the young affiancees who have no dowers and poor young men for lovers. And it would be, if there were no need of bread and meat three times a day, fire-wood in winter, and summer raiment, with prospective little mouths to feed, and little chubby limbs to cover! Love can not feed on honeyed words, smiles, and kisses, and aromas, however fragrant. If our fair readers have nothing in prospect but "love in a cottage", we advise them to leave Love to live in a cottage by himself, and stay at home, where they can get paternal bread and butter. A three-story brick front, with basement, where one has a comfortable home, is far better than a cottage in the woods, with only "Love" to go to market.</p> 
               <p>"Well, Mortimer, what is it your duty to inform us of?" inquired the mother, half guessing at the truth, as soon as she saw Annie leave the room; for women are very quick to read women.</p> 
               <p>"That Annie and I are engaged to be married as soon as I can get into business. I know it is rather premature, but I love her so. I could never give her up; and she has promised to wait for me until I can maintain her! I hope this step has your approbation, Mr. Temple. I am a poor young man, but I hope to prove worthy of her!"</p> 
               <p>"So was I a poor young man, Mortimer, when I engaged myself to her mother. I had to make my own way. I do not object to you because you are poor. As my father said to me, when I left home to go as a clerk, 'Poverty is one of the best tests of what is in a young man. It shows his power to triumph over difficulties. A young man who is disheartened because he has nothing, is not fit to have anything!' Such was my father's views; and when I was hardest pressed by poverty, my courage and pluck rose in proportion. It saved me, Sir. It was the making of me; while money has ruined hundreds of young men to whom it was left. I am sure, if I had been a rich youth, I should have been good for nothing. But you see that I acquired a fortune, and I should have had it now but for endorsing for treacherous friends, and investing in funds that proved totally worthless from the dishonesty of parties. It is not good for an old man to be poor," he added, with a smile, "but it is for a young man! If you are poor, thank God, and take courage<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6857-00000015"/> age! You have a chance of making something of yourself. If you had plenty of money, you might be good for nothing. You have a good education, health, and courage, and these will give you power and ability to be what you please! I have nothing to give Annie. If you will take her as she is, she is yours!"</p> 
               <p>Mortimer rose and grasped Mr. Temple's hand with grateful warmth, while his wife left the room, and brought in Annie, all blushing and happy. Mr. Temple placed her hand in that of the proud young student, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Take her and make her happy, Mortimer. We will keep her for you until you are able to come and take her away."</p> 
               <p>"And that time I trust is not far off," was his reply, as he smiled with joy upon his affianced bride.</p> 
               <p>"If you are to be happy because you yet have nothing, Mortimer," said Mrs. Temple, laughing, "she ought to be so because she has nothing; for I know we always expected she would be an heiress, and many say rich."</p> 
               <p>"That's past, wife-that's past. Women can never know when not to put in words that have no business to be spoken. If I were still rich, I don't know what I should say to a poor young man, even Mortimer, who came to ask me for Annie; but, as it is, they are well mated, if he will take her as she is!"</p> 
               <p>"And I am happy Annie is not rich!" answered Mortimer, to show her and you that I take her for her own worth. I am sorry, Sir, you have lost your wealth, but I esteem it a great blessing that Annie is not an heiress; if she had been, I should have feared to ask her hand. That we are both dowerless, is our greatest happiness!"</p> 
               <p>"It would-have been just the same, Mortimer," answered Annie, with a brilliant smile. "It would have made me happy, then, to endow you with all I possessed!"</p> 
               <p>This subject, dear reader, had all been discussed more than once in the domestic council, involving the probable engagement of Annie to Mortimer Willett. Lovers of money, as both Mr. and Mrs. Temple were, and as all people are who achieve their own wealth, and ambitious as they once had been that Annie should make a splendid match; now that they had "come down in the world", and were cut off, as it were, from rich society and from the visits of wealthy young men, they had made up their minds that even Annie's beauty would not lead eligible matches to propose. It was, therefore, with a sort of reluctant satisfaction that they watched the attachment between the clergyman's talented and handsome son and their penniless daughter. Their penetration led them to see that Mortimer Willett would be likely to become a prosperous man, and take a high position in society, in whatever profession he should choose. They therefore smiled favorably upon the engagement, and felt indeed that it was a fortunate thing that such a young man, whose respectability and social position was unquestioned, should wish to take Annie to wife, "considering", as Mrs. Temple remembered, without due consideration of her husband's feelings, "that she is a bankrupt's daughter!"</p> 
               <p>This indiscreet remark was made by Mrs. Temple, not twenty minutes before Mortimer and Annie came into the house, the parents (who had heard of his expected arrival from Charlotte) being then talking over the probable event of Mortimer's offering himself 'this time'. The observation drew from Mr. Temple the testy reply:</p> 
               <p>"You are the most indiscreet and unfeeling wife ever man had! Always using words that make my ears tingle. Why will you not be more sparing to my feelings? I know I am bankrupt; but I would as lief have my head broke as have it applied to me in this thoughtless way. I know I am broken-"</p> 
               <p>"I didn't mean, Mr. Temple, to hurt your feelings; but how can one help calling things by their right names?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I dare say. Suppose I should call your brother, Wylie Dutton, a close, heartless, miserly wretch, as he is! How would you like it? Yet he is all this! And if he had shown the least spark of brotherly kindness and humanity, I could have saved half, if not all, my fortune. You may thank him that I am a bankrupt, Madam!"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Temple could have made a much better reply; but she was not one of the sort of wives who keep up a quarrel to the "bitter end". She knew that the least said, the sooner peace would follow. Besides, she knew very well that what her husband said was very nearly deserved by her rich bachelor-brother, who, in the extremity of her husband's troubles, might have relieved him. But he refused his aid to her eloquent letters. His reply to her was:</p> 
               <p>"Let him take care of himself, as I have always done. I never asked any man's aid. I've always got along by myself. 'Every man for himself', is my motto!"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Temple, therefore, made no reply to stir up anger which soft words or discreet silence could extinguish. She felt for her husband's misfortunes, and didn't wonder they made him testy and sometimes cross, as she expressed it to Arly when she overheard, by chance, any high words. But, on the whole, Mr. Paul Temple, proud as he was by nature, and proud and ambitious as he had been with reference to the future of his young daughter, bore his reverses with composure and fortitude. He felt more for the loss of fortune to Annie than he did for himself; but he felt glad that, poor as she was, she had the prospect of marrying a young man, who might one day make her rich.</p> 
               <p>It was at the close of this little domestic scene that Mortimer came to the door with Annie. The interesting interview that followed we have recorded where the father placed the hand of his daughter in Mortimer's.</p> 
               <p>Our lover, now perfectly happy, was about to take his leave, when the front-gate was suddenly opened, and a step heard advancing rapidly to the door, upon which a violent knock was given, as if the messenger, whoever he was, was the bearer of some message of importance. It was such a knock as doctors are sometimes roused up with at midnight, when called out to aid in the increase of the figures of the village census-takers.</p> 
               <p>"What can that be?" cried Mrs. Temple, startled.</p> 
               <p>"Who can come knocking that way at this time of night?" ejaculated Mr. Temple, going to the door, out or which Mortimer was ready to take his departure. Mr. Temple held a light in his hand, and beheld a black man whom he knew to be hired in the stable where the stages put up; for there were in that town, far from Southern lands, but three colored people; and these were regarded by the children and bad little boys generally as belonging to a race which had a great love for the flesh of little urchins. In fact, they were the scarecrows and bugbears with which all incompetently administrative mothers frightened their ill-disposed offspring.</p> 
               <p>"Well, Cuffee, what is it?" demanded Mr. Temple, with a frown of displeasure.</p> 
               <p>"Here bit o' writin', Mars'r. Guess you read him. Him tell you," answered the Congo, who was one of the blackest and thickest-lipped of his race, showing his ivories, with a hideous grin.</p> 
               <p>"Read it, Mortimer," said the merchant; "for I have left my spectacles in the room your eyes are younger than mine."</p> 
               <p>Mortimer took from him the soiled piece of paper, and, holding it to the light, read aloud, with difficulty; for it was written in pencil, and the caligraphy was not that of Dolbear:</p>

               <p>"I am sorry for the stranger," said her husband, who was at heart a kind man; "but I cannot conceive who it can be. Smithley doesn't give his name. Cuffee!"</p> 
               <p>"Me here, Marsr!" answered the black, with startling promptness.</p>

               <p>"I must go down and see."</p> 
               <p>"No, Mr. Temple. No, you musn't!" said the good wife. "You have had your rheumatic pains all day; and it will be the death of you! Don't you see the fog is rising from the river; and it is now ten o'clock. Besides, we don't want no poor relations. I don't know 'em! And if they are poor, gracious knows we haven't any place for 'em to nuss 'em."</p> 
               <p>"I can give up my room, mother, and sleep in the wardrobe-closet," said Annie. "We don't know who it is."</p> 
               <p>"If it was brother Wylie himself, though he's no poor man, Mr. Temple shan't stir out of the house this night. It he's sick, then everything is turned topsy-turvy. I'd rather be sick seven times over than have you sick once, Mr. Temple."</p> 
               <p>"I'll go down to the tavern, and learn who the wounded man is," said Mortimer.</p> 
               <p>"Do! That is a good young man!" said Mrs. Temple. "I have no idea who can be related to me that is traveling this way. But it shall not be said that I have refused to see a relation because he is poor. Go and bring me word; and, if necessary, I'll come down to-morrow."</p> 
               <p>Mortimer then took his leave, followed by the negro, leaving Mr. Temple and his wife wondering who it could be lying hurt at the hotel that claimed relationship with them.</p>

               <p>On his way, Mortimer had to pass by the parsonage-gate. He could not continue on, as he was not only anxious to see all his brothers and sisters, but he saw them seated on the steps in the moonlight, waiting for him-from his silver-haired father to Isabel, the youngest little girl of nine years.</p> 
               <p>If he had intended to have gone past, it would have been impossible, as they all saw him, for the white railing in front was low; and running down the short walk, the<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6857-00000016"/> younger ones captured him, with some reproaches for his delay, mingled with caresses and exclamations of delight.</p> 
               <p>When he had kissed over and over again every one of them, and Arly too, who softly chided him for staying so long with Annie, he made known his errand to the tavern.</p> 
               <p>"A relation of the Temples," said his father; "I wonder if it can be any of the Duttons? Mr. Temple has no connections living."</p> 
               <p>"He is a poor man, father! He did not even send to Mr. Temple, but the tavern-keeper sent the word."</p> 
               <p>"I must go with you, my son," said the venerable pastor. "Isabel, bring 'pa's hat and cloak, for the night will be chilly when I come back."</p> 
               <p>Arly would have dissuaded her father; but she knew that all his life he was the visitor of the sick and the friend of the suffering; and that he considered even a more sacred duty than his pulpit-services, that of visiting the sick. Many were the suffering who could say: "I was sick and he visited me, in prison and he came unto me naked and he clothed me, hungry and thirsting and he fed me and gave me drink!" For, although without due means himself to bestow alms and aid on those who needed, he (who would ask nothing for his own needs) never shrank from going to those of his parish who had to give to supply the wants of God's poor and afflicted ones.</p> 
               <p>So he put on his cloak, and took his stick, and walked with his son toward the village-inn. But before Mortimer left the gate, he had whispered into the ear of his sister the brief story of his engagement that night with Annie.</p> 
               <p>"I suspected it would come to that, brother," she said, archly, "and so I managed to give you the opportunity. I am so happy to hear it! We shall now feel like sisters!"</p> 
               <p>The father and son walked down the second street, passing on one side pleasant residences, embosomed in foliage, while the other side was open to the view, which shone in the clear light of the moon like a narrow lane of silver, bounded on the east by dark, shadowy cliffs. The street was silent, for the hour was midway between ten and eleven. At length they passed the venerable church or "meeting-house", where the Sabbath-duties of Dr. Willett were performed. Erected upon a brick basement, one story in height, with three arched doors, which led into a basement vestibule; it towered far above all other structures of the village-its gilded globe, high in the air, reflecting the moonbeams like another planet in the skies. There was an air of solitary grandeur about the ancient church not unlike that of its minister. They had both grown old together. Forty years before, this dignified House or Prayer stood alone in the town, as "the only place where men ought to worship": and hither came all churchgoers, of whatever rank or shade of faith; but, as we have said, when other modern preachers, in staff white cravats, and glossy boots, and hair perfumed, came to town from Boston, or in straight. Quaker-like color, broad-brim and snuff-colored, sanctified coats, the like sought like, and the affinities drew together; and those at heart Unitarians, who had worshiped orthodoxly, no sooner found that they could worship in their own way, than they <choice>
                     <sic>substracted</sic>
                     <corr>subtracted</corr>
                  </choice> themselves from Dr. Willett's congregation; and also, so did the Baptists and Methodists; and but few remained to stand by the old church and its aged pastor, hence his poverty. We do not wholly censure the "remnant that remained" for not giving a full support to him; but there were among them seven families that could easily have made him comfortable. But then they would have had to increase their subscription; and men would rather subscribe to seven new subscriptions than increase an old one. Such is human nature in its unjust contrarieties and inconsistencies.</p> 
               <p>We who wrote this tale, the scenes, and characters, and places of which are drawn accurately from life, remember in our juvenile days the aspect of the church in the days of its highest favor. The minister, Doctor Willett, tall and stately in his goblet-shaped pulpit, which was ascended by winding and very graceful stairs, we recall as vividly as it he were before us-his dignified air, his silver hair, his apostolic aspect, the grace and manliness of his appearance as he preached the Gospel of God to his congregation of devout and reverent listeners. We remember that he wore a black silk gown and band, like the divines of the Church of England, until his gown wore out, and the good old-maids in his parish who annually made and presented him with his bands either died out or went over to the Unitarians, the minister of which sect preached in a fashionable cravat and broadcloth coat of the latest Boston fashion; for Boston, in those days, dear reader, was the New York or London of the present.</p> 
               <p>There was in the days we speak of a great showing of aristocracy. We had not been so long, then, severed from the customs of England as to be purely democratic. Great deference was paid to rank, and money, and position-very great. We recollect that one of the front pews of the old meeting-house was occupied by the minister's family of blooming daughters and handsome boys; but the one opposite to it held a family of Episcopalians. When we were boys, we regarded this denomination as a sort of idol-worshipers. We recollect distinctly, as one Sunday we entered the meeting-house, our minister, Doctor Willett, being sick, seeing within the altar a short man, with a long white robe on, and a black scarf hanging to his feet. We were startled. Such an apparition we had never, in our rustic simplicity, beheld before. Our amazement, as a boy, was increased when we heard him begin from a book a service wholly unknown in our parts; and when I saw him pray from the book kneeling down, my amazement was at its culmination. I recollect that nobody knelt-all standing puritan fashion-save the family in the front pew. This family was the baronial house of our village, if I may so express it. It was an English family of wealth and refinement, which, years before, had purchased a large estate in the vicinity of the village, and built a neat suburban villa, and dwelt there in dignified and opulent seclusion. They kept their own carriage, which was a marvel, as no other family did it in the country. The head of this exclusive family was a short, John-Quincy-Adams-looking old gentleman, with a benevolent face and a gold-headed cane, a broad-brimmed white hat and olive-colored surtout. His wife was an old lady of gracious aspect and widespread charities. There were two or three sons and daughters advanced in age. This family, tradition had it, once lived in England in great state, that the old gentleman had been a Member of Parliament; but, for voting against the Revolutionary War, he had lost his seat, and, gathering his wealth, had come to reside in the new Republic of the West from principle.</p> 
               <p>To know this family, to be on terms of visitation with them, to receive an invitation to one of the annual Christmas-parties they gave, was the crowning ambition of all the families of this and the surrounding towns. To visit at and to be visited by the Vaughans was, in the estimation of wives and daughters, aristocracy-the very cream of it. Those who did not visit at the Vaughans were nobodies.</p> 
               <p>This family troubled themselves but little about the ambitions of the people. They lived in great seclusion, and merely extended their courtesies in order not to be wholly withdrawn from all social intercourse; for in our village were some families of refinement and distinction, though they kept not their carriage. They were the "upper ten" of their day-judges, well-to-do merchants, large practicing lawyers' families. These all visited at the English house; and to visit at this house was "high caste", and not to visit them was to be nobody.</p> 
               <p>A book of heraldry had been consulted by the good people to ascertain who these English people were, when they first quietly came among them, and built their neat country-seat on a promontory overlooking the village and river, and received Boston company, and even great travelers; such as Talleyrand, in his exile; Louis Phillipe, even; Dr. Dwight, the tourist; and a great English duke, who was going from Canada to Boston to embark for England! There was therefore, a dignified mystery to the townsfolk about this family; so, when one of the merchants who bought goods in Boston brought home with him a copy of "Kearsley's Peerage", you may be sure it went the rounds of the village; and especially was commented upon this passage: "Sir John Honeywood had issue-married in 1766, Lord Charles Henry Somerset, second son of Henry, fifth Duke of Beaufort, and had issue Wilham, Viscount Courtney, and Lucy, born June 1770. Lucy married the Hon. Mr. Vaughan, second son of Wilmot, fourth Viscount and first Earl of Lisburne; and Harriet, who married Lord George Thynne, son of the Marquis of Bath."</p> 
               <p>The English strangers' pedigree was, therefore, well jeweled with earls' and dukes' coronets, and half the town was crazy to be on the list of visitors to this illustrious family. It was, perhaps, Mrs. Temple's greatest affliction, in the loss of her property, that she could not keep in the first set, and visit the Vaughans. But the latter, consisting of a venerable gentleman of the old school, in powdered hair and knee-buckles, and his wife, a lovely old lady, and two sons and daughters, heeded little social and monetary distinctions. They were kind, charitable, and social; and old Lady Vaughan, as she was called, made it a point to visit often the humble abode of the ruined merchant: but Mrs. Temple chose to feel that it was from compassion, and felt that there was no honor in the distinction. Where the poor were, the English carriage oftener stopped than at the doors of the "upper ten"; and every call for aid from the wanderer or sufferer found in the hearts of the English family a prompt and kind response.</p> 
               <p>This family were of the Church of England. It was an occasional Episcopal Minister who came down from Boston to see them that held service in our Orthodox Church, by courtesy of Dr. Willett. The family held on to the last, Episcopalians as they were, making no efforts to establish a church of their own; and it was mainly their purse which gave Dr. Willett his four hundred dollars!</p> 
               <p>But our story leads us past the old meeting-house, and, after a square, down a lane that entered the front street. A few minutes' longer walk brought the old minister and<pb n="32-33 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6857-00000017"/> Mortimer to the tavern-a three-story edifice of wood. The negro led the way into the entry, and up the low staircase, into a small parlor where a single candle burned.</p> 
               <p>Here the landlord met them with a low bow to the reverend pastor, and an air of respect for "his cloth" wholly ignored in the present day.</p> 
               <p>"A sad accident, Sir! very sad, Sir!" said mine host, his hand on his heart. "One killed and three hurt, and one of them in a bad way. Very unlucky, Sir? People will be afraid to go in the stage for a month to come-take the sloops, Sir-and a great falling off to our custom! Very bad, Sir!"</p> 
               <p>"Is the gentleman very badly injured?" asked Dr. Willett, in a sympathizing tone.</p> 
               <p>"I fear it will go hard with him! He groans fearful. When I was afraid he was going to die, I asked him if he knew anybody here, and he said 'Yes, the Temples; they are related to me!' so I asked him again if I should send for them; but he was too much suffering to answer, and I took the liberty to send to him! Is he coming?"</p> 
               <p>"I came in his place, Mr. Smithley," answered Mortimer.</p> 
               <p>"And I have come to see if I can do the poor man any good as a spiritual friend," said Dr. Willett.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Sir; I knew you would not be long away if you heard anybody was suffering. Many is the stranger that has come to my house sick that has blessed your Reverence, when he left."</p> 
               <p>"I will go up and see him," said the Doctor.</p> 
               <p>"Does he seem to be a genteel person?" asked Mortimer; "or a laboring man?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, it is hard to say! He is dressed very coarse, but he has a gold ring on; and his hands, my wife says, don't look as if they had ever done much work."</p> 
               <p>"That is no evidence of gentility," remarked Doctor Willett; "for he may have been an idle poor man."</p> 
               <p>"True, true Sir! He has no money!"</p> 
               <p>"Then you have searched his pockets?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Sir, to save myself-I wished to see if he could pay if I kept him here."</p> 
               <p>"And you found he could not! This is rather a questionable mode of ascertaining, methinks," answered the clergyman with a look of grave rebuke, before which the landlord's small silver-colored eyes fell, as he led the way to the room where the stranger lay.</p> 
               <p>"It would have been better for him and the others to have been kept in Gardiner instead of being brought up here," continued mine host, as he went through the entry; "for the four miles' ride was rough for them; but this man said he must come on; and the other two were as anxious, as all said this place was their destination; but as I said, it was too severe a ride for them, though there were cots in the spring-wagon. One of them, a young man, had to be left, he suffered so, at the road-side house of the widow Honeywood down by the Hook; and the other, who was a Collector from Boston, is in this house. He has only one arm broken, and plenty of money, and has my best room. You must excuse the humble apartment I am bringing you to, but as he is a poor man, with a patched coat and old boots and without any baggage, I couldn't afford to lodge him better."</p> 
               <p>The talkative landlord stopped at a low door in an old part of the tavern, and opening it, entered and said:</p> 
               <p>"Here's the minister come to see you, Mister."</p> 
               <p>There was but a tallow dip burning on the stand, and dimly it lighted up the mean room.</p> 
               <p>Doctor Willett could see by it a large, heavy man lying upon a rude straw bed! an old hat and coarse clothing upon a broken chair by it. The man opened his eyes and turned them toward those who entered with a heavy look; for he had received a blow which in part paralyzed the brain. He regarded Doctor Willett a moment, and, as if recognizing his sacred office, he sighed heavily, as if the presence of a man of God forecast a shadow that spoke of death and eternity. The face was not that of a common man; the Doctor's knowledge of men at once saw it was intelligent and marked with character and thought. He wore full whiskers, a long beard (an unusual appendage in that day), and these and his hair were sprinkled with gray. Mortimer closely scrutinized him, and thought he could detect a sufficient likeness to Mr. Temple to verify his claim to the relationship; though the landlord's note had not stated on which side he was connected with the Temples.</p> 
               <p>"My dear friend," said the clergyman, sitting by his bed and taking his hand, with tenderness and sympathy; "I am sorry to see you lying here suffering! I hope the physicians speak favorably of your condition."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, Sir," answered the stranger, in a deep tone, and in a voice and accent of an educated man; "I fear I am seriously hurt. My arm is not only broken, but my ribs, and I have received a severe internal injury. It was from a full conviction that my hurts are likely to be fatal that I insisted on being brought to this town!"</p> 
               <p>"I trust, Sir, you are not so seriously hurt as you imagine. Doctor Page is very skillful, and you shall not want for care! you have relations here?"</p> 
               <p>The man hesitated, and then answered: 
                  <figure> 
                     <head>THE ERRAND OF MERCY.</head> 
                  </figure>
                  <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6857-00000018"/>
                   "Yes, I have some relationship with Mrs. Temple. But it is of no moment to speak of it-unless-" here he paused, "unless I should be likely to die."</p> 
               <p>"The landlord has already sent word to them that you were related to them," said Mortimer; "and I have come at their request to ask you your name, and to know what can be done!"</p> 
               <p>"This was wholly gratuitous, Sir," said the stranger, with a look of anger at Boniface.</p> 
               <p>"But I didn't know but they would aid you, as you seem a poor man," answered the host, in apology.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, yes! I dare say you were afraid I would be a burden to you. But I am no doubt in a Christian community, where, poor as I am, I shall not suffer if left to the tender mercies of an avaricious landlord."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Sir, that be assured of," answered Doctor Willett. "Our people are ever alive to the claims of those who need."</p> 
               <p>"You see, Sir," said Mr. Smithley, aside to Mortimer, "that I have not been too cautious; for he has acknowledged he is poor; and I guess Mr. Temple don't want him on his hands! I hope your father will try and raise a subscription for him, if I have to keep him on my hands."</p> 
               <p>"My dear Sir, do not distress yourself," answered Mortimer, with feelings of sufficient contempt. "You shall not go unpaid, if I can help it."</p> 
               <p>He then said to the wounded man:</p> 
               <p>"If I may take the liberty to ask your name, I should like to inform Mr. Temple from whom I came," said Mortimer, who had recognized the man in mean attire he had seen eating his lunch at the inn.</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Temple is a poor man, if I mistake not?" he asked, after a paroxysm of suffering which he bore with a great effort to appear insensible to it.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," answered the clergyman. "He has only a bare competence; but a worthy man-excellent people; and they will be glad to do what they can.'</p> 
               <p>"I don't know, I don't know. But you can, young man," he continued, addressing Mortimer, "tell Mrs. Temple that her brother, Richard Dutton, is lying wounded at this inn, and may be many weeks under the doctor's hands, and that he would be glad if she could give him a room in her house."</p> 
               <p>The clergyman and his son exchanged glances, as much as to say: "How can they do it with such narrow room and so straitened as they are?" But Mortimer said he would deliver the message in the morning to them; that he intended that night to stay with him.</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, young man, thank you! This is a great kindness-I did not expect it."</p> 
               <p>"My father has always taught me to look after the sick and especially strangers; and as you may not have the means to spare, Sir, to hire any one, I will cheerfully stay with you."</p> 
               <p>"Heaven bless you!" answered the man, who, though evidently by nature stern and cold, it not rough-hearted and soured, seemed deeply moved by this unexpected attention.</p> 
               <p>Doctor Willett then conversed a few minutes with the wounded man, and prayed by his bedside that God would bless the means used for his cure, and raise him up to health.</p> 
               <p>The clergyman then took his leave, and by the light of the moon returned to his home, leaving Mortimer, tired as he was with his twenty-eight miles' walk, to sit up by the bedside of the stranger.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head> 
               <p>"Richard Dutton!" repeated Mrs. Temple, rising from the breakfast-table the next morning, in her surprise at the announcement of this name, when it was made known by Mortimer as he entered the room. "I haven't seen him for twenty years! He at the tavern! He send for Mr. Temple!"</p> 
               <p>"Hush, wife!" said her husband. "Do not betray yourself into any indiscretion. It is, no doubt, your brother, the poor schoolmaster. If so, we must do what we can for him."</p> 
               <p>"Not I! not I! Didn't he run away from home, and disgrace us all by marrying a poor seamstress, and has always lived from hand to mouth, nobody knows how or where?"</p> 
               <p>"I have never heard anything worse of Richard, wife, but that he was a very poor man with a large family of children."</p> 
               <p>"What was he doing to come down here from Boston, in the stage at that, as if he was as rich as his brother; and now to be lying at the inn without a penny in his pocket!"</p> 
               <p>"So much the more need of our aid," said Annie Temple, benevolently.</p> 
               <p>"Don't speak, child! You don't know anything about it. Richard Dutton was always a shiftless man. He never knew how to earn money or keep it. Your father has never been up to Boston, when years ago he used to buy goods there, that he didn't meet Richard almost in rags, and have to lend him money. I haven't seen him since I was married, and I don't care now to own him. He isn't like a brother to me; and to be claiming kith and kin with us! I dare say he expects us to take him here and pay all his expenses!"</p> 
               <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6857-00000019"/> 
               <p>"That is what he humbly asked," said Mortimer, looking with surprise and indignation at the unnatural sister. "He looks like a respectable man, and uses good language."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Dick can do that! He had no lack of education-and he has been for years a sort of hedgeschool-keeper. What shall be done, Mr. Temple?"</p> 
               <p>"I do not know! He is your brother! I am willing to help him all I can. We have no spare room."</p> 
               <p>"I will give up mine, dear father! I can sleep in the wardrobe-closet," said Annie, with generous tones and feeling that won for her a glance of admiration and love from her lover's eyes, that quite rendered harmless the severe look her mother gave her.</p> 
               <p>"You will do no such thing! I cannot have him upon me here! There is not the least room! He might be here months!"</p> 
               <p>"I can plan for you, I think," said Mortimer. "The parsonage is a large old mansion, you know, though illy furnished. We can let him have one of the rooms that we don't use; and I am sure my father and Arly will consent."</p> 
               <p>"Well, if you choose to put yourself out, I have nothing to say. I have no room for him," answered Mrs. Temple.</p> 
               <p>Mortimer, full of this new project, soon took his leave; for he had felt for the injured man; and he was not only an uncle (though a sort of tabooed one) of his dear Annie's, but one always has a kindly feeling for those whom one has done kindnesses to; as Mortimer had done to this stranger in sitting up with him, dressing his wounds, and administering to his wants.</p> 
               <p>"What on earth, Mr. Temple, can have brought brother Dick down here a hundred and fifty miles from Boston?" cried the troubled and mortified lady (for Mrs. Temple still had left a great deal of her old pride as the once rich merchant's wife) to her husband. "And then to be upset and nearly killed, and be thrown upon us or the charity of the town, which is quite as bad."</p> 
               <p>"We must make the best of it, wife," he answered. "We can do no more than we can. Providence has placed him here, and-"</p> 
               <p>"Pshaw! Providence had nothing to do with it. It was that unlucky upset!"</p> 
               <p>"Mamma, who is Uncle Richard? I have not heard you speak of him," asked Annie. "I know all about Uncle Wylie, though I never saw him; but know he lives in great style near Boston, and is very rich, and a bachelor, and has love for nobody nor nothing but his money; and that when dear father was in trouble, he returned all his letters, after the first, unopened. I recollect how you always loved to talk of your brother Wylie, but I had almost forgotten I had another uncle."</p> 
               <p>"Poor relations, child are not very faithfully remembered," said Mr. Temple, in a slightly ironical tone; for though he was a great admirer of wealth in others, he did not wholly approve of his wife's bitterness in the case of her poor brother, in his present affliction. If he had had means and room, he would not have hesitated to have brought him to his house; if not from benevolence, from that species of family pride which would prompt him to save one so nearly related to his wife from "falling upon the town" for aid.</p> 
               <p>"Don't uncle him, Annie! I have kept him off with a cold shoulder ever since I was married. I never wanted you to know anything about his girls and boys."</p> 
               <p>"Then I have cousins!" she cried, gladly.</p> 
               <p>"Don't make me angry! Yes-girls, I dare say, as old as you are, and boys, too-but I don't want to speak about them. I dare say they are' prentices, or sewing-girls. And for him to come here, and call himself my brother! Poor as Job's turkey."</p> 
               <p>"You show too much warmth, Mrs. Temple. You forget how poor we are," said her husband.</p> 
               <p>"Whose fault is it? If you had taken my advice, and not indorsed for-"</p> 
               <p>The rest of the sentence fell not on the ears of the retiring husband, who soon placed a closed door between himself and his wife's tongue.</p> 
               <p>Mortimer, on leaving the house of Mr. Temple, and returning to the parsonage, thought he saw some one watching him from behind a clump of rose bushes near the gate. He looked closely, and caught sight of the figure of a man, partly concealed. He quickly approached, and suddenly "Idiot Joe" stood before him!</p> 
               <p>"Don't scold, Joe!" he ejaculated; "don't get mad coz Joe come here-Joe did'nt go home! Joe crept along after you, Mr. Student-Joe live with you forever!"</p> 
               <p>Mortimer at first regarded him with amazement, and then said, with a frown:</p> 
               <p>"Why did you come after me? How long have you been here?"</p> 
               <p>"Joe came last night! Joe saw you come by the water-brook with a fine lady! Joe follow him an' sleep in the barn last night. Joe had no breakfast, but Joe love student, and never ill go way! Joe'll beg, cut wood, hoe, run, walk, do everything he can for student, let Joe stay here!"</p> 
               <p>The idiot's clasped hands and pleading, deprecating looks, were irresistible. With a smile, Mortimer said, touched with grateful emotions for the exhibition of attachment:</p> 
                
               <p>"Well, you shall stay with me to day. But you must go home to-morrow."</p> 
               <p>"I've got no home! This Joe's home!" he added, rolling his great eyes over the house and place-"live here-eat here-sleep here!"</p> 
               <p>"Come into the kitchen, then." And Mortimer resolved to send him back by the first opportunity, for he regarded him, though he was a man of years, in the light of a runaway boy. "We are not so overburdened with food as your father's house, but you shall have what there is! You fed me yesterday with your own dinner, and it would be a bad return if I would not even give you my breakfast, if need were."</p> 
               <p>All the children stood in the door of the kitchen, timidly watching the gigantic idiot eat. Arly saw, with economic consternation, a day's allowance of bread for the whole family devoured by his huge mouth.</p> 
               <p>"The monster will create a famine here, brother," she said, laughingly.</p> 
               <p>"I'm afraid so. But I shall send him home by the stage to-morrow, if I can get the driver to let him ride. It is an odd fancy he has taken to follow me."</p> 
               <p>He thought you were a wandering knight, and came to be Sancho with you," she said, laughingly. "But he seems as harmless and good-natured as a great house-dog."</p> 
               <p>"And, I dare say, as faithful," answered Mortimer; "but, sister, I have a proposition to make to you. It seems that Mrs. Temple has no room for her poor brother. He has no room to stay at the inn; and no one to nurse him there. We have the large lumber-room, and a bed in it. Can you have it cleaned out and made tidy and fix it up for him? If so, I will have him brought here today; and will do what we can to get him well again. As to food, he will not require much, and very little money will get his medicines, which, indeed, I have no doubt, good Dr. Page will supply gratuitously, as he told him this morning he should charge him nothing at all for his services, as he was a poor man. Shall I bring him, Arly?"</p> 
               <p>"Without asking me, you might have done it, brother, you know that my greatest happiness, as it is my father's and yours, to be able to do good to our fellow-creatures in want. If it were Mrs. Temple's rich brother. she used to talk so much about, it would be a very different thing. His money would purchase him every comfort and attendance; but those who have no money must look to those who have-at least, mercy if not money. I will have the room ready by the time you come."</p> 
               <p>"Where is father?"</p> 
               <p>"He has gone down to see a young man who was left last night at poor widow Honeywood's. He went early this morning, and has not yet been back to breakfast."</p> 
               <p>"Does he know who the young man is?"</p> 
               <p>"Not that I know of-but here is dear father now."</p> 
               <p>The hale old gentleman, in his knee-breeches, broad coat, and wide-brimmed hat, all the worse for service, at this moment came in. Though advancing toward seventy, the fine old orthodox clergyman stepped with a firm tread, and was erect as a youth. His fine face was florid with exercise, and beautiful with philanthropy. Deeds of kindness shone in its lineaments. He was the personification of a venerable parish-minister who had grown gray with wisdom and the exercise of Christian virtues.</p> 
               <p>Yet his people said he was too old to preach to them: too old-fashioned were his sermons; and that he was in his dotage, and they must get a young man! On the contrary, he was like old wine-the better for age. In his wisdom and experience and tried piety his people could have trusted, if they would, as under the shadow of wings. "White hairs," saith the Book of Wisdom, "are a crown of glory when found in the ways of godliness." And never shone on king or prince a brighter crown than good old Doctor Willett's silvery hairs. "Good old Doctor Willett" we have called him; for this was the title which the love and affectionate gratitude of the humble and poor in his parish gave him. And not only was he good; but he was learned in Greek, and Latin, and the Hebrew lore, and was a mighty theologian among the Anaks of the Orthodox Church. Many a young divine had sat at his feet-as, of old, Paul did at the feet of Gamaliel-to learn of him. But there was a craving for "young preaching" and the "old pastor" was turned out of the fold to the commons.</p> 
               <p>"How did you leave the poor man, my son?" he asked with kindly interest.</p> 
               <p>"Easier, father. He had a restless night of it. But his ribs are skillfully set, and his arm is less painful."</p> 
               <p>"Poor man, I hope he will recover. He seems to be well-spoken, as if he had seen good days. What said Mrs. Temple? Is he her brother?"</p> 
               <p>"It would seem so. But she is quite ashamed of him. He has been sent to Coventry, it would seem, having always been poor. She says she cannot find room for him, though Annie offered to surrender her room!"</p> 
               <p>"That won't do, poor girl," said Doctor Willett, who seemed to have thought for everybody and everything. "It would seriously incommode her. We have plenty of room-the square one, and the one over the kitchen. Let us have him here!"</p> 
               <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6857-00000020"/> 
               <p>"That is what I was just proposing to sister."</p> 
               <p>"That is right. We'll take care of him, for I haven't the good Samaritan's two-pence to pay for keeping him in the inn. But in our house we can get along."</p> 
               <p>"I think so, Sir. And who is at Widow Honeywood's?"</p> 
               <p>"A young man sorely bruised. I do not know his name. He cannot speak for a swelled lip and cheek, which are severely hurt. But he has money; for the widow showed a purse of gold which fell from his pocket. His dress and appearance all indicate a person of consideration. The good widow will nurse him well, and I am sure will need the <choice>
                     <sic>remumeration</sic>
                     <corr>remuneration</corr>
                  </choice> which he will reward her with by-and-by. He is not mortally injured, only bruised. The Doctor says that no limbs are fractured."</p> 
               <p>"I am glad to hear it," said Mortimer. "I will go down and see him some time to-day."</p> 
               <p>"You must lie down and sleep first," said his sister. "You will be ill."</p> 
               <p>"When I sit up all night, if I sleep a part of the following day, I am good for nothing the rest of it, and lose my full sleep the next night. Any young man can do without sleep one night and not show it the next day. But I must go and bring Mr. Dutton up."</p> 
               <p>"I will be ready for him," said Arly, cheerfully.</p> 
               <p>The transfer of the wounded stranger was carefully achieved from the tavern to the parsonage by means of a spring-wagon, and he was comfortably placed in the bed in the back-room on the lower floor. He seemed to be very grateful, and expressed his thanks with as much distinctness as his condition would permit him to do.</p> 
               <p>The bill at the inn had been settled by Mortimer out of his little hoard. It was but one dollar for the night he had been there, but a large sum for our hero. But charity is weightier than silver, and goodness of heart more precious "than gold that perisheth!"</p> 
               <p>The physician came and pronounced his case full of hope, but directed that he should be carefully nursed. Mr. Temple by-and-by came down to see him, but he was sleeping under the influence of an anodyne; but he went in and regarded him for a few moments, and said in a whisper to Mortimer:</p> 
               <p>"Yes, it must be Mr. Dutton; but he is greatly altered. I should, however, recognize him. How heavily he breathes! I fear it will go hard with him. Mrs. Temple has sent me to see if it is her brother; and now that I can assure her it must be, she will come and see him; and we will do what we can. Annie is already in the front room to offer her services."</p> 
               <p>Leaving Mr. Temple with him, Mortimer went out to say a few words to Annie, and assure her that there was a chance of his recovery. He left to visit the young man at the widow's. Upon entering the humble wayside cottage, one window of which was filled with toys and candy for children, the good dame, in neat white cap and apron, curtsied a welcome to him, and expressed her joy at seeing him again after so long an absence at college.</p> 
               <p>"How is the young man?" he asked.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, doing nicely. He will be up in a week or two; but I guess it will leave a scar, and that'll be a pity, for he must have been 'mazing handsome. Poor, dear youth! I dare say he's got a loving mother somewhere, whose heart would just break to know he was lying here, bruised as he is. But he doesn't complain, and smiles his thanks out of his fine, clear, blue eyes, for everything I do for him. You don't know how fine his linen is, and how costly his clothes must have been, though they are now all soiled and torn; poor young man. It was a mercy he wasn't killed, like poor Mr. Hall, whose body went by on the hearse, not an hour ago! Ah, what a sudden death! That was a worldly man, Mr. Mortimer; if so he got the gains of this lower yearth, he never cared nothing for his soul. I'm mazin' 'fraid he went without time for a prayer! Wall, as folks sow, they must reap! Poor man-his money'll do him no good in that other world. There's his sloop at the wharf, there, just got in last night, from Bosting, with all his goods in it; and he lying dead in his hearse, waiting to be buried. Vanity is vanity, certain! But I suppose you want to see the young gentleman?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Dame Honeywood; if he would like to see me."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I guess he'll be glad to see sich a friend as you. Like father like son. Good Doctor Willett has been here, and was so kind, and cheered him up, like; not telling him he was going to die, and scaring him, but telling him he would get well, and he must keep up good courage, and do jest as I said. So he nodded his head, and said he would, for his face is so swelled he couldn't open his mouth. But come in. He is in my little back-room. That is the same room and bed my poor boy that was lost at sea used to have. For William's sake, I'll take the best of care of him."</p> 
               <p>Mortimer went into the room, where, upon a low bed with a white coverlid, and snowy pillows, lay the young man he had seen on the box with the driver, smoking and talking as the stage drew up to the inn in Bowdoin, the previous noon. If he had envied him the ability to ride, which he did not, he would have now been taught the lesson "to be content always with our present condition".</p> 
               <p>"I have come to offer you my services, my friend," he said. "I am the son of the clergyman who was here this morning. Do not try to articulate, for I see it is difficult. The physicians say you will not be long confined to your couch. It was a sad accident; but you have escaped with life, which is a great blessing."</p> 
               <p>The young man raised his left hand, on which was a massive seal-ring, with a gesture of devout thankfulness.</p> 
               <p>"If I can do anything for you more than has been done, please write on this leaf with a pencil, for I see your hands are free."</p> 
               <p>Mortimer's suggestion seemed to gratify him. He took the pencil and wrote in a good hand:</p> 
               <p>"Thank you! I am doing well. You are extremely kind. If not too much trouble, I would like my baggage."</p> 
               <p>"Is it at the inn?" asked Mortimer.</p> 
               <p>He wrote:</p> 
               <p>"It was left at Gardiner, I suppose, in the confusion."</p> 
               <p>"I will send for it," answered Mortimer. "I will see the agent here at once. How is it marked?"</p> 
               <p>"C. H. (England)."</p> 
               <p>"I will do as you request," said Mortimer, regarding the young Englishman with new interest. "I will by-and-by come back again. But you must have some one here. The kind widow has her little shop and affairs to attend to. I will take care of your comfort."</p> 
               <p>Mortimer then left to go to the stage-office. To his surprise, he found the trunk there and those of the other passengers who had come up; but when it occurred to him to inquire for a trunk for Mr. Dutton, the answer was that "there was no baggage to that name".</p> 
               <p>"He is indeed an indigent man," said Mortimer, within himself; "but the more need, especially as he is Annie's uncle, he should be taken care of!"</p> 
               <p>The trunk was large, and of the best make, as that of a man who has money to buy the best of what he needs. Having given directions where to send it, he once more sought his home, perplexed to know how to divide his time between his two patients. Having found Mr. Dutton still asleep, he made known to Arly and Annie, who were together in the parlor, the result of his visit to the young man, and gave utterance to his embarrassment.</p> 
               <p>"Annie says she intends to give her uncle as much of her assistance as she can; and if she is much here, I can make and send to the young Englishman nice broths and jellies."</p> 
               <p>"They are expensive luxuries, sister," said Mortimer, smiling. "But don't look so blank about it. I would like to have you visit him as it is so near, two or three times a day, for a woman is a sort of <unclear>heavenly</unclear> angel to a sick man. I know I felt so when I had the typhoid fever two years ago, and dear Annie and you nursed me! That sick three weeks is full of the sweetest memories of my life!"</p> 
               <p>"Pray don't get sick again, Mortimer, that Annie may nurse you. I am sure she likes a well lover better than a sick one."</p> 
               <p>"When the young man needs luxuries I dare say he will give the good widow money, and in that way you can purchase what you want for your jellies and blancmanges, and all those charming delicacies with which I was indulged when convalescing."</p> 
               <p>"It won't be improper for me to visit him, brother?"</p> 
               <p>"Not in the least, as the daughter of the clergyman. You had best go with father this evening."</p> 
               <p>"Is he handsome?"</p> 
               <p>"On the contrary, he has a bandage across his cheek and mouth, and a strip of plaster across his forehead, and is anything but prepossessing. You'll not fall in love with him."</p> 
               <p>"But he might with Arly," said Annie, playfully.</p> 
               <p>"I shall go plain and demure, and as grave as a sister of charity."</p> 
               <p>"You can never look less beautiful, sister," said her brother, gallantly. "I fear, with Annie, the mischief will be on the other side."</p> 
               <p>"I will run the risk, brother," she answered, laughing. "My duty is to do what I can to assist old Goodie Honeywood. He will fare badly if he has no other one to look after his comfort. C. H.? I wonder what the letters stand for!"</p> 
               <p>At this moment Dr. Willett came in, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Where do you think your protege is?"</p> 
               <p>"Joe?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes."</p> 
               <p>"I hope in no mischief or trouble. The driver says he will take him back to-morrow. He knows him well."</p> 
               <p>"He has made his way into the sick room, and has planted himself by Mr. Dutton's bed, and is keeping the flies off him with his great hand, and watching over him with the most tender solicitude. He has a good heart, if he has no brains."</p> 
               <p>"I fear, Arly, that we shall have to keep the poor fellow here," said Mortimer.</p> 
               <p>"He has been cutting and bringing in wood," said Arly. "Then he rubbed down the old horse, a luxury unknown to him for a year or more, brought water, and built a fire, and seems to be as busy as he can be, all the while laughing to himself, and making<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6857-00000021"/> up the most hideous and unmeaning faces. The children were at first greatly terrified at him; but he has made friends with them, and amuses them greatly; and now he is, father says, trying to play nurse."</p> 
               <p>They approached the door of the room, and found him waving to and fro his hand over the sleeper, now arranging the <unclear>bedclothes</unclear>, now watching with eager interest his least movement. Mortimer could not but smile. Joe, while discovering them, made a gesture of silence, and accompanied it with such an odd motion of his great mouth and eyes that Annie laughed aloud. The sleeper woke, and the idiot frowned and looked so fearfully irate that Mortimer shook his finger at him menacingly. In a moment he was subdued; and, crouching upon the floor, he tried to embrace Mortimer's knees, with a hound-like affection.</p> 
               <p>"What a strange being!" ejaculated Dr. Willett, as Mortimer led him passively from the room.</p> 
               <p>Annie now drew near her uncle. His eyes were clearer and expressive. He was evidently better. He regarded her with surprise and satisfaction. No sick man could have done otherwise, who, on awaking, beheld so lovely a person regarding him with affectionate interest. It was enough for Annie that he was her mother's brother. Blood with her was thicker than water; and helplessness of all kinds always excited her sympathy and invited her assistance.</p> 
               <p>"You do not know me, uncle," she said, smiling. "I am Annie Temple. I have come down to help to nurse you, and try and get you well."</p> 
               <p>"I shall certainly get well," he said, "if you take care of me. Let me look at you. Yes; I see the family-likeness-more like your father than your mother! Where is my sister?"</p> 
               <p>"At home, Sir," answered Annie, with slight embarrassment. "'Ma says she is sorry she cannot give you a room in her house; but she will come down and see you this evening."</p> 
               <p>"She was told that I was her brother Richard?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Sir."</p> 
               <p>"Humph!" ejaculated he, in a cynical tone, which, however, Annie gave credit for to the pain he was evidently all the while <choice>
                     <sic>suftering</sic>
                     <corr>suffering</corr>
                  </choice>. "And, knowing me to be your poor Uncle Richard, you, my fair niece, have come to see me and nurse me. This is kind in you. I did not expect it. Your mother hasn't raised you, I see, to despise poor Uncle!"</p> 
               <p>"I despise no one, Sir! Poverty was made honorable when the Divine Son of Mary consecrated it in his own person. It is no disgrace to be poor. The only wrong is, to be ashamed of poverty, and try to be that we are not. A leaf of fennel, because it is real, is more beautiful than a painted rose-leaf. Truth, dear uncle, is always dignified and respectable."</p> 
               <p>"You talk as if you had been wisely taught, girl. I did not suspect that my sister had such a treasure. Your beauty is the least part of your worth, I see; for you are sensible, and also kind-hearted."</p> 
               <p>"You must not talk, dear uncle," said Annie, not at all displeased that she had made so good an impression. "Dr. Page gave strict orders. I and Mortimer Willet are to be your nurses, and you must do just what we say."</p> 
               <p>"Mortimer Willett?"</p> 
               <p>"He is the young man who sat up with you."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, yes! a nice and kind person. He is the good parson's son?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, dear uncle."</p> 
               <p>"I am in good hands. As you say, I will not talk, I will do what I am bid."</p> 
               <p>When Annie entered her house, after passing three hours down at the parsonage with her uncle, she found her mother in an unusual state of excitement and pleased surprise, and holding an open letter in her hand.</p> 
               <p>"When will wonders ever cease!" she cried. "I wish your 'pa would come home! There is news! The letter was just brought from the Post Office, and delayed on account of the breaking of the stage."</p> 
               <p>"Who is it from, mother? What is the strange news?" asked Annie, with amazement.</p> 
               <p>"It is a letter from your Uncle Wylie! It was written five days ago, at Boston-no, at his handsome place, Berry Hill, in the vicinity. It is addressed to me, too! It is twenty years since he has noticed us! And then for him to come and visit us! Here's your father at last-always away when he is most needed at his home!"</p> 
               <p>"What now, wife?"</p> 
               <p>"What now? Guess, if you can? Guess who it's from!" and she held up the letter.</p> 
               <p>"I have no idea. I hope it is not an old Boston dun," answered the merchant, who caught a glimpse of the well-known Boston postmark.</p> 
               <p>"Nothing like it. Guess who wrote it."</p> 
               <p>"I have no notion, unless one of your old lovers, now all rich as Crsus, you are continually throwing at my head, now that I am brought down in the world."</p> 
               <p>"Well, it is certain if I had married Colonel Burrell, I should ride in my own carriage now."</p> 
               <p>Annie colored with shame at her mother's want of delicacy and tenderness for her father's feelings, and, placing her hand on her father's shoulder, she said, with a brilliant smile of pride and pleasure:</p> 
               <p>"You would not have been my dear father. I am glad, with all my heart, mother married you; for that Colonel Burrell is a dreadful man. All his wealth don't render him endurable."</p> 
               <p>"How did you leave Mr. Dutton, Annie?"</p> 
               <p>"Much better, father. He is a rough but intelligent man, and is so grateful-"</p> 
               <p>"Don't talk about Richard Dutton. I can't see what ill wind brought him here. But I have got news, Mr. Temple! This letter is from my brother Wylie."</p> 
               <p>"What does he write about?" asked Mr. Temple, coldly; for he had not forgotten how the rich bachelor turned a deaf ear to his appeals when the cloud of misfortune lowered over his house, and unfeelingly suffered the storm to burst upon him and overwhelm his good name.</p> 
               <p>"He says that he is coming down to see some lands he has bought in Somerset County, and will stop a day with me. Oh, what good news!"</p> 
               <p>"I see no good news in that," said her husband, dryly. "You have no room to accommodate him, even for a day. But let me see his letter."</p>

               <p>When the merchant had concluded the perusal of this extraordinary epistle from one who had ignored their existence for twenty years, he looked pleased, and said:</p> 
               <p>"This is strange! I never expected Major Dutton to write such a letter as this, after all that has <choice>
                     <sic>pased</sic>
                     <corr>passed</corr>
                  </choice>. I am glad to see he is coming to some human feeling, and to learn that there is something else in life besides money to care for. I hope good will come of it."</p> 
               <p>"I am sure it will!" answered Mrs. Temple, with elated looks. "We will do everything to please him and humor his ways. And now we see how Richard came to be here. I'm glad brother is doing something for him. It shows us he'll do something for other people." And here she looked with a great deal of meaning in her husband's face.</p> 
               <p>He understood her, and answered, doubtingly:</p> 
               <p>"I hope so."</p> 
               <p>"Hope so! I know so!"</p> 
               <p>"I don't think he gives his brother Richard more than a mere pittance-probably twenty or thirty dollars a month. His appearance-his patched and coarse coat and pantaloons-showed that he is destitute. Perhaps your brother intends giving him a log cabin to live in on his lands, and send his family to him. Be sure. Wylie Dutton is not the man to be too liberal, or give one dollar more than actual necessity requires. He is a miser at heart. As to his stopping with us it is to save expense for himself and horses for a day at the tavern here."</p> 
               <p>"You do my brother injustice, Mr. Temple! I am sure he is a gentleman, at least, and that is what everybody isn't! But you'll be glad to have his money."</p> 
               <p>"Which I never expect to see the color of," answered Mr. Temple, laughing. "But he will have to snow it to Smithley, at the inn, for you have no place for him here; and as for his two horses, we haven't a lot that will hold a calf, and our woodshed won't do for the entertainment of a span of Boston horses, accustomed to lodge and fare better than the poor of the earth."</p> 
               <p>"He shall not go to the tavern," said Mrs. Temple, emphatically. "Do you suppose I am going to let slip this opportunity for getting a fortune for Annie, and better ourselves, if I can help it? Not I. I am not such a born fool, Mr. Temple. Brother Wylie shall eat and sleep here, and his horses shall be taken care of, if I have to-"</p> 
               <p>"Give them up your own bedroom, were you going to say, wife?"</p> 
               <p>"How provoking you are, Mr. Temple! Whose fault is it that we haven't a stable? Whose fault is it that our handsome house and brick stable, and my horse and chaise were sold? If you had followed my advice-"</p> 
               <p>Mr. Temple, like a tree that has so long bent to the storm, that it bends no longer, but is fixed in one stay, betrayed no displeasure. He was silent, as past, experiences told him he ought to be in such cases. So she did not point the sentence, which, if he had answered back, she assuredly would have done with a sting in it. But in deference to his becoming humility, she left out the sting which usually terminated her sharp speeches to her better half.</p> 
               <p>"Annie shall give up her room, and sleep in the wardrobe-won't she, dear? And brother shall have her room, I can move into it our best bed, and washstand, and bureau, and make it look as nice as possible.<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6857-00000022"/> As for the horses, Doctor Willett has a barn and a chaise-house."</p> 
               <p>"But there is nothing in it for the beasts to eat. The Doctor, you know, sold his chaise to get along; and as nobody would buy his spavined horse, he turns him out to get his living on the road-sides. There has not been an ear of corn or a peck of oats in the good Doctor's barn these two years."</p> 
               <p>"Can't we buy oats and hay, and send them? So that is settled, too!"</p> 
               <p>"But he'll probably have a hired man to drive, and take care of his horses," said Annie; "and what can be done with him?"</p> 
               <p>"A man in livery, I dare say! Dear me! I shall hold my head up with my rich brother at my house. Let me see! There is Betty's room. She could go and sleep with some of the neighbors hired girls, just for a night or two, and so we could manage to lodge the man. As for his meals, he can take them in the kitchen with Betty! You see what a manager I am! Really this is a providence that Wylie should come to see us! I shouldn't be surprised-" And here the lady stopped, as if too full to give utterance to her great thoughts.</p> 
               <p>"Surprised at what?" asked her husband.</p> 
               <p>"If he should settle something on Annie!"</p> 
               <p>"I should be very much so," answered the skeptical husband.</p> 
               <p>"I should not. And now, Mr. Temple, see about the hay and oats being brought. Here's a dollar and a half I have been keeping for some pressing occasion. Buy it with this! See, too, about marketing to-morrow, for he says he shall be here to-night! We must have a nice dinner. Now, Annie"-she said, as Mr. Temple went his way, wondering at this condescending visit of the rich brother, and at the accident which had also sent the "poor Richard" upon them at the same time-"now, Annie, you must stay at home. Don't you go near Richard Dutton again until his brother has left, even if then! Let them look after him at the parsonage. You stay here. I need you. We have everything to turn upside down! Now let us go to work and make the change! And I want you to be very gracious and kind to your Uncle Wylie. Don't forget to kiss him, and say how glad you are to see him! You must look your best, and keep your hair braided your Sunday-way; and you must not let him want for anything. Recollect that he is rich-very rich, and that if he takes a fancy to you (seeing he is an old bachelor, and has nobody to leave his money to), he may settle fifty thousand dollars on you-who can tell? All will depend upon yourself. You are handsome enough, and can make him almost fall in love with you himself-but I believe there is a law set down in the end o' the Bible against uncle's marrying nieces."</p> 
               <p>"And if there were not, dear mother," said Annie, both astonished and amused, for she possessed naturally a keen sense of the ludicrous, "I am engaged to Mortimer forever; and if I were not, I would never marry an old man of sixty, if he owned the mint."</p> 
               <p>"Brother Wylie is not but fifty-seven last birthday. Owned the mint? Don't be foolish, Annie! Riches are everything. Love comes afterward, when husbands behave themselves, and make us love 'em. I did not marry for love! You know I was a poor girl, and taught music. I married Mr. Temple because he was just a-set up in a good business on credit, and everybody said he would be rich. I had rich lovers, but they didn't come to marry me without anything. Love! What will all your love and Mortimers bring you but poverty? Any fine girl can make any man love her! But this is no time to waste in talking. Only mind my words, and try to get on the right side of your uncle!"</p> 
               <p>For the remainder of the day, the small but tidy tenement in which the reverses of Mr. Temple had driven him to seek shelter from the frowns of the world, was a scene of confusion. Every thing had first to be taken out of Annie's room and stowed away in a low loft over the kitchen, and a mattress laid upon the floor of the dark, close press for her sleeping-place. The amiable young lady made no opposition, though, in the honesty and simplicity of her truthful nature, she wondered why the wounded and suffering brother, who really needed shelter and aid, was denied it, while, for the rich brother, who could fare sumptuously at the tavern, all this trouble and uproar was made. She took no pleasure in it at all. She would have cheerfully done all for the poor uncle, but she reluctantly gave her services to put herself out for the rich one. She was not yet versed deeply enough in the motives in human nature to see clearly the secret end which her managing mother had in view.</p> 
               <p>At length, an hour before sunset, Mrs. Temple, very red in the face, very tired, and yet very well satisfied with what had been done, pronounced "everything ready". Mr. Temple had bought the hay and oats, and had them taken-for a sixpence paid in advance, by a loafing inebriate he fell in with-to the minister's old barn, which it took him half an hour to put in order, as the door wanted a hinge and a bolt, and the mangers had long since been split up, by poverty at the parsonage, for firewood. As to asking permission of Dr. Willett for the favor of making use of his barn, no one thought of it. The liberty was taken as a matter of course, as it used to be with his horse and chaise, when he kept one-which the parish at large borrowed and harnessed up without leave whensoever it pleased to use it.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head> 
               <p>Miss Temple now dressed herself to look her best, after sending for Arly, "to please come to braid Annie's hair"; while Mr. Temple, who, as she said, never half-shaved himself at home (which domestic half-shaving he did for economy's sake), was sent to little Mr. Alexander, the white barber, under the tavern, "to get his chin shaved clean for once!"</p> 
               <p>In the meanwhile, the two wounded patients, the one at the Widow Honeywood's, and the other at the parsonage, were receiving the best attention. Idiot Joe had no sooner seen Miss Annie leave her uncle's room than he stole into it, and took her place. The poor man regarded him with wonder, and not a little anxiety, but Dr. Willett, who was there also, said:</p> 
               <p>"He is a poor young man, Mr. Dutton, who has been by a mysterious Providence denied the full exercise of his intelligent faculties, and has taken a fancy to my son, for whom he has left his home. He seems harmless and affectionate."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, yes, let him stay with me. It will relieve your own household," said Mr. Dutton, his words interrupted in the utterance by expressions of pain. "He is strong, he is kind, and he can turn me in bed. Let him be about me, if he wishes to. Oh, my side pains me, Sir, exceedingly."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I doubt not; but suffering is the school of patience and submission, Sir."</p> 
               <p>"Does the physician think my life in danger?"</p> 
               <p>"I believe he has great hopes of you, your constitution is so good; but it cannot be denied, Sir, that your hurts are very serious.'</p> 
               <p>"I suspect so. If there is any change for the worse, let me know, reverend Sir; for, in that case, I have something to do and say to you. I trust to you, Sir, not to delay to inform me; for it is important, if I am not to live, that I be told of it in time."</p> 
               <p>"Be assured I will be faithful, Sir, to your expressed wishes."</p> 
               <p>"Thanks-thanks," answered Mr. Dutton. And closing his eyes, he seemed to wish to rest after the fatigue his conversation had brought upon him. In a few minutes he seemed to be asleep; and leaving him to poor Joe to guard him and inform Miss Charlotte if he awoke, the Doctor went out to visit some of his parishioners.</p> 
               <p>"But did Arly pay a visit to the young Englishmen, and who went with her?" I hear some fair girl ask.</p> 
               <p>That she did! She was too good and kind and benevolent not to do so. She went alone; for her father, when she was ready to go, was engaged with the friends of Mr. Hall about appointing the hour for his funeral the ensuing day.</p> 
               <p>Why should not she go alone? Angels and pure women need no protection when they visit the sick, or prisoners, or the suffering. Purity is protection. We do not advocate the theory that an innocent girl should, in a large city, if the benevolent spirit prompted her, go diving down into dark lanes, redolent of sin, seeking the poor and outcast; penetrating long, dark entries, and descending to the underground abodes of vice and squalor, and where evil men dwell with more evil women, in wretchedness and debauchery. No, no! Purity would, in such purlieus, receive contamination and might be fatally imperiled! Alas! virtue and innocence in such a place would be the jeer and mock of vice and guilt, and the wretches which Purity sought would be eager to destroy her and drag her down to their own level.</p> 
               <p>But in a village, in the house of a respectable poor widow, when the sufferer is a young stranger, and the visitor the daughter of the parish-minister, it was the proper mission of charity and purity to go and do good without fear.</p> 
               <p>No false delicacy made Arly delay when she felt that her presence might be needed. So she went alone.</p> 
               <p>The young man was lying with his face toward the window, looking out upon the bright river, with its passing vessels, and the shadows of the shore reflected inverted upon its placid breast.</p> 
               <p>A light footstep at his door, and a hesitating knock, caused him to turn his head; for Arly found the little front shop deserted, the widow having gone to a neighbor's to get some sort of herb for her guest's benefit. So she entered, and timidly knocked at the inner door, which was ajar.</p> 
               <p>When the young stranger beheld a tall, graceful girl he started with surprise, and seemed embarrassed. But Arly, with a kindly smile, said:</p> 
               <p>"Do not move, or you will disturb your bandages. I am the minister's daughter, and have come to see how you are, and if you need anything."</p> 
               <p>Can young and beautiful maidens have any conception of the power their beauty exercises over the sensibilities of young men? or are they quite as unconscious of it, as the richly-colored birds of the glory of their gorgeous plumage? In our opinion, a sparrow, with its brown coat, and a canary-bird, are equally unconscious either of beauty or of<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6857-00000023"/> plainness. But as to lovely young girls, we have our doubts. We rather suspect that a pretty one knows her power, and loves, too, to exercise it, to the bewilderment of young gentlemen with tender hearts. If they do know how dangerous they are, they are certainly very reckless and cruel to go about as they do with so many young men exposed everywhere to their power. They are like boys shooting at the wooden door of the powder-magazine as a mark.</p> 
               <p>That Charlotte Willett was very beautiful, with sweetly-expressive eyes, rich wavy hair, and a voice of rare melody, we have already given our readers to understand; and that the highest excellency of her loveliness was the goodness which her charming face expressed. Her smile was rich with all the opulence of a woman's gentlest nature: it shed sunshine around her. Whether she was conscious of her beauty and of her power, we cannot say; but, if she were, she was very indiscreet in visiting the young stranger, who, so far as she knew, might have a susceptible heart, and become in love with her! And then, if she refused to return his attachment, she would be answerable to her own conscience for all the unhappiness which might result to him. Taking this view of the case, and knowing how just and true, and amiable and good Arly is, we venture to say that she was wholly unconscious that she was handsome, and wholly ignorant of the power that she possessed as a beautiful girl. She was too amiable to do any one harm, or expose any human being to unhappiness on her account. We do not here mean to advocate that all pretty girls should go vailed, lest they should have to be answerable for the mischief of their eyes and smiles; but, so far as Arly is concerned-and now we are particularly interested in her case-if she had the last idea that the young stranger would have become enamored with her, she would not have gone to him-or gone, possibly, with a double vail on.</p> 
               <p>The young gentleman seemed to color up and be ashamed, as it were, to be seen in such a plight, with a bruised head, by so bright a girl. He pulled at the handkerchief about his cheeks, and so far removed it as to speak and say, though with some indistinctness:</p> 
               <p>"I am sorry you should take so much trouble; excuse me for not receiving you better, Miss. I am not in a very interesting plight to be seen by a young lady!" and, all the while he could not keep his fine eyes off from her face; and, by their brightening up, betrayed his admiration and wonder at the charming apparition-such a contrast to old Dame Honeywood, in her meeting nose and chin, and round iron spectacles, prim cap, and nasal enunciation, whom he had last seen standing there; for Arly did not come in beyond the door.</p> 
               <p>"Do not think of your appearance, Sir," she said, pleasantly. "You will improve every day. You ought not to talk."</p> 
               <p>"I will obey you."</p> 
               <p>"That is not the way!" she answered pleasantly. "I will send you one of my little brothers' slates, and a pencil, and you can write what you wish; but you mustn't try to converse. You see I am a little peremptory; but my brother Mortimer told me that the Doctor forbade you talking for at least three days. That is a long time for a young lady; but gentlemen are naturally taciturn, and I believe prefer silence at all times."</p> 
               <p>There was a smile in the young man's eyes.</p> 
               <p>"Do you need anything?" she asked, playfully.</p> 
               <p>"Yes; to have you remain!"</p> 
               <p>"Didn't I forbid your speaking?" she said, with a slight shake of her head. "Let me establish signs for you until the slate comes. When you wish to say 'no', move your forefinger from side to side; and when you say 'yes', just raise it."</p> 
               <p>"I will fol-"</p> 
               <p>"You must not talk! The Doctor said it would bring on inflammation, and be a serious injury to you. You must be a submissive patient. I am used to nursing, and I always make sick people do just as I say. No matter how bitter the medicine the Doctor leaves, they have to take it. I am a terribly unmerciful nurse! I am a perfect tyrant when Mortimer or father is sick!"</p> 
               <p>The young man laughed, in spite of himself and the agony it caused him. This laugh seemed to establish a sort of friendly feeling. He made a gesture for the pencil and book Mortimer had given him in the morning. Arly got them from the table, and handed them to him with modest grace, and said, with a smile:</p> 
               <p>"If you follow the directions of the Doctor and mind me, I will come and see how you get on once every day-"</p> 
               <p>"Twice!"</p> 
               <p>"Not once if you speak again! Don't you see what an effort it is?"</p> 
               <p>He commenced writing:</p> 
               <p>"I thank you for coming so kindly to see me. I have sisters, and they will thank you when they shall hear of your goodness to a stranger. Your venerable father and your noble, brother, how good they are! If you will call and see me once a day, it will help me. Your kindly face creates hope and trust."</p> 
               <p>"Please don't flatter me, Sir!" she said, with earnest gravity. "If you begin to give compliments you will never see me again. I come to you as a nurse-a Sister of Charity-regard you as such; and don't frighten me away with fine words."</p> 
               <p>"Pardon me," he wrote, "I ask your forgiveness. I will not think of your loveliness, and-"</p> 
               <p>She laid her finger upon the pencil, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Haven't I warned you? I shall not let you even write, unless you behave better!"</p> 
               <p>The young man smiled again with his eyes, and resumed his pencil. Although the bandage about the lower part of his face concealed his mouth and covered a bruise that was unsightly, yet the upper part of his face was very handsome. His eyes were a brilliant and expressive Saxon blue, and his smooth, high forehead, was high, and round, and noble-looking, shaded by soft brown hair, which clustered about his temples with classic negligence. On one of his temples a bit of court-plaster closed a scar, otherwise the upper part of his face was without defect.</p> 
               <p>A young man with a fine forehead and expressive eyes, even if his mouth is muffled and swollen, can manage to be attractive, if he is intelligent and at heart a courteous gentleman, as this stranger evidently was. He did not, therefore, look the fright she expected to find him; on the contrary, she was not a little embarrassed to see such a fine-looking young man with only his cheeks bound up, and a little pale. He at once awakened an interest in her which was deepened by her pity to see so nice a youth lying there hurt, far from his home and friends, His language and manner of writing showed her, too, that he was well-educated and cultivated.</p> 
               <p>"If you will lay your commands on me so seriously," he wrote, "I shall be forced to obey. You have asked if I need anything? Yes. Will you do me the favor to write a note for me?"</p> 
               <p>Arly blushed a little as she read the request, but answered promptly "Yes. To whom?"</p> 
               <p>"To Sir Benjamin Vaughan!"</p> 
               <p>"Do you mean Doctor Vaughan of this place?"</p> 
               <p>The stranger held up his forefinger.</p> 
               <p>"I see you are an apt pupil. I did not know that Doctor Vaughan (as he is usually called; for he practices gratuitously among the poor where they need aid, being well skilled in medicine), was addressed as 'Sir'."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps not in your Republic, Miss," he wrote. "Address him as you please. You will find a little writing-desk in the top of my trunk. Here is the good widow coming in, who will open it for you!"</p> 
               <p>Charlotte did not ask the old dame's aid; but with the same quiet, cheerful manner she would have shown were she waiting on her brother, divested of all affectation-which the pure in heart know nothing of, for they never think of self (and it would have been impossible for Arly or her father to have defined 'selfishness')-she obtained the escritoire, opened it, and laid it upon a little stand, upon which stood his medicines. He made a sign for her to open the lid, and from it she took out a sheet of cream-colored notepaper. At the top of the page she noticed the stamp of a coat of arms, wanting the crest, a simple shield, with a bar of three scollop-shells on a field of ermine. She read the motto, "Ad sidera vultus".</p> 
               <p>Arly had never seen letter-paper so impressed before but in the family of the Vaughan's, whose notes were all stamped with their shield.</p> 
               <p>"Your motto, if this is yours," she said, "is an excellent one-"</p> 
               <p>"It is mine-you translate Latin, then?" he seemed to ask with his eyes, and she answered with a smile.</p> 
               <p>"You know that a clergyman's daughter is supposed to have a little Latin and Greek. Do you render this, "Face to the Stars' or 'Look to Heaven?'"</p> 
               <p>"Either! I prefer the last."</p> 
               <p>"So do I-and so we are both talking. What shall I write? Dictate with your pencil."</p> 
               <p>At this moment the old Doctor came in, a large portly old-school gentleman, with knee-breeches, powder in his hair, a white vest, and a gold cane. He was taking snuff as he followed the good dame in, to whom he had first courteously extended his great silver box. When, seeing Arly, he bowed and smiled and shock her hand with the three fingers of the hand, which between forefinger and thumb held the pinch of maccaboy.</p> 
               <p>"Always where you can do good to somebody, Miss Arly," he said, with the familiar and cheerful tone of a friend.</p> 
               <p>"I merely came, Doctor, to see if he wanted anything, as he is in some sort under Mortimer's charge."</p> 
               <p>"No excuse-none at all! No nurses like the ladies! But I see my patient looks livelier to You have done him good already-"</p> 
               <p>"Doctor-"</p> 
               <p>The old gentleman patted her <choice>
                     <sic>cheeck</sic>
                     <corr>cheek</corr>
                  </choice> and said:</p> 
               <p>"Don't mind me, Arly. Don't cease to come here? And how are you now, my dear Sir?"</p> 
               <p>"Better-much better!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I see that! Swelling subsided! The scar doing well! Mouth still painful, I dare say!"</p> 
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6857-00000024"/> 
               <p>He then felt his pulse, all the while sniffing his nose-a habit the good Doctor had-and said, with an encouraging look:</p> 
               <p>"No fever! Pulse a little agitated. You are doing well! Keep quiet, and abstain from talking much. In a week you will be out again. The man at the parsonage, Miss Arly," he continued, turning to her, "is in a bad way. I fear it will terminate fatally."</p> 
               <p>"Indeed, Sir!"</p> 
               <p>"I have just been with him! He received internal injuries. His only safety is in perfect quiet."</p> 
               <p>"Did you tell my father this?"</p> 
               <p>"He was not at home! But you are the main nurse there."</p> 
               <p>"And my brother!"</p> 
               <p>"True!"</p> 
               <p>"Did you see the poor idiot?"</p> 
               <p>"I did, and I must say I never saw a more tender assistant in a sick-room."</p> 
               <p>"Ought he to be there?"</p> 
               <p>"The patient seems to wish it. He may relieve you all."</p> 
               <p>The Doctor then took leave of his patient, saying he would call and see him in the morning; and as he went out, he looked at Arly as if he wished her to follow him. When she came to the outer door, he said.</p> 
               <p>"Do you know the young gentleman's name?"</p> 
               <p>"I do not, Doctor. The trunk is marked 'C. H.', and with 'England' on it."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, he is from England. He is evidently of good family. He has the air of a gentleman."</p> 
               <p>"I am sure he must be! But I am about writing a note for him. His name will be given. The note is to Doctor Vaughan!"</p> 
               <p>"Possibly, then, he may be known to him. I should like to know; for if he is a friend of that family, he would be better cared for there. Last night, I feared he was very seriously hurt; but it was the first appearance of his wounds before they were dressed. I think he could be safely moved to-morrow, if necessary. Good evening, dear Arly."</p> 
               <p>"Good evening, Doctor."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! what is this?" ejaculated the physician, as a traveling-phaeton at that moment came along the road. It was drawn by a pair of beautiful iron-grays, and a coachman with a gold band about his hat, and buff-leather gloves, was seated on the box. The phaeton held a stout man, with a rough but intelligence countenance, well dressed, and yet with awkward manners, as he half-returned the courteous bow of the Doctor. Behind was strapped on a large trunk, covered with a bear's-skin. The whole equipage was aristocratic and showy, and quite an unusual thing in the quiet streets of this river-town, where the most ambitious "turn-out" was a one-horse chaise-save always the plain but respectable family-coach of the Vaughans, which had now got to be as familiar to the eyes of the people as the stage-coach itself.</p> 
               <p>"Dear ses!" ejaculated Dame Honeywood. "Now, who did ever! That must be some great man-p'raps the gov'nor down from Portlan'. Ain't it stylish-like, Miss Charlotte? Who is it, Doctor?"</p> 
               <p>"Some gentleman from Boston, I dare say, traveling through to Quebec," answered the Doctor, as he got into his old-time chaise and drove away.</p> 
               <p>When Arly returned to her charge, he seemed anxious.</p> 
               <p>"I was afraid you had forgotten me," said the patient, "and had gone."</p> 
               <p>"Oh no! But keep quiet, please, Sir."</p> 
               <p>"The Doctor says I may talk a little."</p> 
               <p>"No! He said you must not talk much."</p> 
               <p>"Well, this little is not much."</p> 
               <p>"Write now, Sir, what I shall put in the note."</p> 
               <p>The young man wrote as follows, on a half-sheet of note-paper. As it fatigued him, he had to take three several tasks at it: <q>
                     <p>"TO SIR BENJAMIN VAUGHAN:-The person named in the accompanying letter was hurt by the upsetting of the stage yesterday at Gardiner. He is now at the house of a kind widow, where he receives the best attention; but he feels it his duty to inform you of his presence here so near you. This is kindly penned for me by a lovely girl-"</p>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>"I shall not write that!" said Arly, with a bright laugh, and coloring up with increased loveliness.</p> 
               <p>He erased the word lovely, and wrote the word charming.</p> 
               <p>"No! Nor that, Sir!"</p> 
               <p>"Amiable?"</p> 
               <p>"No! Nothing!"</p> 
               <p>"This, then, is all?"</p> 
               <p>"Do you sign it?"</p> 
               <p>"No."</p> 
               <p>"How, then? But I have no right to ask you how Doctor Vaughan will know who it is."</p> 
               <p>"Under that slide you will find a letter. Inclose it in the note, and please seal and direct both to Sir-that is, to Doctor-Vaughan."</p> 
               <p>All this was spoken; for his voice grew better with use.</p> 
               <p>Had Arley no curiosity to know his name? We dare say she had the usual curiosity of her sex; but she would not have though much about the matter if he had not withheld it from the bottom of the note. One name is as another name, or no name at all is no better than a name where a stranger is concerned. Mr. Smith, Jones, Brown, it is all the same, so that we never saw Mr. Smith, Jones, or Brown before. We ride all day in a coach, and several days, without knowing the name of any of our fellow-passengers whom we talk with by the hour; and, when we find it is Mr. Smith, we have neither gained nor lost anything. The name is not the man. Yet it would be a queer world if men had no such conventional distinction. Society, without doubt, would fall to chaos if every man should wake up some morning oblivious of his own or of his neighbor's patronymics. "What's in a name?" would then be very clearly demonstrated, to the utter confusion of society.</p> 
               <p>It would have been very natural, no doubt, for Arley to desire to know the name of the young invalid. Should it be Job, or Jesse, or Barnabas, we think it would slightly surprise or displease her. Who can conceive of a nice young gentleman, with a pale, intellectual cast of forehead, as answering to the name of Simon, Peter, or Moses? Edward, Charles, Herbert, George, and the like, seem to be appropriated by all young gentlemen who figure as heroes.</p> 
               <p>But we have not made a hero of our young invalid as yet. Whether he will turn out be one will depend on circumstances more or less favorable.</p> 
               <p>Moving the slide in the desk, Arly took out a letter addressed to the Honorable B. Vaughan, Kennebec, United States of America. It was not sealed. Without doubt it contained the name of the invalid. Arly did not peep into it to see what it was, as some young ladies might have done! She quietly folded it in the note, and addressing it to the gentleman for whom it was destined, asked:</p> 
               <p>"Shall I send this for you?"</p> 
               <p>"If you will be so kind."</p> 
               <p>Shortly afterward, Miss Willett took her leave, and on reaching home, sent her little brother, Andrew, with the note to the villa; and finding the message from Annie's mother to come and "fix her hair", she went over to the cottage of the Temples. It was now within half an hour of sunset. Mrs. Temple had dressed, and was looking flushed and expectant, and going about nervously to see if everything was all right for her "dear brother, Wylie". Twice she read the letter over aloud to Arly, interrupting her as she braided the shining tresses of her rich hair, in her description to her of the interview she had with the young stranger, in which account Annie became deeply interested.</p> 
               <p>"Make her look her best, Arly," said Mrs. Temple. "I want her uncle to see what an aristocratic daughter I have."</p> 
               <p>"Don't make me vain, 'ma," said Annie, laughing.</p> 
               <p>"I wish you were vainer than you are. I never knew two such girls as you two are. You are, either of you, handsome enough to be the wife of a lord, and yet you don't seem to know it."</p> 
               <p>Both girls laughed merrily, and Annie said:</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps Arly may yet be. You don't know what she has been telling me about that young man. He has a hand like a lady's; a gold ring; large, handsome, tender blue eyes; a fine forehead-"</p> 
               <p>"There-there-do stop, dear Annie. If you betray my confidence in that way, I will never tell you anything again."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, you will. But I won't vex you, Arly. But I can guess something-"</p> 
               <p>"Please keep your guesses to yourself, mischief. You think, Madam, because you have arrived to the dignity of an engagement that I must, out of pure envy, try and catch the first lover-a bruised-up one at that-that comes along, though I have never seen him but once!"</p> 
               <p>"Once is enough to lose one's heart," said Annie, in a tone of badinage.</p> 
               <p>"Dear me! Don't quarrel, girls! I wonder if he's coming."</p> 
               <p>"Dear me!" exclaimed Arly. "I shouldn't wonder if that fine carriage was his, and that he has come! Why didn't I mention it!"</p> 
               <p>"Come? Did you see a fine carriage? Where? Where? Tell me quick, child?" cried Mrs. Temple, in great excitement. "Dear me! If he should come, and Annie not fixed!"</p> 
               <p>"I'll have her ready in three minutes," answered Arly. "It passed half an hour ago, when the Doctor and I were at Widow Honeywood's. It was a fine equipage, with a driver in livery, and with beautiful gray horses. It contained but one gentleman, who was wrapped in a cloak."</p> 
               <p>"It must have been my rich brother, Wylie," she cried. "Where can he be? Perhaps he has gone to the tavern first, thinking we can't accommodate him. Where is Mr. Temple? He is always out of the way when he is wanted most. He must run right down to the tavern and invite him up, horses and all! Won't the neighbors stare?"</p> 
               <p>While she was speaking, the rattling noise of wheels was heard, and a glimpse of a handsome carriage was caught through the palings by the eager eyes of Mrs. Temple. All in a flutter, she ran first to the room she had fitted up, to see if all was right there, and then to the little parlor, to look into the glass to see if she herself was presentable with becoming splendor to the rich Boston brother.</p> 
               <p>"Annie, there is one of your curls awry! Go and fix it! Stop a moment. Let me rub your cheeks-you're so pale to-day!"</p> 
               <p>Suiting the action to the word, Mrs. Temple<pb n="48-49 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6857-00000025"/> ple caught both of the young girl's cheeks, and gave them a good pinching and rubbing, by no means to the improvement of her beauty, in our estimation; for little delicate roseate which usually enriched Annie's complexion, needed no improvement; one might as well perfume the moss-rose.</p> 
               <p>The carriage drew up at the gate. Mrs. Temple nervously peeped through the blinds; and beheld first a man with gold lace on his hat open the door of the vehicle; then Mr. Temple, to her surprise, got out-evidence to her that he had been in the right place for once, at the right time. He turned round and assisted a stout gentleman to alight-a heavy man with a dark visage, and looks of a person at ill-odds with all mankind-a very unamiable countenance; yet it resembled enough that of Mr. Richard Dutton to show the new relationship; for the reader need not be told that this is the "other Mr. Dutton".</p> 
               <p>Mr. Temple opened the little paling-gate, and ushered his guest in with a sort of importance, as if he had caught something of his ambitious wife's spirit of pride on the occasion. From the side-lights of the front door, through a little space scraped off with her scissors from the painted glass, a point of observation from which Mrs. Temple always scanned her visitors, the hostess took a good look at her advancing brother as he traversed the twenty steps to the house.</p> 
               <p>"How stout he is grown-stout as Dick promised to be. How he has changed! He looks older and heavier, and slow! But age touches us all! He's dressed fine, and that improves him!"</p> 
               <p>"Yet, mother, he does not look so much like a gentleman in the face as Uncle Richard," said Annie.</p> 
               <p>"Don't you mention him, child! Now put on your smiles! He is at the door! Do as I do! Imitate me, and just as you see me meet him, do you-for (and here she whispered) it may be worth fifty thousand dollars to you. First impressions are everything! He is looking about him, and seems to think it is a poor place for him to come to. But we must make it up in affection and attention! Hush-hush! Here they are! Don't you open the door! Let Betty! I told her to be all fixed up and ready to run as soon as-"</p> 
               <p>Here Mr. Temple opened the door without ringing, and nearly caught his wife in the little entry; but she was a skillful dodger, and got out of sight, not even revealing the skirt of her dress-for skirts were narrow and easily managed in those days. Annie, however, did not fly, but met her father and uncle face to face, without embarrassment and in a natural manner.</p> 
               <p>"So, Annie," said her smiling father, "You are the first to welcome your uncle! This is your niece, my daughter, Major Dutton!"</p> 
               <p>"I am glad to see you, uncle," said Annie, pleasantly, and extending her hand with modest grace, wholly regardless of the programme her mother had laid down for her conduct. "Ma received your letter, and has been looking for you with some impatience."</p> 
               <p>"Impatience!" cried Mrs. Temple, rushing out from the parlor, with a sort of stage-air, and clasping Major Dutton about the neck! I have been dying to see you, brother! O my dear, dear brother! It is so long-(a sob)-so-so long (a double sob)-since-I-saw you! I am so-oh, so glad to see you!" And she kissed him and cried and cried, and hugged him in the most approved manner known to theatrical scenes of the same sort. Mrs. Pelby of that day could not have wept more naturally in playing a sensation-part.</p> 
               <p>"You have altered, sister," said Major Dutton, after she had welcomed him; "but not so much."</p> 
               <p>"Annie, Annie, why don't you hug your uncle? She's diffident, brother-but she'll learn to love you-she thinks the world of you, as we all do! What a happy hour is this to me! Come in, come in! Here's your room all ready! It was dear. Annie's, but she cheerfully gave it up to her beloved uncle! Indeed, there's nothing she would not do for you! Take a seat-there-brother, in the rocking-chair! You must be tired! Where did you pick up Mr. Temple?" she asked, smilingly, as she took his hat and gloves and overcoat.</p> 
               <p>"I was at the inn, waiting, wife," said Mr. Temple; "and as soon as he arrived I brought him here!"</p> 
               <p>"How could you be so cruel, brother dear, to go to the inn, even for a moment, when your own beloved sister had a house, and everything nice for her darling brother? Dear me! I forgot about the horses!"</p> 
               <p>"I have ordered my servant to take them to the hotel," said Major Dutton, in a pettish, raspish voice, in keeping with his cross looks.</p> 
               <p>"Never-never! We've got all prepared for your servant (emphasis on servant) and your span of horses! Do let me have my own way!"</p> 
               <p>"Well, have your own way, woman," he said, as if annoyed.</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Temple, go right out and see to it all! You can let brother's coachman drive you to the stable (she didn't say "the parson's" stables) and then come back and entertain brother while I am about tea. Annie 
                  <figure> 
                     <head>A COUNTRY WASH-TUB.</head> 
                  </figure>
                  <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6857-00000026"/>
                   dear, you haven't kissed your uncle Wylie yet!"</p> 
               <p>"I don't like women to kiss me!" growled the rich brother, and looking as if he would bite back.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Temple laughed heartily:</p> 
               <p>"That is just like you rich old bachelors! Isn't that funny? Don't like to be kissed, even by a pretty girl, and that your niece! Ah, when you was a boy, you used to like the girls!"</p> 
               <p>"Never liked 'em! I won't go to my room! I want fresh and hot water, and towels, and everything, for I wish to take a hot bath after my journey."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Temple looked aghast. A bath! Such a luxury, beyond a wash-basin bath, was not on her housekeeping role. Yet a bath the rich man must have! Annie's innate love of the humorous caused a slightly-mischievous smile to play demurely about her mouth. She was not sorry at all this trouble. She felt that her mother ought to be put to all sorts of inconveniences for being so absurdly vain as to try an entertain a rich brother without the means or room in her house properly to do it; and who, besides, had money enough to pay for all the trouble he might give at the inn; while she suffered her poorer brother, sick and suffering, whom charity called upon her to put herself out for, and who had no money, to go to the house of strangers!</p> 
               <p>"And trouble enough I see my rough, rich uncle is likely to give us all," said Annie, to herself.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Temple had gone to look after the horses; and now, Mrs. Temple, after showing her brother his room, flew in a flurry to the kitchen, and ordered Betty to get her washtub, and "heat water quick", and half fill it; while she herself, got soap and towels and everything else together, in by no means the most amiable of moods; but of course, when she rejoined the nabob in the little parlor, the frown of anger was displaced by wreathed sycophantic smiles. No wonder that weak rich men are exacting, when they find their poor relations so ready to obey their slightest whim and administer to all their caprices.</p> 
               <p>At length Betty, with fiery visage, red from the kitchen, and also with displeasure at the new labors put upon her, thrust her head in at the ajar door, and cried.</p> 
               <p>"Hot water is ready-washtub and towlers-soap and scrubbin'-brush, all in Miss Annie's room-" and she slammed the door.</p> 
               <p>In vain Mrs. Temple made peremptory signals for her to stop, ere she should reveal more than was meet-but Betty out with all the details.</p> 
               <p>"Well, brother Wylie, if you are ready, the room is ready," she said, with her sweetest manner. "I hope," she continued, as she came to the door of his room, "you will find everything you need."</p> 
               <p>"Need!" he exclaimed, glancing round with an aspect of supreme contempt. "Do you think I am going to get into that old wash-tub? Where is your bathing-tub? I can't bathe in this old wooden half of a puncheon!"</p> 
               <p>"Dear me, brother; I did not think!" exclaimed the lady, blushing with mortified pride and trembling lest her rich brother should be angry. "We haven't a long bathing-tub such as you have up to Boston-but there is one in town. I will send and borrow it at once. If you will just wait about ten minutes, brother-"</p> 
               <p>"Not five-not one! I must bathe now!" he answered, gruffly.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, but brother, do let me send for the bathing-tub. Mrs. Colonel Farrelton has one for her sick boy, and-"</p> 
               <p>"Would you put me to death? Think I'll use a sick-tub, and die in a week of disease nobody knows what!"</p> 
               <p>"But I can have it scalded out!" cried Mrs. Temple, who was fast going into despair lest her brother should get irrevocably angry and leave her house, and so put an end to all her hopes for Annie's brilliant future.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Dutton stood and reflected a moment, knitting his brows, and surveying the wretched tub, while his sister earnestly and anxiously watched his face.</p> 
               <p>"Well, send for it! I can't bathe in this!" he growled. "I suppose I shall have to wait half an hour for it!"</p> 
               <p>"Oh no; not a quarter, dear brother! Annie will play for you on her guitar the while. You don't know how well she plays and sings! Come, brother!"</p> 
               <p>"No, I detest singing and squalling! Rather'd hear a banjo than a guitar! All humbug! No, get me pens and ink and paper. I want to write letters! I suppose you've got letter-paper?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh yes; Annie has some! Annie dear, bring your uncle some of your rose-scented note-paper!"</p> 
               <p>"Paugh! Rose-scented! I don't want any of your nonsense. I thought you were poor; and yet you can buy your daughter rose-scented paper!" was the cynical rejoinder of this amiable Boston uncle.</p> 
               <p>"It was a present from young Mortimer Willett! We didn't buy it!" answered the lady, apologetically.</p> 
               <p>"He'd better made her present of a spinning-jenny! But send for the bathing-tub."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Willett hastened from the room. No sooner had she closed the door than she raised both of her hands toward the low<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6857-00000027"/> ceiling of the front entry, and exclaimed in a hoarse stage-sort of whisper.</p> 
               <p>"Dear sus! Was there ever? What shall I do? I didn't expect he'd make me send for it! Oh, Annie!" she cried, as she encountered the young lady with the rose-scented paper in her hand. "Oh, what shall we do? Your uncle says he must have a Boston bathing-tub! There is but one in town, and it is at Colonel Farrelton's; and you know they are so aristocratic and don't visit me since Mr. Temple's failure; for you know he broke, owing him so much! I am at my wits' end!"</p> 
               <p>"It won't be proper, mother, to borrow the bathing-tub of Mrs. Farrelton!" answered Annie, quietly, and was going past her, when her mother caught her by the arm, saying, in a sort of frantic way, "Don't take that rose-paper to him for the world! He detests it! Oh, what shall I do?"</p> 
               <p>"It is a pity you have tried to entertain him, 'ma; for he has so much money he can buy what attention he wants at the hotel. My poor Uncle Richard would not have been one quarter this trouble, sick as he is; and besides, he seems to be of a far more amiable disposition."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, because he is poor! Men who haven't any money have to be amiable and humble. It is only the rich who can have airs like your Uncle Wylie."</p> 
               <p>This was spoken as if she felt a sort o pride that, troublesome as he was, she had a brother rich enough to "put on airs".</p> 
               <p>"Give me that note-paper, Annie!"</p> 
               <p>"You do not mean to send for the tub, mother?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes," she answered, firmly; for despair and fifty thousand dollars in prospect gave her courage even beyond the proprieties. She was prepared to do any deed of daring, however unseemly, to keep on the fair side of her rich brother.</p> 
               <p>"Don't write, mother!"</p> 
               <p>"That I will! Don't say a word! I am acting for your good! Mrs. Farrelton is a religious woman. "She'll lend it."</p> 
               <p>"You never borrow of Mrs. Farrelton!"</p> 
               <p>"I'll borrow this tub if I die for it!"</p> 
               <p>And Mrs. Temple sat down and wrote as follows on the rose-tinted perfumed paper:</p>

                           <p>"MRS. COLONEL FARRELTON-Dear Madam:-You are a Christian woman. You remember in the Bible how a traveler came to a poor man's house which had nought to entertain him, but went and borrowed of his rich neighbor, who was even in bed. So I come to you, my dear Madam. My brother, Major Wylie Dutton, of the City of Boston, has come to my house. He needs a bathing-tub such as he is accustomed to use in his own house-for he is a rich man and bathes sumptuously every day like the rich man in the Bible-and I have no Boston long tub, only Betty's washtub; and if you will be good enough to loan me the blue tin tub, long as a man, I saw once in better days at your house, you will do as the man did to his neighbor in the Bible, and show the true Christian spirit of loving your neighbor as yourself.</p>

               </q> 
               <p>"There, I think that will do!" exclaimed Mrs. Temple, folding it, unaware of the little grammatical deficiencies of construction, due to an imperfect education in her girlhood; "that will bring it."</p> 
               <p>This was addressed to Betty, whom she had called in from the kitchen and her getting supper.</p> 
               <p>"What'll bring it?" asked the irate servitress, maid-of-all-work in the reduced family.</p> 
               <p>"This note-the long bathing-tub? Now take it, that's a good Betty, and run to Mrs. Farrelton's, and ask for her, and give it to her; and, if William isn't there, you just bring the tub yourself!"</p> 
               <p>"Didn't you say the note would bring it, hey? Let it bring it! I'm not going to bring the thing! If my washtub is not good enough for your rich brother and the Mayor of Boston himself, they may both go without washing themselves! There's the Kennebec, let him o and paddle in that, and plenty of room to splash about, and no need to have anybody to wipe up after him! Your rich brother must be amazin' unclean gentry to want a whole hogshead of water to-"</p> 
               <p>"Hush, girl! he'll hear you! Just run with this note. When Annie gets her uncle's property-"</p> 
               <p>"How do you know she'll get it?"</p> 
               <p>"Don't holler so like a sailor, woman! He's got nobody to leave it to but us! So try and help me to put up with him; and, when we are rich, I'll give you some money to buy a new silk dress; that's a nice Betty!"</p> 
               <p>"Well; if it is for Miss Annie, who never spoke a unkind word to me, I'll do it, for she ought to be a heiress!"</p> 
               <p>So Betty took the rose-perfumed note; and, all bareheaded and barefooted as she was, started in a full run across the garden, in the direction of the place of her destination.</p> 
               <p>Betty was a fair representative of that class in Maine known as servant-girls. Daughters of "small-potato farmers,' as the lower agricultural grade in New England is termed, doubtless because their estates consist mainly of a potato-lot; these stout young women come into the towns at an early age, and go out to service. They can read and write after a fashion, have usually a good share of common-sense, work hard for their one dollar, or dollar and a half a week, and do for it the labor of three slaves, worth to their masters fifteen hundred dollars a piece. This grade of domestics every year grows more and more numerous in Maine. They are faithful, laborious, and intelligent. They are often taken into the council of the household, and treated with deference; for the whole domestic machinery would stop if they are offended. In most houses, therefore, the Bettys rule, and are the real power behind the throne. The master keeps in her good graces to keep her; the children to get bread and butter, and especially more butter; the daughters humor her, because they want their dresses fastened, their collars done up, and a thousand little things; and the boys are especially civil, that she may let them stay in the kitchen when mince-pies are baked and dough-nuts are fried, or anything else in the tempting cooking-line going forward. In many families, Betty builds the fires before day, feeds the "one horse", slops the cow, milks her, and turns her out to pasture, before the lord or lady of the manor open their belated eyes. She comes in, builds a fire in the breakfast-room, and possibly in the children's chamber, helps to dress one or more, goes to the kitchen and cooks breakfast, and perhaps waits on table; though to wait on table is regarded by these stalwart dames as the lowest act of menialship, the most degrading part of servitude, always save and except running to answer the door-bell. Some Bettys will curry the horse, cut wood, clean the boots, and do all other similar work, but rebel with angry pride if asked to wait on table, or answer the tinkle-tinkle of the door-bell. These are the points on which they make a stand to assert their Yankee-born independence, and to show that they are not "ignorant Irish" nor "nigger slaves". These two exceptions taken, they regard all other household domestic work as legitimate and honorable. By-and-by, Betty's handsome and ruddy face catches the eye of some young mechanic in the town; and some sunny morning, when Betty is making the bed, while her mistress (we use the term only relatively, for Betty has no mistress or master, it is Mrs. and Mr. This and That when she speaks of them) is fixing her hair for the day, she sidles up to her; and, with a blush rich as the crimson of the watermelon-pulp, ventures to say.</p> 
               <p>"Marm, you don't find no fault with me, do yer?"</p> 
               <p>"No, Betty."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I've got a spark!"</p> 
               <p>The mistress starts with a momentary feeling of solicitude, for this may be the first step toward parting with her "help" (this being the term these hard-working girls most delight to be honored with), for to term them servants or domestics would give them offence beyond retaining them. "Hired lady,' is coveted by some of the more distinguished; but "hired girl" satisfying those of ordinary ambition. What's in a name? Voluntarily or involuntary servitude is a part of the curse. The white races submit to the former, and desire, very properly, to be called "hired help"; which the other condition is equally filled by the ignorant descendants of Canaan; who in spite of himself, was ordained to become a "servant of servants" to his brethren. The difference is, and it is a great one, that voluntary servitude has power to change masters at will; while involuntary servitude has no power of choice. Betty is content in her voluntary servitude, so that she be not called a "hired servant" but "hired girl".</p> 
               <p>"Why, Betty! What have you to do with a lover?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, Marm, I hope by-and-by to get married and settle down on a small farm-or as an industrious mechanics' wife, and work for my husband for love, instead of wages."</p> 
               <p>"It is very foolish in you Betty to leave a good place-"</p> 
               <p>"I ain't going to leave! I only want to ask you if I may let John Trent spark me home from meetin' Sunday-nights, and sit up with me!"</p> 
               <p>"Well, I suppose I must!" answered the lady, reluctantly.</p> 
               <p>"The kitchen is my kingdom, Marm," answers good-natured Betty, with a smile; "and I know we girls can do as we please there; but I thought as you was always so kind to me, and never 'play the lady' over me, I'd ask you. I won't burn out your candles, Marm, if John wants to stay late! He says he'll bring his own candles and apples!"</p> 
               <p>The lady laughs heartily: tells honest Betty they can court by her own candles, and eat as many apples as they choose; only adding-</p> 
               <p>"But, Betty, don't let John stay too late; and you know you have to be up Monday-mornings by two o'clock to build the fires and get ready for washing. And I've always noticed that hired girls that spark are always so stupid Mondays, and I used to catch Sally asleep over the washboard!"</p> 
               <p>Betty laughs and promises to keep her eyes open. Such is the New England maid-servant! In a Southern family there is the fire-builder, the washer, the ironer, the bed-maker, the wood-chopper, the hostler, the gardener, seamstress, the dressing-maid, and the nurse, ten domestics for a small family; and the day's work ill-done at that. But some Betty's perform often all these duties, with going errands to boot, for a dollar and<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6857-00000028"/> a half a week; and leave the ten slaves behind in the race! Such is the Yankee domestic girl! No land has her equal for the possession of all the virtues that go to make up a good servant.</p> 
               <p>Having thus taken up the gauntlet for this valuable class of citizens in the domestic department, we simply desire to add that Mrs. Temple's "Betty" was at the head of them all. About three-and-twenty, "strong as a horse", begging Betty's pardon for this sort of comparison, which we only take as being a common proverb, childishly ignorant of the world and geography in general, not over-religious, but honest and truthful, strong-built, handsome and healthy, with a merry laugh and a good temper when let alone, but plenty of old Adam in her on occasions; patient and enduring, willing and obliging; driving the boys from the kitchen on principle, and not liking the "master" to enter it, unless he praises the shining wares and the neatness of her floor; patronizing to the "mistress", whom she regards as her equal; a confidant of the daughters and a friend to all the household; a close sharer in all its funds, hating its enemies as if they were, her own.</p> 
               <p>Our Betty left her half cooked supper, which was to be an extra one, with better humor than one would have supposed human nature capable of, and hastened to the Farreltons, upon a run; for zeal for Annie and pity for her mistress incited the faithful creature.</p> 
               <p>When she presented herself at the handsome front-door of the aristocratic mansion, she handed the note to the lady thereof, who read it with a look of surprise, which changed into a smile at its close. Betty detected her quiet smile, and took it at once as an insult to her mistress, and said:</p> 
               <p>"If you can't send it, M'm, you needn't laugh. Mrs. Temple, M'm, will be as rich as anybody yet again!"</p> 
               <p>"Tell your mistress-"</p> 
               <p>"I ha'n't no mistress; I'm no ebony slave," answered the independent Betty, who had a long grudge against Mrs. Farrelton for stopping her visits to Mrs. Temple when her husband failed in his business, and come down in the world.</p> 
               <p>"Tell Mrs. Temple that I have no bathing-tub," answered the lady; "it is long since worn out. I am surprised she should send to me, even if I had one! At any rate, she might have sent a civil servant."</p> 
               <p>"Servant!" repeated Betty, furiously, her fine, black eyes flashing. "I'm as good as you are, Miss Farrelton, if Mrs. Temple is down in the world! Ladders has two ends, and sometimes one end rounds to the top, and sometimes the other; and one end's good as another! You are now topside up, but next year you may be bottom-side down, Mem!"</p> 
               <p>With this curt denunciation, Betty, all irate, flung herself round, and left the door. She reached home in great wrath, and made known to Mrs. Temple the result of her errand.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Temple felt keenly the insult to herself, and was almost angry with her rich brother for placing her in a position to have her feelings so wounded, and "such a pious, religious note, too, as I wrote her. She hasn't no more religion than an Indian!"</p> 
               <p>This remark was addressed to Annie, who at the moment came in, saying:</p> 
               <p>"Mother, how shall I get my evening-dress? Uncle is in my room, and I can't go into the wardrobe-closet in it, while he is there!"</p> 
               <p>"I never thought of that. But he'll come out to supper, by-and-by. That hateful, proud Mrs. Colonel Farrelton to send such a despising answer!"</p> 
               <p>"I expected it, mother. You ought not to have exposed yourself to her words. You know you never visit her."</p> 
               <p>"But what can I do? I am desperate. Your uncle must have his bathing-tub. Who can have one? Oh, there's the Vaughans. They are rich and English, and have everything. I'll send to them. Your father shall go!"</p> 
               <p>"No, dear mother, do not send. They are kind and polite, and would not insult you. But it will appear so strange to them," said Annie, who, refined and educated, had a correct understanding of the proprieties of society. But Mrs. Temple was perfectly desperate, and was reckless of consequences to keep her rich brother in her house, and in good-humor; for she perceived that he was by no means a gentleman easy to entertain.</p> 
               <p>"What shall I do then?"</p> 
               <p>Mr. Dutton, himself, at this moment, came out of his room, and said:</p> 
               <p>"I am tired waiting! I'll put off bathing to-night, I guess?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, no, brother. We can get plenty of tubs-"</p> 
               <p>"No, you can't get one-not one! I overheard your talk. But as you have done your best, it is enough, only don't lie about it now, that is all! I hope, at least, I'll get something for supper. So much for visiting poor relations-every thing turned topsy-turvy, because poverty would play pride, and so bursts, like the frog in the fable, that would swell to the size of the ox! Come, Miss," he said to Annie, whose bright eyes fairly sparkled with anger, at his rude language to her mother, "I suppose, as you are such a prodigy, and can play the guitar, you can toast a slice of bread. I am very particular. I hate hot biscuit, flapjacks, and such indigestible nonsense that I heard your mother order her girl to get. A couple of slices of baker's bread is all I want, and you must toast them for me."</p> 
               <p>"Oh no, brother! I'll do it," answered Mrs. Temple, greatly relieved about the tub-affair, and in a mood to do anything for him; "Annie will set the table."</p> 
               <p>"Well, so I get the toast," answered the rich brother! "It must be done just right, or I'll not eat a mouthful; and, mind you, sister-"</p> 
               <p>"Well, dear brother," eagerly.</p> 
               <p>"It must be buttered hot!"</p> 
               <p>"Oh yes; and brought in hot "</p> 
               <p>"No-cold-I eat it cold-but it must be buttered hot. And as for tea-I want the best Souchong, with cream! Can't take tea without cream. And look, I want tea in thirty minutes."</p> 
               <p>Thus giving his orders like a nabob, the rich man walked into the little parlor, which was now obscured in the shades of twilight, and lighting a cigar by the candle, began to smoke, pacing the floor. Mr. Temple pulled Annie by the sleeve, and hastened before her to the kitchen. When the interposing door was closed, she said, with a disturbed look: "Was ever such a man! But hist! He mustn't hear us for the world, for he has quick ears! Don't let him make you angry, Annie. I'm so glad he's give up bathing. That's one trouble over! Now for the baker's bread! And such nice biscuits as I was making, and such batter for the flapjacks! You must just put on your things, Annie, and take this fourpence and run down to the parsonage, ask Andrew Willett to go as fast as his legs can carry him to the baker's, and buy a loaf of bread. Tell him to tell Mr. Brown to send me the freshest. Now do be quick."</p> 
               <p>Annie, best girl in the world, hastened to obey her mother, yet deeply vexed that she had placed her and the whole family in such a false position.</p> 
               <p>"I would rather keep poor all my life than sacrifice my self-respect, as my mother is doing," she said, as she tripped down the walk. "Was ever such a rude rich man as this Uncle Wylie! I do not know whether to detest or pity him. But I will try and treat him with kindness and respect; for good Doctor Willett says we must love even our enemies, and this uncle has almost got to be ours-he has given us so much trouble. I wonder what he'll take it into his head to ask for next?"</p> 
               <p>Andrew was soon on his way to baker Brown's, in obedience to the sweet request of Annie, whom the little fellow would have undertaken any task for, he loved her so well. Until his return, she went up to see the other uncle, learning from one of the children that Arly was with him. When she entered, the venerable, Doctor Willett was praying, in a low voice, by the bedside, Arly kneeling near him, the idiot Joe standing gazing with great awe down into the face of the man of God, as if not comprehending what he was engaged in. The sick man's hands were clasped, and his eyes closed.</p> 
               <p>Annie advanced noiselessly, and kneeled down close by Arly. The aged minister was praying as for one soon about to depart on the journey to that bourne whence no traveler returns? He was pleading for forgiveness of all that was past in the life of the sick man, and that his soul might be made white in the blood of the Lamb.</p> 
               <p>"Amen!" responded from time to time from the invalid, and "Amen!" said Annie, in her heart.</p> 
               <p>Could it be that her uncle was dying? The prayer was ended, and they all rose to their feet in subdued silence. Annie then gazed on the face of the sufferer, and recognized a great change since she had beheld it a few hours before. She whispered to Arly: "Is he dying?"</p> 
               <p>"My father thinks so! We have sent for the Doctor," she answered. "He suffers greatly. He asked for our prayers!"</p> 
               <p>"Poor uncle!" sighed Annie. And she drew near the bed, receiving the grasp of the minister's friendly hand on her way.</p> 
               <p>"Uncle, are you very ill-more so than when I was here?" she asked, in a voice full of sympathy, and laying her soft touch upon his hard, irregular pulse."</p> 
               <p>"Who is it?" he asked, regarding her with looks of inquiry. "Ah, I see-it is Annie, my sister Martha's daughter! Good child-good child! You have come again to see me! Where is my sister?"</p> 
               <p>"'Ma has company-Uncle Wylie is come to see her!" she answered, with an embarrassment that, under the circumstances, was very natural.</p> 
               <p>"What say? Wylie come-Wylie come! Ah, yes-yes. So he's there, is he? How can my sister find place for him and not for me? Oh, ah-yes-I see-I see. It is Wylie, is it? He is rich! The rich brother is cared for-the poor brother must care for himself, or look to strangers. Don't look sad about it, child. I know you are good and kind. That young man-what is his name-Mr. Mortimer?"</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Mortimer Willett, uncle-the son of this good minister who just prayed with you?" said Annie, with earnestness.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Mr. Willett. Nice young man. Is kind to the stranger and poor. He told me how good you were-how-"</p> 
               <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6857-00000029"/> 
               <p>"You must not talk, uncle Richard," said Annie, smilingly interrupting him.</p> 
               <p>"It won't hurt me to talk to you! I see my mother's looks in you. So you are Martha's daughter, and Paul Temple is your father! I did not dream they had a child so fair and kind. I wonder, with my rich brother at your house, you could come and see me, a poor man, from whom you could expect nothing but trouble."</p> 
               <p>"I think, dear uncle, you need more care and kindness than Uncle Wylie, who can pay for all he desires."</p> 
               <p>"Well spoken-heart in the right place, child! Is my sister coming to see me?"</p> 
               <p>"To-morrow, Sir, 'ma will come. Tonight she has to entertain her other brother; and she knows you are well cared for here, with dear Arly Willett, and the Doctor, and Mortimer, and all!"</p> 
               <p>"To-morrow I may be a dead man!"</p> 
               <p>At this moment the door opened, and the physician entered, sniffling and snuffing, as his habit was. Excellent practitioner of the healing art! Kindest of nurses, wisest of doctors! Dressed in a wide-skirted, old-time coat, ruffled shirt, and knee-breeches, with queue and powdered head, how welcome was ever your noble form and genial face in the sick-room!</p> 
               <p>He spoke a pleasant word to each one present, and Annie resigned her place to him. He laid his hand upon the pulse, and looked thoughtful, as if numbering the beats thereof; while the room was as still as a tomb, and all eyes fixed waitingly upon the Doctor's sagacious visage.</p> 
               <p>"Strong-irregular-little fluttering!" he soliloquized. "No immediate danger. Nervous system excited unduly. Something on his mind. Must be calm, my dear friend," he added, addressing the patient. "Dismiss all troublesome thoughts!"</p> 
               <p>"You are right, Doctor," answered the man. "I have a troubled mind. Can we be alone? I have something to say."</p> 
               <p>"Oh yes, I think so," answered Doctor Page, looking pleasantly at him and waving his hand gently behind to those who were in the room.</p> 
               <p>Softly Arly and Annie retired, and the Doctor was left alone with the clergyman and his patient; for Doctor Willett remained at the request of the invalid.</p> 
               <p>"Shall he go?" asked the physician, looking at the idiot, who was standing on the opposite side of the room, counting to himself on his fingers.</p> 
               <p>"No! A poor fool! But he's a good nurse," answered the invalid. "Let him stay! He knows nothing!"</p> 
               <p>Over Joe's great inert visage passed a light-of pleasure at these words, and he rubbed his two hands upon his two knees with a chuckle of delight.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head> 
               <p>Leaving the two gentlemen to hear what confession the sick man evidently wished to make for the lightening of his mind, we will follow Annie and Arly down-stairs. There the former made known to the latter (for the two girls told everything to each other) how affairs were at her mother's, and what a terrible tyrant her Uncle Wylie proved to be, Arly sympathized with her friend in the annoyances caused her, but said to her:</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps if you play the agreeable and act the lamb to the wolf he may make you an heiress."</p> 
               <p>"I would not be false to myself, Arly, for all the gold in his coffers; and I should be, to pretend to like him, when he is so disagreeable. As for 'ma, I think she deserves all; for she refused her poor brother shelter, who would have been scarcely any trouble, ill as he is, and took in her rich one, who has almost driven her wild already. If I were 'ma, I would send him to the hotel, and take Uncle Richard, who would gladly put up with anything."</p> 
               <p>At this moment Andrew came in, and reported that Mr. Brown had no light bread, but would have some in the morning; and then displayed a sheet of gingerbread, saying:</p> 
               <p>"So I bought this with the fourpence, Miss Annie, as I knew you was going to have company, and I think gingerbread is twenty times better than light bread!"</p> 
               <p>"I have no doubt you think so, Andy," said Annie, good-humoredly. "Arly, what shall I do? It will break ma's heart if I go home without it."</p> 
               <p>"We have a loaf of domestic, Annie, you are welcome to."</p> 
               <p>"Do let me have it, and take the gingerbread instead for the children."</p> 
               <p>"Oh yes, yes!" cried Andrew.</p> 
               <p>And he ran off, shouting to the younger ones:</p> 
               <p>"We are going to have hot gingerbread for supper. Ain't that nice?"</p> 
               <p>It was now dusk. Arly accompanied her friend to the door, having wrapped the loaf in a clean white napkin, and given it to her. One star had already come out, and was admiring its reflection in the placid mirror of the river that flowed past with invisible motion, opposite the house.</p> 
               <p>"It is too late for you to go alone, Annie."</p> 
               <p>"Oh no! It is but a step. I'm not afraid."</p> 
               <p>"Andy shall go with you."</p> 
               <p>"Not so! I shan't permit the little rogue to cut me out. I'll go with you," said a fine-toned, manly, and loving voice; and the same moment Mortimer Willett stood by them, having just then entered the gate.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, brother! How did you leave the young English gentleman?" cried his sister.</p> 
               <p>"Much better. But he is no longer at Widow Honeywood's. The Vaughans called upon him as soon as they received the note you sent by Andy to them. I have just come from there, where I left him in a handsome chamber, and surrounded by luxuries and affectionate attentions."</p> 
               <p>"Then he must surely be a young man of consequence," said Annie to Arly. Who is he, Mortimer?"</p> 
               <p>"What would you give to know, girls?" he asked, with a air of badinage.</p> 
               <p>"That is always your way, brother!" said the pretty Arly, in a sweet, petted tone, more affected than real. "You do so love to tease! I wonder, Annie, you can endure him."</p> 
               <p>"He never teases me!" answered the maiden, quietly.</p> 
               <p>"Then you must have a strange power over him. I am his sport when he has a secret, because he knows I have so much curiosity."</p> 
               <p>Arly had yet to know that a brother's love for a sister and for that sister's friend are very different kinds of love-very-though both equally pure, sincere, and truthful.</p> 
               <p>"I won't tease you, Arly," answered her handsome brother. "You shall know all. The young gentleman is noble born."</p> 
               <p>"Noble born!" exclaimed both girls in a breath of astonishment.</p> 
               <p>"A young lord!" added Mortimer.</p> 
               <p>"You jest with us, brother."</p> 
               <p>"No, I do not. He is the son of an earl."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, how wonderful!" exclaimed Arly.</p> 
               <p>"How romantic!" ejaculated Annie, with a smile at her friend's admiration.</p> 
               <p>"Can it be true, brother?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes."</p> 
               <p>"How did you learn it? What do the initials C. H. stand for?"</p> 
               <p>"Where did you see them, Arly?"</p> 
               <p>"On his trunk and-"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes! I forgot. Well, not to tantalize you further, I will just tell you all about it. After I left home to go down and see him again, and offer to stay with him tonight, Doctor Vaughan's carriage came and stopped at the door. One of the ladies and the gray-haired old gentleman alighted. Poor Widow Honeywood, half beside herself with pride and consequence, was courtesying and chattering about the honor done her poor dwelling when I went out to meet them; for I had heard the carriage, and, besides, recognized the noble old Englishman's thoroughbred voice as he asked for the young man who had been hurt by the upsetting of the stage. They seemed pleased to find me there to receive them; and I ushered them into the room.</p> 
               <p>"Doctor Vaughan at once advanced with his sprightly step to the couch, and, extending his hand, said:</p> 
               <p>"'I am grieved, my young friend, to see you lying here. But I trust you will soon get over it. You must be removed to my house. This is my daughter, who has come with me to insist upon taking you. Are you able to ride for ten minutes in an easy-coach, reclined?'</p> 
               <p>"'I think so, he answered.</p> 
               <p>"The removal, with my aid," continued Mortimer to the listening girls, "was soon effected; and, when Dame Honeywood took leave of him, he placed five guineas in her hand, making her richer than she ever was before. In her honesty and justice, she would have given all back, but he insisted on her keeping it, and we rolled off with her blessing following us. At the mansion, I assisted in getting him to his room; for which he was very grateful."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, he is a very grateful young gentleman," said Arly, "thanking one for the least trifle done for him. But how did you know he was an Earl's son, brother?"</p> 
               <p>"What an inquisitive little body you are, Charlotte! I will tell you lest you get no sleep to-night. After I had seen him lying comfortably in his bed, I left him, but promising to come and see him every day, at his request; and, by the way, he made me promise to thank you, Arly, for your kind visit to him, and said he hoped that, now he no longer actually required your services, he might still hope to have the pleasure of seeing you."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, Arly, hear that!" said Annie, mischievously.</p> 
               <p>"I hear it, Annie," answered Arly, trying to look and appear unconcerned; and the dusky twilight favored her by concealing the tell-tale blood which more than their wont deepened the roses of her cheeks.</p> 
               <p>"How did you know he was noble?" asked Annie.</p> 
               <p>"And his name, did it begin with C. H.?" inquired Arly.</p> 
               <p>"Dear me! girls, how can you be so inquisitive. But I will not keep you in suspense, Arly; for Annie, having a handsome lover, can feel no interest in any other young fellow, even though he were a Prince." This was all said laughingly; but how much earnest was there under the smiles, lovers can best tell. "In the hall, Dr. Vaughan said to me, as I was leaving: "This is a singular meeting with a son of a relative in England. This young man's father is the Earl of Pembroke. He is the Honorable Charles Herbert-"</p> 
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6857-00000030"/> 
               <p>"C. H.! that is it! cried Arly. "That is the name those letters stand for!"</p> 
               <p>"How you interrupt one, Arly," said Mortimer, with a shrewd glance at Annie; "yes, his name is Charles Herbert. Mr. Vaughan added that he had come to this country on his way to Canada to look after an estate left him by the Countess of Ellistone, his mother's sister; that he had landed at Boston a week ago, and after a few days delay there with the Tudors, took the mailcoach to go to Quebec by way of the Kennebec and Chaudiere, where the unfortunate accident happened to the stage. He bore letters to me from England, knowing he would pass through this place, and fortunate it was that he did so."</p> 
               <p>When Mortimer had finished, both young ladies expressed their admiration at the presence of so distinguished a person in their village, and Annie did not hesitate to confess that she had the greatest curiosity to see him, as she had never seen "a lord in her life".</p> 
               <p>"He seems to be a very nice, modest young man, and blushes like a girl," said Arly, with the consciousness of superior knowledge. He feelings, however, were deeper than her words at the interesting intelligence she had received.</p> 
               <p>"I must go home, Arly," suddenly exclaimed Annie, "'ma will be crazy."</p> 
               <p>"Then, let us not delay a moment," said Mortimer, with affected alarm; and, taking Annie's arm, he left the door. He tried to get possession of the napkin, not knowing what it was, but she firmly held and covered it with her hands, for she had no idea of telling him what it contained.</p> 
               <p>They had not proceeded far before they overtook Mr. Temple. He was limping along, poor, kind man! and uttering a groan at every step.</p> 
               <p>"What is it, dear father?" cried Annie.</p> 
               <p>"Are you hurt, Sir," asked Mortimer, letting Annie go to give him aid.</p> 
               <p>"I fear so! I was in the loft, scraping down hay-it was dark-and I fell through the opening into the stall. I have broken my ankle, if not, worse!"</p> 
               <p>"So much for uncle Wylie!" was the thought that passed through Annie's mind, as she supported her father on the other side. Slowly, they drew near to the house, and Mrs. Temple came out, expecting to meet only Annie, and had already began, on hearing the gate open, to upbraid her for her delay, when she saw the three, and heard a deep groan from her husband.</p> 
               <p>She ran forward exclaiming and wondering, and scolding and crying, all at once-</p> 
               <p>"What is the matter, Annie? Are you hurt, Mr. Temple? What made you stay so? Here's Wylie as impatient as a Grand Turk! Is he much hurt, Mortimer? Don't groan so; Wylie'll hear you!"</p> 
               <p>"I've broke my leg, I believe, wife-fell through the stable-" he ejaculated, in a tone that sought sympathy, doubtful if it would get it.</p> 
               <p>"How could you be so careless?-and just at this time, and your brother-in-law, the Major, on a visit-"</p> 
               <p>"It was his visit caused the accident-his horses-" whined the poor, broken merchant, who, since his wife, in his misfortune, had ceased to respect him, had almost ceased to respect himself.</p> 
               <p>"What can be done with you? and your brother-in-law expecting you to entertain him! Can't you bear up-can't you act as if nothing was the matter, and go into the parlor and talk with him, while Annie and I get supper on the table? I wish you were a more careful person, Mr. Temple; it is so inconsiderate of you to be injuring yourself just when you are most wanted! But I ought to be used it, as it always is the way with you!"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Temple did not at all heed the presence and ears of Mortimer, whom she had known from a boy. She had no domestic secrets to keep from him; for he knew her and all about them, and she felt that she could talk before him as she could before Annie. Mortimer also was, on the ground of his engagement to her daughter, just like one of the family. So she did not care to put a bridle on her tongue for him. Thus it is our friends and acquaintances know us so well. It is through and by them, before whom we do not vail our hearts or speech, that the world comes to know us. If we were as discreet before our intimate friends as we are before strangers, we should go through the world like those old-fashioned books with clasps closing the covers tightly together, no man reading us "as he runs". It is our intimate friends, before whom we dismiss reserve, who, becoming (as friends will) by-and-by our foes, who betray us and our weaknesses to the world! All men and women are not strictly honorable; if they were, they would not in hatred betray the confidence placed in them in love! Hence one-half the world is betrayed by the treachery of the other half. It is only a noble and true spirit, that in anger seals more firmly the lips over the secrets of a friend become a foe! Our friends' secrets, weaknesses, and errors, and sins, unreservedly exposed to us in the open day of friendship, ought to be held seven-fold sacred in the night of enmity. It is a base and little, a low and mean soul, that, in wrath uncovers the nakedness which it should sacredly vail.</p> 
                
               <p>Yet wise, and sagacious, and discreet, as is the maxim, "Live with your friends as if you expected them one day to become your foes", an honorable man will no more adopt it than he will wear concealed weapons at the marriage-supper, or kneel at the holy table of the Church with a stiletto in his sleeve!</p> 
               <p>"Dear 'ma, 'pa is severely hurt," said the spirited Annie. "He must be led at once to bed! He cannot entertain any one."</p> 
               <p>"Dear me! dear sus! Well, what a misfortune! I really am afraid brother Wylie will leave the house! Did you get the bread?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; but I must have dropped it when I overtook father," said Annie.</p> 
               <p>"There will be no end to trouble! You knew your uncle was waiting for his toast, buttered hot-and why didn't you let Mortimer Willett take care of your father, and hasten home?"</p> 
               <p>Annie made no reply, so deeply hurt and mortified was she at the selfish and unfeeling manifestation on the part of her mother. Aided by her lover, she led her father to his room, and laid him upon the bed. Mortimer, who had some skill in surgery, having attended a course of medical lectures, then examined his ankle, and finding it dislocated, not broken, said he would go for a physician, and send him at once. He then disappeared on his errand of mercy.</p> 
               <p>"A pretty pass it has come to!" cried Mrs. Temple, walking up and down the room without approaching her husband. "No bread-and you with a sprained foot! What will brother Wylie think? Here it is most eight o'clock and no supper! I hear him talking to himself in the parlor; and no wonder, for you are not there to talk to him! What will become of Annie's fortune? He will hate us more than ever-no tub! no bread! And then there is his Boston coachman is too proud to eat with Betty, and says he must have his meals to himself; and that he is not to be put into the kitchen-loft! One would think the way he goes on in the kitchen ordering Betty about that he was as rich as his master! Betty says she is not afraid of him, and if he does not keep a civil tongue she'll beat him out with the broomstick; and then there'll be trouble; for brother Wylie would not stay a minute in a house where his fine Boston coachman was beaten out of doors with the broomstick! Dear me, I dare say he thinks himself good enough to sit in the parlor and at the table of such as we are if his master was not here."</p> 
               <p>All this time Mr. Temple lay moaning; and Annie, like an angel of pity, was bending over him. She had removed his shoe and sock, and was rubbing with her velvet-soft and white hands the suffering ankle. Mrs. Temple stopped and regarded them both for a moment, and then resumed, in an angry and complaining tone:</p> 
               <p>"One would say the town was hospital enough with the two travelers half killed without an old fool adding himself to the number! Where were your eyes, Mr. Temple? Couldn't you see there was a place in the floor to throw the hay down? What were you doing to tumble into it, if you were sober-not that you are a drinking man, thank fortune, for then I should be a wretched woman indeed! That affliction is removed from me!"</p> 
               <p>"The floor had been taken up in some places to make kindling-wood," answered the poor husband, if possible, trying to say a word in defence, oblivious of the fact that explanations only increased the fire of the attack, and were not to be pardoned.</p> 
               <p>At this moment stood in the door the stout form of the rich man, Major Dutton. Mrs. Temple curtsied with deference and sudden humility, and said:</p> 
               <p>"You must excuse me, brother, but Mr. Temple has been so careless as to sprain his ankle. Supper will soon be-"</p> 
               <p>"What, my dear Sir, are you badly hurt?" asked the intruder, going to the bedside and taking his hand, and speaking in a tone that amazed his sister for its sympathetic kindness.</p> 
               <p>"I fear so, Major Dutton!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, my father has badly. dislocated his ankle!" answered Annie.</p> 
               <p>"I am sorry to hear it. How did it happen?"</p> 
               <p>"He fell in the dark-husband is so nearsighted!" answered Mrs. Temple, in a tone that afar off imitated his kindly one; for she would not for the world her brother should be acquainted with the fact that she had no stable, and had put up the horses and phton at that of the parsonage. With all her poverty, she wished vainly to appear well off in the eyes of a man who, she well knew, was thoroughly aware of her narrow circumstances; for had not she and her husband in the first days of their reverses written earnest and appealing letters to him, their rich relative, asking aid, only to be roughly refused? Yet this very brother she was now moving heaven and earth to honor and entertain, because she yet hoped through Annie's beauty to obtain a portion of his fortune. To what meanness and shame will not sycophancy and avarice stoop!</p> 
               <p>The kind and sincere tones in which the cross, rich man had addressed her husband, amazed her. How sudden the change from moroseness to gentleness. Mr. Temple felt the sympathy, and answered:</p> 
               <p>"I have not been injured so, Sir, but that I shall soon get over it."</p> 
               <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6857-00000031"/> 
               <p>"I trust so-I trust so!" rejoined Major Dutton, in a hearty manner. "I regret extremely your misfortune."</p> 
               <p>"It is not near so bad as your brother," said Mrs. Temple. "There, that will do, Annie; I feel relieved."</p> 
               <p>"My brother?" exclaimed Mr. Dutton.</p> 
               <p>"Yes; did you not hear of the accident?"</p> 
               <p>"No; what is it?"</p> 
               <p>"I forgot to tell you, brother," said Mrs. Temple, with a red face set ablaze by her burning conscience. Brother Richard, whom, your letter stated, you had sent forward to take charge of your wild lands in Somerset, got upset in the stage, and was badly hurt!"</p> 
               <p>"I hope not so bad!" he cried. "I heard at Gardiner, this afternoon, that a stage had upset, but I heard no names."</p> 
               <p>"The two who were injured, uncle, were brought up to the town," said Annie, who began to feel that beneath the rude exterior of Wylie Dutton there was a gentleman's heart. "One of them was my uncle Richard, who sent word to us from the hotel that his ribs were broken, and that he suffered from some internal injury."</p> 
               <p>"Where is he? I will go at once and see him!"</p> 
               <p>This question was addressed to his sister; but she had not courage, so profound was her sense of guilt, in neglecting her brother, because he was a poor man, to reply; but Annie answered, with the air of quiet dignity and truth, which were to her spirit like robes of beauty enfolding it:</p> 
               <p>"At the parsonage. He was not able to keep himself at the inn; and, as 'ma had no room for him, the minister, Dr. Willett, took him very kindly to his house, where he now is. Do not be anxious, for he receives the best attention; but he is very much hurt, and fears he shall not live!"</p> 
               <p>Major Dutton uttered an exclamation of surprise and pain, and said:</p> 
               <p>"If any one can go with me, I will at once visit him. What a sad calamity to befall my brother!"</p> 
               <p>At this instant, the Doctor, whom Mortimer had found at the parsonage, came in; and, having carefully looked at the injured ankle, pronounced it only a dislocation; and, with Major Dutton and Mortimer exerting all their strength to the aid of his skill, he replaced it, the merchant bravely bearing the anguish of the severe and trying operation.</p> 
               <p>Major Dutton now spoke with the Doctor, and earnestly inquired about his brother.</p> 
               <p>"It is barely possible, Sir, that he may get over it; but it will be several days before the crisis which will enable me to decide with certainty. Go and see him. I told him you had come, and he wishes to see you."</p> 
               <p>The Doctor, as he spoke, regarded Major Dutton with a peculiar and investigating glance, which did not escape the observation of Mortimer, while it surprised him. What could it mean? Why should he search his face so closely, as if he were a detective officer, and was regarding with suspicion the face before him?</p> 
               <p>"I will go and see my brother," said Major Dutton, "if this young gentleman can direct me to the minister's house."</p> 
               <p>"With pleasure," answered Mortimer; "it is my father's."</p> 
               <p>"So much the better!" answered Mr. Dutton, putting on his gloves."</p> 
               <p>"But you will stay to tea, brother Wylie!" exclaimed Mrs. Temple.</p> 
               <p>"No; have given you trouble enough already, sister," he answered coldly, "Is it possible you have not been to see him, nor to invite him to your house! Certainly he much more required attention than I did!"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Temple was dumb. Her brother spoke severely. She had not expected to hear him speak so kindly of his pennyless brother! She now almost wished that she had invited Richard. But little time was left her to think. Her rich brother was fairly going out of the house without his supper; and to visit even his poor brother!</p> 
               <p>"You'll come back, Wylie," she said, beseechingly. "I'll keep tea for you, and have a good fire in your room. Annie will make your tea and toast for you. You have no idea how handy she is."</p> 
               <p>"I dare say. I know she has given up her room to me, so that if I come back she will not be able to go to bed at all, as her room is within mine; and she will be a prisoner there in the morning (even if she manages to slip in at night) till I choose to get up. Yes, your daughter is an obliging person, and has good nature and amiability. But I cannot put upon these. I can not, merely to gratify a mother's pride in having a rich brother in her house, put her lovely daughter out of her room. I, therefore, Miss Annie, resign the premises fitted up for me with so much trouble and vanity again to you! I shall not come back to-night, but stay with my brother, or at the hotel!"</p> 
               <p>"Not come back!" almost screamed Mrs. Temple.</p> 
               <p>"No, sister! I have another reason for not occupying that room. By all the rights of nature and humanity it belongs to my poor brother, and you should have fitted it up for him, and not suffer him to be indebted to strangers in his misfortune for shelter. It would be sacrilege against filial piety for me, in health, to occupy the bed which should have been his! I had means to go and come and pay at pleasure. He was sick and poor, and you should have taken him in. But because you thought me rich, and that I might be of service to you, you have been guilty of a great crime against hospitality and your own soul. I have seen and understood all. I commend Miss Annie for her yielding her room to me, when I knew in her heart she wished that it had been prepared for her poorer uncle. She, in spite of the bad example you have set her, has no inordinate love of wealth, and has not hesitated to express, as I overheard by accident, her deeper interest in the poor uncle at the parsonage."</p> 
               <p>"I hope, brother, you are not angry. I did it for your honor! Your letter told me you was coming, and I tried to make all comfortable for you," answered Mrs. Temple, sobbing with mingled shame and anger, that he should expose her so before them all, and so severely.</p> 
               <p>"But you heard of the accident to my brother before you got my letter. I see how it is: if it had been your rich brother who had broken his ribs, you would not have let him be beholden to others, but would have had him here without delay. I detest flattery and fawning, and meanness, which is mingled with inhumanity. You must pardon me, Mr. Temple, but I could not let this occasion go by of rebuking my sister for her false pride and heartless vanity. I trust it will be a lesson to her. Come, young Sir," he added, addressing Mortimer; "I am now ready to go with you. Good night, Mr. Temple, I will call and see how you are after breakfast. Kiss me good-night, niece."</p> 
               <p>Annie, with half her dislike to her morose, rich uncle removed, offered her cheek to him quietly, and then grasping his sister's hand, said:</p> 
               <p>"You need not cry or be vexed! I see that it is not the brother you care for, but the money he is supposed to represent. If I had been Richard I should not have been here by your invitation."</p> 
               <p>"Forgive me, brother-oh, don't go away angry with me, brother Wylie," she sobbed, and clinging to him. "I do love you! I will send for Richard in the morning, if you say so-"</p> 
               <p>"If I say so! Your heart must say so."</p> 
               <p>"Well, my heart shall say so! I did not know you cared so much about him, or-"</p> 
               <p>"Cared about him! Perhaps not! Ask him; but no matter, I do not speak of my own works. Perhaps one of these days you will learn that Wylie Dutton has for twenty years been the sole supporter of his thriftless brother Richard, his wife and large helpless family. But it does not become me, and yet it does become me to say so! And why, you may know ere long. I am not angry. I pity you! I am sorry for you. I have seen how you put yourself out and lowered yourself, because you thought I had money. All this should have been done for my brother, who really needs your care. But I must go to him."</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head> 
               <p>Richard Dutton lay in his bed with his eyes wide open, but he saw not what was before him, but only imaginary shapes. The flowers on the paper appeared to him to be serpents, or fawns, or birds, or all together; and the full-blown roses wore the heads of lions; and circular ornaments in the border were living heads of people, with bright eyes looking at him. A stain on the wall seemed to him a sea with a wide horizon, and scratches upon it were ships and sloops and flying boats. The world of creative fancy had mingled with the actual, and out of things seen he created shapes supernatural and wild.</p> 
               <p>"I am becoming delirious, I fear," he said, starting and looking about restlessly, and rubbing, his eyes with the only hand he could use. "Let me count my pulse. It must be one hundred and twenty. The fever is on me. I am glad that I have made my will. My mind feels easier. Justice is done at last in all directions. What Heaven has given me I have given to those who come after me. Ah, how the room fills with singular-looking beings! There stands an Indian chief sternly looking at me, yet I know it is only a cloak hanging from a peg; nevertheless, I see every feature, and the expression of the painted face. I wonder if the Doctor told my brother to come to me. I must see him. I cannot die without freeing myself from-"</p> 
               <p>The door softly opened. The idiot who had seemed to be asleep by the hearth rose and confronted the person with the air of one who keeps guard. When he saw Mortimer, he took his hand, and pressed it to his great, loose lips, and smiled with delight.</p> 
               <p>"Joe glad you came. Gentlemen, all time, talk to the debble, and nothin' nowhere! Say Indian, in room. Scare poor Joe."</p> 
               <p>"He will not harm you."</p> 
               <p>"Joe remembers you tell nobody hurt good people. Joe is good people. Joe don't tell lie-steal pig; and play Sabba' day. Joe good! Joe hurt nobody."</p> 
               <p>Mortimer said:</p> 
               <p>"I know you are. I wish all men were as innocent of harm. Go now and lie down and sleep till morning. You need not stay. They'll show you where to sleep."</p> 
               <p>And he gently put the idiot out of the room.</p> 
               <p>Major Dutton had entered it with Mortimer. He removed his hat and drew near the bed. The eyes of his brother were fixed upon him<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6857-00000032"/> with an eager, startled stare, and he muttered:</p> 
               <p>"And there is my brother. He looks as if he were alone. Yet I know it is only his shape, like all these."</p> 
               <p>"He raves," said Mr. Dutton aside to Mortimer. "Poor man! Brother!"</p> 
               <p>"What-can shapes speak? Can apparel take such likeness to flesh and blood?"</p> 
               <p>"Dear brother, don't you know me?" asked the other, deeply moved; and drawing near he grasped him by the hand. "See, it is me. I am no dream?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I know it now. I am rejoiced to see you, brother. I am a little flighty. Everything seems to live in the room, and I fancied that you were but a freak of my fevered brain's conception. When did you arrive?"</p> 
               <p>"This afternoon. I am very sorry to hear how you have been hurt. As soon as the news came to me I hastened to you."</p> 
               <p>"I doubt it not. I know you would not neglect me," he said, his mind evidently all clear again.</p> 
               <p>"How could I, brother? Do I not owe everything to you?"</p> 
               <p>"Don't speak of it. But let me see you alone; you can tell why, since you see me thus. Providence has put a strange termination to our plan."</p> 
               <p>"It is indeed strange."</p> 
               <p>"I will leave you together," said Mortimer. "If you need anything, please knock, Sir, with this stick upon the floor, and my father or I will at once come up."</p> 
               <p>Mortimer then left the room and joined the family-circle which he had scarcely mingled at all with since his return home from college the day previous; so busy had he been with the series of events which had, in such rapid succession, transpired, absorbing all his time and attention.</p> 
               <p>Seated now at the late tea-table with his father, and sister, and the younger ones of the pastor's large family, the incidents of the day naturally presented interesting subjects of conversation. Arley would have said much about the young noble, but she feared that her brother or her father would smile; for the old gentleman was not so aged as not to retain some scintillations of humor, and he sometimes loved to rally young people. The presence of the two brothers in the house and the extraordinary conduct of Mrs. Templeton were alluded to, but not with any idle gossip; for evil of any one was never spoken at that table, which thrice a day was consecrated with all thereupon by a blessing. Mortimer was not the one to repeat any disagreeable scenes to other ears, and he scarcely alluded to the conversation which he had heard at Mrs. Temple's. He merely remarked that Mrs. Temple appeared much disappointed at her brother's resolution to pass the night with the invalid, but forbore to present her in her true colors to his family.</p> 
               <p>The supper was a frugal meal of baker's bread, cut into slices and eaten with apples nicely baked in molasses, with a tumbler of milk all around. And when the children were put to bed, having first said their prayers either to Arley or at their father's knee, Mortimer, his sister, and the reverend Doctor, got together by the glowing autumnal fireside, and began to discourse of the prospects before them. The shining fire lighted up the barely-furnished sitting-room, with its threadworn carpet, twenty years old or more, and plain chairs, wooden bookshelves, and uncurtained windows-for they were very poor, the people at the parsonage, but it was respectable poverty, and withal a sort of holy poverty. It never got in debt, nor lived above its means, nor aped expense or show. If the minister's coat had a patch in it, he wore it with the same grace and dignity as in the old times when it was new.</p> 
               <p>"Now, dear father," said Mortimer, "let us talk a few minutes about our affairs, while Major Dutton remains with his brother. I no sooner got your letter, sister, than I hastened home. It was a great sacrifice to leave college, but let it not be mentioned any more. I have alluded to it for the last time, to prevent you both <choice>
                     <sic>fron</sic>
                     <corr>from</corr>
                  </choice> saying anything about it. Next week, father, I shall go up to Boston. I met in town to day a merchant, who says that the large firm of H. Rice &amp; Co. need a clerk from the country who knows country-merchants. He writes him to obtain one from this county to bring its custom to him. I at once offered myself for the position; for you know, dear, father, I am well acquainted with everybody."</p> 
               <p>"Did you accept the place, my son?" asked his venerable father, who was smoking his evening pipe, and meditating.</p> 
               <p>"Not without referring to you, dear father. Mr. Ingraham, the merchant I allude to, kindly says he will keep the place for me until I speak to you about it. The salary is one thousand dollars the first year, and to be increased if satisfaction is given. Mr. Ingraham had it view for his own son, who, however, has accepted a supercargoship in a vessel bound to Vera Cruz, consigned to Belden &amp; Co. With your permission. I will take it. I can live on four hundred a year, and the rest will be such a blessing to you and sister and the children. Why, it will bring your salary, father, up to one thousand dollars."</p> 
               <p>The reverend pastor sighed! Was it because he felt that this surplus ought to be made up by his people, instead of by the labor of his son?</p> 
                
               <p>"Go, my son! Go, and God bless you and prosper. For the children's sake, I rejoice in your good fortune. But you must not when you get to Boston stint yourself too closely. We can get along with much less."</p> 
               <p>"You shall not have one dollar less," answered Mortimer, smiling. "I have heard of Henry Rice as one of the most enterprising merchants of Boston. If I am faithful, I shall rise; and who knows but that by-and-by I may get to be junior-partner. Mr. Baker, his 'Co.', was once his clerk, Mr. Ingraham tells me."</p> 
               <p>Arly pressed her brother's hand, and tears of delight were in her deep-blue eyes. She felt her heart overflowing with gratitude to God for this good prospect for her father. It seemed to be singularly providential. Her father could now have comforts in his old age, and the children enough to eat and wear. Of herself, the noble girl never once thought.</p> 
               <p>"We shall be so happy; and you will, too, to be able to make 'pa happy!" she said, in a low tone, tremulous with emotion.</p> 
               <p>"I shall be as strong as a lion and as cheerful as a lark at my work, Arly," answered Mortimer, with animation lighting up his fine countenance.</p> 
               <p>"And how happy Annie will be!" whispered Arly.</p> 
               <p>"Dear Annie knows nothing of it yet. I did not tell until I had got your consent, dear father. To-morrow I will let her know my good fortune."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps in two years you may be married," said Arly, with a smile.</p> 
               <p>"Not so soon hardly; perhaps in three or four; but I must make you all here comfortable first. Annie and I can wait. True love never grows cold or old. It is like the sun, new every morning as at its first rising in the day of creation. But we will make happy the day by corresponding. Letters are so delightful. They almost compensate for <choice>
                     <sic>adsence</sic>
                     <corr>absence</corr>
                  </choice>. I can realize the feelings of the lover who said, 'It was a pleasure to be absent from his betrothed once in a while, to receive such sweet letters of love and devotion as she wrote him.' So letters will help us pass the time."</p> 
               <p>Dr. Willett sat smoking, but his eyes rested with benign happiness upon his son and daughter. He enjoyed their pleasure, and inwardly prayed for blessings upon their youthful heads.</p> 
               <p>The conversation now became more personal and particular in reference to their plans. Arley began to calculate how many shirts, and cravats, and kerchiefs, and socks, etc., etc., he would want in his trunk, and told him she would see that all his things were ready, and nice enough for Boston, by Monday. Dr. Willett remembered two or three old gentlemen in Boston, who were in college with him fifty years ago, and he would pen a letter introducing his son to each of them.</p> 
               <p>So they sat up and talked until late in the night, quite forgetting the sick man and his brother.</p> 
               <p>"Come, children, it is past midnight. Let us retire," said the father and priest of the house.</p> 
               <p>Arley laid the Bible on the table, and Mortimer, at a sign from his father, read a portion of a chapter. Arley then raised the tune of the usual evening-hymn, in a sweet, melodious voice, Mortimer joining in. They then kneeled around the little table, and the gray-haired sire lifted up his hands in prayer and thanksgiving to God.</p> 
               <p>A few minutes' silence, and rising, they kissed one another, with affection, and separated, Arly accompanying her father to the door, and once more kissing him "good-night", then seeking her own chamber; while Mortimer softly approached the room of the invalid. Softly he opened the door. A candle burned low in the fireplace. A dim and mystic obscurity, neither light nor darkness, prevailed in the chamber. The invalid lay upon his bed, with his hands clasped together, his eyes open and stony, staring into space.</p> 
               <p>The other brother-where was he? Gone!</p> 
               <p>Mortimer, with a painful misgiving and awe, took up the candle and approached the bed. The coverlid no longer heaved with breathing life beneath! The face was fixed and rigid! He laid his hand upon the wrist; it was pulseless, yet warm! He touched the brow, but there was no elasticity of the flesh! It was the brow of one dead!</p> 
               <p>Mortimer shrunk back. He could not realize the truth.</p> 
               <p>"Dead! Can it be? So suddenly! Three hours ago, feverish with delirium! The flesh is yet warm, with the fever-heat yet lingering. He cannot have long expired! Where is his brother? Could he have been here when he died? If so, why did he not give information? Why did he depart so silently? There is a mystery about this!"</p> 
               <p>These were the thoughts and reflections which quickly followed each other through the mind of the amazed young man. His first impulse, which he did not obey, was to call his sister, for he did not wish to disturb his aged father. But, on reflection, he resolved to let her sleep also. Satisfying himself that he was indeed dead, he locked the door, and stole softly away out of the house. In that old time day, there were watchmen of the night, who guarded against fire and rogues while men slept. Every half-hour their sonorous cry, "All's well-half-past<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6857-00000033"/> one o'clock in the morning" (or whatever hour it was), could be heard far or near, awaking not unpleasantly the half-sleeper, and assuring the wakeful that the guardians of the village were vigilant in their office.</p> 
               <p>"Twelve o'clock, and all's well-and-a-close-dry-morning" had broken upon the stillness of the chamber of the dead as he was deliberating what to do in this painful emergency; and it was the sound that suggested to him his proper course, and led him to lock the room and leave the dead man alone.</p> 
               <p>Upon reaching the street, he beheld the dark outline of the form of the watchman receding down the street. He ran after him, and as he drew near, the man, hearing his quick tread, turned and raised his club, as if expecting an enemy.</p> 
               <p>"It is I, Captain Day," said Mortimer, who recognized a stout citizen in the shoe-making business, who had often patched his boots; but who, for a dollar, chose to turn day into night, and sleep over his lapstone of a morning.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, what! How? Ain't that young Mr. Willett?" he answered, dropping his baton, and advancing with the discreet caution of true courage, which never risks itself individually when it is necessary to preserve itself for the public good.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Captain Day. I have come to tell you that one of the men who was injured in the accident, and whom my father brought to the house, is dead!"</p> 
               <p>"You don't say so, Mr. Mortimer! Dead? Bless my soul, that's a wonder! How awful!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Captain, he died to-night-not long ago. I want your aid to lay him out, as I do not wish to disturb the house-for you know my father and sister would be of no service; so I let them sleep, and have come out to ask you to find one or two persons, and bring them quietly to the personage."</p> 
               <p>"That I can do, and at once," he answered, with readiness.</p> 
               <p>"By the way, have you seen anybody?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; a man passed along an hour ago. I saw him close. He looked like a stranger. Do you know who it was; for I wonder who it could be out so late? I was kind o' suspicious on him."</p> 
               <p>Captain Day suspected every man as being a rogue who was out after curfew-bell at nine o'clock.</p> 
               <p>Mortimer returned softly to the house and waited at the gate for the succor he had sent for to arrive. The full moon was shining from her midnight-throne in radiant splendor upon the river and town and hills. The stars sparkled like <choice>
                     <sic>the the</sic>
                     <corr>the</corr>
                  </choice> crowns of angels enthroned in sight of human eyes.</p> 
               <p>Mortimer leaned upon the gate and gazed upon the scene before him with interest, familiar as it was to him from childhood. A sloop, with her broad white mainsail, entered the scene by doubling a point of the river, and slowly ascending the river past the town; the creak of her boom reaching distinctly his ears as she jibbed to catch the wind as the curving shore compelled her to alter her course.</p> 
               <p>Gradually the thoughts of Mortimer fell into the channel which the recent events naturally shaped for them. He reviewed the incidents of the day and night. He thought about the brothers-their meeting-the death of one and the silent and mysterious departure of the other. He wondered if the death took place before the latter left-or-</p> 
               <p>But, instead of exploring our way through his doubts and unanswered questions with himself, let us find the facts by going back to the chamber of Richard Dutton, and remaining an invisible listener to what passed while the Doctor and the clergyman were, at his request, left alone with him.</p> 
               <p>When the Rev. Doctor had closed the door, and all was still, Mr. Dutton for a few moments remained silent, as if not knowing exactly how to begin to say what was his purpose to make known to them. The two gentlemen stood observing him, and waiting.</p> 
               <p>"Pen and paper, Sir, if you please," he said, suddenly.</p> 
               <p>Dr. Willett placed both upon a stand by him. The invalid, at length, spoke in a perfectly natural manner, as follows:</p> 
               <p>"Gentlemen, my dear sirs and friends, I am a dying man. I feel at my heart death's approaches. I desire to square myself with the world, and then with Heaven. One of you will write for me?"</p> 
               <p>The clergyman took the pen, and Mr. Dutton continued:</p> 
               <p>"My name is Wylie Dutton. I am-"</p> 
               <p>"'Wylie!' I understood 'Richard'," interrupted Dr. Willett. "Are you right?" for the clergyman believed he was wandering.</p> 
               <p>"Yes; Wylie Dutton is my name. Write as I dictate, if you please, for words are difficult. Have you written? Well, go on, and say:"</p> 
               <p>"Of Roxbury, near Boston, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, bachelor; and being of sound mind and clear head, I <unclear>desire</unclear> to make this my last will and testament, revoking all others prior to this day and date. First commending my soul to God, and asking forgiveness through His Son for all my sins, I profess myself living and dying a Christian man. Have you that all down, Sir?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes," answered the minister; "and I have with pleasure written it."</p> 
                
               <p>"I give and bequeath my house and grounds, and all appertaining thereto in Roxbury, valued at forty-two thousand dollars, to my brother, Richard Dutton, for his own proper use, and for his heirs forever. Is that written, Sir?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes," answered Dr. Willett, surprised and doubting; for he now believed, more than ever, that the sick man's mind wandered; and that the poor brother, in his fancy, conceived himself to be the rich brother.</p> 
               <p>"Good. At last Richard will have a home, and his wife and daughters be comfortable. I have let them suffer to this time; but now they shall begin to live. Richard has learned the value of property by the want of it, and he will keep it."</p> 
               <p>For a moment or two he paused, as if suffering, but went on again.</p> 
               <p>"As a house is of little worth without means to live, I give and bequeath to my said brother Richard eight thousand dollars, ready money, in Suffolk Bank, Boston; and fifty-three thousand dollars stock, in said bank. Write it, Sir."</p> 
               <p>The minister looked significantly at the physician, who whispered:</p> 
               <p>"He is not out of his head at all. You had best go on."</p> 
               <p>"That will do for Richard. How much is it I gave him in all?"</p> 
               <p>"One hundred thousand dollars," replied Doctor Page, taking snuff enormously.</p> 
               <p>"That is right. You two gentlemen are to be witnesses of this. I detest lawyers-never consulted one in my life. This will is good in law, and you will see it duly probated, as my executors.</p> 
               <p>Dr. Willett looked at Doctor Page, and touched his forehead.</p> 
               <p>"He is not worth a dollar, Doctor. He could not pay at the inn. He said he was poor. He has a rich brother, who is now the guest of his sister, Mrs. Paul Temple; and he fancies himself that gentleman."</p> 
               <p>"This is strange," sniffed Dr. Page; "for his mind is clear, his reason sound."</p> 
               <p>"I fear not. If this were his brother lying here, and bequeathing such vast sums, I should not marvel, for he is reputed vastly rich; but this man, I am assured, has always been penniless-a teacher, a wanderer for his bread, and wholly dependent upon his rich brother for the house he lived in, and the clothes his family wore."</p> 
               <p>"Indeed!" ejaculated the physician, in the same undertone with which the above was spoken. "This puts a new aspect on the case. It is possible he may be out of his head, then."</p> 
               <p>"Reverend Sir," interrupted the invalid, with some impatience; "will you oblige me by writing?"</p> 
               <p>"By all means," answered Dr. Willett, and resumed the pen.</p> 
               <p>"I give and bequeath to my niece, Annie Temple, daughter of my sister Martha and Paul Temple, late merchant, forty thousand dollars, which I have in money and bank-stock in the Cohasset Bank; the amount to be paid to her order on the day of her wedding. I make this bequest, partly because I see she is an amiable and sensible person, and visited me, though she believed me poor and destitute; and partly to reward Mr. Mortimer Willett for his kindness and benevolence, sitting up with me all night, and bringing me to this house; for, as he is to marry her, as he told me discoursing of her and her virtues, in the night watches, it will be as if I had bequeathed it upon the estimable young man. Is this written, Sir?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Sir," answered Doctor Willett, with increasing marvel, and in doubt still whether it were the real Wylie Dutton thus devising in such a princely way, or the poor Richard in a sort of delirium, in which he fancied himself his brother. The doubts went strongly to support the latter opinion. He wrote, therefore, not so much like one who recorded seriously what was dictated, as from a disposition to humor the <choice>

               <p>"To Paul Temple, who is an honest but unfortunate man, I give and bequeath the interest of twenty thousand dollars, which I have deposited in the Tri-Mountain Bank, payable quarterly to him; the principal, after his death, to go to the Hospital for the Insane. To my sister I bequeath one dollar, in remembrance of the time when I was a poor young man, and she was well-married, and I needed this sum to pay for three meals, which she refused to lend me, or invite me to her house. Thus I punish her avarice and want of sisterly affection, then and now, in refusing to see me, supposing me to be her poor brother Richard, or to let me in her house, dying man as I am. Twenty-eight years has not changed her or made her any wiser. I bequeath her one dollar! I hope you have written it all down as I say!"</p> 
               <p>"Word for word," answered the perplexed clergyman.</p> 
               <p>"It is well. All my other property, not named in this will, of whatever sort, I devise to erect a charity-hospital for strangers in the city of Boston. This is all?"</p> 
               <p>The clergyman ended the writing; and, at his request, read it over to him.</p> 
               <p>"That is correct. I thank you. Now add that I appoint you two gentlemen as my executors, giving your full names."</p> 
               <p>This was also done. The dying man, with a sigh of relief, fell back upon his pillow, seemingly exhausted.</p> 
               <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6857-00000034"/> 
               <p>"Gentlemen," at length said the bequestor; "I am now easier. Give me the pen. Bear witness that I sign this."</p> 
               <p>And he wrote, with a singularly bold hand, "Wylie Dutton", beneath.</p> 
               <p>The two gentlemen appended their signatures as witnesses.</p> 
               <p>Was it a real and bona fide will, dear reader? or only an imaginary one dictated by the poor brain of Richard Dutton?</p> 
               <p>"I thank you, gentlemen!" said the testator; "I hope you will take care of the will. I have made others, but this alone I will to stand. In due time, if I die, as I fear I shall, make known to my niece and brother, who I hear is at Mr. Temple's, what has been done. Send for him to come and see me at once. Now, gentlemen, keep secret what has passed while I am alive. Come, Doctor, I will sleep. Give me my medicine, boy."</p> 
               <p>This command was directed to Joe, who in a moment was by his side with the potion. After a little, the Doctor, who with Mr. Willett had bound themselves to secrecy about the will, left him, seeing he was inclined to sleep, but giving directions as to his treatment through the night, to Doctor Willett. The latter accompanied him to the hall.</p> 
               <p>"What do you think?" then asked the clergyman. "Is this man Wylie Dutton?"</p> 
               <p>"In my opinion, yes," answered Dr. Page.</p> 
               <p>"It so, it is all very strange. He certainly called himself Richard, and the other calls himself Wylie. As such he arrived here in a stylish phaeton, and is entertained at Mrs. Temple's. She ought to know her brother!"</p> 
               <p>"Has Mrs. Temple been to see this one?"</p> 
               <p>"No, Doctor. She is hardly like to leave a rich brother, if you know anything of her, to visit a sick one-a sensible woman enough, but a very foolish one at times!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes! yes!" sniffed the medical man. "But to-morrow will reveal all about the matter. It is barely possible my patient has been willing away his brother's money in a delusive state of his mind, when men often imagine themselves rich."</p> 
               <p>"That is my opinion, Doctor. The will is all a fiction of the poor man."</p> 
               <p>After some further conversation, in which he expressed his hope that the patient would sleep all night, and advising Doctor Willett to leave him to his rest, only going in occasionally, Doctor Page took up his hat and cane to go, when Mortimer came in with the message for him to go and see poor Mr. Temple. Doctor Willett expressed his sympathy, and would also have gone; but Mortimer assured him that the ankle was only dislocated. "And, besides, dear father, who will be near Mr. Dutton? One of us must stay."</p> 
               <p>We have already seen the physician reach the abode of the Temples, and his departure after setting the ankle, followed soon after ward by Mortimer and Major Dutton, whose desire to visit his brother we have already permitted our readers to witness. Upon reaching the parsonage, we have seen the well brother enter the room of the sick brother; and, after a while, at the request of the latter, he is left alone with him. Mortimer and his father and sister go down to tea and discuss afterward his plans and hopes for the future, which, as we have seen, had a rosy morning-sky for the sun of his prosperity to rise in. Then we saw him bid the venerable pastor and his fair sister, good-night; and, seeing them retire to their rooms, he sought the chamber where he had left the two brothers together two and a half hours before.</p> 
               <p>We have beheld his horror at beholding the invalid a corpse, yet warm with the lingering fires of fever, and no living soul in the room; for Joe had previously been sent by Mortimer to his bed over the kitchen.</p> 
               <p>We have seen Mortimer's perplexity relieved by hearing the call of the watchman whom he sent for aid to lay out the dead man; and, while he is waiting at the gate in front of the parsonage for him, musing upon what had passed and star-gazing, we have taken the opportunity to go back and bring up what transpired in the sick-room while the physician and clergyman were left alone with the invalid at his solicitation.</p> 
               <p>Our story, therefore, ought hence to go smoothly on; but the reader will, doubtless, desire to know also what transpired between the two brothers when left together, and why the living one went away so quietly, and whether he did so before or after his brother's death? Such curiosity being very natural, and the gratification of it being quite necessary to the development and full understanding of our tale, we now proceed to gratify it.</p> 
               <p>After the door had closed upon the two brothers, the one who was the guest of Mrs. Temple satisfying himself that it was securely fastened, and that no person was concealed in the room, took a chair, and sat by the pillow of his brother. For a few moments no word was spoken.</p> 
               <p>"This is a sad mishap, Richard," said the sick man, at length. "I fear it will be the end of me!"</p> 
               <p>"I was very much surprised to learn that you were one of those hurt, Brother Wylie, in the stage, the wreck of which I passed in the steep street in Gardiner. They told me one man had been killed-a Mr. Hall, whom I well knew as a depositor in our bank; and that two passengers were hurt-one very badly. Little did I dream it was you until so informed at Mr. Temple's, when I at once hastened to come to you."</p> 
                
               <p>"A bad ending to our little plot. I fear Providence has frowned up it, and so brought me up in this way! It has been on my conscience, and I was half of a mind to give my own name at the inn, and so out with it; but, for your sake, as it would make against you as if you were an impostor, I kept silence, and played the 'poor brother'!"</p> 
               <p>This last was said with a slight smile, which, however, pain greatly qualified. After a twinge or two he went on and said:</p> 
               <p>"So they brought me here, believing me to be poor-these good kind people. But the noble young man had sat up with me all night at the inn, and never had a suffering man such a nurse! He anticipated everything I wanted. He was constantly vigilant; and his hand and voice were as gentle as a woman's. I never beheld so fine a young man. If he had known me to be rich (for he is poor, being the minister's son). I should not have wondered at his devotion to me; but he believed me to be so in need that he offered me his own purse! During the night I asked him a good many questions about my sister. I got his confidence. I learned he was engaged to Annie Temple, Martha's daughter. He told me a great deal, as I drew him out. He made me love my niece for his sake, so warmly he spoke in her praise. I got from him his engagement, his poverty, his plans to support his father, and, by-and-by, a wife. He tried to conceal my sister's faults; but I saw enough from what he would not say, what he would have said if he had been a gossip; and I knew she had no more heart at forty-nine than she had at nineteen, when she scorned us both, poor boys, because she had married a man who had some money. All that is changed now. I wonder she ever had the face to write to me to help her husband with eight thousand dollars, when she once actually told one of her former fashionable friends, when asked if you and I were related to her (from the name), that we were not!"</p> 
               <p>"You were right, therefore, in writing to try her, brother, to see what she was of, now that misfortune had or ought to have humbled her."</p> 
               <p>"I thought so when we framed this little deception in Roxbury; but now, with death staring me in the face, I behold nothing so terrible as Truth, whom, I fear, I have offended."</p> 
               <p>"Your motive was a good one, Wylie. Were I lying there, and certain I was to die, I would not repent the part I have played, at your request, in the affair."</p> 
               <p>The invalid groaned with some sudden paroxysm of suffering, and was silent.</p> 
               <p>Wylie Dutton had been a poor boy, and had enriched himself by honest industry and integrity. When the poor widow, his mother, died, and left three boys and one daughter, orphans, one of them was taken and sent to school by a charitable lady to make a minister of him; and the other (Wylie) ran off to sea at fifteen, to escape apprenticeship to an old druggist who had the reputation of starving his boys, and putting medicines into their bread and butter to lessen their appetites. From a sailor-boy Wylie rose to be a mate, made some rich ventures in far lands, and, coming home with a bagful of gold, he was taken in as a junior partner in the firm that owned the ship; and from that day his riches increased, and prosperity attended all his speculations. Martha, the daughter, was educated in part by the minister, and then taught school; and, being handsome and lively, took the susceptible heart of young Paul Temple, then just set up in a thriving business, and was married to him. By-and-by, Mr. Temple moved down into Maine, and there grew rich apace-but too fast; for he, one cloudy morning, awoke to find himself bankrupt, the pride of his wife fallen, and the sole daughter of his house cut off from all inheritance but that of poverty.</p> 
               <p>It was in these troubles that Mrs. Temple wrote letter after letter to her rich brother (forgetting how she had refused the sailor-boy a dollar in her prosperity) to aid her husband. He replied to but one of them in a moneyless letter, full of good advice and reproofs for bad management.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Temple was rightly served. The fruit will always prove to be that which the sower hath sowed. She could not have expected to reap anything but what she did from that withholden dollar. Moreover, she was rightly served; because, a few years before, when the poor brother Richard wrote to her to help him and his large family, she refused to send him anything, although at the time rich and able to help him. When, therefore, she called for help, it was justly denied her. If we would receive good at the hands of others, we must do good ourselves to others. Meanness, avarice, and stinginess find their own lashes in this world; and all Mrs. Temples will find like treatment from the world.</p> 
               <p>Richard Dutton, we have said, was educated-that is, he was sent to college; but the second year, as he proved a dull scholar, the old lady, his patron, withdrew supplies, and Richard, half Greekized and Latinized, was compelled to leave college; and, without trade or calling that could benefit him, he was compelled to take the alteration in such cases chosen by poor scholars (poor scholars, alas! in more senses than one)-which is, to find a school. So he began life a poor teacher, married a poor girl (one of his pupils) for her beauty and virtues, and lived on shiftlessly<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6857-00000035"/> ly from year to year, his wife bringing him a new pupil annually, but one more expensive than profitable. At length, sickness, misfortune, inability to get employment, brought him so low and destitute in his two wretched hired rooms in Bolston alley, that his wife resolved in person to apply to her husband's rich brother, of whom he had in vain, by letter, sought for aid. In brief, the helpless and lovely wife, pale and interesting in her lowliness and poverty, modest, and with a touching story on her lips, prevailed. From that day, Wylie generously settled five hundred a year upon the wife. He was too prudent a man to give it to his brother, as he wished to leave him what he called "a margin to do all he could for himself".</p> 
               <p>Thus the family were removed from want. The children grew up <choice>
                     <sic>obdedient</sic>
                     <corr>obedient</corr>
                  </choice> and industrious; and, at the period of our story, there were eight poor boys and four girls. Two of the boys were learning to be printers in the Galaxy office through the kindness of Mr. Buckingham, the editor, who had been in college with their thriftless father. The eldest son had gone to tea, and the eldest daughter (Mary Dutton, a treasure in herself) was assisting to clothe the children and keep everything neat and tidy about the house; for they had been some years living in a rent dwelling belonging to Wylie on Roxbury street, a little back from the sidewalk, which he let them have free of rent. Richard, in the meanwhile, taught when he could, assisted where teachers were sick or wished to be absent, did a little bookkeeping or filling of papers for the grocer on the corner, and other such jobs as he could find, and all this suited his idle and listless temperament; for though not a dissipated or vicious man, Richard Dutton was one of that class of clever, good-for-nothing men who are never able to take care of themselves, and who are fortunate if they have capable wives or relations to lean upon.</p> 
               <p>The brothers rarely met Wylie was never once in his house. He passed the children in the street without knowing them. Yet he was not indifferent to the welfare of the family. He kept them in his mind, and, by indirect inquiries, found that they were respectable and industrious, and worthy of all he had done. So he was satisfied, and took no further thought of the matter.</p> 
               <p>At length, one day, shortly before the opening of our story, as he was coming out of town in his buggy, his horse, affrighted by a drum and fife, turned round so suddenly in the shafts, as to overturn the vehicle, and throw him out at the very gate of the abode of his brother. For a moment he was confused, and his first consciousness was in recognizing a woman's hand in his striving to raise him to his feet. He at once recovered his senses, and, rising with the aid, looked and saw that his assistant was a young girl, who expressed the deepest sympathy and anxiety.</p> 
               <p>"I hope you are not hurt, Sir?" she said, in a sincere voice.</p> 
               <p>"No Miss-thank you-I believe I am all sound! It was like to have been serious! Ah, I see a lad has my horse. Here, my good little fellow, unharness him and lead him to that next livery-stable, and ask them to send a man for the buggy. Tell them it is Major Dutton's horse. And what is your name, Miss?"</p> 
               <p>"Mary Dutton, Sir."</p> 
               <p>"What-not Richard's daughter?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Sir," she answered, modestly now, knowing that it was her rich uncle.</p> 
               <p>"Bless me! you are a fine girl-and I believe as good as you are pretty! What boy is that?"</p> 
               <p>"My brother."</p> 
               <p>"I thought so by the likeness to you. And here comes your mother to see who is hurt! Nobody but me, Ma'am," he called, cheerily: for the rich man was full of thankfulness and joy at his escape, and his feelings shone in his face, and were expressed in his tones. "Glad to see you, Mrs. Dutton," he said, but without offering his hand to her. "Like to have met with an accident at your gate. Your daughter and son were looking at the soldiers, I dare say, and happened here in good time. You have fine children," he added, looking at three or four little ones that stood about her. "I have not seen you for a long time. Time deals fairly with you. Richard ought to be proud of his wife and children. Where is he?"</p> 
               <p>"He has gone to-day to assist in the Boylston school, as Mr. Dillworth is sick."</p> 
               <p>"Glad he has something to do?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Sir. He wishes to be employed all the time, Sir; but there are so many younger men that fill all the places."</p> 
               <p>"I dare say! But it is getting late. I must get another gig at the stable. What does that boy do who is so skillfully taking my horse out?"</p> 
               <p>"He is a printer, Sir."</p> 
               <p>"What is his name?"</p> 
               <p>"Wyhe, Sir."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, that is it, is it? Well, I must keep my eye on him that he don't disgrace me."</p> 
               <p>"He'll be sure not to do that, Sir, I am sure," answered Mrs. Dutton, with maternal pride.</p> 
               <p>"If he takes after you, I shall not fear. Good evening, Ma'am. Good-bye, little ones! And as for you, young lady, don't forget your batchelor-uncle, who will never forget that you were so kind as to try and lift him up. Have you got a lover?</p> 
                
               <p>Mary dropped her eyes and blushed so beautifully, that he said with a smile:</p> 
               <p>"I need not ask. Your cheeks tell the story."</p> 
               <p>He was about walking away when Mrs. Dutton hastened after him, and said something, when he turned round and said, almost angrily: "Don't thank me-I hate to be thanked. Tell your husband to come out and see me Saturday-morning, at eight o'clock. I will be at home for him." And he shook her hand kindly.</p> 
               <p>When he had gone out of sight, Mrs. Dutton clasped her hands, and with smiles said to Mary:</p> 
               <p>"This is a providential thing, I feel! I am so glad he has seen you and my children. He would never have come of himself, he is so eccentric. But he is a kind and good man with all his roughness."</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER X.</head> 
               <p>The morning appointed, Richard Dutton, wondering why his brother should send for him, was true to the hour; and, was ushered into his rich brother's presence, bowing low, hat in hand, with all the air of a "poor relation".</p> 
               <p>"Sit down, Richard," said the rich man, with an air of condescension, meant to be friendly.</p> 
               <p>Richard took a distant chair, and set his hat upon the floor.</p> 
               <p>"Have you breakfasted, brother?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh yes; quite so-oh yes!" answered the embarassed schoolmaster. "We breakfast early at my house. My wife is a notable housekeeper."</p> 
               <p>"Yes; I think so. My banker tells me she has drawn for nine years only three hundred and fifty a year of the five hundred I put annually to her credit."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Jane is frugal. She saves. She tries to live as if she hadn't the money in bank-works just as hard, and makes everything tell toward economy."</p> 
               <p>"I am glad to hear it. You are a fortunate man, Richard, to have such a good wife; and then your children are handsome and bright enough for a king's household. You know how I happened to see 'em all?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; wife told me when I came home. I am glad you were not hurt."</p> 
               <p>"I sprang out as I saw the gig going over. As it was, I was whisked about like a top half-a-dozen times before I struck the pavement; and while I was wondering where I was, I felt your daughter's hand in mine, and her voice of compassion, as she tried to raise me. Fine girls! fine boys!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, brother; I hope so, I trust so."</p> 
               <p>There was a moment's silence which followed. Richard, the poor brother, seemed to be waiting to be addressed. There they sat, the two grown men of forty-four and forty-seven, both gray-headed; both heavy, stout, and rather coarse-looking men. The rich man's face shrewder and more careworn than his brother's, who looked like a man who let nothing trouble him. Yet the brothers looked very much like each other. Indeed, Richard had been thrice taken for his brother (wearing his brother's old coat which had been given him), and once a man insisted on paying him seven hundred dollars on the street to take up his note. It was with difficulty Richard convinced him that he had not loaned him seven hundred dollars, never having had that sum in his life at once.</p> 
               <p>"Richard, I have always been sorry you had no talent for making money," said Wylie. "A man who has a family ought to be able to support 'em."</p> 
               <p>"I know it, brother; but it is just my luck. Nothing ever succeeded with me. You were born with a gold spoon in your mouth, and I a pewter."</p> 
               <p>"Not a bit of it! A man makes himself There is no such thing as luck. Hard work and an eye to the main chance-that is the way I got along. But we are too old now to talk of these things. If you lived to be a hundred, you would be just as poor as you are now. I have sent for you to say that I have decided that your family need something more to get along than they have. I like your wife and your children. You may be proud of them. I wish to put you in a way to make them comfortable. I have recently purchased of Mr. Bingham, the great land-proprietor, several thousand acres near the sources of Sandy River, in Maine, which empties into the Kennebec. There are two lumber-camps upon it, and a road passes through it toward Canada. I wish you to become my agent, and reside there. There is a good house near the Falls, and my men are putting up a sawmill. You are a good surveyor. I want you to lay off a town about the Falls, and I will throw the lots into market; for there is a growing demand for Maine land. You have it in your power to make your fortune there."</p> 
               <p>Richard Dutton was deeply moved by this new proof of his brother's regard for him and his family; and tears came into his eyes. The terms of the agency were soon settled, and Richard saw before him a future of happiness for his wife and children."</p> 
               <p>"Next week, I intend to go down to see my lands, and I wish you to go with me; and I can then tell you what I wish you to do. Go alone at first, and, after everything is comfortable, come back for your wife and children. The city is a bad place to raise children. Yours will be happier and healthier<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6857-00000036"/> there, and of great service to you; and as each gets married, I dare say you can portion off a farm for them; and when you are threescore and ten, be surrounded with a colony of your own flesh and blood."</p> 
               <p>The rich bachelor pleasantly smiled at this picture he was drawing for his brother, who seemed to become a new man with the hopes which shone so brightly before him. He would have thanked his brother with emotion; but he said:</p> 
               <p>"No, no! That will do! I am only doing my duty. I am rich enough. I find that, after a certain sum, wealth is a trouble, and it becomes the possessor's master. The love of money is like that of liquor, Richard. It grows upon a man; until, by-and-by, when he would stop and enjoy it, he has it no longer in his power; and he must make money or die. Habit is ten times stronger than nature. Don't thank me. I wish to stop getting rich. I have got a soul, and I am sometimes strangely troubled about it. I tremble at the words, 'How hardly shall a rich man enter the kingdom of heaven!'-words that I often, of late, think upon; and sometimes I think my soul of more value than all I possess, and I feel like giving away everything, so that I can get to heaven by-and-by."</p> 
               <p>"Sister would be glad, if I may venture to suggest, brother, to have some aid from you. I am told she is very poor."</p> 
               <p>"And deservedly so; for, when she had means, she was the soul of avarice. I can never forget the time when I went to her to lend me a dollar. I had just come in from my first voyage, and we had foundered at sea, and lost all, and were brought into Boston in a vessel that took us off. Our owners gave each of us a coarse suit of clothes, and offered us berths in another vessel going to Carraccas. I shipped at once for twelve dollars in advance; but as the vessel was not to sail for three weeks, I took board. I then called on my sister, who was married to Temple. You know from a child she was always vain and selfish, and thought everything of appearances. Seeing me so poor-looking, she did not ask me to sit down, nor to take a meal, nor to come again, though she had a good and roomy house, and her husband in fine business. Just before the vessel sailed, I went to the boarding-house for my bundle of things; but the keeper's bill was a dollar over and above what I had, after emptying my pockets. Till <emph>I</emph> paid this, I could not get my few clothes. The vessel was to sail the next day; so, driven desperate, I resolved to ask my sister for it. I rang at her door. The hired woman went in and told her I wanted to see her. She came into the entry with her bonnet and shawl on, as if just going out, and said, coldly: 'I thought you were off to sea again, Wylie?'</p> 
               <p>"'No. I sail to-day,' I answered. 'I have come to ask you to lend me a dollar to pay a balance on my board, so I can get my bundle.'</p> 
               <p>"'I have not got it," she answered. 'I don't have enough for my own expenses. You chose to go to sea instead of being a genteel clerk, and so you must expect to be poor. Don't come to me!'</p> 
               <p>"'Your husband is well off," I said, angrily.</p> 
               <p>"'What if he is? I didn't bring him any money. I have no right to use his money, or lend it. No, I haven't got it!' And she began slowly to close the door, backing me out.</p> 
               <p>"With a sailor's angry phrase on my lips, I turned from her. I went, by chance, past her husband's store. I saw him within. Without a moment's reflection, I stepped up to him, and said:</p> 
               <p>"'Mr. Temple, will you lend me a dollar? I will pay you on my return from my voyage. I need it to pay my bill.'</p> 
               <p>"'Yes, and five, too, if you wish it,' he answered, placing a five-dollar bill in my hand. 'Why have you not been to see us?'</p> 
               <p>"'I called,' I answered, surprised at his kindness; 'but my sister was just going out.'</p> 
               <p>"After a pleasant conversation with him, I left him. In passing through Washington street, I caught sight of my sister ahead. I saw her step into Loring &amp; Baker's fashionable drygoods-store. Soon after, I passed and looked in, and saw the clerks showing her silks. I watched, unseen, through the window, and saw her take out of her purse a roll of bills and pay money for a rich silk. I was satisfied. I turned upon my heel with contempt.</p> 
               <p>"So she treated me, brother, when I sought her aid," said Richard; "but when, years afterward, she became unfortunate, I would have assisted her, out of revenge-paying her good for evil-if I had been able."</p> 
               <p>"But I would not! I think people ought to suffer for their evil doings. They ought to be made to feel as they have made others feel, and to be reminded of their past misdoings by their present suffering, as Joseph's brethren took their imprisonment in Egypt as a just retribution for selling their young brother years before. Our afflictions are often the reaction of old sins done against our fellow-being. Yet I was not wholly hardhearted. When she wrote to me, I gave her no aid. I wanted her to suffer; but I secretly prevented Temple's severest creditors here from throwing him into jail. To this hour he is ignorant to whose friendly aid six thousand dollars of his Boston debts have never troubled him, and that he has anything left!"</p> 
               <p>"You are a good man! You never let your left hand-"</p> 
               <p>"Please stop just there, Richard. In that way I paid him his five dollars. And now I want you to join me in a pleasant little plan I have been turning over in my mind. I hear Temple has a daughter who is amiable and beautiful, and not in the least like her mother. The innocent ought not to suffer with the guilty. Now I have made up my mind to benefit her mother for the daughter's sake, and for Temple's-a good man, though too hopeful in business-affairs-provided her misfortunes have humbled her, and made her feel for others who are poor. As we are both going down into Maine, and pass through Hollowell, I propose that, in order to test my sister, and also her daughter and husband, that we change characters!"</p> 
               <p>"How do you mean, brother Wylie?" asked Richard, perplexed by the words and quiet smile in his eyes.</p> 
               <p>"I mean that you travel as the rich Wylie, and I as Richard. You will take my carriage and horses, and driver, and trunk, and fine clothes, and travel as Major Dutton, and I will go in the stage, booked as Richard Dutton!"</p> 
               <p>"Are you serious?" asked Richard, smiling.</p> 
               <p>"Never more so! It may be a freak, and one of my eccentricities that people give me credit for, but I have a great desire to see how my sister will treat us in our changed characters. Will you lend yourself to the plan?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, brother, if you say so. But Martha will discover the deception."</p> 
               <p>"Not at all! It is twenty years since she has seen either of us. We are not unlike; nay, have been taken for each other."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, especially once when you were dunned on the street by a constable for me, and so kindly paid the demand and costs, to his great marvel, and without informing him of his mistake."</p> 
               <p>"A pleasant joke, and service to you, Richard, not worth naming. Our sister will never suspect that we are otherwise than we appear. When we reach Hollowell, I, as Richard, and poor, will first go to her house and ask her to entertain me, having no money (for I will have none), and if she is kind, and sisterly, and takes me in, and does by me as a brother, believing me to be her poor brother Richard, I will then lodge there and stay until you come on, as her brother Wylie, in state. You also will drive to the house. I wish to see if she will turn me out for the 'rich brother, and how, under the circumstances, her character will show itself! If it handsomely stands the trial, and she treats me as kindly as she would her rich brother', then I will make her comfortable for life; and when her daughter (if she treats me as her poor uncle, as she should) marries, I will give her a fortune. Now you see my plan."</p> 
               <p>"It is an amusing one, Wylie. But I should be glad, myself, to see how it will be carried out."</p> 
               <p>"Then act your part thus: When you arrive, act the desperate rich man! Outdo me altogether, if she takes you in, rejecting me. Be imperative, and as troublesome as possible. Make her pay for the honor of your company. You comprehend now my plan?"</p> 
               <p>"Perfectly."</p> 
               <p>"And enter into it?"</p> 
               <p>"Completely."</p> 
               <p>At length Richard took his leave. In that interview the kindest feelings had been awakened one toward the other, and the old affection they had for each other when they were boys was rekindled. With perfect understanding of one another, and complete sympathy with each other, they separated.</p> 
               <p>A few days afterward, their plan was put into effect, so far as the one starting in the stage and the other in a private carriage on their journey to Maine. At Portland, Wylie delayed a day on business, and hence Richard arrived the same day with him at Hollowell, not suspecting him to be in the stage which upset. But the reader has seen how the stage-accident in Gardiner changed in part the programme of Wylie Dutton, who, instead of stopping at his sister's door, as her poor brother asking her hospitality, he was borne on a litter to the inn, whence he sent word to her to come and see him.</p> 
               <p>There was on his mind ere he finally resolved to send his name to her as "Richard", at first, a severe struggle between truth and his preorganized plan of proceeding. Wounded as he was, and, perhaps, fatally so, he shrank from continuing a deception that had been, as it seemed to him, frowned upon by Providence. But if he did not know but that his brother Richard had already arrived at, or might come at any moment, to Mr. Temple's as "Wylie Dutton", and it was, he felt his duty, to protect him in a part which he had ventured upon only to gratify his whim. Therefore, he firmly gave his name as "Richard" to the servant in the inn, who took to Mrs. Temple the tidings that "her poor brother" was lying there wounded, and wished to see her.</p> 
               <p>"My condition will at least move her to take charge of me, now I am suffering, and so need her attention," he said, as the servant closed the door.</p> 
               <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6857-00000037"/> 
               <p>The reader has already seen the result of this message; the indifference of Mrs. Temple, the kindness of Mortimer and Doctor Willett and Annie. We have also seen Richard Dutton arrive under the style and name of his wealthy brother, and received as such, with all the honors which the straitened household of the avaricious and unchanged lady could lavish upon him. We have seen how faithfully Richard Dutton acted the part of the haughty rich man, giving all the trouble in his brother's capacity, and not a little on his own score; for he found that it was to the "rich brother Wylie" all this homage was paid, and not to Richard.</p> 
               <p>When, therefore, he subsequently learned how that his brother had been in the overturned stage, and had been denied before his own coming admittance at his sister's, though Annie had warmly urged his reception, he became sufficiently indignant. It is no wonder that he evinced it, and reproved her, as he did, in the presence of the Doctor, Mortimer, and Mr. Temple, in the room where the latter lay with his injured foot! Every word he spoke to her was richly merited by the heartless sister; and we wish all other Mrs. Temples could be as appropriately rebuked; and Mrs. Temples who love not their poor brothers and fawn on their rich ones are as plenty in the world as "leaves on the trees of Vallambrosa".</p> 
               <p>The reader now begins to see clearly the plan of our story. The will made by the wounded man was indeed a bona fide one. It was the will of Wylie Dutton in his right mind; and Annie is actually to be an heiress; Richard Dutton, the proprietor of the stately Roxbury mansion, with money in bank to support his new position; and Paul Temple is to have twelve hundred a year for the support of his family; and Mrs. Martha Jane Temple (ne Dutton) will not fail of receiving that "one dollar" of just judgment.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER XI.</head> 
               <p>We left the two brothers in the room of the parsonage of Dr. Willett conversing, the one lying suffering upon the bed, the other seated by him, and evincing by his words and looks his great distress at his brother Wylie's condition. We have heard the invalid express his doubts whether it were right for him to have taken on this deception toward his sister, since it had terminated so badly. Richard replied:</p> 
               <p>"If I were lying there, brother Wylie, I would not repent the past I have performed in the affair. We have tested our sister. We have weighed her, and find her wanting. 'Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin', can be written on the wall over the door of her house."</p> 
               <p>"More's the pity! more's the pity! I would she had shown a better spirit. But listen, brother; I have made my will. I thought I was dying. I seemed to feel a cold hand feeling about my heart. It is not taken away yet. So I made my will before the good clergyman and the physician. They are my executors. When I am dead, you will read it. I have not forgotten you. I wish you to move to my house. Your wife is a lady by goodness of heart, and your daughters and sons are all worthy to be born in the most aristocratic houses. Go and live there. Remember me, and teach them not to forget their Uncle Wylie. But I am weak. I cannot say much-that cold hand, it has left my heart, but it has grasped both my feet! They are icy cold! But one word more! Do not carry my body to Boston. I have a horror of a corpse being removed from State to State! If I die here, let me be buried here in the quiet graveyard of the village. Don't put me into a coffin, and then into a deal box, and have me carted on a dray like a box of freight or a piano, handled as such by swearing men, hoisted into a vessel, and stowed away in the hold! The idea is horrible! And wherefore? When the body gets to its journey's end, it is no longer human. It is an unrecognizable mass of shaken and jellied putrefaction, from being handled and knocked about so; and the face is no longer human! Swear to me that I shall be buried here! that in the resurrection I may be known at least to be the man and sinner, Wylie Dutton!"</p> 
               <p>"I swear it, brother!"</p> 
               <p>"Then I shall die in peace. It matters little where a man's body rests awaiting the trump of the Archangel! Sea or land is the same; for 'the sea shall give up its dead that is within it', as well as the land, at the blast of the Angel of Judgment. Under the sky into which my spirit ascends let my body lie. Erect over me no showy monument-only a gravestone. A hospital, a school, a church, built with the money that monuments eat up, would be pillars of immortal beauty-imperishable memorials. I know a man who has ordered a tomb for his favorite son which cost eight thousand dollars! If he had with the money founded a free orphan-school, and inscribed his son's name over the portal, it would have been a living memorial forever of the dead; and each generation should bear in its heart his deathless name to the latest posterity. Foolish is he who trusts to marble for a memorial of his name! Let him write it on the living memories, on the beating hearts of the generations!"</p> 
               <p>Here the invalid paused, and breathed heavily.</p> 
               <p>"Do you suffer much, brother?"</p> 
                
               <p>"No; but-but I feel those horrid fingers creeping up my legs! They grasp my knees! Their icy pressure is fearful. If this is the chill of death, how dreadful it is! how fearful to be able to watch and feel the advance, step by step, from the extremities to the heart! Touch my hands and arms! Have they feeling? I find no sensation!"</p> 
               <p>"They are very cold, brother!"</p> 
               <p>"I thought so! They are already dead; They will be warm no more-never-warm-again. Brother!"</p> 
               <p>"What, Wylie!"</p> 
               <p>"I see you weep. I know you love me. I wish I had given you half my income. I have never done what I ought. I ought not to have kept you down, and your excellent wife and children, as I have, on a paltry $500 a year!"</p> 
               <p>"But you gave us house-rent-"</p> 
               <p>"Don't mention it! This is no time to speak of such good deeds as a man does in health, in order to compromise with his conscience and the world, when a sense of the truth 'that no man liveth to himself' comes over him! I now see what I have left undone! I understand why the Bible 'warns rich men' as it does. It is a fearful thing, Richard, to be rich. God expects so much of us, and we so fail in what we ought to do. I had no children's mouths and limbs to clothe and feed. I have left undone toward you that which I ought to have done. But, Richard, you will find I have tried to be just at last. Forgive me for keeping you poor, when I could have made you rich. I feel that I am responsible for all you and yours have been pinched in, that I might have prevented. But I am dying poor, if that will atone. I have given all I have away. Oh! that death-cold touch! It is as if ice were being placed inch by inch from my feet up my legs. I feel the cold creeping along toward my body. It will, ere long, reach my heart. Is this death? Can I watch its approaches thus calmly? Let me feel my pulse! It still beats; but it is as unnatural as if the wrist of a statue of stone, exposed in wintry January-air, should begin to rise and fall with mysterious life!"</p> 
               <p>"Is there any thing I can do for you?" asked Richard, in tones of awe.</p> 
               <p>"No, I think not. I have made my will. But you may put this in the newspaper-notice of my death. They are Bible-words. They may save some rich men from losing their souls: <q>
                     <p>"'Make not haste to be rich.'</p>
                     <p>"'How hardly shall a rich man enter into the kingdom of God!'</p>
                     <p>"'It is the Lord who giveth the power to get wealth.'</p>
                     <p>"'The gold and silver are mine,' saith the Lord.</p>
                  </q> I believe I have quoted correctly, or nearly so. But find the places in the Bible, Richard. I would with my tombstone warn men 'not to make haste to be rich'; or, if rich, to make haste to do good with their means. I wish now I had been poor, as poor as you are, Richard!"</p> 
               <p>"But the good you have done with your money-"</p> 
               <p>"Will not help me at God's bar! I tremble to die rich! I wish to be as poor as Jesus, who had only his apparel. Give all my clothes to the poor, brother. I have made my sister's daughter rich, for she is worthy, and for the young man's sake, her lover."</p> 
               <p>"Both are worthy of all you can do for them. Annie is wholly different from her mother. She would have had you to the house."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I knew so. Now, brother, let me say to you, whom I have made rich, put not your trust in riches. Do good with them. First pay all your debts, principal and interest. A man who will not, when he can, pay his debts, is a sinner above all men. Debt is the touchstone of a man's true character. A man who, with the means, will not pay old debts, is not an honest man. Honesty knows no legal outlawry. An honest man and a Christian will 'owe no man anything' when he can pay, though the debt be a quarter of a century old! Oh! this hand of death! how it creeps up with its chilling fingers. I feel it about my heart! All my blood rushes to my brain! See! What do I behold! What do I hear! I see faces! One is my mother's! She smiles and beckons to me. I see other strange persons. One says 'he is my father'! They are gathered like a cloud about me. I hear the most ravishing music! What resplendent light shines about them! Oh! how cold! how cold! My heart is freezing, brother! Lay your warm hand upon it! There is no warmth! It is death sealing me for the grave! Hark to the music! What can earth give so seraphic! I am surrounded with glorified forms! I feel their wings of light fan me! Brother, farewell! I forgive my-my sister! I revoke the one do-dol-dollar! It was wrong-it was revenge! Give-give-give her a town-town-ship in-oh! how cold!-cold!-cold! The waves of Death's Jordan overflow me! And this is death! What blackness of darkness! Alone!-alone!-alone! cold!-cold!-cold! Where am I?" he cried, shivering until the room shook. "I am falling-falling into an unknown abyss! See! A cross is thrown to me from a height! I grasp its arms! Hark! Music!-light!-glory unutterable! I am-saved!-I am saved!"</p> 
               <p>His brother was bending over him in wonder and anguish. He held in his arms a<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6857-00000038"/> corpse! His brother was no more for this earth!</p> 
               <p>For a few minutes, Richard Dutton bent over his brother's body in silent awe. He laid his hand upon his brow. It was hot, but inanimate.</p> 
               <p>"Heaven be merciful to his soul!" he prayed, with earnest emotion.</p> 
               <p>He then sternly closed his brother's staring eyes, with his thumb and finger pressed upon them, and folded his hands and decently covered him up, and stood reverently gazing upon him.</p> 
               <p>"And this is the end!" he ejaculated. "The rich and the poor alike come to this at last! Let this lesson teach me to prepare also for this silence which knows no waking or change on earth! How profoundly do I now feel that life is given us for death! and that he who dies without its preparation has lived to no purpose-has lost all that life contains or can bestow!"</p> 
               <p>He paced up and down the room several minutes, thoughtful. He suddenly stopped in his walk and said:</p> 
               <p>"What must be done? It is midnight. Shall I wake the family or let him lie until morning? Ere then he will be cold and stiff. I will silently leave the house and hasten to the inn. There I shall be able to find some persons-for there are people who sit up all night to watch for stages and travelers in inns. I will return with them; for gold will buy all services, even the gold of dead men buries them!"</p> 
               <p>So Richard Dutton, out of the same feeling of consideration which forbade Mortimer, shortly afterward, to call his father and sister, softly left the house and went out. On his way, he inquired of the watchman for the inn. When he made known there that the person had died who had been hurt in the stage, and taken to Dr. Willett's, and that he would pay men to go up-as he was his brother-to lay him out, Smithley soon had two of his men up, and going with them, he followed Richard Dutton to the parsonage. On their way they were met by Captain Daniel Day, the watchman, on his way to find assistance, and he returned with them to the gate of the parsonage, where Mortimer was waiting for him. At the sight of Major Dutton (as he supposed him to be), the brother, Mortimer expressed his gratification, and he asked him quickly:</p> 
               <p>"He died, then, before you left, Sir?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes," answered Richard; "and not wishing to disturb your family, I went out for this assistance."</p> 
               <p>"I am glad you have come with aid," answered Mortimer, and conducted the party to the room of the dead.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head> 
               <p>"Dead!" exclaimed Mrs. Temple, early the next morning, as Mortimer called to the house, and, meeting her at the door, gave her the news. "Richard Dutton dead!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, and laid out," he answered, gravely. "He died a little before midnight. His brother was with him."</p> 
               <p>"And Richard's really dead! And where is my brother Wylie?" she asked, as if thinking more of her disappointment at his going away than grieving at her "poor" brother's death.</p> 
               <p>"He is at the tavern asleep, where he went at daybreak, after all had been done for his brother."</p> 
               <p>"He might have come here! There I've kept his room for him all night. But he must not stay there. Tell him, Mortimer, we expect him to stay here, at least till the funeral is over."</p> 
               <p>"I will tell him so How is Annie?"</p> 
               <p>"She isn't up yet I kept her up till long after one o'clock, hoping the Major would surely come back; and you know she couldn't go into her closet to sleep till he was safe in bed and asleep, because she had to go through his room. But I wont disturb her, and let her sleep."</p> 
               <p>"I hope Mr. Temple is easier?"</p> 
               <p>"I don't know. He has made a great groaning all night; but any little thing he always makes a fuss about. He can't bear the least pain. He loves to be nursed and petted and poored and made a world of nonsense of when he's sick; and because Annie is so foolish as to humor him, he thinks I have nothing to do but rub his ankle for him. I don't think he's much hurt. Don't fail to give my compliments to brother Wylie, and tell him I expect him to stay with me."</p> 
               <p>Mortimer had not been gone half an hour, when Betty was called in, and the following note placed in her hands, written by Mrs. Temple, who was a great power with her pen. It was her resort at all times, from settling a difference about buying milk to arranging a quarrel with her husband, writing him from her room to his, and throwing him the note under his door!</p>

It is better to forgive than to receive, says the Bible, and I know you joined the church once, as I did; and off and on I've been trying to serve the Lord this twenty-four year.

               <p>When Richard Dutton rose late next morning in the inn, the above note was placed in his hands by the landlord, with a low bow; and with the remark that the bearer had gone home, but wished him to send a reply.</p> 
               <p>When Richard read the note, his mouth drew closely its sarcastic lips, and he muttered:</p> 
               <p>"What a heartless woman! She has no soul. Not a word of real sorrow for her brother-supposing it is me, Richard, who is dead. She loves money more than her soul! But she is punished. My brother leaves her but a dollar."</p> 
               <p>After he had breakfasted, Richard Dutton sought Doctor Willett, and had an interview with him and Doctor Page about the will. These gentlemen were courteous and respectful, and gave him the will, as the chief person interested in it, to read. He saw with surprise and gratitude that its noble provisions for himself and his family, and for Paul Temple and Annie were verified.</p> 
               <p>We will pass over the events of the two following days, the second of which was marked only by the funeral of Wylie Dutton. It was followed to the grave by a large concourse of citizens, and by the Willetts, and Mrs. Temple, the latter in such half-mourning as could hastily be made up. Annie, and Mortimer, and Arly stood by the grave, and shed a tear over the stranger accidentally killed in their midst, as the village-paper had it the next morning. Joe, the idiot, also stood there in stupid awe and woe. Richard Dutton was chief-mourner, and a real one! as the earth fell upon the hollow lid of the coffin, his strong frame shook and he was convulsed with grief. Mrs. Temple's face was hidden by her kerchief; but there were no tears in her eyes to dry. She did not know that the dead man was Wylie, her rich brother! She had no grief to waste on "poor Richard". There were not then, as now, printed tickets sent out everywhere announcing the death and inviting the friends. The deceased was spoken of only as Mr. Dutton. She had no suspicion of the truth. In her sight it was Wylie who stood by the grave mourning so deeply; and she wondered he should show so much feeling for a poor brother. So the blessing was pronounced over the grave; and the earth piled up, and the sods placed above it, and then the mourners and spectators one by one turned away, leaving the dead alone with the dead!</p> 
               <p>As Richard Dutton was getting into his carriage at the gate, his sister drew near, and under the advantage of so sad an occasion, laid her hand upon his arm, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Drive to my house, Wylie! I've got everything ready for you so nice!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I'm going to your house," he answered, coldly. "I shall be there by-and-by, I wish to see your husband."</p> 
               <p>Thus saying, he drove away with Annie, Mortimer, and Miss Willett, who had come with him.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Temple then got into the hired carriage in which she had come; and, though troubled at his cold and stern manner, rejoiced to get him again as her guest, under any circumstances.</p> 
               <p>That evening, an hour before sunset, her brother arrived; but he was on foot, having sent his carriage to the inn the preceding morning; for he had learned from the driver how ill his horses had fared in the parson's stable. Accompanying her brother were Reverend Doctor Willett and Doctor Page. The three gentlemen came in together and looked solemn, as became persons who had but an hour before been to the burial of the dead. Mrs. Temple received them, trying to look sorry, too; but her satisfaction at seeing her "rich" brother come back, glittered from beneath the downfall of her eyelids. She pressed her brother's hand, and could not help saying:</p> 
               <p>"I am so glad you have come, Wylie."</p> 
               <p>He made no reply. The three gentlemen entered the bedroom where Mr. Temple was reclining upon his bed, his foot bandaged up. He spoke pleasantly to them in welcome, but his eyes expressed surprise, if not apprehension, at this formidable demonstration. His first thought was:</p> 
               <p>"The doctor must consider me dangerous, to bring the minister and my brother-in-law."</p> 
               <p>"Glad to see you looking so much better," said Doctor Page, pushing a pinch of snuff into his nostrils with enormous sniffling. "Keep quiet a few days and you'll be out again."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I am so glad, dear father," exclaimed Annie.</p> 
               <p>"It little matters, for the use he is to his family, whether he lies here or goes about," muttered Mrs. Temple, aside to Betty, who had poked in her curious face to see why the three gentlemen came so formally together.</p> 
               <p>"A smith can't work without tools, be he never so strong, Ma'am, nor a merchant without goods," answered Betty, who always stood up for her mild and patient "master".</p> 
               <p>"Go mind your work, Betty," answered Mrs. Temple.</p> 
               <p>"I'll mind it when I please, Ma'am," answered<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6857-00000039"/> swered the Queen of the Kitchen, without stirring a toe to obey.</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Temple," said the minister, we have come to transact a little business before you"</p> 
               <p>"I hope it is nothing unpleasant," ejaculated the broken merchant, whose apprehensions were only of evil and ill news, from long habit and misfortune.</p> 
               <p>"No, good news," sniffed the physician. "It will cheer you up better than poultice and blister. We wish you to listen to a will that Doctor Willett will read to you."</p> 
               <p>"Whose?" asked Mr. Temple, amazed and rising hall up.</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Dutton's, your late brother-in-law."</p> 
               <p>"Will!" muttered audibly Mrs. Temple; "I wonder what he has to do with making a will, when he never had a dollar he could call his own; and, I dare say; my brother Wylie here has had to bear the funeral-expenses.</p> 
               <p>"Madam!" cried Richard Dutton, with an angry voice.</p> 
               <p>She was at once silenced. She was prudent enough not to offend the "rich" brother.</p> 
               <p>"You, Mrs. Temple, will remain," said Doctor Willett, "while I read the will-and you, Miss Annie," he said, smiling, for he rejoiced at the good news she was to hear.</p> 
               <p>The reverend gentleman then unfolded the will and began to read it; first stating that it was the dying man's wish that they should witness it. He had not read farther than the name ere Mrs. Temple exclaimed, "Richard, you mean, Doctor," and Paul Temple also said, "Not Wylie, is it?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Wylie Dutton-so it reads, and so the gentleman directed it to be written."</p> 
               <p>"His name was Richard! He must have been flighty," said Mrs. Temple.</p> 
               <p>"Go on-read the will, Doctor, if you please," said Richard Dutton.</p> 
               <p>When he had concluded it, which he did not do without numerous exclamations of surprise and incredulity by Mrs. Temple, her husband said, amazed and perplexed:</p> 
               <p>"How can this be? Richard had no estate to leave. He must have been out of his head-for Major Wylie owns all that his brother Richard thus bequeathes. I feel grateful to him, even in his madness, for remembering me and Annie."</p> 
               <p>"The only thing like him is 'the dollar'-that is all he had to will," said Mrs. Temple, with a sneering laugh. "I am better off than all of you."</p> 
               <p>"Listen, sister!" said Richard Dutton. "The will is genuine. It is your brother Wylie who is dead, and to-day was buried. I am Richard Dutton."</p> 
               <p>He then proceeded to make known to the whole company what the reader has already been advised of, the plot which his brother had formed with him to change characters for the time.</p> 
               <p>They all heard with wonder. Paul Temple, with a cry of joy, embraced his fair daughter; for he saw that all his earthly misfortunes were suddenly come to an end-and Annie, his idol, was to be rich and happy! Mrs. Temple stood, the statue of mingled anger, amazement, and disappointment.</p> 
               <p>"Do you say that you are Richard?" she cried, with excitement and doubt. "If you are, there is the bite of a dog on your left arm."</p> 
               <p>"There it is, sister!" he said, showing her the marks of four teeth deeply indented.</p> 
               <p>She clasped her hands together-turned deadly pale, and shrieking with rage, went into hysterics. Fortunately, the Doctor was present. She was soon brought to her senses, and to her breath.</p> 
               <p>"To insult me so! To expose me in this way! A paltry dollar! A pretty trick for two gentlemen!"</p> 
               <p>"Madam, you well merited it," answered Richard, with severe dignity. "Your conduct to Wylie, supposing him to be me, and to me believing me to be Wylie, is proof that your heart is as hard as the nether millstone; and that no motives but avarice can move it. I was not present when my noble brother made his will. But he has rightly punished you. He has shown, too, how deeply your cruel conduct to him long years ago has been engraven upon his memory. The dollar willed you ought to teach you a lesson for life."</p> 
               <p>"Well, if I haven't anything, Annie is an heiress; and Mr. Temple will have twelve hundred a year."</p> 
               <p>"Annie's property," said Doctor Page, sniffling, "is to be paid her only on her marriage day. When that day comes, Miss Annie," he added, smiling, "Doctor Willett and I will see that your fortune is duly paid to you."</p> 
               <p>"In case of Mr. Temple's death, what shall I get?" suddenly asked Mrs. Temple.</p> 
               <p>"Nothing, Madam," said Doctor Page. "The bequest goes then in another direction."</p> 
               <p>"And I left without a penny!"</p> 
               <p>"You have your one dollar," said Richard, bitterly. "Doubtless my brother's object was for you to depend on your daughter, who will have enough for her and you!"</p> 
               <p>"I'll break the will! I'll break the will! You-you have a hundred thousand dollars. You have your nest lined well; and your wife and children are rich, and I am a beggar."</p> 
               <p>"You forget the dollar, sister!"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Temple went once more into hysterics, and was borne by Annie and the strong-armed Betty into the room fitted up for the rich brother, and laid upon the bed. Annie bathed her brow, and could hardly keep her joyous thoughts quiet the while. "Forty thousand dollars! My father comfortable, too? My poor mother-well, she will enjoy it! What a strange plot it was! How singularly it has ended! Richard, instead of being dead, is alive and rich! What wonder mother feels it. Forty thousand dollars the day I am married! (Here was a sweet proud blush!) How happy Mortimer will be! He need not go to Boston now! He can make his father and Arly so happy! Oh, my dear mother, don't moan so! It will all be right. You didn't know it was Uncle Wylie-"</p> 
               <p>"I fear I've lost my soul. I am a wicked woman! God forgive me!"</p> 
               <p>Annie was startled. She had never heard such words of contrition fall from her lips; for her mother was one who was never sorry for anything, and who never said "I was wrong". From this new phase of grief, she augured happiness in the future for them all. But Annie had yet to learn that a few words of penitence and contrition under pique and humiliation are not conversion; and that he who to-day says "I repent", to-morrow may forget the meaning of the words.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head> 
               <p>Mortimer had heard of Annie's good fortune, and at their next interview he congratulated her on "being an heiress"; and when she said: "Now, dear Mortimer, you need not go to be a clerk," he refused to see the force of the argument, saying:</p> 
               <p>"I am too proud, dear Annie, to owe all to you. I must work for my father and Arley. Perhaps," he added, seeing her drop her eyelids sadly, "perhaps we can now be married a year or two sooner."</p> 
               <p>"I don't see, why not-this-year," she said, blushingly.</p> 
               <p>So they parted by the "Cascade", where we have seen them meet; and while he descended the romantic defile to overtake the stage which was climbing London hill, south of the village, she lingered until she could no longer discern his retreating form. They had exchanged rings, locks of hair, and kisses, and planned a weekly correspondence.</p> 
               <p>Sadly, and yet with her heart full of happiness, Annie returned home. She passed the gate to the parsonage, where still stood Arley and her brothers and sisters, who had been watching the stage, as it passed the lower street, to meet Mortimer on the hill, as he had agreed with the driver.</p> 
               <p>In a few minutes, the children, with the tears of parting yet wet on their cheeks, returned into the house, whither their venerable father had already gone, to shut his door, and pray to the Father of all to take care of his dear boy, and grant him life-long prosperity, and by-and-by a safe return to his home.</p> 
               <p>Annie and Arley stood by the gate, both looking sorrowfully at one another; both feeling too deeply to speak. Loved equally by these fair girls, yet loved differently, how precious was his love to them both! What encouragement, with two such guardian-angels, for him to be brave and true to himself, to them, to his God!</p> 
               <p>"He will be gone until May," said Annie, at length.</p> 
               <p>"It is a long, long time," answered Arley. "Oh, I am so glad you are rich, dearest, and that your father is so well off. I saw him walking out yesterday, and he scarcely limped, he was in such high spirits; and even your 'ma is more satisfied, now that he is going to move into his fine house again."</p> 
               <p>"'Ma is always pleased with show and style," answered Annie; "but I never was happier than in our little cottage. But I am glad 'pa is be to well off. What a noble disposition Uncle Wylie must have had, with all his eccentricities."</p> 
               <p>"Yes. How you wondered at the rough conduct of Richard, supposing him to be Wylie, with all his trouble about the bath-tub and toast. I don't wonder your 'ma is vexed now she has found it out."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps it has done mamma good. It has taught her not to be guided by appearances, as she always is. But one must be blind, Arley, to the faults of their parents."</p> 
               <p>"No one could be more obedient and filial, Annie, than you are. 'Pa always brings you forward to me and my younger sisters as a paragon and example of all virtues. But who is this gentleman walking this way? He is a stranger? I wonder who it can be! How handsome he is!"</p> 
               <p>"I have no idea; he is dressed like a Bostonian," remarked Annie. "He is very handsome."</p> 
               <p>The young ladies were about to leave the gate and go, "lest," as Annie said, "he might think they were smitten with his good looks to linger and gaze upon him," when, seeing the movement, he quickened his steps, and said, with a courteous and pleasant manner:</p> 
               <p>"Pardon me, young ladies. I am seeking the residence of Doctor Willett. I was informed at the hotel that it was in this direction.</p> 
               <p>"This is the house, Sir," answered Arley, with a girlish side-look at Annie. "If you desire to see my father, he is within-"</p> 
               <p>"I wish to see Mr. Mortimer Willett?"</p> 
               <p>"My brother has left, not half an hour since, by the stage for Boston."</p> 
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6857-00000040"/> 
               <p>"Your brother? I then address Miss Charlotte Willett, I presume. I regret extremely that I did not come sooner. Left for Boston? I came from Brunswick purposely to see him."</p> 
               <p>"He will regret missing you-" Arley stopped, embarrassed.</p> 
               <p>"Again, I beg your pardon for not informing you who I am. You have heard your brother speak of Edward Haverhill," and he presented his card to Miss Willett, with a graceful bow.</p> 
               <p>"Often, Sir. I am glad to see you." And with these words of welcome, Arley extended frankly her hand to him. "This is Miss Annie Temple"</p> 
               <p>"Of whom also I have heard Mortimer speak," he said, with a smile of quiet meaning, as Arley interpreted it.</p> 
               <p>Annie colored richly, and acknowledged, with that sweet grace which never deserted her, his bow.</p> 
               <p>"I am sure brother will be very sorry when he hears you have been here. You are a great favorite with him."</p> 
               <p>"I shall go to Boston in a few days; and as I had promised Mortimer some time to visit him, I chose this time, when I felt very confident I should meet him at his father's."</p> 
               <p>"My father will be glad to see you. Will you go in?"</p> 
               <p>"Arley, I must go home," said Annie, in an undertone; and darted off, with scarcely a glance at Mr. Haverhill, and as if fearing he would offer his escort; and sad at heart with parting from her lover, she was in no mood for the society even of Adonis.</p> 
               <p>The eyes of the young stranger irresistibly followed her charming figure in its retreat; but, recollecting himself in the presence of a lady equally as fair, he said:</p> 
               <p>"I thank you; I will pay my respects to your father. Your friend, Miss Willett, is a very lovely girl."</p> 
               <p>"And as good as beautiful," answered Arley, who had no envy in her composition.</p> 
               <p>Arley had not just turned the second corner from the parsonage toward her own house when she saw the carriage of the Vaughans pass, and in it the invalid young Englishman; at least, she guessed it was he from Arley's description. For a moment, her eyes followed the carriage as it passed out of sight in the direction of Dr. Willett's; and then she hastened home and to her room, "to have a good cry about Mortimer", as she afterward confessed to her friend.</p> 
               <p>Fortunately, her own room was now once more in her own possession. In vain, Mrs. Temple urged Richard Dutton to remain after that will was read. He coldly bade her adieu, and the next day returned to Boston to carry the good news (how every day Death brings good news, with inherited riches, to some persons!) to his family; but, before leaving, he had rewarded Dr. Willett for his goodness to his brother by presenting him with the carriage and pair, preferring to return with the mailcoach to Boston. Mrs. Temple, therefore, had the field. The "one dollar" made her twinge a little; but she tried to forget it in the greater benefit of twelve hundred a year. As Doctor Page had told Mr. Willett, his news was better than liniments; and what with reviving spirits and healthier blood, and better digestion, he was soon limping about, quite another man.</p> 
               <p>The carriage containing the young Englishman stopped before the parsonage. Arley had just left Mr. Haverhill in her father's study, talking with him about Mortimer, and was in the front entry when she saw the "Earl's son" get out. Old Mr. Vaughan assisted him; and, together, they walked up the short gravel-path to the door. Arley would have taken flight! But who could receive them? There was no "hired girl", and the children were in the backyard. It was too late to run away. Blushing with a conscious consciousness, she extended her hand to the old gentleman, who touched it with dignified courtesy, and then presented his companion, saying:</p> 
               <p>"My young friend, the Honorable Charles Herbert, desires to pay his first call to you all here, and assure you and your father and brother of his gratitude for your attention."</p> 
               <p>"Which I can never forget, Miss Willett," the young man said, with fine emotion beaming in his eyes.</p> 
               <p>He was pale, but interestingly handsome. How much he had changed for the better in two weeks! The swelled cheek and bandage were all gone; and he stood before her as fine a looking (maugre the paleness) young English gentleman as a young American lady could wish to see. Arley felt that she was not looking composed! She grew embarrassed, and forgot to ask them in; and, when her omission flashed upon her, she stammered out:</p> 
               <p>"Won't you come in, Doctor Vaughan. 'Pa is in his study; I will call him."</p> 
               <p>"No; I will go up and see him. I have some business to talk over with him. You will entertain Mr. Herbert down-stairs."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Herbert being seated in the parlor, the mean furniture of which could not but attract his eyes, Miss Willett left him to conduct the noble old English gentleman to her father's private room. At the door, Haverhill was just coming out, and descended the hall with her. Seeing the stranger in the parlor, he did not go in, but said he would call again before he left town; and, in the meanwhile. walk about and see the place. So he bowed himself out, thinking in his heart what a fine girl his friend's sister was.</p> 
               <p>"But then," he mused, as he walked out of the gate, "not so striking in appearance as her friend, Miss Temple. That fair girl seemed to enchain me with her single glance. Her eyes are magnetic. No wonder Mortimer fancied her; and, now I have seen her, I marvel he never engaged himself to her. 'I'm too poor,' he said, with his usual noble sentiments-'too poor to ask her to unite her destiny with mine!' I wonder if she loves him! I wonder if Miss Willett is engaged! I saw a pale young fellow in the room; she looked as if his presence and mine were de trop at once; and so I did her the favor to leave. He may have been her music-teacher, however; though I saw no piano. I suppose the minister is too poor for that luxury. What a pity for fine girls ever to want everything! Beauty, it seems to me, ought ever to move in an atmosphere of luxuries; that diamonds, pearls, rubies, and all that is rich and beautiful in ornament should adorn all women. A poor, beautiful girl is unnatural-an anomaly! I wonder if Miss Willett is poor!"</p> 
               <p>Thus musing, the young man walked on; and, insensibly, his footsteps took the direction taken by Annie. This maiden, after her "good cry", had come into her mother's room, and taken a seat, with her sewing in her hand. She was embroidering a slipper for her father to wear on his lame foot. Mrs. Temple was engaged in calculating on the fly-leaf of her almanac, how much interest forty-seven thousand dollars would bring at six per cent.</p> 
               <p>"Twenty-four hundred a year!" she soliloquized. "That is double ours! (Mrs. Temple had already begun to use the plural pronouns with reference to her husband's bequest.) What a fortune for a girl! You are now eighteen, Annie. If you don't get married till you are twenty-one, the interest will make it forty-seven thousand two hundred; I declare almost fifty!"</p> 
               <p>Annie did not listen. Her thoughts were with the absent.</p> 
               <p>"I think Mortimer Willett has showed his good sense by going up to Boston. He is poor, and all his family, and he ought to work for 'em. He can hardly hope to save anything beyond what they need for ten years. Industrious young man; no doubt he'll do well, if he's economical. One of those days he may marry some nice young woman in his own condition, and-"</p> 
               <p>"What are you talking about, 'ma?" at length cried Annie, catching the last of her artful words. "Mortimer marry who? He will never marry any one but me, you will know, mother; and I will marry none else."</p> 
               <p>"Don't be foolish, Annie. You are now an heiress. You are no longer as you were when he offered himself to you. You were both poor, now you are unequal. You ought not to think of him-a mere clerk-not money enough to pay for a marriage-license. Now, be a good girl, and write to him, and cast him off. Your hand will be worth seeking for by the richest gentleman of the land."</p> 
               <p>"Mother, if you talk to me in this way, I cannot stay and listen."</p> 
               <p>"Your condition is now above his. You can look as high as you please. As soon as we get into our former stylish house, I mean to give one of the grandest parties ever known in Kennebec County. I mean to bring you out. Nobody knows of your engagement to this poor young student. Forget it, dearest, and be heart free. You can reign queen of hearts."</p> 
               <p>"One kingdom is enough for my condition, and that I am queen of, mother. It is Mortimer's heart."</p> 
               <p>"You will make me angry, child."</p> 
               <p>"I am sorry, dear mother. But the change in my fortune will produce no change in my feelings toward Mortimer."</p> 
               <p>This was spoken firmly, but respectfully; and, to avoid further communication on the subject, she rose and went out. Her bonnet in the entry suggested the idea of walking in the yard; for the day was mild and soft, with Indian-summer airs. The soft murmur of the cataract from the woods not far off fell upon her ears, and her steps took instinctively that favorite direction.</p> 
               <p>"I shall, at least, be alone there," she said. She had been half an hour seated above the cataract where so often Mortimer sat with her, the embroidery lay untouched upon her lap, the waters rushed past, bearing leaves tinted with the splendors of the iris; and as they went flashing over the fall, it looked to her like a cascade of rubies, diamonds, pearls, and sapphires. She sat and enjoyed the scene amid the great shadows of the pines falling about her in solemn twilight, and thought of and wished for Mortimer to be there enjoying it with her.</p> 
               <p>Suddenly a voice near her caused her to turn her head with surprise. Haverhill, who had strayed thither half an hour before she came, and had been admiring the wild scene, wondering to find within a step of a large town so romantic and secluded a spot, untouched by any hand but that of nature at the creation.</p> 
               <p>"What a charming spot, Miss Willett!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Mr. Haverhill. This is our favorite walk. I did not know I was not alone. I am glad you have discovered it."</p> 
               <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6857-00000041"/> 
               <p>"I found a style and a path, and, as I have a great fancy for exploring, I followed whither it led, and so this scene of beauty flashed upon me. What lovers' paths, lovers' seats, lovers' bowers, lovers' leaps, and lovers' bridges are here!"</p> 
               <p>"What do you call lovers' bridges, Mr. Haverhill?" she asked, laughing.</p> 
               <p>"Very narrow places crossing brooks, with just peril enough to give lovers excuses for crossing, hand in hand."</p> 
               <p>Annie blushed and laughed; for she recollected several such "bridges", which she and Mortimer had crossed exactly in the same manner. Haverhill's fine eyes reflected the laugh.</p> 
               <p>A laugh breaks the ice of formality. It opens the doors of the social feeling. One mutual laugh goes further to make two persons acquainted than a year's formal interview.</p> 
               <p>Haverhill was fascinating, clever, and a good talker. He praised Mortimer a good deal. Annie could not but like him for this; and she was glad to find one she could talk with about her lover.</p> 
               <p>Annie's frank and bewitching manner, unconsciously to herself, captivated more and more his senses. She pointed out to him all the romantic places. Related two or three legends connected with "The Cascades", and finally had to remind him that "it was getting late", and she must leave him to his meditations.</p> 
               <p>"I cannot leave you go home alone," he answered, with the easy courtesy of an old friend. "You must permit me to accompany you."</p> 
               <p>At the door, he lingered to enjoy a little longer her sweet presence. Mrs. Temple seeing him, and that he was "so genteel", came to the porch and said:</p> 
               <p>"Annie, do not be so impolite as to keep the gentleman standing-won't you walk in, Sir?"</p> 
               <p>He glanced at Annie.</p> 
               <p>"I should be glad to have you come in, Mr. Haverhill," added Annie. "I already had invited him, mother."</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Haverhill!" said Mrs. Temple, in a sort of recollecting way. "Is this the Mr. Haverhill I have heard young Mortimer Willet speak about?"</p> 
               <p>This was addressed to the young man.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Madam."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I am glad to see you, Sir!" exclaimed the lady, who, at the name, recollected that Mortimer had told her he was very rich. "Come in, Mr. Haverhill. There is a chair, Sir. I am glad you met Annie. I must apologize for our humble house-but it is only temporarily. We are going to move into a very fine house very soon. Hope, Mr. Haverhill to see you in it. Have heard of your family when I lived in Boston. Your grandfather was General Haverhill?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Madam."</p> 
               <p>"And you are Judge Haverhill's son?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Madam," very quietly.</p> 
               <p>"Mother, I saw the stranger who is at Mr. Vaughan's, riding out to-day," said Annie, trying to change the direction of this conversation. "He looked very pale."</p> 
               <p>"They say he is an English lord. Have you heard of him, Mr. Haverhill?"</p> 
               <p>"No, Madam," answered Haverhill, who was mentally contrasting mother and daughter; and no longer wondered that pearls were found in oysters. We beg pardon of Mrs. Temple for the figure; she must pardon it, for the honor we allow to be hers; for, if Annie is a pearl, she is the mother of pearl; and this escaped innocently.</p> 
               <p>"I never saw a lord," continued Mrs. Temple. "I read of 'em in novels in my day. I recollect reading Clarissa Harlowe and Pamela, and there are a great many lords and ladies enacted in that book. The two-volume novels of now-a-days, what are they to compare with the seven and ten volumes as a time Mr. Richards used to entertain us with."</p> 
               <p>"Richardson, mother."</p> 
               <p>"Well, it makes no difference. 'Son' is no real part of anybody's name. It is merely put on to show they are their father's sons. Richard, I am sure, was the family-name."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Temple never owned that she was wrong; and if she told a lie by accident, she would defend it.</p> 
               <p>"Please stay to tea, Mr. Haverhill. Mr. Temple has limped round to see the minister, but 'll be glad to see you. He thinks a great deal of Boston men. He has gone to Doctor Willett's to see about the estate; as Doctor Willett is one of the executors. Perhaps you heard my brother died not long since, and left Annie forty thousand dollars; and my husband twenty thousand dollars."</p> 
               <p>"Indeed, Madam, I am sorry to hear that your brother is dead. Glad that he has left you his property."</p> 
               <p>"Not the half of it. It is most all gone to his brother Richard, who has gone to Roxbury to live in fine style to be sure. Stay to tea, Haverhill. Annie, take Mr. Haverhill's hat."</p> 
               <p>"Excuse me, Madam; if my hat is taken away, I never know what to do with my fingers. Deprive a gentleman of his hat in the parlor, and you deprive him of his self-possession."</p> 
               <p>"Dear me-how odd! Well, it is so with the ladies, Mr. Haverhill," said Mrs. Temple; "they must have a fan, or knitting, or something. Now, I am never easy with nothing in my hands; so I always carry my keys to fondle, like. Mr. Temple always opens and shuts his penknife when he is in company, and used to clean his nails before people with it; but I long ago taught him it was a very dirty trick; he ought as well clean his teeth in company. Our minister always is pulling at his eyebrows, and as he has continually done it for thirty odd years, I wonder he has a bristle left; but, to-day-just look at them-gray as they are, they are as thick as a hedgehog's, and an inch long. I never saw such eyebrows!"</p> 
               <p>Mr. Temple returned; warmly welcomed Mr. Haverhill, who had so often been mentioned by Mortimer as to seem to be an old friend. He remained to tea; and after supper, played draughts with Annie, made himself agreeable to her mother, and talked politics with the father. When nine o'clock curfew rang all little boys and girls to bed, he very properly took his leave, leaving his heart in Miss Annie's possession, and upon Mr. Temple an agreeable impression that he was a very intelligent and interesting young man, and upon the mother a determined purpose to bring about a match between Annie and this only son of the rich Judge Haverhill! As to Mortimer, she was wholly indifferent to any claims the "poor young man" might have upon her honor or upon Annie's hand!</p> 
               <p>From that evening, Annie's peace departed. Mr. Haverhill was deeply in love with her. He did not know that Mortimer was engaged to her; and in love, lovers are seldom particular about consulting the pleasure of others who admire the same lady. Indeed, most young men regard the field of love as a battle-ground where the bravest wins and pockets the honors. If a dozen students had been in love with Annie, Haverhill would hardly have recognized their claim, nor would he without a fair trial have yielded the prize to either of them.</p> 
               <p>Intending going to Boston the next day, or the next, or the next, he was on these days a regular caller at Mr. Temple's. Sometimes, Annie saw him-sometimes, as she saw him coming, in order to avoid him, she ran over to see Arley. The next Sunday, he accompanied her home from church, and thus gave public encouragement to the rumor that Annie Temple had discarded Mortimer Willett, and was to marry the handsome and rich Boston suitor. Mrs. Temple, with an eye always to the main chance, had done all in her power to spread the rumor, and so commit, as it were, her daughter to this treachery against her absent lover. Arley was Annie's only confidant. To him she revealed frankly her mother's plans; and her own resolve not to yield to her, nor listen to any proposals from Mr. Hoverhill.</p> 
               <p>"I do all I can to avoid him," she said, warmly. "I had no idea he would fall in love with me! He, last night (out it must come to you, dear Arley) offered himself to me. I refused him firmly, but kindly, and told him I was not my own, but Mortimer's! He then implored me not to drive all hope from his heart! perhaps Mortimer might not continue in the same mind-as if dear Mortimer could ever forget me!"</p> 
               <p>"What does your father and mother say?" asked Arley, with deep interest.</p> 
               <p>"He spoke to them first, and got their consent; for mother makes father think as she does. What shall I do, Arley? Oh! what shall I do?"</p> 
               <p>"Did you give him any hope?" asked Arley, with a gravity becoming an old Quakeress.</p> 
               <p>"None, none! I begged him not to think of me again. I told him I was grateful to him; for what young lady can be otherwise, for the preference over others of her sex, declared to her by a handsome young man? I could not, for the world, treat rudely a gentleman who has expressed his regard for me. Such ought always to be friends. I do hope he will leave to-morrow, as he has said he intends to do."</p> 
               <p>"Did he say he would to you?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I am to see him no more. 'Ma knows this. She is so very, very angry. She says I can choose where I will, being a fortune and all that. I would rather have been poor, and so married Mortimer at the last. Dear me! oh, what shall I do?</p> 
               <p>"Don't be alarmed," said Arley, affectionately embracing her; "you will yet marry him, Annie," added Arley, with a knowing smile. "The will, my father says, bequeaths to you the forty thousand dollars only on the supposition that you marry my brother."</p> 
               <p>"Does it say so! Oh, joy! joy! Tell me truly?"</p> 
               <p>"The witnesses say that Mr. Wylie Dutton, in making the will, declared that he wished to give some testimony of his regard to my brother, for his kindness to him (though people should never reward kindness, I think), and said to them-</p> 
               <p>"'As I hear he is engaged to be married to my niece, Annie, I give and bequeath to her forty thousand dollars, to be paid her on the day of her marriage; and in this way I try to reward them both'."</p> 
               <p>"Was it so? oh, was it so?" cried Annie, with excitement flashing in her eyes.</p> 
               <p>"Yes. You may ask my father, if you doubt my knowledge of the will," answered Arley, quietly.</p> 
               <p>"Then I am saved!" she cried, bursting into tears of joy and weeping on her friend's<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6857-00000042"/> shoulder. "Let my mother know this, dear Arley."</p> 
               <p>"No, not at present. Let us wait. There is time, when worst comes to worst, to bring out the real truth, and withdraw the vail. Perhaps Mr. Haverhill may leave, as he says, for Boston; and as you have said you will see him no more, there will be an end to it, and nobody hurt by it."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I hope he will go. I love Mortimer as much as Eve loved Adam (and I am sure no love can exceed hers), and I will never marry any one but Mortimer!</p> 
               <p>Thus terminated impressively the interview between the two young friends. The next day, Edward Haverhill did not leave Hollowell for Boston. How could he? Love knows no laws. Love, for the time, induces a temporary delirium tremens. The subject of the attack is passive, and not responsible to reasonable people who have never been in love, or who, having been, have been thoroughly cured of it. At the inn, that night, after proposing to Annie, he did not sleep a wink. All night he was thinking of Annie. She seemed to be an angel hovering over him, and showering upon him blessings in the shape of wreaths and baskets of flowers; and now singing to him from the invisible skies seraphic melodies, and now going before him and guiding him to palaces of love and delight in realms of bliss. In the morning, his first resolve was, "I will not go to Boston to-day"; his second was, "I will again urge my suit. All is fair in love. What is Mortimer Willett to me? The moment I fall in love with a lady he loves, we become antagonists. Perish friendship masculine, so that love feminine lives! I will see her again to-day. There is her weak and vain mother, I know, will aid me all in her power. She told me as much. Willett is poor; I am rich. Both father and mother will stand on my side. I would not, for the world, try to compel a fair maiden to marry me; but young girls don't know their own hearts. I am sure I can make her as good and kind a husband as Willett. One thing is certain: if I marry her not, there is but one girl in the world I ever could marry, and that is-but no matter. She is pure, chaste, lovely, beyond her sex, though poor and obscure. Her virtues are her diamonds! I cannot, however, marry sweet Mary Dutton-all my family would discard me. When once I proposed it, telling my 'aristocratic friends how much I loved her, poor as she was, they held up their hands in holy horror. I do believe, moral people as all my rich relations are, they would rather I would have ruined that sweet, lovely girl than honorably married her! But cut off my right hand and pluck out my right eye first. I do believe that God has especial judgments for seducers of innocence. Virginity was sanctified in the sinless conception of the son of Mary, as well as marriage, in a virgin giving birth to a son. He who destroys the laws of marriage, or of virgin purity, has a higher damnation, therefore, than other men. Never be this stain on my earthly escutcheon-this crime written by the Recording Angel-against the name of Edward Haverhill for adjudgment at the last day!"</p> 
               <p>At this moment a servant entered his room, to tell him that the Portland stage was ready.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, true! But I will not go to-day," he answered, and leisurely resumed his dressing.</p> 
               <p>The reader has understood from the foregoing soliloquy of young Haverhill, that he had a previous love. It was the eldest daughter of the "poor brother Richard". In Boston, Mr. Richard Dutton sometimes fitted lads for the lowest class in college. Edward Haverhill was with him the year prior to his admission to college. It was not possible, that, studying so long with the parent, he did not sometimes see the daughter; for the school in which Mr. Dutton received eight young men was in his own parlor. It is true, he kept his school as separated from his house as possible; but youths and maidens have a natural affinity for one another, and one might as well guard the flowers from the moonbeams as girls from boys.</p> 
               <p>The beautiful Mary Dutton had often been caught sight of the handsome boy; and by-and-by he grew so bold as to fling a bouquet into the window where she sat; and, as it was not flung back, he sent another and another day after day; but no words passed between them. But one day he was coming to his studies in a sharp and sudden rain. He overtook "the schoolmaster's daughter", who, returning from an errand, was vainly trying to protect herself from the deluge with her shawl over her bonnet. In a moment, young Haverhill was at her side, and escorted the blushing and pleased girl to the door, himself scarcely blushing less than she; for youth is always embarrassed in the presence of beauty, whether it be the bloom-cheek girl who sells apples on the wayside-stand or the daughter of a millionaire.</p> 
               <p>Haverhill was perfectly fascinated. The way and smile with which she thanked him completed his capture. From that hour he was her knight! Secretly, however, he kept his love, and never but once revealed to her his secret. It was the evening before he was to leave for college. It was a stolen meeting. He was passing, and asked her little brother to tell her that "some one wanted to see her at the gate".</p> 
               <p>The house was humble, and separated from the street only by a narrow flower-yard not twenty feet wide.</p> 
               <p>"Don't tell her who it is, Harry?" he said; "and here is an apple for you."</p> 
               <p>So Harry went in with great mystery in his eyes, and delivered the message where-with he was charged!</p> 
               <p>It was a bright moonlight-night, when everybody was out of doors, either at their gates or on their stoops, enjoying the beauties of the night.</p> 
               <p>"Who is it, Harry? I can't go unless you tell me who it is?"</p> 
               <p>"He gave me an apple not to tell!"</p> 
               <p>"It is a gentleman, then?"</p> 
               <p>"I can't tell you."</p> 
               <p>"Then I can't go."</p> 
               <p>"Won't you tell if I tell you?"</p> 
               <p>"No," she answered, smiling.</p> 
               <p>"Well, it is that handsome Ned Haverhill, whose father is so rich, and who is going to college to-morrow."</p> 
               <p>Mary blushed warmly.</p> 
               <p>"Go away, Harry. You may run up and play in the moonlight a little while with Bob Summers!"</p> 
               <p>"O Gemini! that is better than an apple!" he shouted, bounding away.</p> 
               <p>Mary was not long in appearing at the little street-gate. She only delayed to smooth her hair, and, perhaps, to recover sufficient courage: for while love makes lovers the boldest of men and women, at times; so, at times, it renders them the most timid. It is a sweet timidity which takes possession of them, not an awkward one at all-one that makes them only the more attractive.</p> 
               <p>"I am going in the morning, Mary!" said Edward. "I am glad you came out. It shows me you do not dislike me."</p> 
               <p>Love is always jealous.</p> 
               <p>"I never disliked you, Edward," answered Mary Dutton. "I never had any cause to do so."</p> 
               <p>"I hope not. I was doubtful if you would come out. I have been walking up and down before your house for half an hour, hoping you would come to the gate, as every body is out. Will you remember me?"</p> 
               <p>"I never can forget you, Edward. You and I can never be otherwise than friends."</p> 
               <p>"I know it, Mary. You are now seventeen-I am nineteen. I dare not ask you to wait for me till I get through college?"</p> 
               <p>"It would not be prudent, Edward. My father is poor-yours is rich. You move in a different sphere, and will always do so. We can be friends, but nothing more!"</p> 
               <p>"If you were rich, would you engage yourself to me?" he asked, taking both her hands in his, and daring to press the tips of the soft, pretty fingers to his lips.</p> 
               <p>She would have withdrawn them; but, as she did not try very hard, he held them firmly.</p> 
               <p>"If you loved me as much when you leave college, I would! But not now. I love you, Edward; you know not how I love you. But fortune separates us forever!"</p> 
               <p>We will not prolong our narration of the interview. It was a juvenile love-affair-full of tears, protestations, jealousies, and exquisite happiness.</p> 
               <p>They parted, never expecting to meet again; because one was poor, and the other rich. Ah! these walls of gold, though not a foot high, are as impassable as those of Babylon, one hundred feet high! There is no climbing over a golden wall, however low. Lover's scaling-ladders are helpless, and assault is impotent. Rather a thousand feet of wall of clay than one inch of wall of gold between me and my lady-love!</p> 
               <p>They parted, these young hearts, the severance of which was the splitting of a gold dollar in two, leaving only two shining fragments.</p> 
               <p>So they parted. He promised to write to her. She begged he would not do so.</p> 
               <p>"Do we not love one another?" he asked, earnestly, with tears in his eyes.</p> 
               <p>"Oh yes! But we can no more than love, Edward," she answered, with tremulous accents. "It is not wrong to love; but no more-I cannot let you write to me. I cannot reply to your letters. Let us be happy in each other's love-as brother and sister. Good night! God bless you!"</p> 
               <p>She wrong his hand. He would not let it or her go. He was at the age when love is strongest, as buds of roses are with more difficulty torn apart than full-blown flowers.</p> 
               <p>So they parted, loving as Heaven intended they should love; but as earth (and Mammon, its god) forbid they should love.</p> 
               <p>They parted with beating hearts, with kisses of pure and chaste emotion, with embraces that knew no evil, with the innocence of angels.</p> 
               <p>He went his way to his splendidly-lighted home; and she, Mary Dutton, the poor schoolmaster's daughter, to where she could weep alone, and where even the moonlight could not penetrate the sacredness of her sorrow. What was the place she sought? The little, dark schoolroom; and, of course, the very desk where Edward had sat at for months. In his seat she took her seat; and laying her hands crossed upon the desk, and her face bowed upon her hands, she cried as if her heart would break.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head> 
               <p>The reader will now perceive that Edward Haverhill was in love with two cousins, not knowing them to be cousins.</p> 
               <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6857-00000043"/> 
               <p>After he had breakfasted and made his toilet to his satisfaction, the rich young collegian lounged in the direction of the residence of Mr. Temple. On the way he met that gentleman, limping down to town to hear the daily gossip and news.</p> 
               <p>"What, Mr. Haverhill! I am glad to see you again. Wife said you were to go today."</p> 
               <p>"No, Sir;" I concluded to stay," he answered. "The truth is, I am a very unhappy man. I am deeply in love with your daughter. You know my family, Sir."</p> 
               <p>"The best in New England! I am highly honored, Sir-"</p> 
               <p>"But Annie has refused me! I am going to try once more, as Mrs. Temple informed me that the engagement would be perfectly satisfactory to you both!"</p> 
               <p>"Perfectly, my dear Sir," answered Mr. Temple, trying to disguise his satisfaction, by biting his lips and rubbing his ankle. "She can never have her mother's consent (nor mine, of course, in such a case), to marry young Willett. It will be (this is confidential, Sir), just as Mrs. Willett says."</p> 
               <p>"Then I will once more see Mrs. Willett," answered Haverhill. "I wish you a very good morning, Sir."</p> 
               <p>"Good-good morning, Mr. Haverhill. Be assured of my favor in the transaction."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, Sir," answered Haverhill. And he hastened to the abode of the fair Annie.</p> 
               <p>It was rather early to make a call; of which he was reminded by seeing the windows up, and the house airing with the pillows hanging over the sill, and catching of the notable and busy housewife, Mrs. Temple, with a kerchief tied about her head, and a broom in her hand.</p> 
               <p>"It won't do for me to call for an hour yet," he said, looking at his watch. "It is nearly ten o'clock. I will stroll into the romantic grove by the waterfall awhile, to kill the time."</p> 
               <p>So he turned his steps in the direction of "The Cascades". He had heard of them but not seen them before; and as he stood by the brink over which the swift waters plunged amid the deep gloom of the pine-shaded glen, he was struck with the beauty and wild grandeur of the scene. For awhile he sat upon a moss-covered stone, and gazed upon the moving waters, and mused upon the past; for when we muse quietly, it is the past we think of; but when we think <choice>

               <p>"Am I truly honest in loving Annie and wishing to marry her, when my heart is one half belonging to sweet Mary Dutton in Boston. But I cannot marry Mary. My family would rise in arms! Next to her I love Annie, and I believe it is because she so wonderfully resembles Mary. I was struck with it the first moment I beheld her! only Annie has more bonhomie and sociability; while Mary is as timid as a dove-but wonderfully are they like each other, even in the tones of the voice. Thus, my love for Annie ought to be regarded by Mary Dutton, if she knew the real secret of it, as a compliment! But what if Annie refuses me! Shall I marry her against her will? If she loves Mortimer, am I an honorable man in trying to steal her love away from him?</p> 
               <p>He suddenly started up and walked quickly away, as if his meditations were becoming unpleasant, and he would banish his thoughts. To his surprise, he had not gone ten steps, when, in going round a high rock that hung half suspended above the chasm, he came upon a pair of lovers. Lovers they were, unmistakably; for the maiden was blushing and picking a flower to pieces, with her eyes cast to the ground, while by her side walked the lover, pressing the hand that held the torn rose, and with eloquent pleadings in his fine blue eyes, was audibly urging his suit.</p> 
               <p>It was a surprise to both parties. Haverhill bowed and passed on, like a true-bred man, as if he had noticed nothing, while the lovers, separating like lightning, seemed both to be gazing upon the blue sky, with as much curiosity as if they then beheld it for the first time.</p> 
               <p>Haverhill recognized the lady but not the gentleman.</p> 
               <p>"Who can the handsome fellow be who is playing the tender so devoutly to Miss Charlotte Willett?" he asked himself. "What a nice color came to her cheek and brow as she saw me! How unsuccessfully he tried to look nonchalant! It is evidently a foregone love-conclusion. I wonder who he can be? and I wonder if Mrs. Temple has aired her house yet? I must be busy, too, in my love-matters. Bless me, what a charming place this grove and waterfall is for a sentimental walk! If I could only walk by moonlight here with Annie half an hour, she couldn't help saying 'Yes'. The atmosphere of the place is redolent of love. The waters chant 'L'Amour'; the trees rustle 'love', the birds sing songs of love, and the very skies are warm with love. The spell of love is here; and a maiden that ventures here with her swain, fancy free, will go forth bound to him in the chains of roses which are Love's shackles!"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Temple's rooms were at length in nice order, and she was dressed "for callers". She received Haverhill with delight, and expressed her joy that he had concluded to stay another day.</p> 
               <p>The result of this private interview was, that the managing mother gave her full consent to his marriage. When he spoke of her love for Mortimer, she assured him it was a childish attachment, with nothing in it, and that she cared no more for him than for fifty other young men. When he spoke of Mortimer's possible attachment for her (for he wanted to keep a clear conscience in the matter), she told him that Mortimer had already broken off the engagment, since he was only a clerk, and could not for years hope to marry her.</p> 
               <p>"No, Mr. Haverhill; there is nothing in the way of your having Annie," she concluded. "Shall I call her in?"</p> 
               <p>"If you please-"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Temple was already out of the room.</p> 
               <p>"Annie, Mr. Haverhill, the richest and handsomest young man in Boston, wishes to see you in the parlor. Go right in!" she said to her daughter in her room.</p> 
               <p>"I do not wish to see him, 'ma. Mr. Haverhill has had my answer. I cannot see him!"</p> 
               <p>"You must see him. I will be obeyed by you while you are under my roof. He has honorably offered himself. He has my full consent, and, of course, your father's. All that remains is yours! As for Mortimer, he must give you up, and you him! I dare say he'll try to keep the engagement when he knows you are an heiress. But he shall never marry you while I live! Come, dear! come, child! I ain't angry with you! Come, Annie dearest, and just go in and see Mr. Haverhill! He has stayed over to-day just to see you."</p> 
               <p>"I will obey you, mother. I think it is best I see him!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes. But beware! Don't you offend him. Don't say 'no', or I don't know what I might do," with a harsh frown and a menacing shake of the fist.</p> 
               <p>The rest was lost to Annie's ear as she closed the door.</p> 
               <p>Haverhill rose and bowed with a smile of gratification as Annie entered. Her cold and distant manner chilled him the next moment. How beautiful and statue-like she looked! Pale and calm, and yet evidently deeply moved within.</p> 
               <p>"You wish to see me, my mother says."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Miss Temple. I cannot abandon all hope! I have lingered to see you once more, and implore you to reverse your decision!"</p> 
               <p>"I thank you. Your preference does me great honor; but you know not how it embarrasses me. I am already engaged, as I have told you. Until Mortimer Willett releases me from that sacred bond, I cannot listen to any one. Do not urge me, Mr. Haverhill. I am grateful to you for-for-loving me; but I love another. I shall never forget your goodness, and that you have selected me out of so many others more worthy to make you happy!"</p> 
               <p>Her voice was vailed with tears. He rose, and, taking her hand, said, with emotion:</p> 
               <p>"Forgive me! I am wrong. I see you love Mortimer I was misinformed. Let us at least be friends. Farewell!"</p> 
               <p>He pressed her hand to his lips, and the next moment was gone.</p> 
               <p>Oh, what a weight was lifted from Annie Temple's heart! How fully did her noble spirit do justice to his manly generosity!</p> 
               <p>"May kind Heaven give him a wife worthy of him!" she sighed. "I know his heart bleeds, and he has made a noble sacrifice. I shall always esteem him."</p> 
               <p>The next hour, Edward Haverhill was on his way to his home in Boston.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Temple had overheard a part of the conversation by her ear being placed to the keyhole; she heard Annie say the words, "Until Mortimer releases me, I can listen to no one else."</p> 
               <p>When Annie left the room, she sought her own chamber, and locked herself in to escape any words from her mother.</p> 
               <p>For two hours afterward, Mrs. Temple was closely engaged in writing a letter to some one, which she herself took to the post-office, and secretly dropped into the box, as if she were doing an act which she did not wish to be witnessed. This done, she made several calls, and told every one that Annie's engagement was broken off with Mortimer; "but she didn't think she'd be disengaged long-a girl with such a fortune as she was to have the day she should marry!"</p> 
               <p>"There'll be another engagement and marriage, too, I guess," remarked her friend; "for everybody says that the young English lord, who was hurt in the great stage accident, has addressed her!"</p> 
               <p>"A lord addressed poor Arley Willett!" exclaimed Mrs. Temple, her lip curling with a sneer of jealousy. "He's only fooling."</p> 
               <p>"Not her; for he is there every day, and walks out with her; and where have you been you haven't heard of it, Mrs. Willett?"</p> 
               <p>"Thinking about my own affairs. Since we got this moving, we are very busy trying to get furniture for our new house-for I mean to hold up my head with the best now; and them that snubbed me when poor Temple lost his money, I'll snub now with a will! If he had seen my daughter then it would not be so strange; but such a milk and cherry girl as Charlotte Willett, and poor as a church-mouse!"</p> 
               <p>"That is not her fault. She has a fair skin and cherry lips," answered the other. "As for poor, ministers are not expected to<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6857-00000044"/> be rich, like other folks. Their respectability, like other people's, don't depend on what they are worth. A poor minister's daughter stands as high as a rich merchant's, as far as I have seen."</p> 
               <p>Charlotte Willett puts on too many airs. She needn't think her brother is going to get my child's forty thousand!"</p> 
               <p>With this speech, Mrs. Temple went on her ways; and we fear not very amiable ways at that. She determined to see about this story of the young lord, and stopped at the parsonage. Who should she come upon in the parlor but Arley and the nobleman, laughing and talking as merrily as possible, at which Mrs. Temple scowled as erst did Sathanus when he beheld Adam and Eve enjoying themselves in Eden with innocent mirth.</p> 
               <p>Arley betrayed no embarrassment at the call. She gracefully introduced to her the gentleman as "Mr. Herbert"; nothing more nor less than "Mr. Herbert". Mrs. Temple was not at her ease in their presence, and said, brusquely:</p> 
               <p>"Is your father in his study?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; I will go and-"</p> 
               <p>"No; I can go alone." And away she went, leaving Arley wondering what made her so vexed about something or another. Dr. Willett received his visitor with that gracious and stately deportment which distinguished this fine old gentleman of the ancient New England school of theology.</p> 
               <p>After a few moments' conversation about health, weather, and the dull times, Mrs. Temple said, abruptly:</p> 
               <p>"Doctor, who was that young gentleman I saw so at home down-stairs, in the parlor, with Miss Charlotte?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I suspect you mean Mr. Herbert," answered the venerable minister. "He is the young English gentleman who was injured in the stage-accident some time ago. Mortimer and Arley nursed him; he made great friends with my son, and has fallen in love with my daughter!"</p> 
               <p>"How dreadful!"</p> 
               <p>"Dreadful, Mrs. Temple!"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I can't bear them foreigners!"</p> 
               <p>"Arley fancies them, for she has engaged herself to him, and they are to be married on his return from Quebec, some four weeks hence."</p> 
               <p>"Then he is not a lord at all?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, I dare say he is. I know him to be a very respectable young man. In England, he would be called the Earl of Pembroke; but in this republican land, simply Mr. Charles Herbert."</p> 
               <p>"You don't say he is an earl?"</p> 
               <p>"In England, Mrs. Temple."</p> 
               <p>"And you so calm about it! Don't believe he will ever come back to marry Arley."</p> 
               <p>"Dr. Willett looked displeased; and Mrs. Temple rose and departed. She had not been in her house five minutes before she questioned Annie, who said she had known of the engagement for several days between Arley Willett and the young Englishman.</p> 
               <p>"Annie!" and Mrs. Temple seemed to be choking with some great idea.</p> 
               <p>"What, mother?"</p> 
               <p>"Don't you think you could catch this Earl (for Doctor Willett, and he never told a lie in his life, says he is so). You know Arley hasn't much tact. An earl is better than to be the rich Mrs. Haverhill! An earl's wife is a duchess, or at least an earless-"</p> 
               <p>"A countess, 'ma!"</p> 
               <p>"Indeed! A countess! How that would sound! The Countess Annie (what's his name? oh-Herbert), the Countess Herbert; and I your mother! This would be a triumph. This would revenge me for the high heads since we came down. But we are going up again! Now, Annie, I want you to catch this earl!"</p> 
               <p>"Arley has already caught him; or rather he her, 'ma," answered Annie, smiling, yet piqued.</p> 
               <p>"But you can fascinate him, were he ten times caught by such a lily-white and soft-butter as she is!"</p> 
               <p>"Mother, I have a true lover in Mortimer; and, if I had not, I should be the last person to steal another girl's away, especially Arley's."</p> 
               <p>In vain Mrs. Temple urged, scolded, stormed, and threatened! Annie was firm.</p> 
               <p>Are there many such mothers as Mrs. Temple? Yea, many. To such there is neither honor, nor true love, nor truth, nor duty, nor purity. To such, all that is holy in love should sacrifice itself to all that is low in avarice. Many a daughter has been sacrificed by managing mothers!</p> 
               <p>The next day, Arley bade a brief farewell to her foreign lover. Mrs. Temple said he would never come back, because she hoped he would never come back; for so envious was her character, she <choice>

                     <corr>did</corr>
                  </choice> not desire Arley, "the poor daughter of the minister," to marry better than Annie, though Mr. Haverhill's wife; for his wife she resolved she should be.</p> 
               <p>Let us return to Mortimer, thus persistently conspired against.</p> 
               <p>He was in his counting-room, leaning over his desk and ledger. He could not help the fair image of Annie, in miniature, filling all the spaces of the ciphers in his figures. She looked out from every one of them into his face, her own full of love. As he knew of her fortune, sometimes the thought came over him that others might seek to win her-that it was barely possible he might lose her.</p> 
               <p>"Letters, Sir," said the office-boy, and handed one to Mortimer.</p> 
               <p>The superscription was in a strange hand. He turned aside and opened it; and he read as follows, with what feelings our readers may easily conceive:</p>

                           <p>"MR. WILLETT:-This is to inform you that you needn't think any more about Annie, as she don't about you. She wishes the engagement broke off. She says she cannot listen to Mr. Haverhill till it is; and when it is she'll accept him. He is a very proper and rich person, and has fell desperately in love with my daughter, and is wealthy, and don't love her for her fortune as some others I won't name might, Mr. Haverhill proposed this morning, and Ann only waits 'to get off the old love before she puts on the new', as Shakespeare says. So, if you are a man of honor and a Christian, you'll not let your left hand know what your right hand doeth, nor look 'after filthy lucre', as the Bible says, and write to Annie that you don't any longer hold her bound to you by that silly engagement, which, when she was poor was well enough, <choice>

               <p>What could be the result of this letter! Anger, pain, grief, and hostility-the last toward Haverhill. Pleading sudden illness, Mortimer hastened to the privacy of his room. Hours of anguish he passed, and at length wrote Annie, inclosing her mother's letter, and relieving her, if she desired it. On his way to the post-office, he met Haverhill, who had that afternoon reached Boston. He passed him without other recognition than a flashing gaze of fierce anger. Haverhill's conscience interpreted the look. That night he slept not until he had seen Mortimer, explained all, and assured him of the devotion of Annie and the falsity of her mother's letter! The two friends became once more friends. Conversing at length of other matters, Mortimer related the history of the will, and how Major Dutton had enriched his brother Richard and his family.</p> 
               <p>"The father of Mary Dutton?" exclaimed Haverhill.</p> 
               <p>"Yes."</p> 
               <p>"The schoolmaster?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes."</p> 
               <p>"With a hundred thousand, and removed last week you say to the elegant villa of Major Dutton as their own?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, yes! What is the matter?"</p> 
               <p>"I'll go and marry Mary Dutton to-morrow, if she'll have me! A cousin of Annie, too! That is next to it!"</p> 
               <p>Our story is done. Love triumphed over all. The young English earl returned in due time from Montreal, and married Arley Willett in the old South Church; her father performing the marriage-service, and old Doctor Vaughan giving away the bride. Scarcely had they returned from the altar before Mortimer Willett led to it the charming and faithful Annie, and then and there the two were united in the holy bonds of wedlock; and the newspapers printed in Boston the same day, but which were two days in getting to Hollowell, contained the following finale to this triangular marriage:</p> 
               <p>"Married, in Trinity Church, Summer street, by the Reverend Doctor Eastburn, Edward Haverhill, Esq., to Miss Mary Dutton, of Roxbury."</p> 
               <p>Thus true love's current did run smooth. Mrs. Temple was as happy as naughty people can be (for the bad are never quite happy, as real happiness proceeds from within and comes not to the heart from any outward events), and thought her daughter had done well; especially since she had learned that Annie's fortune depended wholly on her sharing it with Mortimer, and nobody else!</p> 
               <p>Doctor Willett lived to a good old age, happy in the prosperity of his children, which he showed. Sometimes he would smile with paternal pride as Doctor Vaughan would now and then show him a paragraph in a London paper, such as:</p> 
               <p>"The Countess of Pembroke, the lovely American wife of the Earl, was at the Queen's reception yesterday." Or, "The Countess of Pembroke has given birth to a son."</p> 
               <p>Mortimer became, and now is, one of the leading Boston merchants.</p> 
               <p>Poor Joe, the idiot, still lives with him, as a privileged character, but always useful.</p> 
               <p>Of our other characters, we have no more to say than has been said. If our story does good, and "holds the mirror up to Nature" to all the Mrs. Temples who read it, we have our reward. Truth and honesty are mighty to prevail; while all wrong-doing has, like the fabled serpent, a sting in its tail.</p>
