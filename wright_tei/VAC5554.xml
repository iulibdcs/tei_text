                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>MY DEAR SIR: I am happy to assure you that your anxiety is
                     without reason. Flemming will be confined to the sofa for three or four weeks,
                     and will have to be careful at first how he uses his leg. A fracture of this
                     kind is always a tedious affair. Fortunately, the bone was very skilfully set
                     by the surgeon who chanced to be in the drug-store where Flemming was brought
                     after his fall, and I apprehend no permanent inconvenience from the accident.
                        <emph>Flemming is doing, perfectly well physically;</emph> but I must
                     confess that the irritable and morbid state of mind into which he has<pb
                        n="8-9" xml:id="VAC5554-00000005"/> fallen causes me a great deal of
                     uneasiness. He is the last man in the world who ought to break his leg. You
                     know how impetuous our friend is ordinarily, what a soul of restlessness and
                     energy, never content unless he is rushing at some object, like a sportive bull
                     at a red shawl; but amiable withal. He is no longer amiable. His temper has
                     become something frightful. Miss Fanny Flemming came up from Newport, where the
                     family are staying for the summer, to nurse him; but he packed her off the next
                     morning in tears. He has a complete set of Balzac's works, twenty-seven
                     volumes, piled up near his sofa, to throw at Watkins whenever that exemplary
                     serving-man appears with his meals. Yesterday I very innocently brought
                     Flemming a small basket of lemons. You know it was a strip of lemon-peel on the
                     curbstone that caused our friend's mischance. Well, he no sooner set his eyes
                     upon these lemons than he fell into such a rage as I cannot adequately
                     describe. This is only one of his moods, and the least distressing. At other
                     times he sits with bowed head regarding his splintered limb, silent, sullen,
                     despairing. When this fit is on him—and it sometimes lasts all day—nothing can
                     distract his melancholy. He refuses to cat, does not even read the newspapers;
                     books, except as projectiles for Watkins, have no charms for him. His state is
                     truly pitiable.</p>
                  <p>Now, if he were a poor man, with a family depending on his daily labor, this
                     irritability and despondency would be natural enough. But in a young fellow of
                     twenty-four, with plenty of money and seemingly not a care in the world, the
                     thing is monstrous. If he continues to give way to his vagaries in this manner,
                     he will end by bringing on an inflammation of the fibula. It was the fibula he
                     broke. I am at my wits' end to know what to prescribe for him. I have
                     anæsthetics and lotions, to make people sleep and to soothe pain; but I've no
                     medicine that will make a man have a little common-sense. That is beyond my
                     skill, but maybe it is not beyond yours. You are Flemming's intimate friend,
                     his <foreign xml:lang="LAT">fidus Achates</foreign>. Write to him, write to him
                     frequently, distract his mind, cheer him up, and prevent him from becoming a
                     confirmed case of melancholia. Perhaps he has some important<pb n="10-11"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000006"/> tant plans disarranged by his present
                     confinement. If he has you will know, and will know how to advise him
                     judiciously. I trust your father finds the change beneficial? I am, my dear
                     sir, with great respect, etc.</p>

                     <hi rend="i"/>MY DEAR JACK: I had a line from Dillon this morning, and was
                     rejoiced to learn that your hurt is not so bad as reported. Like a certain
                     personage, you are not so black and blue as you are painted. Dillon will put
                     you on your pins again in two or three weeks, if you will only have patience
                     and follow his counsels. Did you get my note of last Wednesday? I was greatly
                     troubled when I heard of the accident.</p>
                  <p>I can imagine how tranquil and saintly you are with your leg in a trough! It is
                     deuced awkward, to be sure, just as we had promised ourselves a glorious month
                     together at the seaside; but we must make the best of it. It is unfortunate,
                     too, that my father's health renders it impossible for me to leave him. I think
                     he has much improved; the sea air is his native<pb n="12-13"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000007"/> element; but he still needs my arm to lean upon
                     in his walks, and requires some one more careful than a servant to look after
                     him. I cannot come to you, dear Jack, but I have hours of unemployed time on
                     hand, and I will write you a whole post-office full of letters if that will
                     divert you. Heaven knows, I have n't anything to write about. It is n't as if
                     we were living at one of the beach houses; then I could do you some character
                     studies, and fill your imagination with groups of sea-goddesses, with their (or
                     somebody else's) raven and blond manes hanging down their shoulders. You should
                     have Aphrodite in morning wrapper, in evening costume, and in her prettiest
                     bathing suit. But we are far from all that here. We have rooms in a farm-house
                     on a cross-road, two miles from the hotels, and lead the quietest of lives.</p>
                  <p>I wish I were a novelist. This old house, with its sanded floors and high
                     wainscots, and its narrow windows looking out upon a cluster of pines that turn
                     themselves into æolian-harps every time the wind blows, would be the place in
                     which to write a summer romance. It should be a story with the odors of the
                     forest and the breath of the sea in it. It should be a novel like one of that
                     Russian fellow's,—what's his name?—Tourguénieff,—Turguenef, Turgenif,
                     Toorguniff, Turgénjew,—nobody knows how to spell him. Yet I wonder if even a
                     Liza or an Alexandra Paulovna could stir the heart of a man who has constant
                     twinges in his leg. I wonder if one of our own Yankee girls of the best type,
                     haughty and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">spirituelle</foreign>, would be of any
                     comfort to you in your present deplorable condition. If I thought so, I would
                     hasten down to the Surf House and catch one for you; or, better still, I would
                     find you one over the way.</p>
                  <p>Picture to yourself a large white house just across the road, nearly opposite
                     our cottage. It is not a house, but a mansion, built, perhaps, in the colonial
                     period, with rambling extensions, and gambrel roof, and a wide piazza on three
                     sides,—a self-possessed, high-bred piece of architecture, with its nose in the
                     air. It stands back from the road, and has an obsequious retinue of fringed
                     elms and oaks and weeping willows. Sometimes in the morning, and oftener in the
                     afternoon, when the sun has withdrawn from that part of<pb n="14-15"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000008"/> the mansion, a young woman appears on the piazza
                     with some mysterious Penelope web of embroidery in her hand, or a book. There
                     is a hammock over there,—of pineapple fibre, it looks from here. A hammock is
                     very becoming when one is eighteen, and has golden hair, and dark eyes, and an
                     emerald-colored illusion dress looped up after the fashion of a Dresden china
                     shepherdess, and is <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chaussée</foreign> like a belle of
                     the time of Louis Quatorze. All this splendor goes into that hammock, and sways
                     there like a pond-lily in the golden afternoon. The window of my bedroom looks
                     down on that piazza,—and so do I.</p>
                  <p>But enough of this nonsense, which ill becomes a sedate young attorney taking
                     his vacation with an invalid father. Drop me a line, dear Jack, and tell me how
                     you really are. State your case. Write me a long, quiet letter. If you are
                     violent or abusive, I'll take the law to you.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>YOUR letter, dear Ned, was a godsend. Fancy what a fix I am
                     in,—I, who never had a day's sickness since I was born. My left leg weighs
                     three tons. It is embalmed in spices and smothered in layers of fine linen,
                     like a mummy. I can't move. I have n't moved for five thousand years. I'm of
                     the time of Pharaoh.</p>
                  <p>I lie from morning till night on a lounge, staring into the hot street.
                     Everybody is out of town enjoying himself. The brown-stone-front houses across
                     the street resemble a row of particularly ugly coffins set up on end. A green
                     mould is settling on the names of the deceased, carved on the silver
                     door-plates. Sardonic spiders have sewed up the key-holes. All is silence and
                     dust and desolation.—I interrupt this a moment, to take a shy at Watkins with
                     the second volume of César Birotteau. Missed him!<pb n="16-17"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000009"/> I think I could bring him down with a copy of
                     Sainte-Beuve or the Dictionnaire Universel, if I had it. These small Balzac
                     books somehow don't quite fit my hand; but I shall fetch him yet. I've an idea
                     Watkins is tapping the old gentleman's Château Yquem. Duplicate key of the
                     wine-cellar. Hibernian swarries in the front basement. Young Cheops up stairs,
                     snug in his cerements. Watkins glides into my chamber, with that colorless,
                     hypocritical face of his drawn out long like an accordion; but I know he grins
                     all the way down stairs, and is glad I have broken my leg. Was not my evil star
                     in the very zenith when I ran up to town to attend that dinner at Delmonico's?
                     I did n't come up altogether for that. It was partly to buy Frank Livingstone's
                     roan mare Margot. And now I shall not be able to sit in the saddle these two
                     months. I'll send the mare down to you at The Pines,—is that the name of the
                     place?</p>
                  <p>Old Dillon fancies that I have something on my mind. He drives me wild with
                     lemons. Lemons for a mind diseased! Nonsense. I im only as restless as the
                     devil under this confinement,—a thing I'm not used to. Take a man who has never
                     had so much as a headache or a toothache in his life, strap one of his legs in
                     a section of water-spout, keep him in a room in the city for weeks, with the
                     hot weather turned on, and then expect him to smile and purr and be happy! It
                     is preposterous. I can't be cheerful or calm.</p>
                  <p>Your letter is the first consoling thing I have had since my disaster, ten days
                     ago. It really cheered me up for half an hour. Send me a screed, Ned, as often
                     as you can, if you love me. Anything will do. Write me more about that little
                     girl in the hammock. That was very pretty, all that about the Dresden china
                     shepherdess and the pond-lily; the imagery a little mixed, perhaps, but very
                     pretty. I did n't suppose you had so much sentimental furniture in your upper
                     story. It shows how one may be familiar for years with the reception-room of
                     his neighbor, and never suspect what is directly under his mansard. I supposed
                     your loft stuffed with dry legal parchments, mortgages and affidavits; you take
                     down a package of manuscript, and lo! there are lyrics and sonnets and
                     canzonettas. You really have a graphic descriptive<pb n="18-19"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000010"/> touch, Edward Delaney, and I suspect you of
                     anonymous love-tales in the magazines.</p>
                  <p>I shall be a bear until I hear from you again. Tell me all about your pretty
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">inconnue</foreign> across the road. What is her
                     name? Who is she? Who's her father? Where's her mother? Who's her lover? You
                     cannot imagine how this will occupy me. The more trifling the better. My
                     imprisonment has weakened me intellectually to such a degree that I find your
                     epistolary gifts quite considerable. I am passing into my second childhood. In
                     a week or two I shall take to India-rubber rings and prongs of coral. A silver
                     cup, with an appropriate inscription, would be a delicate attention on your
                     part. In the mean time, write!</p>

                     tedious,—the bow-string and the sack, and two Nubians to drop him into the
                     Piscataqua! But, truly, Jack, I have a hard task. There is literally nothing
                     here,—except the little girl over the way. She is swinging in the hammock at
                     this moment. It is to me compensation for many of the ills of life to see her
                     now and then put out a small kid boot, which fits like a glove, and set herself
                     going. Who is she, and what is her name? Her name is Daw. Only daughter of Mr.
                     Richard W. Daw, ex-colonel and banker. Mother dead. One brother at Harvard,
                     elder brother killed at the battle of Fair Oaks, nine years ago. Old, rich
                     family, the Daws. This is the homestead, where father and daughter pass<pb
                        n="20-21" xml:id="VAC5554-00000011"/> eight months of the twelve; the rest
                     of the year in Baltimore and Washington. The New England winter too many for
                     the old gentleman. The daughter is called Marjorie,—Marjorie Daw. Sounds odd at
                     first, does n't it? But after you say it over to yourself half a dozen times,
                     you like it. There's a pleasing quaintness to it, something prim and
                     violet-like. Must be a nice sort of girl to be called Marjorie Daw.</p>
                  <p>I had mine host of The Pines in the witness-box last night, and drew the
                     foregoing testimony from him. He has charge of Mr. Daw's vegetable-garden, and
                     has known the family these thirty years. Of course I shall make the
                     acquaintance of my neighbors before many days. It will be next to impossible
                     for me not to meet Mr. Daw or Miss Daw in some of my walks. The young lady has
                     a favorite path to the sea-beach. I shall intercept her some morning, and touch
                     my hat to her. Then the princess will bend her fair head to me with courteous
                     surprise not unmixed with haughtiness. Will snub me, in fact. All this for thy
                     sake, O Pasha of the Snapt Axle-tree!.... How oddly things fall out! Ten
                     minutes ago I was called down to the parlor,—you know the kind of parlors in
                     farm-houses on the coast, a sort of amphibious parlor, with sea-shells on the
                     mantel-piece and spruce branches in the chimney-place,—where I found my father
                     and Mr. Daw doing the antique polite to each other. He had come to pay his
                     respects to his new neighbors. Mr. Daw is a tall, slim gentleman of about
                     fifty-five, with a florid face and snow-white mustache and side-whiskers. Looks
                     like Mr. Dombey, or as Mr. Dombey would have looked if he had served a few
                     years in the British Army. Mr. Daw was a colonel in the late war, commanding
                     the regiment in which his son was a lieutenant. Plucky old boy, backbone of New
                     Hampshire granite. Before taking his leave, the colonel delivered himself of an
                     invitation as if he were issuing a general order. Miss Daw has a few friends
                     coming, at 4 P. M., to play croquet on the lawn (parade-ground) and have tea
                     (cold rations) on the piazza. Will we honor them with our company? (or be sent
                     to the guard-house.) My father declines on the plea of ill-health. My father's
                     son bows with as much suavity as he knows, and accepts.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>THE party, my dear Jack, was as dreary as possible. A lieutenant
                     of the navy, the rector of the Episcopal church at Stillwater, and a society
                     swell from Nahant. The lieutenant looked as if he had swallowed a couple of his
                     buttons, and found the bullion rather indigestible; the rector was a pensive
                     youth, of the daffydowndilly sort; and the swell from Nahant was a very weak
                     tidal wave indeed. The women were much better, as they always are; the two Miss
                     Kingsburys of Philadelphia, staying at the Sea-shell House, two bright and
                     engaging girls. But Marjorie Daw!</p>
                  <p>The company broke up soon after tea, and I remained to smoke a cigar with the
                     colonel on the piazza. It was like seeing a picture to see Miss Marjorie
                     hovering around the old soldier, and doing a hundred gracious little things
                        for<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC5554-00000013"/> him. She brought the cigars and
                     lighted the tapers with her own delicate fingers, in the most enchanting
                     fashion. As we sat there, she came and went in the summer twilight, and seemed,
                     with her white dress and pale gold hair, like some lovely phantom that had
                     sprung into existence out of the smoke-wreaths. If she had melted into air,
                     like the statue of Galatea in the play, I should have been more sorry than
                     surprised.</p>
                  <p>It was easy to perceive that the old colonel worshipped her, and she him. I
                     think the relation between an elderly father and a daughter just blooming into
                     womanhood the most beautiful possible; There is in it a subtile sentiment that
                     cannot exist in the case of mother and daughter, or that of son and mother. But
                     this is getting into deep water.</p>
                  <p>I sat with the Daws until half past ten, and saw the moon rise on the sea. The
                     ocean, that had stretched motionless and black against the horizon, was changed
                     by magic into a broken field of glittering ice, interspersed with marvellous
                     silvery fjords. In the far distance the Isles of Shoals loomed up like a group
                     of huge bergs drifting down on us. The Polar Regions in a June Thaw! It was
                     exceedingly fine. What did we talk about? We talked about the weather—and
                        <emph>you!</emph> The weather has been disagreeable for several days
                     past,—and so have you. I glided from one topic to the other very naturally. I
                     told my friends of your accident; how it had frustrated all our summer plans,
                     and what our plans were. I played quite a spirited solo on the fibula. Then I
                     described you; or, rather, I did n't. I spoke of your amiability, of your
                     patience under this severe affliction; of your touching gratitude when Dillon
                     brings you little presents of fruit; of your tenderness to your sister Fanny,
                     whom you would not allow to stay in town to nurse you, and how you heroically
                     sent her back to Newport, preferring to remain alone with Mary, the cook, and
                     your man Watkins, to whom, by the way, you were devotedly attached. If you had
                     been there, Jack, you would n't have known yourself. I should have excelled as
                     a criminal lawyer, if I had not turned my attention to a different branch of
                     jurisprudence.</p>
                  <p>Miss Marjorie asked all manner of leading questions concerning you. It did not
                     occur to me<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC5554-00000014"/> then, but it struck me
                     forcibly afterwards, that she evinced a singular interest in the conversation.
                     When I got back to my room, I recalled how eagerly she leaned forward, with her
                     full, snowy throat in strong moonlight, listening to what I said. Positively, I
                     think I made her like you!</p>
                  <p>Miss Daw is a girl whom you would like immensely, I can tell you that. A beauty
                     without affectation, a high and tender nature,—if one can read the soul in the
                     face. And the old colonel is a noble character, too.</p>
                  <p>I am glad the Daws are such pleasant people. The Pines is an isolated spot, and
                     my resources are few. I fear I should have found life here somewhat monotonous
                     before long, with no other society than that of my excellent sire. It is true,
                     I might have made a target of the defenceless invalid; but I have n't a taste

                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>FOR a man who has n't a taste for artillery, it occurs to me, my
                     friend, you are keeping up a pretty lively fire on my inner works. But go on.
                     Cynicism is a small brass field-piece that eventually bursts and kills the
                     artilleryman.</p>
                  <p>You may abuse me as much as you like, and I'll not complain; for I don't know
                     what I should do without your letters. They are curing me. I have n't hurled
                     anything at Watkins since last Sunday, partly because I have grown more amiable
                     under your teaching, and partly because Watkins captured my ammunition one
                     night, and carried it off to the library. He is rapidly losing the habit he had
                     acquired of dodging whenever I rub my ear, or make any slight motion with my
                     right arm. He is still suggestive of the wine-cellar, however. You may break,
                     you may shatter<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5554-00000015"/> ter Watkins, if you
                     will, but the scent of the Roederer will Hang round him still.</p>
                  <p>Ned, that Miss Daw must be a charming person. I should certainly like her. I
                     like her already. When you spoke in your first letter of seeing a young girl
                     swinging in a hammock under your chamber window, I was somehow strangely drawn
                     to her. I cannot account for it in the least. What you have subsequently
                     written of Miss Daw has strengthened the impression. You seem to be describing
                     a woman I have known in some previous state of existence, or dreamed of in
                     this. Upon my word, if you were to send me her photograph, I believe I should
                     recognize her at a glance. Her manner, that listening attitude, her traits of
                     character, as you indicate them, the light hair and the dark eyes,—they are all
                     familiar things to me. Asked a lot of questions, did she? Curious about me?
                     That is strange.</p>
                  <p>You would laugh in your sleeve, you wretched old cynic, if you knew how I lie
                     awake nights, with my gas turned down to a star, thinking of The Pines and the
                     house across the road. How cool it must be down there! I long for the salt
                     smell in the air. I picture the colonel smoking his cheroot on the piazza. I
                     send you and Miss Daw off on afternoon rambles along the beach. Sometimes I let
                     you stroll with her under the elms in the moonlight, for you are great friends
                     by this time, I take it, and see each other every day. I know your ways and
                     your manners! Then I fall into a truculent mood, and would like to destroy
                     somebody. Have you noticed anything in the shape of a lover hanging around the
                     colonial Lares and Penates? Does that lieutenant of the horse-marines or that
                     young Stillwater parson visit the house much? Not that I am pining for news of
                     them, but any gossip of the kind would be in order. I wonder, Ned, you don't
                     fall in love with Miss Daw. I am ripe to do it myself. Speaking of photographs,
                     could n't you manage to slip one of her <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >cartes-de-visite</foreign> from her album,—she must have an album, you
                     know,—and send it to me? I will return it before it could be missed. That's a
                     good fellow! Did the mare arrive safe and sound? It will be a capital animal
                     this autumn for Central Park.</p>
                  <p>O—my leg? I forgot about my leg. It's better.</p>

                  <p>You are correct in your surmises. I am on the most friendly terms with our
                     neighbors. The colonel and my father smoke their afternoon cigar together in
                     our sitting-room or on the piazza opposite, and I pass an hour or two of the
                     day or the evening with the daughter. I am more and more struck by the beauty,
                     modesty, and intelligence of Miss Daw.</p>
                  <p>You ask me why I do not fall in love with her. I will be frank, Jack: I have
                     thought of that. She is young, rich, accomplished; uniting in herself more
                     attractions, mental and personal, than I can recall in any girl of my
                     acquaintance; but she lacks the something that would be necessary to inspire in
                     me that kind of interest. Possessing this unknown quantity, a woman neither
                     beautiful nor wealthy nor very young could bring me to her feet. But not Miss
                     Daw. If we were shipwrecked together on an uninhabited island,—let me suggest a
                     tropical island, for it costs no more to be picturesque,—I would build her a
                     bamboo hut, I would fetch her bread-fruit and cocoanuts, I would fry yams for
                     her, I would lure the ingenuous turtle and make her nourishing soups, but I
                     would n't make love to her,—not under eighteen months. I would like to have her
                     for a sister, that I might shield her and counsel her, and spend half my income
                     on thread-laces and camel's-hair shawls. (We are off the island now.) If such
                     were not my feeling, there would still be an obstacle to my loving Miss Daw. A
                     greater misfortune could scarcely befall me than to love her. Flemming, I am
                     about to make a revelation that will astonish you. I may be all wrong in my
                     premises and consequently in my conclusions ; but you shall judge.</p>
                  <p>That night when I returned to my room after the croquet party at the Daws', and
                     was thinking over the trivial events of the evening, I was suddenly impressed
                     by the air of eager attention with which Miss Daw had followed my account of
                     your accident. I think I mentioned this to you. Well, the next morning, as I
                     went to mail<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC5554-00000017"/> my letter, I overtook
                     Miss Daw on the road to Rye, where the post-office is, and accompanied her
                     thither and back, an hour's walk. The conversation again turned on you, and
                     again I remarked that inexplicable look of interest which had lighted up her
                     face the previous evening. Since then, I have seen Miss Paw perhaps ten times,
                     perhaps oftener, and on each occasion I found that when I was not speaking of
                     you, or your sister, or some person or place associated with you, I was not
                     holding her attention. She would be absent-minded, her eyes would wander away
                     from me to the sea, or to some distant object in the landscape; her fingers
                     would play with the leaves of a book in a way that convinced me she was not
                     listening. At these moments if I abruptly changed the theme,—I did it several
                     times as an experiment,—and dropped some remark about my friend Flemming, then
                     the sombre blue eyes would come back to me instantly.</p>
                  <p>Now, is not this the oddest telling in the world? No, not the oddest. The
                     effect which you tell me was produced on you by my casual mention of an unknown
                     girl swinging in a hammock is certainly as strange. You can conjecture how that
                     passage in your letter of Friday startled me. Is it possible, then, that two
                     people who have never met, and who are hundreds of miles apart, can exert a
                     magnetic influence on each other? I have read of such psychological phenomena,
                     but never credited them. I leave the solution of the problem to you. As for
                     myself, all other things being favorable, it would be impossible for me to fall
                     in love with a woman who listens to me only when I am talking of my friend!</p>
                  <p>I am not aware that any one is paying marked attention to my fair neighbor. The
                     lieutenant of the navy—he is stationed at Rivermouth—sometimes drops in of an
                     evening, and some times the rector from Stillwater; the lieutenant the oftener.
                     He was there last night. I would not be surprised if he had an eye to the
                     heiress; but he is not formidable. Mistress Daw carries a neat little spear of
                     irony, and the honest lieutenant seems to have a particular facility for
                     impaling himself on the point of it. He is not dangerous, I should say; though
                     I have known a woman to satirize a man for years, and marry him after all.
                     Decidedly, the lowly rector is not<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC5554-00000018"/>
                     dangerous; yet, again, who has not seen Cloth of Frieze victorious in the lists
                     where Cloth of Gold went down?</p>
                  <p>As to the photograph. There is an exquisite ivorytype of Marjorie, in
                     passe-partout, on the drawing-room mantel-piece. It would be missed at once, if
                     taken. I would do anything reasonable for you, Jack; but I've no burning desire
                     to be hauled up before the local justice of the peace, on a charge of petty
                     larceny.</p>
                  <p>P. S.—Enclosed is a spray of mignonette, which I advise you to treat tenderly.
                     Yes, we talked of you again last night, as usual. It is becoming a little
                     dreary for me.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>YOUR letter in reply to my last has occupied my thoughts all the
                     morning. I do not know what to think. Do you mean to say that you are seriously
                     half in love with a woman whom you have never seen,—with a shadow, a chimera?
                     for what else can Miss Daw be to you? I do not understand it at all. I
                     understand neither you nor her. You are a couple of ethereal beings moving in
                     finer air than I can breathe with my commonplace lungs. Such delicacy of
                     sentiment is something I admire without comprehending. I am bewildered. I am of
                     the earth earthy, and I find myself in the incongruous position of having to do
                     with mere souls, with natures so finely tempered that I run some risk of
                     shattering them in my awkwardness. I am as Caliban among the spirits!</p>
                  <p>Reflecting on your letter, I am not sure it is<pb n="36-37"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000019"/> wise in me to continue this correspondence. But
                     no, Jack; I do wrong to doubt the good sense that forms the basis of your
                     character. You are deeply interested in Miss Daw; you feel that she is a person
                     whom you may perhaps greatly admire when you know her: at the same time you
                     bear in mind that the chances are ten to five that, when you do come to know
                     her, she will fall far short of your ideal, and you will not care for her in
                     the least. Look at it in this sensible light, and I will hold back nothing from
                     you.</p>
                  <p>Yesterday afternoon my father and myself rode over to Rivermouth with the Daws.
                     A heavy rain in the morning had cooled the atmosphere and laid the dust. To
                     Rivermouth is a drive of eight miles, along a winding road lined all the way
                     with wild barberry-bushes. I never saw anything more brilliant than these
                     bushes, the green of the foliage and the pink of the coral berries intensified
                     by the rain. The colonel drove, with my father in front, Miss Daw and I on the
                     back seat. I resolved that for the first five miles your name should not pass
                     my lips. I was amused by the artful attempts she made, at the start, to break
                     through my reticence cence. Then a silence fell upon her; and then she became
                     suddenly gay. That keenness which I enjoyed so much when it was exercised on
                     the lieutenant was not so satisfactory directed against myself. Miss Daw has
                     great sweetness of disposition, but she can be disagreeable. She is like the
                     young lady in the rhyme, with the curl on her forehead, <q>
                        <lg type="stanza">
                           <l>"When she is good,</l>
                           <l>She is very, very good,</l>
                           <l>And when she is bad, she is horrid!"</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q> I kept to my resolution, however; but on the return home I relented, and
                     talked of your mare! Miss Daw is going to try a side-saddle on Margot some
                     morning. The animal is a trifle too light for my weight. By the by, I nearly
                     forgot to say Miss Daw sat for a picture yesterday to a Rivermouth artist. If
                     the negative turns out well, I am to have a copy. So our ends will be
                     accomplished without crime. I wish, though, I could send you the ivorytype in
                     the drawing-room; it is cleverly colored, and would give you an idea of her
                     hair and eyes, which of course the other will not.</p>
                  <p>No, Jack, the spray of mignonette did not<pb n="38-39"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000020"/> come from me. A man of twenty-eight does n't
                     enclose flowers in his letters—to another man. But don't attach too much
                     significance to the circumstance. She gives sprays of mignonette to the rector,
                     sprays to the lieutenant. She has even given a rose from her bosom to your
                     slave. It is her jocund nature to scatter flowers, like Spring.</p>
                  <p>If my letters sometimes read disjointedly, you must understand that I never
                     finish one at a sitting, but write at intervals, when the mood is on me.</p>
                  <p>The mood is not on me now.</p>

                        <hi rend="i"/>I HAVE just returned from the strangest interview with
                        Marjorie. She has all but confessed to me her interest in you. But with what
                        modesty and dignity! Her words elude my pen as I attempt to put them on
                        paper; and, indeed, it was not so much what she said as her manner; and that
                        I cannot reproduce. Perhaps it was of a piece with the strangeness of this
                        whole business, that she should tacitly acknowledge to a third party the
                        love she feels for a man she has never beheld! But I have lost, through your
                        aid, the faculty of being surprised. I accept things as people do in dreams.
                        Now that I am again in my room, it all appears like an illusion,—the black
                        masses of Rembrandtish shadow under the trees, the fire-flies whirling in
                        Pyrrhic dances among the shrubbery, the sea over there, Marjorie sitting on
                        the hammock!</p>

                  <p>You were passing into your second childhood, were you? Your intellect was so
                     reduced that my epistolary gifts seemed quite considerable to you, did they? I
                     rise superior to the sarcasm in your favor of the 11th instant, when I notice
                     that five days' silence on my part is sufficient to throw you into the depths
                     of despondency.</p>
                  <p>We returned only this morning from Appledore, that enchanted island,—at four
                     dollars per day. I find on my desk three letters from you! Evidently there is
                     no lingering doubt in <emph>your</emph> mind as to the pleasure I derive from
                     your correspondence. These letters are undated, but in what I take to be the
                     latest are two passages that require my consideration. You will pardon my
                     candor, dear Flemming, but the conviction forces itself upon me that as your
                     leg grows stronger your head becomes weaker. You ask<pb n="42-43"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000022"/> my advice on a certain point. I will give it. In
                     my opinion you could do nothing more unwise than to address a note to Miss Daw,
                     thanking her for the flower. It would, I am sure, offend her delicacy beyond
                     pardon. She knows you only through me; you are to her an abstraction, a figure
                     in a dream,—a dream from which the faintest shock would awaken her. Of course,
                     if you enclose a note to me and insist on its delivery, I shall deliver it; but
                     I advise you not to do so.</p>
                  <p>You say you are able, with the aid of a cane, to walk about your chamber, and
                     that you purpose to come to The Pines the instant Dillon thinks you strong
                     enough to stand the journey. Again I advise you not to. Do you not see that,
                     every hour you remain away, Marjorie's glamour deepens, and your influence over
                     her increases? You will ruin everything by precipitancy. Wait until you are
                     entirely recovered; in any case, do not come without, giving me warning. I fear
                     the effect of your abrupt advent here—under the circumstances.</p>
                  <p>Miss Daw was evidently glad to see us back again, and gave me both hands in the
                     frankest way. She stopped at the door a moment, this afternoon, in the
                     carriage; she had been over to Rivermouth for her pictures. Unluckily the
                     photographer had spilt some acid on the plate, and she was obliged to give him
                     another sitting. I have an intuition that something is troubling Marjorie. She
                     had an abstracted air not usual with her. However, it may be only my fancy.
                     ....I end this, leaving several things unsaid, to accompany my father on one of
                     those long walks which are now his chief medicine,—and mine!</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>I WRITE in great haste to tell you what has taken place here
                     since my letter of last night. I am in the utmost perplexity. Only one thing is
                        plain,—<emph>you</emph> must not dream of coming to The Pines. Marjorie has
                     told her father everything! I saw her for a few minutes, an hour ago, in the
                     garden; and, as near as I could gather from her confused statement, the facts
                     are these: Lieutenant Bradly—that's the naval officer stationed at
                     Rivermouth—has been paying court to Miss Daw for some time past, but not so
                     much to her liking as to that of the colonel, who it seems is an old friend of
                     the young gentleman's father. Yesterday (I knew she was in some trouble when
                     she drove up to our gate) the colonel spoke to Marjorie of Bradly,—urged his
                     suit, I infer. Marjorie expressed her dislike for the lieutenant with
                     characteristic frankness, and finally confessed to her father—well, I really do
                     not know what she confessed. It must have been the vaguest of confessions, and
                     must have sufficiently puzzled the colonel. At any rate; it exasperated him. I
                     suppose I am implicated in the matter, and that the colonel feels bitterly
                     towards me. I do not see why: I have carried no messages between you and Miss
                     Daw; I have behaved with the greatest discretion. I can find no flaw anywhere
                     in my proceeding. I do not see that anybody has done anything,—except the
                     colonel himself.</p>
                  <p>It is probable, nevertheless, that the friendly relations between the two
                     houses will be broken off. "A plague o' both your houses," say you. I will keep
                     you informed, as well as I can, of what occurs over the way. We shall remain
                     here until the second week in September. Stay where you are, or, at all events,
                     do not dream of joining me.....Colonel Daw is sitting on the piazza looking
                     rather wicked. I have not seen Marjorie since I parted with her in the
                     garden.</p>

                     <hi rend="i"/>MY DEAR DOCTOR: If you have any influence over Flemming, I beg of
                     you to exert it to prevent his coming to this place at present. There are
                     circumstances, which I will explain to you before long, that make it of the
                     first importance that he should not come into this neighborhood. His appearance
                     here, I speak advisedly, would be disastrous to him. In urging him to remain in
                     New York, or to go to some inland resort, you will be doing him and me a real
                     service. Of course you will not mention my name in this connection. You know me
                     well enough, my dear doctor, to be assured that, in begging your secret
                     co-operation, I have reasons that will meet your entire approval when they are
                     made plain to you. We shall return to town on the 15th of next month, and my
                     first duty will be to present myself at your hospitable door and satisfy your
                     curiosity, if I have excited it. My father, I am glad to state, has so greatly
                     improved that he can no longer be regarded as an invalid. With great esteem, I
                     am, etc., etc.</p>

                     <hi rend="i"/>Your letter, announcing your mad determination to come here, has
                     just reached me. I beseech you to reflect a moment. The step would be fatal to
                     your interests and hers. You would furnish just cause for irritation to R. W.
                     D.; and, though he loves Marjorie tenderly, he is capable of going to any
                     lengths if opposed. You would not like, I am convinced, to be the means of
                     causing him to treat <emph>her</emph> with severity. That would be the result
                     of your presence at The Pines at this juncture. I am annoyed to be obliged to
                     point out these things to you. We are on very delicate ground, Jack; the
                     situation is critical, and the slightest mistake in a move would cost us the
                     game. If you consider it worth the winning, be patient. Trust a little to my
                     sagacity. Wait and see what happens. Moreover, I understand from Dillon that
                     you are in no condition to take so long a journey. He thinks the air of the
                     coast would be the worst thing possible for you; that you ought to go inland,
                     if anywhere. Be advised by me. advised by Dillon.</p>

                     <hi rend="i"/>ON the second of September, 187-, as the down express due at 3.40
                     left the station at Hampton, a young man, leaning on the shoulder of a servant,
                     whom he addressed as Watkins, stepped from the platform into a hack, and
                     requested to be driven to "The Pines." On arriving at the gate of a modest
                     farm-house, a few miles from the station, the young man descended with
                     difficulty from the carriage, and, casting a hasty glance across the road,
                     seemed much impressed by some peculiarity in the landscape. Again leaning on
                     the shoulder of the person Watkins, he walked to the door of the farm-house and
                     inquired for Mr. Edward Delaney. He was informed by the aged man who answered
                     his knock, that Mr. Edward Delaney had gone to Boston the day before, but that
                     Mr. Jonas Delaney was within. This information did not appear satisfactory to
                     the stranger, who inquired if Mr. Edward Delaney had left any message for Mr.
                     John Flemming. There was a letter for Mr. Flemming, if he were that person.
                     After a brief absence the aged man reappeared with a Letter.</p>

                     <hi rend="i"/>AT five o'clock on the morning of the tenth of July, 1860, the
                     front door of a certain house on Anchor Street, in the ancient seaport town of
                     Rivermouth, might have been observed to open with great caution. This door, as
                     the least imaginative reader may easily conjecture, did not open itself. It was
                     opened by Miss Margaret Callaghan, who immediately closed it softly behind her,
                     paused for a few seconds with an embarrassed air on the stone step, and then,
                     throwing a furtive glance up at the second-story windows, passed hastily down
                     the street towards the river, keeping close to the fences and garden walls on
                     her left.</p>
                  <p>There was a ghostlike stealthiness to Miss Margaret's movements, though there
                     was nothing<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5554-00000029"/> whatever of the ghost
                     about Miss Margaret herself. She was a plump, short person, no longer young,
                     with coal-black hair growing low on the forehead, and a round face that would
                     have been nearly meaningless if the features had not been
                     emphasized—italicized, so to speak—by the small-pox. Moreover, the brilliancy
                     of her toilet would have rendered any ghostly hypothesis untenable. Mrs.
                     Solomon—we refer to the dressiest Mrs. Solomon, which ever one that was—in all
                     her glory was not arrayed like Miss Margaret on that eventful summer morning.
                     She wore a light-green, shot-silk frock, a blazing red shawl, and a yellow
                     crape bonnet profusely decorated with azure, orange, and magenta artificial
                     flowers. In her hand she carried a white parasol. The newly risen sun,
                     ricocheting from the bosom of the river and striking point-blank on the
                     top-knot of Miss Margaret's gorgeousness, made her an imposing spectacle in the
                     quiet street of that Puritan village. But, in spite of the bravery of her
                     apparel, she stole guiltily along by garden walls and fences until she reached
                     a small, dingy framehouse near the wharves, in the darkened doorway of which
                     she quenched her burning splendor, if so bold a figure is permissible.</p>
                  <p>Three quarters of an hour passed. The sunshine moved slowly up Anchor Street,
                     fingered noiselessly the well-kept brass knockers on either side, and drained
                     the heeltaps of dew which had been left from the revels of the fairies
                     overnight in the cups of the morning-glories. Not a soul was stirring yet in
                     this part of the town, though the Rivermouthians are such early birds that not
                     a worm may be said to escape them. By and by one of the brown Holland shades at
                     one of the upper windows of the Bilkins mansion—the house from which Miss
                     Margaret had emerged—was drawn up, and old Mr. Bilkins in spiral nightcap
                     looked out on the sunny street. Not a living creature was to be seen, save the
                     dissipated family cat,—a very Lovelace of a cat that was not allowed a
                     night-key,—who was sitting on the curbstone opposite, waiting for the hall door
                     to be opened. Three quarters of an hour, we repeat, had passed, when Mrs.
                     Margaret O'Rouke, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">née</foreign> Callaghan, issued from
                     the small, dingy house by the river, and regained the doorstep of the Bilkins
                     mansion in the same stealthy fashion in which she had left it.</p>
                  <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC5554-00000030"/>
                  <p>Not to prolong a mystery that must already oppress the reader, Mr. Bilkins's
                     cook had, after the manner of her kind, stolen out of the premises before the
                     family were up, and got herself married,—surreptitiously and artfully married,
                     as if matrimony were an indictable offence.</p>
                  <p>And something of an offence it was in this instance. In the first place,
                     Margaret Callaghan had lived nearly twenty years with the Bilkins family, and
                     the old people—there were no children now—had rewarded this long service by
                     taking Margaret into their affections. It was a piece of subtile ingratitude
                     for her to marry without admitting the worthy couple to her confidence. In the
                     next place, Margaret had married a man some eighteen years younger than
                     herself. That was the young man's lookout, you say. We hold it was Margaret
                     that was to blame. What does a young blade of twenty-two know? Not half so much
                     as he thinks he does. His exhaustless ignorance at that age is a discovery
                     which is left for him to make in his prime.</p>

                  <p>In one sense Margaret's husband <emph>had</emph> come to forty year,—she was
                     forty to a day.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Margaret O'Rouke, with the baddish cat following closely at her heels,
                     entered the Bilkins mansion, reached her chamber in the attic without being
                     intercepted, and there laid aside her finery. Two or three times, while
                     arranging her more humble attire, she paused to take a look at the marriage
                     certificate, which she had deposited between the leaves of her Prayer-Book, and
                     on each occasion held that potent document upside down; for Margaret's literary
                     culture was of the severest order, and excluded the art of reading.</p>
                  <p>The breakfast was late that morning. As Mrs. O'Rouke set the coffee-urn in
                     front of Mrs. Bilkins and flanked Mr. Bilkins with the broiled mackerel and the
                     buttered toast, Mrs. O'Rouke's conscience smote her. She afterwards declared
                     that when she saw the two sitting there so innocent-like, not dreaming of the
                        <emph>comether</emph> she had put upon them, she secretly and unbeknownt let
                     a few tears fall into the cream-pitcher. Whether or<pb n="60-61"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000031"/> not it was this material expression of
                     Margaret's penitence that spoiled the coffee, does not admit of inquiry; but
                     the coffee was bad. In fact, the whole breakfast was a comedy of errors.</p>
                  <p>It was a blessed relief to Margaret when the meal was ended. She retired in a
                     cold perspiration to the penetralia of the kitchen, and it was remarked by both
                     Mr. and Mrs. Bilkins that those short flights of vocalism,—apropos of the
                     personal charms of one Kate Kearney who lived on the banks of Killarney,—which
                     ordinarily issued from the direction of the scullery, were unheard that
                     forenoon.</p>
                  <p>The town clock was striking eleven, and the antiquated timepiece on the
                     staircase (which never spoke but it dropped pearls and crystals, like the fairy
                     in the story) was lisping the hour, when there came three tremendous knocks at
                     the street door. Mrs. Bilkins, who was dusting the brass-mounted chronometer in
                     the hall, stood transfixed with arm uplifted. The admirable old lady had for
                     years been carrying on a guerilla warfare with itinerant vendors of furniture
                     polish, and pain-killer, and crockery cement, and the like. The effrontery of
                     the triple knock convinced vinced her the enemy was at her gates,—possibly that
                     dissolute creature with twenty-four sheets of note-paper and twenty-four
                     envelopes for fifteen cents.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Bilkins swept across the hall, and opened the door with a jerk. The
                     suddenness of the movement was apparently not anticipated by the person
                     outside, who, with one arm stretched feebly towards the receding knocker,
                     tilted gently forward, and rested both hands on the threshold in an attitude
                     which was probably common enough with our ancestors of the Simian period, but
                     could never have been considered graceful. By an effort that testified to the
                     excellent condition of his muscles, the person instantly righted himself, and
                     stood swaying unsteadily on his toes and heels, and smiling rather vaguely on
                     Mrs. Bilkins.</p>
                  <p>It was a slightly built, but well-knitted young fellow in the not unpicturesque
                     garb of our marine service. His woollen cap, pitched forward at an acute angle
                     with his nose, showed the back part of a head thatched with short, yellow hair,
                     which had broken into innumerable curls of painful tightness. On his ruddy
                        cheeks<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC5554-00000032"/> a sparse sandy beard was
                     making a timid <foreign xml:lang="FRA">début</foreign>. Add to this a weak,
                     good-natured mouth, a pair of devil-may-care blue eyes, and the fact that the
                     man was very drunk, and you have a pre-Raphaelite portrait—we may as well say
                     it at once—of Mr. Larry O'Rouke of Ballyshanty, County Connaught, and late of
                     the U. S. sloop-of-war Santee.</p>
                  <p>The man was a total stranger to Mrs. Bilkins; but the instant she caught sight
                     of the double white anchors embroidered on the lapels of his jacket, she
                     unhesitatingly threw back the door, which, with great presence of mind, she had
                     partly closed.</p>
                  <p>A drunken sailor standing on the step of the Bilkins mansion was no novelty.
                     The street, as we have stated, led down to the wharves, and sailors were
                     constantly passing. The house abutted directly on the street; the granite
                     door-step was almost flush with the sidewalk, and the huge old-fashioned brass
                     knocker—seemingly a brazen hand that had been cut off at the wrist and nailed
                     against the oak as a warning to malefactors—extended itself in a kind of grim
                     appeal to everybody. It seemed to possess strange fascinations for all
                     seafaring folk; and when there was a man-of-war in port the rat-tat-tat of that
                     knocker would frequently startle the quiet neighborhood long after midnight.
                     There appeared to be an occult understanding between it and the blue-jackets.
                     Years ago there was a young Bilkins, one Pendexter Bilkins,—a sad losel, we
                     fear,—who ran away to try his fortunes before the mast, and fell overboard in a
                     gale off Hatteras. "Lost at sea," says the chubby marble slab in the Old South
                     Burying-Ground, "<foreign xml:lang="LAT">ætat</foreign> 18." Perhaps that is
                     why no blue-jacket, sober or drunk, was ever repulsed from the door of the
                     Bilkins mansion.</p>
                  <p>Of course Mrs. Bilkins had her taste in the matter, and preferred them sober.
                     But as this could not always be, she tempered her wind, so to speak, to the
                     shorn lamb. The flushed, prematurely old face that now looked up at her moved
                     the good lady's pity.</p>
                  <p>"What do you want?" she asked kindly.</p>
                  <p>"Me wife."</p>
                  <p>"There's no wife for you here," said Mrs. Bilkins, somewhat taken aback. "His
                     wife!" she thought; "it's a mother the poor boy stands in need of."</p>
                  <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC5554-00000033"/>
                  <p>"Me wife," repeated Mr. O'Rouke, "for betther or for worse."</p>
                  <p>"You had better go away," said Mrs. Bilkins, bridling up, "or it will be the
                     worse for you."</p>
                  <p>"To have and to howld," continued Mr. O'Rouke, wandering retrospectively in the
                     mazes of the marriage service, "to have and to howld, till death—bad luck to
                     him!—takes one or the ither of us."</p>
                  <p>"You're a blasphemous creature," said Mrs. Bilkins, severely.</p>
                  <p>"Thim's the words his riverince spake this mornin', standin' foreninst us,"
                     explained Mr. O'Rouke. "I stood here, see, and me jew'l stood there, and the
                     howly chaplain beyont."</p>
                  <p>And Mr. O'Rouke with a wavering forefinger drew a diagram of the interesting
                     situation on the doorstep.</p>
                  <p>"Well," returned Mrs. Bilkins, "if you're a married man, all I have to say is,
                     there's a pair of fools instead of one. You had better be off; the person you
                     want does n't live here."</p>
                  <p>"Bedad, thin, but she does."</p>
                  <p>"Lives here?"</p>
                  <p>"Sorra a place else."</p>
                  <p>"The man's crazy," said Mrs. Bilkins to herself.</p>
                  <p>While she thought him simply drunk she was not in the least afraid; but the
                     idea that she was conversing with a madman sent a chill over her. She reached
                     back her hand preparatory to shutting the door, when Mr. O'Rouke, with an
                     agility that might have been expected from his previous gymnastics, set one
                     foot on the threshold and frustrated the design.</p>
                  <p>"I want me wife," he said sternly.</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately Mr. Bilkins had gone up town, and there was no one in the house
                     except Margaret, whose pluck was not to be depended on. The case was urgent.
                     With the energy of despair Mrs. Bilkins suddenly placed the toe of her boot
                     against Mr. O'Rouke's invading foot, and pushed it away. The effect of this
                     attack was to cause Mr. O'Rouke to describe a complete circle on one leg, and
                     then sit down heavily on the threshold. The lady retreated to the hat-stand,
                     and rested her hand mechanically on the handle of a blue cotton umbrella. Mr.
                     O'Rouke partly turned his head and smiled upon her with conscious superiority.
                     At this juncture a third<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC5554-00000034"/> actor
                     appeared on the scene, evidently a friend of Mr. O'Rouke, for he addressed that
                     gentleman as "a sapleen," and told him to go home.</p>
                  <p>"Divil an inch," replied the sapleen; but he got himself off the threshold, and
                     resumed his position on the step.</p>
                  <p>"It's only Larry, mum," said the man, touching his forelock politely; "as
                     dacent a lad as iver lived, when he's not in liquor; an' I've known him to be
                     sober for days togither," he added reflectively. "He don't mane a hap'orth a'
                     harum, but jist now he's not quite in his right moind."</p>
                  <p>"I should think not," said Mrs. Bilkins, turning from the speaker to Mr.
                     O'Rouke, who had seated himself gravely on the scraper, and was weeping. "Has
                     n't the man any friends?"</p>
                  <p>"Too many of 'em, mum, an' it's along wid dhrinkin' toasts wid 'em that Larry
                     got throwed. The punch that sapleen has dhrunk this day would amaze ye. He give

                  <p>"Misther Donnehugh," said Mr. O'Rouke with great dignity, "ye're dhrunk
                     agin."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Donnehugh, who had not taken more than thirteen ladles of rum-punch,
                     disdained to reply directly.</p>
                  <p>"He's a dacent lad enough,"—this to Mrs. Bilkins,—"but his head is wake. Whin
                     he 's had two sups o' whiskey he belaves he's dhrank a bar'l full. A gill o'

                  <p>"Is n't there anybody to look after him?"</p>
                  <p>"No, mum, he's an orphan; his father and mother live in the owld counthry, an'

                  <p>"Has n't he any family in the town—"</p>
                  <p>"Sure, mum, he has a family; was n't he married this blessed mornin'?"</p>
                  <p>"He said so."</p>

                  <p>"And the—the person?" inquired Mrs. Bilkins.</p>
                  <p>"Is it the wife ye mane?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, the wife: where is she?"</p>
                  <p>"Well thin, mum," said Mr. Donnehugh, "it's yerself that can answer that."</p>

                  <p>"I?" exclaimed Mrs. Bilkins. "Good heavens! this man's as crazy as the

                  <p>"Begorra, if anybody's crazy it's Larry, for it's Larry has married

                  <p>"It's a civil tongue the owld lady has, anyway," remarked Mr. O'Rouke,
                     critically, from the scraper.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Bilkins's voice during the latter part of the colloquy had been pitched in
                     a high key; it rung through the hall and penetrated to the kitchen, where
                     Margaret was thoughtfully wiping the breakfast things. She paused with a
                     half-dried saucer in her band, and listened. In a moment more she stood, with
                     bloodless face and limp figure, learning against the banister, behind Mrs.
                     Bilkins.</p>
                  <p>"Is it there ye are, me jew'l!" cries Mr. O'Rouke, discovering her.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Bilkins wheeled upon Margaret.</p>
                  <p>"Margaret Callaghan, <emph>is</emph> that thing your husband?"</p>
                  <p>"Ye-yes, mum," faltered Mrs. O'Rouke, with a woful lack of spirit.</p>
                  <p>"Then take it away!" cried Mrs. Bilkins.</p>
                  <p>Margaret, with a slight flush on either cheek, glided past Mrs. Bilkins, and
                     the heavy oak door closed with a bang, as the gates of Paradise must have
                     closed of old upon Adam and Eve.</p>
                  <p>"Come!" said Margaret, taking Mr. O'Rouke by the hand; and the two wandered
                     forth upon their wedding-journey down Anchor Street, with all the world before
                     them where to choose. They chose to halt at the small, shabby tenement-house,
                     by the river, through the doorway of which the bridal pair disappeared with a
                     reeling, eccentric gait; for Mr. O'Rouke's intoxication seemed to have run down
                     his elbow, and communicated itself to Margaret.</p>
                  <p>O Hymen! who burnest precious gums and scented woods in thy torch at the
                     melting of aristocratic hearts, with what a pitiful penny-dip thou hast lighted
                     up our matter-of-fact romance!</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>IT had been no part of Margaret's plan to acknowledge the
                     marriage so soon. Though on pleasure bent, she had a frugal mind. She had
                     invested in a husband with a view of laying him away for a rainy day, that is
                     to say, for such time as her master and mistress should cease to need her
                     services; for she had promised on more than one occasion to remain with the old
                     people as long as they lived. And, indeed, if Mr. O'Rouke had come to her and
                     said in so many words, "The day you marry me you must leave the Bilkins
                     family," there is very little doubt but Margaret would have let that young
                     sea-monster slip back unmated, so far as she was concerned, into his native
                     element. The contingency never entered into her calculations. She intended that
                     the ship which had brought Ulysses to her island should take him off again
                     after a decent interval of honeymoon; then she would confess all to Mrs.
                     Bilkins, and be forgiven, and Mr. Bilkins would not cancel that clause supposed
                     to exist in his will bequeathing two first-mortgage bonds of the Squedunk R. R.
                     Co. to a certain faithful servant. In the mean while she would add each month
                     to her store in the coffers of the Rivermouth Savings Bank; for Calypso had a
                     neat sum to her credit on the books of that provident institution.</p>
                  <p>But this could not be now. The volatile bridegroom had upset the wisely
                     conceived plan, and "all the fat was in the fire," as Margaret philosophically
                     put it. Mr. O'Rouke had been fully instructed in the part he was to play, and,
                     to do him justice, had honestly intended to play it; but destiny was against
                     him. It may be observed that destiny and Mr. O'Rouke were not on very friendly
                     terms.</p>
                  <p>After the ceremony had been performed and Margaret had stolen back to the
                     Bilkins mansion, as related, Mr. O'Rouke with his own skilful hands had brewed
                     a noble punch for the wedding guests. Standing at the head of the table and
                     stirring the pungent mixture in a small wash-tub purchased for the occasion,
                     Mr. O'Rouke came out in full-flower. His flow of wit, as he replenished the
                     glasses, was as racy and seemingly as<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC5554-00000037"/>
                     inexhaustible as the punch itself. When Mrs. McLaughlin held out her glass,
                     inadvertently upside down, for her sixth ladleful, Mr. O'Rouke gallantly
                     declared it should be filled if he had to stand on his head to do it. The elder
                     Miss O'Leary whispered to Mrs. Connally that Mr. O'Rouke was "a perfic
                     gintleman," and the men in a body pronounced him a bit of the raal shamrock. If
                     Mr. O'Rouke was happy in brewing a punch, he was happier in dispensing it, and
                     happiest of all in drinking a great deal of it himself. He toasted Mrs.
                     Finnigan, the landlady, and the late lamented Finnigan, the father, whom he had
                     never seen, and Miss Biddy Finnigan, the daughter, and a young toddling
                     Finnigan, who was at large in shockingly scant raiment. He drank to the company
                     individually and collectively, drank to the absent, drank to a tin-pedler who
                     chanced to pass the window, and indeed was in that propitiatory mood when he
                     would have drunk to the health of each separate animal that came out of the
                     Ark. It was in the midst of the confusion and applause which followed his song,
                     "The Wearing of the Grane," that Mr. O'Rouke, the punch being all gone,
                     withdrew unobserved and went in quest of Mrs. O'Rouke,—with what success the
                     reader knows.</p>
                  <milestone n="" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>According to the love-idyl of the period, when Laura and Charles Henry, after
                     unheard-of obstacles, are finally united, all cares and tribulations and
                     responsibilities slip from their sleek backs like Christian's burden. The idea
                     is a pretty one, theoretically, but, like some of those models in the Patent
                     Office at Washington, it does n't work. Charles Henry does not go on sitting at
                     Laura's feet and reading Timothy Titcomb to her forever: the rent of the
                     cottage by the sea falls due with prosaic regularity; there are bakers, and
                     butchers, and babies, and tax-collectors, and doctors, and undertakers, and
                     sometimes gentlemen of the jury to be attended to. Wedded life is not one long
                     amatory poem with recurrent rhymes of love and dove, and kiss and bliss. Yet
                     when the average sentimental novelist has supplied his hero and heroine with
                     their bridal outfit and attended to that little matter of the marriage
                     certificate, he usually turns off the gas, puts up his shutters, and saunters
                     off with his hands in his pockets, as if the day's business<pb n="74-75"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000038"/> were over. But we, who are honest dealers in
                     real life and disdain to give short weight, know better. The business is by no
                     means over: it is just begun. It is not Christian throwing off his pack for
                     good and all, but Christian taking up a load heavier and more difficult than
                     any he has carried.</p>
                  <p>If Margaret Callaghan, when she meditated matrimony, indulged in any roseate
                     dreams, they were quickly put to flight. She suddenly found herself
                     dispossessed of a quiet, comfortable home, and face to face with the fact that
                     she had a white elephant on her hands. It is not likely that Mr. O'Rouke
                     assumed precisely the shape of a white elephant to her mental vision; but he
                     was as useless and cumbersome and unmanageable as one.</p>
                  <p>Margaret and Larry's wedding-tour did not extend beyond Mrs. Finnigan's
                     establishment, where they took two or three rooms and set up housekeeping in a
                     humble way. Margaret, who was a tidy housewife, kept the floor of her
                     apartments' as white as your hand, the tin plates on the dresser as bright as
                     your lady-love's eyes, and the cooking-stove as neat as the machinery on a
                     Sound steamer. When she was not rubbing the stove with lamp-black she was
                     cooking upon it some savory dish to tempt the palate of her marine monster.
                     Naturally of a hopeful temperament, she went about her work singing softly to
                     herself at times, and would have been very happy that first week if Mr. O'Rouke
                     had known a sober moment. But Mr. O'Rouke showed an exasperating disposition to
                     keep up festivities. At the end of ten days, however, he toned down, and at
                     Margaret's suggestion that he had better be looking about for some employment,
                     he rigged himself up a fishing-pole and set out with an injured air for the
                     wharf at the foot of the street, where he fished for the rest of the day. To
                     sit for hours blinking in the sun, waiting for a cunner to come along and take
                     his hook, was as exhaustive a kind of labor as he cared to engage in. Though
                     Mr. O'Rouke had recently returned from a long cruise, he had not a cent to
                     show. During his first three days ashore he had dissipated his three years'
                     pay. The housekeeping expenses began eating a hole in Margaret's little fund,
                     the existence of which was no sooner known to Mr. O'Rouke than he stood up his
                     fishing-rod in one corner of the room, and thenceforth it caught nothing but
                     cobwebs.</p>
                  <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC5554-00000039"/>
                  <p>"Divil a sthroke o'work I'll do," said Mr. O'Rouke, "whin we can live at aise
                     on our earnin's. Who'd be afther frettin' hisself, wid money in the bank? How
                     much is it, Peggy darlint?"</p>
                  <p>And divil a stroke more of work did he do. He lounged down on the wharves, and,
                     with his short clay pipe stuck between his lips and his hands in his pockets,
                     stared off at the sail-boats on the river. He sat on the doorstep of the
                     Finnigan domicile, and plentifully chaffed the passers-by. Now and then, when
                     he could wheedle some fractional currency out of Margaret, he spent it like a
                     crown-prince at The Wee Drop around the corner. With that fine magnetism which
                     draws together birds of a feather, he shortly drew about him all the
                     ne'er-do-weels of Rivermouth. It was really wonderful what an unsuspected lot
                     of them there was. From all the frowzy purlieus of the town they crept forth
                     into the sunlight to array themselves under the banner of the prince of
                     scallawags. It was edifying of a summer afternoon to see a dozen of them
                     sitting in a row, like turtles, on the string-piece of Jedediah Rand's wharf,
                     with their twenty-four four feet dangling over the water, assisting Mr. O'Rouke
                     in contemplating the islands in the harbor, and upholding the scenery, as it
                     were.</p>
                  <p>The rascal had one accomplishment, he had a heavenly voice, quite in the rough,
                     to be sure, and he played on the violin like an angel. He did not know one note
                     from another, but he played in a sweet natural way, just as Orpheus must have
                     played, by ear. The drunker he was the more pathos and humor he wrung from the
                     old violin, his sole piece of personal property. He had a singular fancy for
                     getting up at two or three o'clock in the morning, and playing by an open
                     casement. All the dogs in the immediate neighborhood and innumerable dogs in
                     the distance would join to swell the chorus on a scale that would have
                     satisfied Mr. Gilmore himself.</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately Mr. O'Rouke's <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bêtises</foreign> were not
                     always of so innocent a complexion. On one or two occasions, through an excess
                     of animal and other spirits, he took to breaking windows in the town. Among his
                     nocturnal feats he accomplished the demolition of the glass in the door of The
                     Wee Drop. Now, breaking windows in Rivermouth is an amusement not wholly
                        disconnected<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC5554-00000040"/> nected with an
                     interior view of the police-station (bridewell is the local term); so it
                     happened that Mr. O'Rouke woke up one fine morning and found himself snug and
                     tight in one of the cells in the rear of the Brick Market. His plea that the
                     bull's-eye in the glass door of The Wee Drop winked at him in an insultin'
                     manner as he was passing by did not prevent Justice Hackett from fining the
                     delinquent ten dollars and costs, Which made sad havoc with the poor wife's
                     bank account. So Margaret's married life wore on, and all went merry as a
                     funeral knell.</p>
                  <p>After Mrs. Bilkins, with a brow as severe as one of the Parcæ, had closed the
                     door upon the O'Roukes that summer morning, she sat down on the stairs, and,
                     sinking the indignant goddess in the woman, burst into tears. She was still
                     very wroth with Margaret Callaghan, as she persisted in calling her; very
                     merciless and unforgiving, as the gentler sex are apt to be—to the gentler sex.
                     Mr. Bilkins, however, after the first vexation, missed Margaret from the
                     household; missed her singing, which was in itself as helpful as a second girl;
                     missed her hand in the preparation of those hundred and one nameless comforts
                     which are necessities to the old, and wished in his soul that he had her back
                     again. Who could make a gruel, when he was ill, or cook a steak, when he was
                     well, like Margaret? So, meeting her one morning at the fish-market,—for Mr.
                     O'Rouke had long since given over the onerous labor of catching cunners,—he
                     spoke to her kindly, and asked her how she liked the change in her life, and if
                     Mr. O'Rouke was good to her.</p>
                  <p>"Troth, thin, sur," said Margaret, with a short dry laugh, "he's the divil's
                     own!"</p>
                  <p>Margaret was thin and careworn, and her laugh had the mild gayety of champagne
                     not properly corked. These things were apparent even to Mr. Bilkins, who was
                     not a shrewd observer. With a duplicity quite foreign to his nature, he
                     gradually drew from her the true state of affairs. Mr. O'Rouke was a very bad
                     case indeed; he did nothing towards her support; he was almost constantly
                     drunk; the little money she had laid by was melting away, and would not last
                     until winter. Mr. O'Rouke was perpetually coming home with a sprained ankle, or
                     a bruised shoulder, or a broken head. He<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC5554-00000041"
                     /> had broken most of the furniture in his festive hours, including the
                     cooking-stove. "In short," as Mr. Bilkins said in relating the matter
                     afterwards to Mrs. Bilkins, "he had broken all those things which he should n't
                     have broken, and failed to break the one thing he ought to have broken long
                     ago,—his neck, namely."</p>
                  <p>The revelation which startled Mr. Bilkins most was this: in spite of all,
                     Margaret loved Larry with the whole of her warm Irish heart. Further than
                     keeping the poor creature up waiting for him until ever so much o'clock at
                     night, it did not appear that lie treated her with personal cruelty. If he had
                     beaten her, she would have worshipped him; as it was, she merely loved the
                     ground he trod upon.</p>
                  <p>Revolving Margaret's troubles in his thoughts as he walked homeward, Mr.
                     Bilkins struck upon a plan by which he could help her. When this plan was laid
                     before Mrs. Bilkins, she opposed it with a vehemence that convinced him she had
                     made up her mind to adopt it.</p>
                  <p>"Never, never will I have that ungrateful woman under this roof!" cried Mrs.
                     Bilkins; and accordingly the next day Mr. and Mrs. O'Rouke took up their abode
                     in the Bilkins mansion,—Margaret as cook, and Larry as gardener.</p>
                  <p>"I'm convanient if the owld gintleman is," had been Mr. O'Rouke's remark, when
                     the proposition was submitted to him. Not that Mr. O'Rouke had the faintest
                     idea of gardening. He did n't know a tulip from a tomato. He was one of those
                     sanguine people who never hesitate to undertake anything, and are never abashed
                     by their herculean inability.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Bilkins did not look to Margaret's husband for any great botanical
                     knowledge; but he was rather surprised one day when Mr. O'Rouke pointed to the
                     triangular bed of lilies-of-the-valley, then out of flower, and remarked,
                     "Thim's a nate lot o'purtaties ye've got there, sur." Mr. Bilkins, we repeat,
                     did not expect much from Mr. O'Rouke's skill in gardening; his purpose was to
                     reform the fellow if possible, and in any case to make Margaret's lot
                     easier.</p>
                  <p>Re-established in her old home, Margaret broke into song again, and Mr. O'Rouke
                     himself promised to do very well; morally, we mean, not agriculturally. His
                     ignorance of the simplest<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC5554-00000042"/> laws of
                     nature, if nature has any simple laws, and his dense stupidity on every other
                     subject were heavy trials to Mr. Bilkins. Happily Mr. Bilkins was not without a
                     sense of humor, else he would have found Mr. O'Rouke insupportable. Just when
                     the old gentleman's patience was about exhausted, the gardener would commit
                     some atrocity so perfectly comical that his master all but loved him for the
                     moment.</p>
                  <p>"Larry," said Mr. Bilkins, one breathless afternoon in the middle of September,
                     "just see how the thermometer on the back porch stands."</p>
                  <p>Mr. O'Rouke disappeared, and after a prolonged absence returned with the
                     monstrous announcement that the thermometer stood at 820!</p>
                  <p>Mr. Bilkins looked at the man closely. He was unmistakably sober.</p>
                  <p>"Eight hundred and twenty what?" cried Mr. Bilkins, feeling very warm, as he
                     naturally would in so high a temperature.</p>
                  <p>"Eight hundthred an' twinty degrays, I suppose, sur."</p>
                  <p>"Larry, you're an idiot."</p>
                  <p>This was obviously not to Mr. O'Rouke's taste; for he went out and brought the
                     thermometer, and, pointing triumphantly to the line of numerals running
                     parallel with the glass tube, exclaimed, "Add 'em up yerself, thin!"</p>
                  <p>Perhaps this would not have been amusing if Mr. Bilkins had not spent the
                     greater part of the previous forenoon in initiating Mr. O'Rouke into the
                     mysteries of the thermometer. Nothing could make amusing Mr. O'Rouke's method
                     of setting out crocus bulbs. Mr. Bilkins had received a lot of a very choice
                     variety from Boston, and having a headache that morning, turned over to Mr.
                     O'Rouke the duty of planting them. Though he had never seen a bulb in his,
                     life, Larry unblushingly asserted that he, had set out thousands for Sir Lucius
                     O'Grady, of O'Grady Castle, "an illegant place intirely, wid tin miles o'
                     garden-walks," added Mr. O'Rouke, crushing Mr. Bilkins, who boasted only of a
                     few humble flower-beds.</p>
                  <p>The following day he stepped into the garden to see how Larry had done his
                     work. There stood the parched bulbs, carefully arranged in circles and squares
                     on top of the soil.</p>
                  <p>"Did n't I tell you to set out these bulbs?" cried Mr. Bilkins, wrathfully.</p>
                  <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC5554-00000043"/>
                  <p>"An' did n't I set 'em out?" expostulated Mr. O'Rouke. "An' ain't they a
                     settin' there beautiful?"</p>
                  <p>"But you should have put them into the ground, stupid!"</p>
                  <p>"Is it bury 'em, ye mane? Be jabbers! how could they iver git out agin? Give
                     the little jokers a fair show, Misther Bilkins!"</p>
                  <p>For two weeks Mr. O'Rouke conducted himself with comparative propriety; that is
                     to say, he rendered himself useless about the place, appeared regularly at his
                     meals, and kept sober. Perhaps the hilarious strains of music which sometimes
                     issued at midnight from the upper window of the north gable were not just what
                     a quiet, unostentatious family would desire; but on the whole there was not
                     much to complain of.</p>
                  <p>The third week witnessed a falling off. Though always promptly on hand at the
                     serving out of rations, Mr. O'Rouke did not even make a pretence of working in
                     the garden. He would disappear mysteriously immediately after breakfast and
                     reappear with supernatural abruptness at dinner. Nobody knew what he did with
                     himself in the interval, until one day he was observed to fall out of an
                     apple-tree near the stable. His retreat discovered, lie took to the wharves and
                     the alleys in the distant part of the town. It soon became evident that his
                     ways were not the ways of temperance, and that all his paths led to The Wee
                     Drop.</p>
                  <p>Of course, Margaret tried to keep this from the family. Being a woman, she made
                     excuses for him in her heart. It was a dull life for the lad anyway, and it was
                     worse than him that was leading Larry astray. Hours and hours after the old
                     people had gone to bed, she would sit without a light in the lonely kitchen,
                     listening for that shuffling step along the gravel-walk. Night after night she
                     never closed her eyes, and went about the house the next day with that smooth,
                     impenetrable face behind which women hide their care.</p>
                  <p>One morning found Margaret sitting pale and anxious by the kitchen stove.
                     O'Rouke had not come home at all. Noon came and night, but not Larry. Whenever
                     Mrs. Bilkins approached her that day, Margaret was humming "Kate Kearney" quite
                     merrily. But when her work was done, she stole out at the back gate and<pb
                        n="86-87" xml:id="VAC5554-00000044"/> went in search of him. She scoured the
                     neighborhood like a madwoman. O'Rouke had not been at the Finnigans'. He had
                     not been at The Wee Drop since Monday, and this was Wednesday night. Her heart
                     sunk within her when she failed to find him in the police station. Some
                     dreadful thing had happened to him. She came back to the house with one hand
                     pressed wearily against her cheek. Tie dawn struggled through the kitchen
                     windows, and fell upon Margaret crouched by the stove.</p>
                  <p>She could no longer wear her mask. When Mr. Bilkins came down she confessed
                     that Larry had taken to drinking again, and had not been home for two
                     nights.</p>
                  <p>"Mayhap he's drownded hisself," suggested Margaret, wringing her hands.</p>
                  <p>"Not he," said Mr. Bilkins; "he does n't like the taste of water well
                     enough."</p>
                  <p>"Troth, thin, he does n't," reflected Margaret; and the reflection comforted
                     her.</p>
                  <p>"At any rate, I 'll go and look him up after breakfast," said Mr. Bilkins. And
                     after breakfast, accordingly, Mr. Bilkins sallied forth with the depressing
                     expectation of finding Mr. O'Rouke without much difficulty. "Come to think of
                     it," said the old gentleman to himself, drawing on his white cotton gloves as
                     he walked up Anchor Street, "<emph>I</emph> don't want to find him."</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">

                  <head>III.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>BUT Mr. O'Rouke was not to be found. With amiable cynicism Mr.
                     Bilkins directed his steps in the first instance to the police station, quite
                     confident that a bird of Mr. O'Rouke's plumage would be brought to perch in
                     such a cage. But not so much as a feather of him was discoverable. The Wee Drop
                     was not the only bacchanalian resort in Rivermouth; there were five or six
                     other low drinking-shops scattered about town, and through these Mr. Bilkins
                     went conscientiously. He then explored various blind alleys, known haunts of
                     the missing man, and took a careful survey of the wharves along the river on
                     his way home. He even shook the apple-tree near the stable with a vague hope of
                     bringing down Mr. O'Rouke, but brought down nothing except a few winter apples,
                     which, being both unripe and unsound, were not perhaps bad representatives of
                     the object of his search.</p>
                  <p>That evening a small boy stopped at the door of the Bilkins mansion with a
                     straw hat, at once identified as Mr. O'Rouke's, which had been found on Neal's
                     Wharf. This would have told against another man; but O'Rouke was always leaving
                     his hat on a wharf. Margaret's distress is not to be pictured. She fell back
                     upon and clung to the idea that Larry had drowned himself, riot intentionally,
                     maybe; possibly he had fallen overboard while intoxicated.</p>
                  <p>The late Mr. Buckle has informed us that death by drowning is regulated by laws
                     as inviolable and beautiful as those of the solar system; that a certain
                     percentage of the earth's population is bound to drown itself annually, whether
                     it wants to or not. It may be presumed, then, that Rivermouth's proper quota of
                     dead bodies was washed ashore during the ensuing two months. There had been
                     gales off the coast and pleasure parties on the river, and between them they
                     had managed to do a ghastly business. But Mr. O'Rouke failed to appear among
                     the flotsam and jetsam which the receding tides left tangled in the piles of
                     the Rivermouth wharves. This convinced Margaret that Larry had proved a too
                     tempting morsel to some buccaneering shark, or<pb n="90-91"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000046"/> had fallen a victim to one of those immense
                     schools of fish which seem to have a yearly appointment with the fishermen on
                     this coast. From that day Margaret never saw a cod or a mackerel brought into
                     the house without an involuntary shudder. She averted her head in making up the
                     fish-balls, as if she half dreaded to detect a faint aroma of whiskey about
                     them. And, indeed, why might not a man fall into the sea, be eaten, say, by a
                     halibut, and reappear on the scene of his earthly triumphs and defeats in the
                     non-committal form of hashed fish? <q>
                        <lg type="stanza">
                           <l>"Imperial Cæsar, dead, and turn'd to clay,</l>
                           <l>Might stop a hole to keep the wind away."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q> But, perhaps, as the conservative Horatio suggests, 't were to consider
                     too curiously to consider so.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Bilkins had come to adopt Margaret's explanation of O'Rouke's
                     disappearance. He was undoubtedly drowned, had most likely drowned himself. The
                     hat picked up on the wharf was strong circumstantial evidence in that
                     direction. But one feature of the case staggered Mr. Bilkins. O'Rouke's violin
                     had also disappeared. Now, it required no great effort to imagine a man
                     throwing himself overboard under the influence of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mania
                        à potu</foreign>; but it was difficult to conceive of a man committing
                     violinicide! If the fellow went to drown himself, why did he take his fiddle
                     with him? He might as well have taken an umbrella or a German student lamp.
                     This question troubled Mr. Bilkins a good deal first and last. But one thing
                     was indisputable: the man was gone, and had evidently gone by water.</p>
                  <p>It was now that Margaret invested her husband with charms of mind and person
                     not calculated to make him recognizable by any one who had ever had the
                     privilege of knowing him in the faulty flesh. She eliminated all his bad
                     qualities, and projected from her imagination a Mr. O'Rouke as he ought to have
                     been,—a species of seraphic being mixed up in some way with a violin; and to
                     this ideal she erected a headstone in the suburban cemetery. If Mr. O'Rouke
                     could have read the inscription, he would never have suspected his own
                     complicity in the matter.</p>
                  <p>But there the marble stood, sacred to his memory; and soon the snow came down
                     from the gray sky and covered it, and the invisible snow of weeks and months
                     drifted down on<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC5554-00000047"/> Margaret's heart, and
                     filled up its fissures, and smoothed off the sharp angles of its grief; and
                     there was peace upon it.</p>
                  <p>Not but she sorrowed for Larry at times. But life had a relish to it again; she
                     was free, though she did not look at it in that light; she was happier in a
                     quiet fashion than she had ever been, though she would not have acknowledged it
                     to herself. She wondered that she had the heart to laugh when the ice-man made
                     love to her. Perhaps she was conscious of something comically incongruous in
                     the warmth of a gentleman who spent all winter in cutting ice, and all summer
                     in dealing it out to his customers. She had not the same excuse for laughing at
                     the baker; yet she laughed still more merrily at him when he pressed her hand
                     over the steaming loaf of brownbread, delivered every Saturday morning at the
                     scullery door. Both these gentlemen had known Margaret many years, yet neither
                     of them had valued her very highly until another man came along and married
                     her. A widow, it would appear, is esteemed in some sort as a warranted article,
                     being stamped with the maker's name.</p>
                  <p>There was even a third lover in prospect; for according to the gossip of the
                     town, Mr. Donnehugh was frequently to be seen of a Sunday afternoon standing in
                     the cemetery and regarding Mr. O'Rouke's headstone with unrestrained
                     satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>A year had passed away, and certain bits of color blossoming among Margaret's
                     weeds indicated that the winter of her mourning was over. The ice-man and the
                     baker were hating each other cordially, and Mrs. Bilkins was daily expecting it
                     would be discovered before night that Margaret had married one or both of them.
                     But to do Margaret justice, she was faithful in thought and deed to the memory
                     of O'Rouke,—not the O'Rouke who disappeared so strangely, but the O'Rouke who
                     never existed.</p>
                  <p>"D'ye think, mum," she said one day to Mrs. Bilkins, as that lady was adroitly
                     sounding her on the ice question,—"d' ye think I'd condescind to take up wid
                     the likes o' him, or the baker either, Afther sich a man as Larry?"</p>
                  <p>The rectified and clarified O'Rouke was a permanent wonder to Mr. Bilkins, who
                     bore up under the bereavement with remarkable resignation.</p>
                  <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5554-00000048"/>
                  <p>Peggy is right," said the old gentleman, who was superintending the burning out
                     of the kitchen flue. "She won't find another man like Larry O'Rouke, in a
                     hurry."</p>
                  <p>"Thrue for ye, Mr. Bilkins," answered Margaret. "Maybe there's as good fish in
                     the say as iver was caught, but I don't belave it all the same."</p>
                  <p>As good fish in the sea! The words recalled to Margaret the nature of her loss,
                     and she went on with her work in silence.</p>
                  <milestone n="" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>"What—what is it, Ezra?" cried Mrs. Bilkins, changing color, and rising hastily
                     from the breakfast-table. Her first thought was apoplexy.</p>
                  <p>There sat Mr. Bilkins, with his wig pushed back from his forehead, and his eyes
                     fixed vacantly on The Weekly Chronicle, which he held out at arm's length
                     before him.</p>
                  <p>"Good heavens, Ezra! what is the matter?"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Bilkins turned his eyes upon her mechanically, as if he were a great
                     wax-doll, and somebody had pulled his wire.</p>
                  <p>"Can't you speak, Ezra?"</p>
                  <p>His lips opened, and moved inarticulately; then he pointed a rigid finger, in
                     the manner of a guide-board, at a paragraph in the paper, which he held up for
                     Mrs. Bilkins to read over his shoulder. When she had read it she sunk back into
                     her chair without a word, and the two sat contemplating each other as if they
                     had never met before in this world, and were not over-pleased at meeting.</p>
                  <p>The paragraph which produced this singular effect on the aged couple occurred
                     at the end of a column of telegraph despatches giving the details of an
                     unimportant engagement that had just taken place between one of the blockading
                     squadron and a Confederate cruiser. The engagement itself does not concern us,
                     but this item from the list of casualties on the Union side has a direct
                     bearing on our <choice>

                  <p>"Larry O'Rouke, seaman, splinter wound in the leg. Not serious."</p>
                  <p>That splinter flew far. It glanced from Mr. O'Rouke's leg, went plumb through
                     the Bilkins mansion, and knocked over a small marble slab in the Old South
                     Burying-Ground.</p>
                  <p>If a ghost had dropped in familiarly to breakfast<pb n="96-97"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000049"/> fast, the constraint and consternation of the
                     Bilkins family could not have been greater. How was the astounding intelligence
                     to be broken to Margaret? Her explosive Irish nature made the task one of
                     extreme delicacy. Mrs. Bilkins flatly declared herself incapable of undertaking
                     it. Mr. Bilkins, with many misgivings as to his fitness, assumed the duty; for
                     it would never do to have the news sprung upon. Margaret suddenly by people
                     outside.</p>
                  <p>As Mrs. O'Rouke was clearing away the breakfast things, Mr. Bilkins, who had
                     lingered near the window with the newspaper in his hand, coughed once or twice
                     in an unnatural way to show that he was not embarrassed, and began to think
                     that maybe it would be best to tell Margaret after dinner. Mrs. Bilkins
                     fathomed his thought with that intuition which renders women terrible, and sent
                     across the room an eye-telegram to this effect, "Now is your time."</p>
                  <p>"There's been another battle down South, Margaret," said the old gentleman
                     presently, folding up the paper and putting it in his pocket. "A sea-fight this
                     time."</p>
                  <p>"Sure, an' they're allus fightin' down there."</p>
                  <p>"But not always with so little damage. There was only one man wounded on our
                     side."</p>
                  <p>"Pore man! It's sorry we oughter be for his wife an' childer, if he's got
                     any."</p>
                  <p>"Not badly wounded, you will understand, Margaret; not at all seriously
                     wounded; only a splinter in the leg."</p>
                  <p>"Faith, thin, a splinter in the leg is no pleasant thing in itself."</p>
                  <p>"A mere scratch," said Mr. Bilkins lightly, as if he were constantly in the
                     habit of going about with a splinter in his own leg, and found it rather
                     agreeable. "The odd part of the matter is the man's first name. His first name
                     was Larry."</p>
                  <p>Margaret nodded, as one should say, There's a many Larrys in the world.</p>
                  <p>"But the oddest part of it," continued Mr. Bilkins, in a carelessly sepulchral
                     voice, "is the man's last name."</p>
                  <p>Something in the tone of his voice made Margaret look at him, and something in
                     the expression of his face caused the blood to fly from Margaret's cheek.</p>
                  <p>"The man's last name," she repeated, wonderingly.</p>
                  <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC5554-00000050"/>
                  <p>"Yes, his last name,—O'Rouke."</p>
                  <p>"D'ye mane it?" shrieked Margaret,—"d' ye mane it? Glory to God! O worra!
                     worra!"</p>
                  <p>"Well Ezra, said Mrs. Bilkins, in one of those spasms of base ingratitude to
                     which even the most perfect women are liable, "you've made nice work of it. You
                     might as well have knocked her down with, an axe!"</p>
                  <p>"But,- my dear—"</p>
                  <p>"O bother!—my smelling-bottle, quick!— second bureau drawer,—left-hand
                     side."</p>
                  <p>Joy never kills; it is a celestial kind of hydrogen of which it seems
                     impossible to get too much at one inhalation. In an hour Margaret was able to
                     converse with comparative calmness on the resuscitation of Larry O'Rouke, whom
                     the firing of a cannon had brought to the surface as if he had been in reality
                     a drowned body.</p>
                  <p>Now that the whole town was aware of Mr. O'Rouke's fate, his friendly Mr.
                     Donnehugh came forward with a statement that would have been of some interest
                     at an earlier period, but was of no service as matters stood, except so far as
                     it assisted in removing from Mr. Bilkins's mind a passing doubt as to whether
                     the Larry O'Rouke of the telegraphic reports was Margaret's scapegrace of a
                     husband. Mr. Donnehugh had known all along that O'Rouke had absconded to Boston
                     by a night train and enlisted in the navy. It was the possession of this
                     knowledge that had made it impossible for Mr. Donnehugh to look at Mr.
                     O'Rouke's gravestone without grinning.</p>
                  <p>At Margaret's request, and in Margaret's name, Mr. Bilkins wrote three or four
                     letters to O'Rouke, and finally succeeded in extorting an epistle from that
                     gentleman, in which he told Margaret to cheer up, that his fortune was as good
                     as made, and that the day would come when she should ride through the town in
                     her own coach, and no thanks to old flint-head, who pretended to be so fond of
                     her. Mr. Bilkins tried to conjecture who was meant by old flint-head, but was
                     obliged to give it up. Mr. O'Rouke furthermore informed Margaret that he had
                     three hundred dollars prize-money coming to him, and broadly intimated that
                     when he got home he intended to have one of the most extensive blow-outs ever
                     witnessed in Rivermouth.</p>
                  <p>"Oche!" laughed Margaret, "that's jist Larry<pb n="100-101"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000051"/> over agin. The pore lad was allus full of his
                     nonsense an' spirits."</p>
                  <p>"That he was," said Mr. Bilkins, dryly.</p>
                  <p>Content with the fact that her husband was in the land of the living, Margaret
                     gave herself no trouble over the separation. O'Rouke had shipped for three
                     years; one third of his term of service was past, and two years more, God
                     willing, would see him home again. This was Margaret's view of it. Mr.
                     Bilkins's view of it was not so cheerful. The prospect of Mr. O'Rouke's
                     ultimate return was anything but enchanting. Mr. Bilkins was by no means
                     disposed to kill the fatted calf. He would much rather have killed the Prodigal
                     Son. However, there was always this chance: he might never come back.</p>
                  <p>The tides rose and fell at the Rivermouth wharves; the summer moonlight and the
                     winter snow, in turn, bleached its quiet streets; and the two years had nearly
                     gone by. In the mean time nothing had been heard of O'Rouke. If he ever
                     received the five or six letters sent to him, he did not fatigue himself by
                     answering them.</p>
                  <p>"Larry's all right," said hopeful Margaret. If any harum had come to the
                     gossoon, we'd have knowed it. It's the bad news that travels fast."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Bilkins was not so positive about that. It had taken a whole year to find
                     out that O'Rouke had not drowned himself.</p>
                  <p>The period of Mr. O'Rouke's enlistment had come to an end. Two months slipped
                     by, and he had neglected to brighten Rivermouth with his presence. There were
                     many things that might have detained him, difficulties in getting his
                     prize-papers or in drawing his pay; but there was no reason why he might not
                     have written. The days were beginning to grow long to Margaret, and vague
                     forebodings of misfortune possessed her.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps we had better look up Mr. O'Rouke.</p>
                  <p>He had seen some rough times, during those three years, and some harder work
                     than catching cunners at the foot of Anchor Street, or setting out crocuses in
                     Mr. Bilkins's back garden. He had seen battles and shipwreck, and death in many
                     guises; but they had taught him nothing, as the sequel will show. With his
                     active career in the navy we shall not trouble ourselves; we<pb n="102-103"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000052"/> take him up at a date a little prior to the
                     close of his term of service.</p>
                  <p>Several months before, he had been transferred from the blockading squadron to
                     a gun-boat attached to the fleet operating against the forts defending New
                     Orleans. The forts had fallen, the fleet had passed oil to the city, and Mr.
                     O'Rouke's ship lay off in the stream, binding up her wounds. In three days be
                     would receive his discharge, and the papers entitling him to a handsome amount
                     of prize-money in addition to his pay With noble contempt for so much good
                     fortune, Mr. O'Rouke dropped over the bows of the gun-boat one evening and
                     managed to reach the levee. In the city he fell in with some soldiers, and,
                     being of a convivial nature, caroused with them, that night, and next day
                     enlisted in a cavalry regiment.</p>
                  <p>Desertion in the face of the enemy for city lay under Federal guns, it was
                     enough—involved the heaviest penalties. O'Rouke was speedily arrested with
                     other deserters, tried by court-martial, and sentenced to death.</p>
                  <p>The intelligence burst like a shell upon the quiet household in Anchor Street,
                     listening daily for the sound of Larry O'Rouke's footstep on the threshold. It
                     was a heaVy load for Margaret to bear, after all those years of patient vigil.
                     But the load was to be lightened for her. In consideration of O'Rouke's long
                     service, and in view of the fact that his desertion so near the expiration of
                     his time was an absurdity, the Good President commuted his sentence to
                     imprisonment for life, with loss of prize-money and back pay. Mr. O'Rouke was
                     despatched North, and placed in Moyamensing Prison.</p>
                  <p>If joy could kill, Margaret would have been a dead woman the day those tidings
                     reached Rivermouth; and Mr. Bilkins himself would have been in a critical
                     condition, for, thought he did not want O'Rouke shot or hanged, he was
                     delighted to have him permanently shelved.</p>
                  <p>After the excitement was over, and this is trying time, Margaret accepted the
                     situation philosophically.</p>
                  <p>"The pore lad's out o' harum's rache, any way," she reflected. "He can't be
                     gittin' into hot wather now, and that's a fact. And maybe after awhiles they'll
                     let him go agin. They<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC5554-00000053"/> let out
                     murtherers and thaves and sich like, and Larry's done no hurt to nobody but
                     hisself."</p>
                  <p>Margaret was inclined to be rather severe on President Lincoln for taking away
                     Larry's prize-money. The impression was strong on her mind that the money went
                     into Mr. Lincoln's private exchequer.</p>
                  <p>"I would n't wonder if Misthress Lincoln had a new silk gownd or two this
                     fall," Margaret would remark, sarcastically.</p>
                  <p>The prison rules permitted Mr. O'Rouke to receive periodical communications
                     from his friends outside. Once every quarter Mr. Bilkins wrote him a letter,
                     and in the interim Margaret kept him supplied with those doleful popular
                     ballads, printed on broadsides, which one sees pinned up for sale on the iron
                     railings of city churchyards, and seldom anywhere else. They seem the natural
                     exhalations of the mould and pathos of such places, but we have a suspicion
                     that they are written by sentimental young undertakers. Though these songs must
                     have been a solace to Mr. O'Rouke in his captivity, he never so far forgot
                     himself as to acknowledge their receipt. It was only through the kindly
                     chaplain of the prison that Margaret was now and then advised of the well-being
                     of her husband.</p>
                  <p>Towards the close of that year the great O'Rouke himself did condescend to
                     write one letter. As this letter has never been printed, and as it is the only
                     specimen extant of Mr. O'Rouke's epistolary manner, we lay it before the reader

                  <p>"Pop goes the Weasel" was sent to him, and Mr. Bilkins ingeniously slipped into
                     the same envelope "Beware of the Bowl," and "The Drunkard's Death," two
                     spirited compositions well calculated to exert a salutary influence over a man
                     imprisoned for life.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing in this earthly existence so uncertain as what seems to be a
                     certainty. To all appearances, the world outside of Moyamensing Prison was
                     forever a closed book to O'Rouke. But the Southern Confederacy collapsed, the
                     General Amnesty Proclamation was issued, cell doors were thrown open; and one
                     afternoon Mr. Larry<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC5554-00000054"/> Rouke, with his
                     head neatly shaved, walked into the Bilkins kitchen and frightened Margaret
                     nearly out of her skin.</p>
                  <p>Mr. O'Rouke's summing up of his case was characteristic: "I've bin kilt in
                     battle, hanged by the coort-martial, put into the lock-up for life, and here I
                     am, bedad, not a ha'p'orth the worse for it.</p>
                  <p>None the worse for it, certainly, and none the better. By no stretch of magical
                     fiction can we make an angel of him. He is not at all the material for an
                     apotheosis. It was not for him to reform and settle down, and become a
                     respectable, oppressed tax-payer. His conduct in Rivermouth, after his return,
                     was a repetition of his old ways. Margaret all but broke down under the tests
                     to which he put her affections, and came at last to wish that Larry had never
                     got out of Moyamensing Prison.</p>
                  <p>If any change had taken place in Mr. O'Rouke, it showed itself in occasional
                     fits of sullenness towards Margaret. It was in one of these moods that he
                     slouched his hat over his brows, and told her she need n't wait dinner for
                     him.</p>
                  <p>It will be a cold dinner, if Margaret has kept it waiting; for two years have
                     gone by since that day, and O'Rouke has not come home.</p>
                  <p>Possibly he is off on a whaling voyage; possibly the swift maelstrom has
                     dragged him down; perhaps he is lifting his hand to knock at the door of the
                     Bilkins mansion as we pen these words. But Margaret does not watch for him
                     impatiently any more. There are strands of gray in her black hair. She has had
                     her romance.</p>

                     <hi rend="i"/>OF course that was not his name. Even in the State of Maine,
                     where it is still a custom to maim a child for life by christening him Arioch
                     or Shadrach or Ephraim, nobody would dream of calling a boy "Quite So." It was
                     merely a nickname which we gave him in camp; it stuck to him with such bur-like
                     tenacity, and is so inseparable from my memory of him, that I do not think I
                     could write definitely of John Bladburn if I were to call him anything but
                     "Quite So."</p>
                  <p>It was one night shortly after the first battle of Bull Run. The Army of the
                     Potomac, shattered, stunned, and forlorn, was back in its old quarters behind
                     the earth-works. The melancholy line of ambulances bearing our wounded to
                     Washington was not done creeping over Long Bridge; the blue smocks and the gray
                     still lay in windrows on the field of Manassas; and the gloom that weighed down
                     our hearts was like the fog that stretched along the bosom of the Potomac, and
                     infolded the valley of the Shenandoah. A drizzling rain had set in at twilight,
                     and, growing bolder with the darkness, was beating a dismal tattoo on the
                     tent,—the tent of Mess 6, Company A, -th Regiment N. Y. Volunteers. Our mess,
                     consisting originally of eight men, was reduced to four. Little Billy, as one
                     the boys grimly remarked, had concluded to remain at Manassas; Corporal Steele
                     we had to leave at Fairfax Court-House, shot through the hip; Hunter and Suydam
                     we had said good by that afternoon. "Tell Johnny Reb," says Hunter, lifting up
                     the leather side-piece of the ambulance, "that I'll be back again as soon as
                     get a new leg." But Suydam said nothing; only unclosed his eyes languidly and
                     smiled farewell to us.</p>
                  <p>The four of us who were left alive and unhurt that shameful July day sat
                     gloomily smoking our brier-wood pipes, thinking our thoughts, and listening<pb
                        n="110-111" xml:id="VAC5554-00000056"/> tening to the rain pattering against
                     the canvas. That, and the occasional whine of a hungry cur, foraging on the
                     outskirts of the camp for a stray bone, alone broke the silence, save when a
                     vicious drop of rain detached itself meditatively from the ridge-pole of the
                     tent, and fell upon the wick of our tallow candle, making it "cuss," as Ned
                     Strong described it. The candle was in the midst of one of its most profane
                     fits when Blakely, knocking the ashes from his pipe and addressing no one in
                     particular, but giving breath, unconsciously as it were, to the result of his
                     cogitations, observed that "it was considerable of a fizzle."</p>
                  <p>"The 'on to Richmond' business?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes."</p>
                  <p>"I wonder what they'll do about it over yonder," said Curtis, pointing over his
                     right shoulder. By "over yonder" he meant the North in general and
                     Massachusetts especially. Curtis was a Boston boy, and his sense of locality
                     was so strong that, during all his wanderings in Virginia, I do not believe
                     there was a moment, day or night, when he could not have made a bee-line for
                     Faneuil Hall.</p>
                  <p>"Do about it?" cried Strong. "They'll make about two hundred thousand blue
                     flannel trousers and send them along, each pair with a man in it, —all the
                     short men in the long trousers, and all the tall men in the short ones," he
                     added, ruefully contemplating his own leg-gear, which scarcely reached to his
                     ankles.</p>
                  <p>"That's so," said Blakely. "Just now, when I was tackling the commissary for an
                     extra candle, I saw a crowd of new fellows drawing blankets."</p>
                  <p>"I say there, drop that!" cried Strong. "All right, sir, did n't know it was
                     you," he added hastily, seeing it was Lieutenant Haines who had thrown back the
                     flap of the tent, and let in a gust of wind and rain that threatened the most
                     serious bronchial consequences to our discontented tallow dip.</p>
                  <p>"You're to bunk in here," said the lieutenant, speaking to some one outside.
                     The some one stepped in, and Haines vanished in the darkness.</p>
                  <p>When Strong had succeeded in restoring the candle to consciousness, the light
                     fell upon a tall, shy-looking man of about thirty-five, with long,<pb
                        n="112-113" xml:id="VAC5554-00000057"/> hay-colored beard and mustache, upon
                     which the rain-drops stood in clusters, like the night-dew on patches of cobweb
                     in a meadow. It was an honest face, with unworldly sort of blue eyes, that
                     looked out from under the broad visor of the infantry cap. With a deferential
                     glance towards us, the new-comer unstrapped his knapsack, spread his blanket
                     over it, and sat down unobtrusively.</p>
                  <p>"Rather damp night out," remarked Blakely, whose strong hand was supposed to be
                     conversation.</p>
                  <p>"Quite so," replied the stranger, not curtly, but pleasantly, and with an air
                     as if he had said all there was to be said about it.</p>
                  <p>"Come from the North recently?" inquired Blakely, after a pause.</p>
                  <p>"Yes."</p>
                  <p>"From any place in particular?"</p>
                  <p>"Maine."</p>
                  <p>"People considerably stirred up down there?" continued Blakely, determined not
                     to give up.</p>
                  <p>"Quite so."</p>
                  <p>Blakely threw a puzzled look over the tent, and seeing Ned Strong on the broad
                     grin, frowned merely. Strong instantly assumed an abstracted air, and began
                     humming softly,</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>"I wish I was in Dixie."</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>"The State of Maine," observed Blakely, with certain defiance of manner not at
                     all necessary discussing a geographical question, "is a pleasant State."</p>
                  <p>"In summer," suggested the stranger.</p>
                  <p>"In summer, I mean," returned Blakely with animation, thinking he had broken
                     the ice. Cold as blazes in winter, though,—is n't it?"</p>
                  <p>The new recruit merely nodded.</p>
                  <p>Blakely eyed the man homicidally for a moment, and then, smiling one of those
                     smiles of simulated gayety which the novelists inform us more tragic than
                     tears, turned upon him with withering irony.</p>
                  <p>"Trust you left the old folks pretty comfortable?"</p>
                  <p>"Dead.".</p>
                  <p>"The old folks dead!"</p>
                  <p>"Quite so."</p>
                  <p>Blakely made a sudden dive for his blanket, tucked it around him with painful
                     precision, and was heard no more.</p>
                  <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC5554-00000058"/>
                  <p>Just then the bugle sounded "lights out,"—bugle answering bugle in far-off
                     camps. When our not elaborate night-toilets were complete, Strong threw
                     somebody else's old boot at the candle with infallible aim, and darkness took
                     possession of the tent. Ned, who lay on my left, presently reached over to me,
                     and whispered, "I say, our friend 'quite so' is a garrulous old boy! He'll talk
                     himself to death some of these odd times, if he is n't careful. How he
                        <emph>did</emph> run on!"</p>
                  <p>The next morning, when I opened my eyes, the new member of Mess 6 was sitting
                     on his knapsack, combing his blond beard with a horn comb. He nodded pleasantly
                     to me, and to each of the boys as they woke up, one by one. Blakely did not
                     appear disposed to renew the animated conversation of the previous night; but
                     while he was gone to make a requisition for what was in pure sarcasm called
                     coffee, Curtis ventured to ask the man his name.</p>
                  <p>"Bladburn, John," was the reply.</p>
                  <p>"That's rather an unwieldy name for everyday use," put in Strong. If it would
                     n't hurt your feelings, I'd like to call you Quite So,— for short. Don't say
                     no, if you don't like it. Is it agreeable?"</p>
                  <p>Bladburn gave a little laugh, all to himself, seemingly, and was about to say,
                     "Quite so," when he caught at the words, blushed like a girl, and nodded a
                     sunny assent to Strong. From that day until the end, the sobriquet clung to
                     him.</p>
                  <p>The disaster at Bull Run was followed, as the reader knows, by a long period of
                     masterly inactivity, so far as the Army of the Potomac was concerned. McDowell,
                     a good soldier but unlucky, retired to Arlington Heights, and McClellan, who
                     had distinguished himself in Western Virginia, took command of the forces in
                     front of Washington, and bent his energies to reorganizing the demoralized
                     troops. It was a dreary time to the people of the North, who looked fatuously
                     from week to week for "the fall of Richmond"; and it was a dreary time to the
                     denizens of that vast city of tents and forts which stretched in a semicircle
                     before the beleaguered Capitol,—so tedious and soul-wearing a time that the
                     hardships of forced marches and the horrors of battle became desirable things
                     to them.</p>
                  <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC5554-00000059"/>
                  <p>Roll-call morning and evening, guard-duty, dress-parades, an occasional
                     reconnoissance, dominos, wrestling-matches, and such rude games as could be
                     carried on in camp made up the sum of our lives. The arrival of the mail with
                     letters and papers from home was the event of the day. We noticed that Bladburn
                     neither wrote nor received any letters. When the rest of the boys were
                     scribbling away for dear life, with drumheads and knapsacks and cracker-boxes
                     for writing-desks, he would sit serenely smoking his pipe, but looking out on
                     us through rings of smoke with a face expressive of the tenderest interest.</p>
                  <p>Look here, Quite So," Strong would say, "the mail-bag closes in half an hour.
                     Ain't you going to write?"</p>
                  <p>"I believe not to-day," Bladburn would reply, as if he had written yesterday,
                     or would write tomorrow: but he never wrote.</p>
                  <p>He had become a great favorite with us, and with all the officers of the
                     regiment. He talked less than any man I ever knew, but there was nothing
                     sinister or sullen in his reticence. It was sunshine,—warmth and brightness,
                     but no voice. Unassuming and modest to the verge of shyness, he impressed every
                     one as a man of singular pluck and nerve.</p>
                  <p>"Do you know," said Curtis to me one day, "that that fellow Quite So is clear
                     grit, and when we come to close quarters with our Palmetto brethren over
                     yonder, he'll do something devilish?"</p>
                  <p>"What makes you think so?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, nothing quite explainable; the exasperating coolness of the man, as much
                     as anything. This morning the boys were teasing Muffin Fan" [a small mulatto
                     girl who used to bring muffins into camp three times a week, —at the peril of
                     her life!] "and Jemmy Blunt of Company K—you know him—was rather rough on the
                     girl, when Quite So, who had been reading under a tree, shut one finger in his
                     book, walked over to where the boys were skylarking, and with the smile of a
                     juvenile angel on his face lifted Jemmy out of that and set him down gently in
                     front of his own tent. There Blunt sat speechless, staring at Quite So, who was
                     back again under the tree, pegging away at his little Latin grammar."</p>
                  <p>That Latin grammar! He always had it about<pb n="118-119"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000060"/> him, reading it or turning over its dog's-eared
                     pages at odd intervals and in out-of-the-way places. Half a dozen times a day
                     he would draw it out from the bosom of his blouse, which had taken the shape of
                     the book just over the left breast, look at it as if to assure himself it was
                     all right, and then put the thing back. At night the volume lay beneath his
                     pillow. The first thing in the morning, before he was well awake, his hand
                     would go groping instinctively under his knapsack in search of it.</p>
                  <p>A devastating curiosity seized upon us boys concerning that Latin grammar, for
                     we had discovered the nature of the book. Strong wanted to steal it one night,
                     but concluded not to. "In the first place," reflected Strong, "I have n't the
                     heart to do it, and in the next place I have n't the moral courage. Quite So
                     would placidly break every bone in my body." And I believe Strong was not far
                     out of the way.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes I was vexed with myself for allowing this tall, simple-hearted
                     country fellow to puzzle me so much. And yet, was he a simple-hearted country
                     fellow? City bred he certainly was not; but his manner, in spite of his
                     awkwardness ness, had an indescribable air of refinement. Now and then, too, he
                     dropped a word or a phrase that showed his familiarity with unexpected lines of
                     reading. "The other day," said Curtis, with the slightest elevation of eyebrow,
                     "he had the cheek to correct my Latin for me." In short, Quite So was a daily
                     problem to the members of Mess 6. Whenever he was absent, and Blakely and
                     Curtis and Strong and I got together in the tent, we discussed him, evolving
                     various theories to explain why he never wrote to anybody and why nobody ever
                     wrote to him. Had the man committed some terrible crime, and fled to the army
                     to hide his guilt? Blakely suggested that he must have murdered "the old
                     folks." What did he mean by eternally conning that tattered Latin grammar? And
                     was his name Bladburn, anyhow? Even his imperturbable amiability became
                     suspicious. And then his frightful reticence! If he was the victim of any deep
                     grief or crushing calamity, why did n't he seem unhappy? What business had he
                     to be cheerful?</p>
                  <p>"It's my opinion," said Strong, "that he's a rival Wandering Jew; the original
                     Jacobs, you know, was a dark fellow."</p>

                  <p>Blakely inferred from something Bladburn had said, or something he had not
                     said, which was more likely,—that he had been a schoolmaster at some period of
                     his life.</p>
                  <p>"Schoolmaster be hanged!" was Strong's comment. "Can you fancy a schoolmaster
                     going about conjugating baby verbs out of a dratted little spelling-book? No,
                     Quite So has evidently been a—a—Blest if I can imagine <emph>what</emph> he's
                     been!"</p>
                  <p>Whatever John Bladburn had been, he was a lonely man. Whenever I want a type of
                     perfect human isolation, I shall think of him, as he was in those days, moving
                     remote, self-contained, and alone in the midst of two hundred thousand men.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>THE Indian summer, with its infinite beauty and tenderness, came
                     like a reproach that year to Virginia. The foliage, touched here and there with
                     prismatic tints, drooped motionless in the golden haze. The delicate Virginia
                     creeper was almost minded to put forth its scarlet buds again. No wonder the
                     lovely phantom—this dusky Southern sister of the pale Northern June—lingered
                     not long with us, but, filling the once peaceful glens and valleys with her
                     pathos, stole away rebukefully before the savage enginery of man.</p>
                  <p>The preparations that had been going on for months in arsenals and foundries at
                     the North were nearly completed. For weeks past the air had been filled with
                     rumors of an advance; but the rumor of to-day refuted the rumor of yesterday,
                     and the Grand Army did not move. Heintzelman's corps was constantly folding its
                     tents, like the Arabs, and as silently stealing away;<pb n="122-123"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000062"/> but somehow it was always in the same place the
                     next morning. One day, at length, orders came down for our brigade to move.</p>
                  <p>"We're going to Richmond, boys!" shouted Strong, thrusting his heads in at the
                     tent; and we all cheered and waved our caps like mad. You see, Big Bethel and
                     Bull Run and Ball's Bluff (the bloody B's, as we used to call them,) had n't
                     taught us any better sense.</p>
                  <p>Rising abruptly from the plateau, to the left of our encampment,I was a tall
                     hill covered with a stunted growth of red-oak, persimmon, and chestnut. The
                     night before we struck tents I climbed up to the crest to take a parting look
                     at a spectacle which custom had not been able to rob of its enchantment. There,
                     at my feet, and extending miles and miles away, lay the camps of the Grant
                     Army, with its camp-fires reflected luridly against the sky. Thousands of
                     lights were twinkling in every direction, some nestling in the valley, some
                     like fire-flies beating their wings and palpitating among the trees, and others
                     stretching in parallel lines and curves, like the street-lamps of a city.
                     Somewhere, far off, a band was playing, at intervals it seemed; and now and
                     then, nearer to, a silvery strain from a bugle shot sharply up through the
                     night and seemed to lose itself like a rocket among the stars,—the patient,
                     untroubled stars. Suddenly a hand was laid upon my arm.</p>
                  <p>"I'd like to say a word to you," said Bladburn.</p>
                  <p>With a little start of surprise, I made room for him on the fallen tree where I
                     was seated.</p>
                  <p>"I may n't get another chance," he said. "You and the boys have been very kind
                     to me, kinder than I deserve; but sometimes I've fancied that my not saying
                     anything about myself had given you the idea that all was not right in my past.
                     I want to say that I came down to Virginia with a clean record."</p>
                  <p>"We never really doubted it, Bladburn."</p>
                  <p>"If I did n't write home," he continued, "it was because I had n't any home,
                     neither kith nor kin. When I said the old folks were dead, I said it. Am I
                     boring you? If I thought I was—"</p>
                  <p>"No, Bladburn. I have often wanted you to talk to me about yourself, not from
                     idle curiosity, I trust, but because I liked you that rainy night<pb
                        n="124-125" xml:id="VAC5554-00000063"/> when you came to camp, and have gone
                     on liking you ever since. This is n't too much to say, when Heaven only knows
                     how soon I may be past saying it or you listening to it."</p>
                  <p>"That's it," said Bladburn, hurriedly, "that's why I want to talk with you.
                     I've a fancy that I sha' n't, come out of our first battle."</p>
                  <p>The words gave me a queer start, for I had been trying several days to throw
                     off a similar presentiment concerning him,—a foolish presentiment that grew out
                     of a dream.</p>
                  <p>"In case anything of that kind turns up," he continued, "I'd like you to have
                     my Latin grammar here,—you've seen me reading it. You might stick it away in a
                     bookcase, for the sake of old times. It goes against me to think of it falling
                     into rough hands or being kicked about camp and trampled under foot."</p>
                  <p>He was drumming softly with his fingers on the volume in the bosom of his
                     blouse.</p>
                  <p>"I did n't intend to speak of this to a living soul," he went on, motioning me
                     not to answer him; "but something took hold of me to-night and made me follow
                     you up here. Perhaps if I told you all, you would be the more willing to look
                     after the little book in case it goes ill with me. When the war broke out I was
                     teaching school down in Maine, in the same village where my father was
                     schoolmaster before me. The old man when he died left me quite alone. I lived
                     pretty much by myself, having no interests outside of the district school,
                     which seemed in a manner my personal property. Eight years ago last spring a
                     new pupil was brought to the school, a slight slip of a girl, with a sad kind
                     of face and quiet ways. Perhaps it was because she was n't very strong, and
                     perhaps because she was n't used over well by those who had charge of her, or
                     perhaps it was because my life was lonely, that my heart warmed to the child.
                     It all seems like a dream now, since that April morning when little Mary stood
                     in front of my desk with her pretty eyes looking down bashfully and her soft
                     hair falling over her face. One day I look up, and six years have gone by,—as
                     they go by in dreams,—and among the scholars is a tall girl of sixteen, with
                     serious, womanly eyes which I cannot trust myself to look upon. The old life
                     has come to an end. The child has become a woman and can teach the master
                        now.<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC5554-00000064"/> So help me Heaven, I did n't
                     know that I loved her until that day!"</p>
                  <p>"Long after the children had gone home I sat in the school-room with my face
                     resting on my hands. There was her desk, the afternoon shadows falling across
                     it. It never looked empty and cheerless before. I went and stood by the low
                     chair, as I had stood hundreds of times. On the desk was a pile of books, ready
                     to be taken away, and among the rest a small Latin grammar which we had studied
                     together. What little despairs and triumphs and happy hours were associated
                     with it! I took it up curiously, as if it were some gentle dead thing, and
                     turned over the pages, and could hardly see them. Turning the pages, idly so, I
                     came to a leaf on which something was written with ink, in the familiar girlish
                     hand. It was only the words 'Dear John,' through which she had drawn two hasty
                     pencil lines—I wish she had n't drawn those lines!" added Bladburn, under his
                     breath.</p>
                  <p>He was silent for a minute or two, looking off towards the camps, where the
                     lights were fading out one by one.</p>
                  <p>"I had no right to go and love Mary. I was twice her age, an awkward, unsocial
                     man, that would have blighted her youth. I was as wrong as wrong can be. But I
                     never meant to tell her. I locked the grammar in my desk and the secret in my
                     heart for a year. I could n't bear to meet her in the village, and kept away
                     from every place where she was likely to be. Then she came to me, and sat down
                     at my feet penitently, just as she used to do when she was a child, and asked
                     what she had done to anger me; and then, Heaven forgive me! I told her all, and
                     asked her if she could say with her lips the words she had written, and she
                     nestled in my arms all a trembling like a bird, and said them over and over
                     again.</p>
                  <p>"When Mary's family heard of our engagement, there was trouble. They looked
                     higher for Mary than a middle-aged schoolmaster. No blame to them. They forbade
                     me the house, her uncles; but we met in the village and at the neighbors'
                     houses, and I was happy, knowing she loved me. Matters were in this state when
                     the war came on. I had a strong call to look after the old flag, and I hung my
                     head that day when the company raised in our village marched by<pb n="128-129"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000065"/> the school-house to the railroad station; but I
                     could n't tear myself away. About this time the minister's son, who had been
                     away to college, came to the village. He met Mary here and there, and they
                     became great friends. He was a likely fellow, near her own age, and it was
                     natural they should like one another. Sometimes I winced at seeing him made
                     free of the home from which I was shut out; then I would open the grammar at
                     the leaf where 'Dear John' was written up in the corner, and my trouble was
                     gone. Mary was sorrowful and pale these days, and I think her people were
                     worrying her.</p>
                  <p>"It was one evening two or three days before we got the news of Bull Run. I had
                     gone down to the burying-ground to trim the spruce hedge set round the old
                     man's lot, and was just stepping into the enclosure, when I heard voices from
                     the opposite side. One was Mary's, and the other I knew to be young Marston's,
                     the minister's son. I did n't mean to listen, but what Mary was saying struck
                     me dumb. <emph>We must never meet again</emph>, she was saying in a wild way.
                        <emph>We must say good by here, forever,—good by, good by!</emph> And I
                     could hear her sobbing bing. Then, presently, she said, hurriedly, <emph>No,
                        no; my hand, not ny lips!</emph> Then it seemed he kissed her hands, and the
                     two parted, one going towards the parsonage, and the other out by the gate near
                     where I stood.</p>
                  <p>"I don't know how long I stood there, but the night-dews had wet me to the bone
                     when I stole out of the graveyard and across the road to the school-house. I
                     unlocked the door, and took the Latin grammar from the desk and hid it in my
                     bosom. There was not a sound or a light anywhere as I walked out of the
                     village. And now," said Bladburn, rising suddenly from the tree-trunk, "if the
                     little book ever falls in your way, won't you see that it comes to no harm, for
                     my sake, and for the sake of the little woman who was true to me and did n't
                     love me? Wherever she is to-night, God bless her!"</p>
                  <milestone n="" unit="TOPOGRAPHY"/>
                  <p>As we descended to camp with our arms resting on each other's shoulder, the
                     watch-fires were burning low in the valleys and along the hillsides, and as far
                     as the eye could reach the silent tents lay bleaching in the moonlight.</p>

                  <head>III.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>WE imagined that the throwing forward of our brigade was the
                     initial movement of a general advance of the army; but that, as the reader will
                     remember, did not take place until the following March. The Confederates had
                     fallen back to Centreville without firing a shot, and the National troops were
                     in possession of Lewinsville, Vienna, and Fairfax Court-House. Our new position
                     was nearly identical with that which we had occupied on the night previous to
                     the battle of Bull Run,—on the old turnpike road to Manassas, where the enemy
                     was supposed to be in great force. With a field-glass we could see the Rebel
                     pickets moving in a belt of woodland on our right, and morning and evening we
                     heard the spiteful roll of their snare-drums.</p>
                  <p>Those pickets soon became a nuisance to us. Hardly a night passed but they
                     fired upon our outposts, so far with no harmful result; but after a while it
                     grew to be a serious matter. The Rebels would crawl out on all-fours from the
                     wood into a field covered with underbrush, and lie there in the dark for hours,
                     waiting for a shot. Then our men took to the rifle-pits, pits ten or twelve
                     feet long by four or five deep, with the loose earth banked up a few inches
                     high on the exposed sides. All the pits bore names, more or less felicitous, by
                     which they were known to their transient tenants. One was called "The
                     Pepper-Box," another "Uncle Sam's Well," another "The Reb-Trap," and another, I
                     am constrained to say, was named after a not to be mentioned tropical locality.
                     Though this rude sort of nomenclature predominated, there was no lack of softer
                     titles, such as "Fortress Matilda" and "Castle Mary," and one had, though
                     unintentionally, a literary flavor to it, "Blair's Grave," which was not
                     popularly considered as reflecting unpleasantly on Nat Blair, who had assisted
                     in making the excavation.</p>
                  <p>Some of the regiment had discovered a field of late corn in the neighborhood,
                     and used to boil a few ears every day, while it lasted, for the boys detailed
                     on the night-picket. The corn-cobs were always scrupulously preserved and
                     mounted on<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC5554-00000067"/> the parapets of the pits.
                     Whenever a Rebel shot carried away one of these <emph>barbette</emph> guns,
                     there was swearing in that particular trench. Strong, who was very sensitive to
                     this kind of disaster, was complaining bitterly one morning, because he had
                     lost three "pieces" the night before.</p>
                  <p>"There's Quite So, now," said Strong, "when a Minie-ball comes
                        <emph>ping!</emph> and knocks one of his guns to finders, he merely smiles,
                     and does n't at all see the degradation of the thing."</p>
                  <p>Poor Bladburn! As I watched him day by day going about his duties, in his shy,
                     cheery way, with a smile for every one and not an extra word for anybody, it
                     was hard to believe he was the same man who, that night before we broke camp by
                     the Potomac, had poured out to me the story of his love and sorrow in words
                     that burned in my memory.</p>
                  <p>While Strong was speaking, Blakely lifted aside the flap of the tent and looked
                     in on us.</p>
                  <p>Boys, Quite So was hurt last night," he said, with a white tremor to his
                     lip.</p>
                  <p>"What!"</p>
                  <p>"Shot on picket."</p>
                  <p>"Why, he was in the pit next to mine," cried Strong.</p>
                  <p>"Badly hurt?"</p>
                  <p>"Badly hurt."</p>
                  <p>I knew he was; I need not have asked the question. He never meant to go back to
                     New England!</p>
                  <milestone n="" unit="TYPOGRAPHY"/>
                  <p>Bladburn was lying on the stretcher in the hospital-tent. The surgeon had knelt
                     down by him, and was carefully cutting away the bosom of his blouse. The Latin
                     grammar, stained, and torn, slipped, and fell to the floor. Bladburn gave me a
                     quick glance. I picked up the book, and as I placed it in his hand, the icy
                     fingers closed softly over mine. He was sinking fast. In a few minutes the
                     surgeon finished his examination. When he rose to his feet there were tears on
                     the weather-beaten checks. He was a rough outside, but a tender heart.</p>
                  <p>"My poor lad," he blurted out," it's no use. If you've anything to say, say it
                     now, for you've nearly done with this world."</p>
                  <p>Then Bladburn lifted his eyes slowly to the surgeon, and the old smile flitted
                     over his face as he murmured,</p>
                  <p>"Quite so."</p>

               <head>A YOUNG DESPERADO.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>WHEN Johnny is all snugly curled up in bed, with his rosy cheek
                  resting on one of his scratched and grimy little hands, forming altogether a
                  faultless picture of peace and innocence, it is hard to realize what a busy,
                  restive, pugnacious, badly ingenious little wretch he is! There is something so
                  comical in those pygmy shoes and stockings sprawling on the floor,—they look as if
                  they could jump up and run off, if they wanted to—there is something so laughable
                  about those little trousers, which appear to be making futile attempts to climb up
                  into the easy-chair,—the said trousers still retaining the shape of Johnny's
                  active legs, and refusing to go to sleep,—there is something, I say, about these
                  things, and about Johnny himself, which makes it difficult for me to remember
                  that, when Johnny is awake, he possesses the cunning of Machiavel and the <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">sang-froid</foreign> of the Capitaine Fracasse.</p>
               <p>I am sure I do not know how he came by such unpleasant traits. I am myself the
                  least diplomatic and audacious of men. Of course, I do not mean to imply that
                  Johnny inherited, his disposition from his mother. She is the gentlest of women.
                  But when you come to Johnny,—he's the terror of the whole neighborhood.</p>
               <p>He was meek enough at first,—that is to say, for the first six or seven days of
                  his existence. But I verily believe he was not more than eleven days old and
                  twenty-two inches long when he showed a degree of temper that would have been
                  respectable in an aged giant. On that occasion he turned very red in the face,—he
                  was superfluously red before,—doubled up his ridiculous hands in the most
                  threatening manner, and finally, in the impotency of rage, punched himself in the
                  eye. When I think of the life he led his mother and Susan during the first
                  eighteen months after his arrival, I shrink from the responsibility of allowing
                  Johnny to call me father.</p>
               <p>Johnny's aggressive disposition was not more early developed than his duplicity.
                  By the time he was two years of age I had got the following bitter maxim by heart:
                  "Whenever J. is particularly<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC5554-00000069"/> ticularly
                  quiet, look out for squalls." He was sure to be in some mischief. And I must say
                  there was a novelty, an unexpectedness, an ingenuity, in his badness that
                  constantly astonished me. The crimes he committed could be arranged
                  alphabetically. He never repeated himself. His evil resources were inexhaustible.
                  He never did the thing I expected he would. He never failed to do the thing I was
                  unprepared for. I am not thinking so much of the time when he painted my
                  writing-desk with raspberry jam as of the occasion when he perpetrated an act of
                  original cruelty on Mopsey, a favorite kitten in the household. We were sitting in
                  the library. Johnny was playing in the front hall. In view of the supernatural
                  stillness that reigned, I remarked, suspiciously, "Johnny is very quiet, my dear."
                  At that moment a series of pathetic mews was heard in the entry, followed by a
                  violent scratching on the oil-cloth. Then Mopsey bounded into the room with three
                  empty spools strung upon her tail. The spools were removed with great difficulty,
                  especially the last one, which fitted remarkably tight. After that, Mopsey never
                  saw a work-basket without arching her tortoise-shell back, and distending her tail
                  to three times its natural thickness. Another child would have squeezed the
                  kitten, or stuck a pin in her, or twisted the tail; it was reserved for the
                  superior genius of Johnny to string rather small spools upon it. He heightened
                  expectation by never doing the obvious thing.</p>
               <p>It was this fertility and happiness, if I may say so, of invention that prevented
                  me from being entirely dejected over my son's behavior at this period. Sometimes
                  the temptation to seize him and shake him was too strong for poor human nature.
                  But I always regretted it afterwards. When I saw him asleep in his tiny bed, with
                  one tear dried on his plump, velvety cheek and two little mice-teeth visible
                  through the parted lips, I could not help thinking what a little bit of a fellow
                  he was, with his funny little fingers and his funny little nails; and it did not
                  seem to me that he was the sort of person to be pitched into by a great strong man
                  like me.</p>
               <p>"When Johnny grows older," I used to say to his mother, "I'll reason with
                  him."</p>
               <p>Now I do not know when Johnny will grow old enough to be reasoned with. When I
                     reflect<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC5554-00000070"/> how hard it is to reason
                  with wise grown-up people, if they happen to be unwilling to accept your view of
                  matters, I am inclined to be very patient with Johnny, whose experience is rather
                  limited, after all, though he is six years and a half old, and naturally wants to
                  know why and wherefore. Somebody says something about the duty of "blind
                  obedience." I cannot expect Johnny to have more wisdom than Solomon, and to be
                  more philosophic than the philosophers.</p>
               <p>At times, indeed, I have been led to expect this from him. He has shown a depth of
                  mind that warranted me in looking for anything. At times he seems as if he were a
                  hundred years old. He has a quaint, bird-like way of cocking his head on one side,
                  and asking a question that appears to be the result of years of study. If I could
                  answer some of those questions, I should solve the darkest mysteries of life and
                  death. His inquiries, however, generally have a grotesque flavor. One night, when
                  the mosquitoes were making sprightly raids on his person, he appealed to me,
                  suddenly: 'How does the moon feel when a skeeter bites it?" To his meditative
                  mind, the broad, smooth surface of the moon presented a temptation not to be
                  resisted by any wandering bird of prey.</p>
               <p>I freely confess that Johnny is now and then too much for me. I wish I could read
                  him as cleverly as he reads me. He knows all my weak points; he sees right through
                  me, and makes me feel that I am a helpless infant in his adroit hands. He has an
                  argumentative, oracular air, when things have gone wrong, which always upsets my
                  dignity. Yet how cunningly he uses his power! It is only in the last extremity
                  that he crosses his legs, puts his hands into his trousers-pockets, and argues the
                  case with me. One day last week he was very near coming to grief. By my
                  directions, kindling-wood and coal are placed every morning in the library grate,
                  in order that I may have a fire the moment I return at night. Master Johnny must
                  needs apply a lighted match to this arrangement early in the forenoon. The fire
                  was not discovered until the blower was one mass of incandescent iron, and the
                  wooden mantel-shelf was smoking with the intense heat.</p>
               <p>When I came home, Johnny was led from the store-room, where he had been imprisoned
                     from<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC5554-00000071"/> an early period, and where he
                  had employed himself in eating about two dollars' worth of preserved pears.</p>
               <p>"Johnny," said I, in as severe a tone as one could use in addressing a person
                  whose forehead glistened with syrup,—"Johnny, don't you remember that I have
                  always told you never to meddle with matches?"</p>
               <p>It was something delicious to see Johnny trying to remember. He cast one eye
                  meditatively up to the ceiling, then he fixed it abstractedly on the canary-bird,
                  then he rubbed his ruffled brows with a sticky hand; but really, for the life of
                  him, he could n't recall any injunctions concerning matches.</p>
               <p>"I can't, papa, truly," said Johnny at length. "I guess I must have forgot
                  it."</p>
               <p>"Well, Johnny, in order that you may not forget it in future—"</p>
               <p>Here Johnny was seized with an idea. He interrupted me.</p>
               <p>"I'll tell you what you do, papa,—<emph>you jest put it down in
                  writin'</emph>."</p>
               <p>With the air of a man who has settled a question definitely, but at the same time
                  is willing to listen politely to any crude suggestions that you may have to throw
                  out, Johnny crossed his legs, and thrust his hands into those wonderful
                  trousers-pockets. I turned my face aside, for I felt a certain weakness creeping
                  into the corners of my mouth. I was lost. In an instant the little head, covered
                  all over with brown curls, was laid upon my knee, and Johnny was crying, "I'm so
                  very, very sorry!"</p>
               <p>I have said that Johnny is the terror of the neighborhood. I think I have not done
                  the young gentleman an injustice. If there is a window broken within the radius of
                  two miles from our house, Johnny's ball, or a stone known to have come from his
                  dexterous hand, is almost certain to be found in the battered premises. I never
                  hear the musical jingling of splintered glass but my <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >porte-monnaie</foreign> gives a convulsive throb in my breast-pocket. There is
                  not a doorstep in our street that has not borne evidences in red chalk of his
                  artistic ability; there is not a bell that he has n't rung and run away from at
                  least three hundred times. Scarcely a day passes but he falls out of something, or
                  over something, or into something. A ladder running up to the<pb n="142-143"
                     xml:id="VAC5554-00000072"/> dizzy roof of an unfinished building is no more to
                  be resisted by him than the back platform of a horse-car, When the conductor is
                  collecting his fare in front.</p>
               <p>I should not like to enumerate the battles that Johnny has fought during the past
                  eight months. It is a physical impossibility, I should judge, for him to refuse a
                  challenge. He picks his enemies impartially out of all ranks of society. He has
                  fought the ash-man's boy, the grocer's boy, the plumber's boy, (I was glad of
                  that!) the rich boys over the way, and any number of miscellaneous boys who
                  chanced to stray into our street.</p>
               <p>I cannot say that this young desperado is always victorious. I have known the tip
                  of his nose to be in a state of unpleasant redness for weeks together. I have
                  known him to come home frequently with no brim to his hat; once he presented
                  himself with only one shoe, on which occasion his jacket was split up the back in
                  a manner that gave him the appearance of an over-ripe chestnut bursting out of its
                  bur. How he will fight! But this I can say,—if Johnny is as cruel as Caligula, he
                  is every inch as brave as Agamemnon.</p>
               <p>At present the General, as I sometimes call him, is in hospital. He was seriously
                  wounded at the battle of The Little Go-Cart, on the 9th instant. On returning from
                  my office yesterday evening, I found that scarred veteran stretched upon a sofa in
                  the sitting-room, with a patch of brown paper stuck over his left eye, and a
                  convicting smell of vinegar about him.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said his mother, dolefully, "Johnny's been fighting again. That horrid
                  Barnabee boy (who is eight years old, if he is a day) won't let the child
                  alone."</p>
               <p>"Well," said I, "I hope Johnny gave that Barnabee boy a thrashing."</p>
               <p>"Did n't I, though?" cries Johnny, from the sofa. "<emph>You</emph> bet!"</p>
               <p>"O Johnny!" remonstrates his mother.</p>
               <p>Now, several days previous to this, I had addressed the General in the following
                  terms:—</p>
               <p>"Johnny, if I ever catch you in another fight of your own seeking, I shall cane
                  you."</p>
               <p>In consequence of this declaration, it became my duty to look into the
                  circumstances of the present affair, which will be known in history as the battle
                  of The Little Go-Cart. After going<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC5554-00000073"/> over
                  the ground very carefully, I found the following to be the state of the case.</p>
               <p>It seems that the Barnabee Boy—I speak of him as if he were the Benicia Boy—is the
                  oldest pupil in the Primary Military School (I think it, <emph>must</emph> be a
                  military school) of which Johnny is a recent member. This Barnabee, having whipped
                  every one of his companions, was sighing for new boys to conquer, when Johnny
                  joined the institution. He at once made friendly overtures of battle to Johnny,
                  who, oddly enough, seemed indisposed to encourage his advances. Then Barnabee
                  began a series of petty persecutions, which had continued up to the day of the
                  fight.</p>
               <p>On the morning of that eventful day the Barnabee Boy appeared in the school-yard
                  with a small go-cart. After running down on Johnny several times with this useful
                  vehicle, he captured Johnny's cap, filled it with sand, and dragged it up and down
                  the yard triumphantly in the go-cart. This made the General very indignant, of
                  course, and he took an early opportunity of kicking over the triumphal car, in
                  doing which he kicked one of the wheels so far into space that it has not been
                  seen since.</p>
               <p>This brought matters to a crisis. The battle would have taken place then and
                  there; but at that moment the school-bell rang, and the gladiators were obliged to
                  give their attention to Smith's Speller. But a gloom hung over the morning's
                  exercises,—a gloom that was not dispelled in the back row, when the Barnabee Boy
                  stealthily held up to Johnny's vision a slate, whereon was inscribed this fearful
                  message:—</p>
               <p>
                  <figure>
                     <p>Ime a Going to Lick you at reces</p>
                  </figure>
               </p>
               <p>Johnny got it "put down in writin'" that time!</p>
               <p>After a hasty glance at the slate,the General went on with his studies composedly
                  enough. Eleven o'clock came, and with it came recess, and with recess the
                  inevitable battle.</p>
               <p>Now I do not intend to describe the details of this brilliant action, for the
                  sufficient reason that, though there were seven young gentlemen (connected<pb
                     n="146-147" xml:id="VAC5554-00000074"/> nected with the Primary School) on the
                  field as war correspondents, their accounts of the engagement are so contradictory
                  as to be utterly worthless. On one point they all agree,—that the contest was
                  sharp, short, and decisive. The truth is, the General is a quick, wiry,
                  experienced old hero; and it did not take him long to rout the Barnabee Boy, who
                  is in reality a coward, as all bullies and tyrants have ever been, and always will
                  be.</p>
               <p>I do not approve of boys fighting; I do not defend Johnny; but if the General
                  wants an extra ration or two of preserved pear, he shall have it!</p>
               <milestone n="" unit="typography"/>
               <p>I am thoroughly aware that, socially speaking, Johnny is a Black Sheep. I know
                  that I have brought him up badly, and that there is not an unmarried man or woman
                  in the United States who would n't have brought him up "very differently." It is a
                  great pity that the only people who know how to manage children never have any. At
                  the same time, Johnny is not a black sheep all over. He has some white spots. His
                  sins—if wiser folks had no greater!—are the result of too much animal life. They
                  belong to his evanescent youth, and will pass away; but his honesty, his
                  generosity, his bravery, belong to his character, and are enduring qualities. The
                  quickly crowding years will tame him. An expensive pane of glass, or a protrusive
                  bell-knob ceases in time to have attractions for the most susceptible temperament.
                  And I am confident that Johnny will be a great statesman, or a valorous soldier,
                  or, at all events, a good citizen, after he has got over being A Young
                  Desperado.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE OLD TAVERN AT BAYLEY'S FOUR-CORNERS.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>YOU will not find Greenton, or Bayley's Four-Corners as it is
                     more usually designated, on any map of New England that I know of. It is not a
                     town; it is not even a village; it is merely an absurd hotel. The almost
                     indescribable place called Greenton is at the intersection of four roads, in
                     the heart of New Hampshire, twenty miles from the nearest settlement of note,
                     and ten miles from any railway station. A good location for a hotel, you will
                     say. Precisely; but there has always been a hotel there, and for the last dozen
                     years it has been pretty well patronized—by one boarder. Not to trifle with an
                     intelligent public, I will state at once that, in the early part of this
                     century, Greenton was a point at which the mail-coach, on the Great Northern
                     Route, stopped to change horses and allow the passengers to dine. People in the
                     county, wishing to take the early mail Portsmouth-ward, put up overnight at the
                     old tavern, famous for its irreproachable larder and soft feather-beds. The
                     tavern at that time was kept by Jonathan Bayley, who rivalled his wallet in
                     growing corpulent, and in due time passed away. At his death the establishment,
                     which included a farm, fell into the hands of a son-in-law. Now, though Bayley
                     left his son-in-law a hotel,—which sounds handsome,—he left him no guests; for
                     at about the period of the old man's death the old stage-coach died also.
                     Apoplexy carried off one, and steam the other. Thus, by a sudden swerve in the
                     tide of progress, the tavern at the Corners found itself high and dry, like a
                     wreck on a sand-bank. Shortly after this event or maybe contemporaneously,
                     there was some attempt to build a town at Greenton; but it apparently failed,
                     if eleven cellars choked up with <foreign xml:lang="FRA">débris</foreign> and
                     overgrown with burdocks are any indication of failure. The farm, however, was a
                     good farm, as things go in New Hampshire; and Tobias Sewell, the son-in-law,
                     could afford to snap his fingers at the travelling<pb n="150-151"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000076"/> elling public if they came near enough,—which
                     they never did.</p>
                  <p>The hotel remains to-day pretty much the same as when Jonathan Bayley handed in
                     his accounts in 1840, except that Sewell has from time to time sold the
                     furniture, of some of the upper chambers to bridal couples in the neighborhood.
                     The bar is still open and the parlor door says PARLOUR in tall black letters.
                     Now and then a passing drover looks in at that lonely bar-room, where a
                     high-shouldered bottle of Santa Cruz rum ogles with a peculiarly knowing air a
                     shrivelled lemon on a shelf; now and then a farmer comes across country to talk
                     crops and stock and take a friendly glass with Tobias; and now and their a
                     circus caravan with speckled ponies, or a menagerie, with a soggy elephant,
                     halts under the swinging sign, on which there is a dim mail-coach with four
                     phantomish horses driven by a portly gentleman whose head has been washed off
                     by the rain. Other customers there are none, except that one regular boarder
                     whom I have mentioned.</p>
                  <p>If misery makes a man acquainted with strange bedfellows, it is equally certain
                     that the profession of surveyor and civil engineer often takes one into
                     undreamed-of localities. I had never heard of Greenton until my duties sent me
                     there, and kept me there two weeks in the dreariest season of the year. I do
                     not think I would, of my own volition, have selected Greenton for a fortnight's
                     sojourn at any time; but now the business is over, I shall never regret the
                     circumstances that made me the guest of Tobias Sewell and brought me into
                     intimate relations with Miss Mehetabel's Son.</p>
                  <p>It was a black October night in the year of grace 1872, that discovered me
                     standing in front of the old tavern at the Corners. Though the ten miles' ride
                     from K——had been depressing, especially the last five miles, on account of the
                     cold autumnal rain that had set in, I felt a pang of regret on hearing the
                     rickety, open wagon turn round in the road and roll off in the darkness. There
                     were no lights visible anywhere, and only for the big, shapeless mass of
                     something in front of me, which the driver had said was the hotel, I should
                     have fancied that I had been set down by the roadside. I was wet to the skin
                     and in no amiable humor; and not being able to find bell-pull or knocker, or
                     even a door, I belabored the side<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC5554-00000077"/> of
                     the house with my heavy walking-stick. In a minute or two I saw a i light
                     flickering somewhere aloft, then I heard the sound of a window opening,
                     followed by an exclamation of disgust as a blast of wind extinguished the
                     candle which had given me an instantaneous picture <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en
                        silhouette</foreign> of a man leaning out of a casement.</p>
                  <p>"I say, what do you want, down there?" said an unprepossessing voice.</p>
                  <p>"I want to come in, I want a supper, and a bed, and numberless things,".</p>
                  <p>"This is n't no time of night to go rousing honest folks out of their sleep.
                     Who are you, anyway?"</p>
                  <p>The question superficially considered, was a very simple one, and I, of all
                     people in the world, ought to have been able to answer it off-hand; but it
                     staggered me. Strangely enough, there came drifting across my memory the
                     lettering on the back of a metaphysical work which I had seen years before on a
                     shelf in the Astor Library. Owing to an unpremeditatedly funny collection of
                     title and author, the lettering read as follows: "Who Am I? Jones." Evidently
                     it had puzzled Jones to know who he was, or he would n't have written a book
                     about it, and come to so lame and impotent a conclusion. It certainly puzzled
                     me at that instant to define my identity. "Thirty years ago," I reflected, "I
                     was nothing; fifty years hence I shall be nothing again, humanly speaking. In
                     the mean time, who am I, sure enough?" It had never occurred to me before what
                     an indefinite article I was. I wish it had not occurred to me then. Standing
                     there in the rain and darkness, I wrestled vainly with the problem, and was
                     constrained to fall back upon a Yankee expedient.</p>
                  <p>"Is n't this a hotel?" I asked finally.</p>
                  <p>"Well, it is a sort of hotel," said the voice, doubtfully. My hesitation and
                     prevarication had apparently not inspired my interlocutor with confidence in
                     me.</p>
                  <p>"Then, let me in. I have just driven over from K—— in this infernal rain. I am
                     wet through and through."</p>
                  <p>"But what do you want here, at the Corners? What's your business? People don't
                     come here, least ways in the middle of the night."</p>
                  <p>"It is n't in the middle of the night," I returned, incensed. "I come on
                     business connected<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC5554-00000078"/> with the new
                     road. I 'm the superintendent of the works."</p>
                  <p>"Oh!"</p>
                  <p>"And if you don't open the door at once, I'll raise the whole neighborhood,—and
                     then go to the other hotel."</p>
                  <p>When I said that, I supposed Greenton was a village with three or four thousand
                     population at least, and was wondering vaguely at the absence of lights and
                     other signs of human habitation. Surely, I thought, all the people cannot be
                     abed and asleep at half past ten o'clock: perhaps I am in the business section
                     of the town, among the shops.</p>
                  <p>"You jest wait," said the voice above.</p>
                  <p>This request was not devoid of a certain accent of menace, and I braced myself
                     for a sortie on the part of the besieged, if he had any such hostile intent.
                     Presently a door opened at the very place where I least expected a door, at the
                     farther end of the building, in fact, and a man in his shirt-sleeves, shielding
                     a candle with his left hand, appeared on the threshold. I passed quickly into
                     the house with Mr. Tobias Sewell (for this was Mr. Sewell) at my heels, and
                     found myself in a long, low-studded bar-room.</p>
                  <p>There were two chairs drawn up before the hearth, on which a huge hemlock
                     backlog was still smouldering, and on the unpainted deal counter contiguous
                     stood two cloudy glasses with bits of lemon-peel in the bottom, hinting at
                     recent libations. Against the discolored wall over the bar hung a yellowed
                     handbill, in a warped frame, announcing that "the Next Annual N. H.
                     Agricultural Fair" would take place on the 10th of September, 1841. There was
                     no other furniture or decoration in this dismal apartment, except the cobwebs
                     which festooned the ceiling, hanging down here and there like stalactites.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Sewell set the candlestick on the mantel-shelf, and threw some pine-knots
                     on the fire, which immediately broke into a blaze, and showed him to be a lank,
                     narrow-chested man, past sixty, with sparse, steel-gray hair, and small,
                     deep-set eyes, perfectly round, like a carp's, and of no particular color. His
                     chief personal characteristics seemed to be too much feet and not enough teeth.
                     His sharply cut, but rather simple face, as he turned it towards me, wore a
                     look of interrogation<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC5554-00000079"/> rogaton.
                     Replied to his mute inquiry by taking out my pocket-book and banding him my
                     business-card, which he held up to the candle and perused with great
                     deliberation.</p>
                  <p>"You're a civil engineer, are you? he said, displaying his gums, which gave his
                     countenance an expression of almost infantile, innocence. He made no further
                     audible remark, but mumbled between his thin lips something which an
                     imaginative person might have construed into, "If you're a civil engineer, I'll
                     be blessed if I would n't like to see an uncivil one!"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Sewell growl, however, was worse than his bite,—owing to his lack of teeth
                     probably,—for he very good-naturedly set himself to work preparing supper for
                     me. After a slice of cold ham, and a warm punch, to which my chilled condition
                     gave a grateful flavor, I went to bed in a distant chamber in a most amiable
                     mood, feeling satisfied that Jones was a donkey to bother himself about his
                     identity.</p>
                  <p>When I awoke the sun was several hours high. My bed faced a window, and by
                     raising myself on one elbow I could look out on what I expected would be the
                     main street. To my astonishment ment, I beheld a lonely country road winding up
                     a sterile hill and disappearing over the ridge. In a cornfield at the right of
                     the road was a small private graveyard enclosed, by a crumbling stone-wall with
                     a red gate. The only thing suggestive of life was this little corner lot
                     occupied by death. I got out of bed and went to the other window. There I had
                     an uninterrupted view of twelve miles of open landscape, with Mount Agamenticus
                     in the purple distance. Not a house or a spire in sight. "Well," I exclaimed,
                     "Greenton does n't appear to be a very closely packed metropolis!" That rival
                     hotel with which I had threatened Mr. Sewell overnight was, not a deadly
                     weapon, looking at it by daylight. "by Jove!" I reflected, "maybe I'm in the
                     wrong place." But there, tacked against a panel of the bedroom door, was a
                     faded time-table dated Greenton, August 1, 1839.</p>
                  <p>I smiled all the time I was dressing, and went smiling down stairs, where I
                     found Mr. Sewell, assisted by one of the fair sex in the first bloom of her
                     eightieth year, serving breakfast for me on a small table—in the bar-room!</p>
                  <p>"I overslept myself this morning," I remarked<pb n="158-159"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000080"/> marked apologetically, "and I see that I am
                     putting you to some trouble. In future, if you will have me called, I will take
                     my meals at the usual <foreign xml:lang="FRA">table-d'hôte</foreign>."</p>
                  <p>"At the what?" said Mr. Sewell.</p>
                  <p>"I mean with the other boarders."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Sewell paused in the act of lifting a chop from the fire, and, resting the
                     point of his fork against the woodwork of the mantel-piece, grinned from ear to
                     ear.</p>
                  <p>"Bless you! there is n't any other boarders. There has n't been anybody put up
                     here sence—let me see—sence father-in-law died, and that was in the fall of
                     '40. To be sure, there 's Silas; <emph>he</emph>'s a regular boarder; but I
                     don't count him."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Sewell then explained how the tavern had lost its custom when the old stage
                     line was broken up by the railroad. The introduction of steam was, in Mr.
                     Sewell's estimation, a fatal error. "Jest killed local business. Carried it off
                     I'm darned if I know where. The whole country has been sort o' retrograding
                     ever sence steam was invented."</p>
                  <p>"You spoke of having one boarder,"I said.</p>
                  <p>"Silas? Yes; he came here the summer 'Tilda died,—she that was 'Tilda
                     Bayley,—and he's here yet, going on thirteen year. He could n't live any longer
                     with the old man. Between you and I, old Clem Jaffrey, Silas's father, was a
                     hard nut. Yes," said Mr. Sewell, crooking his elbow in inimitable pantomime,
                     "altogether too often. Found dead in the road hugging a three-gallon demijohn.
                        <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Habeas corpus</foreign> in the barn," added Mr.
                     Sewell, intending, I presume, to intimate that a <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                        >post-mortem</foreign> examination had been deemed necessary. "Silas," he
                     resumed, in that respectful tone which one should always adopt when speaking of
                     capital, "is a man of considerable property; lives on his interest, and keeps a
                     hoss and shay. He's a great scholar, too, Silas; takes all the pe-ri-odicals
                     and the Police Gazette regular."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Sewell was turning over a third chop, when the door opened and a stoutish,
                     middle-aged little gentleman, clad in deep black, stepped into the room.</p>
                  <p>"Silas Jaffrey," said Mr. Sewell, with a comprehensive sweep of his arm,
                     picking up me and the new-comer on one fork, so to speak. "Be acquainted!"</p>
                  <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC5554-00000081"/>
                  <p>Mr. Jaffrey advanced briskly, and gave me his hand with unlooked-for
                     cordiality. He was a dapper little man, with a head as round and nearly as bald
                     as an orange, and not unlike an orange in complexion, either; he had twinkling
                     gray eyes and a pronounced Roman nose, the numerous freckles upon which were
                     deepened by is funereal dress-coat and trousers. He reminded me of Alfred de
                     Musset's blackbird, which, with its yellow beak and sombre plumage, looked like
                     an undertaker eating an omelet.</p>
                  <p>"Silas will take care of you," said Mr. Sewell, taking down his hat from a peg
                     behind the door. "I've got the cattle to look after. Tell him, if you want
                     anything."</p>
                  <p>While I ate my breakfast, Mr. Jaffrey hopped up and down the narrow bar-room
                     and chirped away as blithely as a bird on a cherry-bough, occasionally ruffling
                     with his fingers a slight fringe of auburn hair which stood up pertly round his
                     head and seemed to possess a luminous quality of its own.</p>
                  <p>"Don't I find it a little slow up here at the Corners? Not at all, my dear sir.
                     I am in the thick of life up here. So many interesting ing things going on all
                     over the world,—inventions, discoveries, spirits, railroad disasters,
                     mysterious homicides. Poets, murderers, musicians, statesmen, distinguished
                     travellers, prodigies of all kinds turning up everywhere. Very few events or
                     persons escape me. I take six daily city papers, thirteen weekly journals, all
                     the monthly magazines, and two quarterlies. I could not get along with less. I
                     could n't if you asked me. I never feel lonely. How can I, being on intimate
                     terms, as it were, with thousands and thousands of people? There's that young
                     woman out West. What an entertaining creature <emph>she</emph> is!—now in
                     Missouri, now in Indiana, and now in Minnesota, always on the go, and all the
                     time shedding needles from various arts of her body as if she really enjoyed
                     it! Then there's that versatile patriarch who walks hundreds of miles and saws
                     thousands of feet of wood, before breakfast, and shows no signs of giving out.
                     Then there's that remarkable, one may say that historical colored woman who
                     knew Benjamin Franklin, and fought at the battle of Bunk—no, it is the old
                     negro man who fought Bunker Hill, a mere infant, of course, at that<pb
                        n="162-163" xml:id="VAC5554-00000082"/> period. Really, now, it is quite
                     curious to observe how that venerable female slave—formerly an African
                     princess—is repeatedly dying in her hundred and eleventh year, and coming to
                     life again punctually every six months in the small-type paragraphs. Are you
                     aware, sir, that within the last twelve years no fewer than two hundred and
                     eighty-seven of General Washington's colored coachmen have died?"</p>
                  <p>For the soul of me I could n't tell whether this quaint little gentleman was
                     chaffing me or not. I laid down my knife and fork, and stared at him.</p>
                  <p>"Then there are the mathematicians!" he cried vivaciously, without waiting for
                     a reply. "I take great interest in them. Hear this!" and Mr. Jaffrey drew a
                     newspaper from a pocket in the tail of his coat, and read as follows: <hi
                        rend="i"/>"It has been estimated that if all the candles manufactured by
                     this eminent firm (Stearine &amp; Co.) were placed end to end, they would reach
                     2 and ⅞ times around the globe. Of course," continued Mr. Jaffrey, folding up
                     the journal reflectively, "abstruse calculations of this kind are not, perhaps,
                     of vital importance, but they indicate the intellectual activity of the age.
                     Seriously, now," he said, halting in front of the table, "what with books and
                     papers and drives about the country, I do not find the days too long, though I
                     seldom see any one, except well I go over to K——for my mail. Existence may be
                     very full to a man who stands a little aside from the tumult and watches it
                     with philosophic eye. Possibly he may see more of the battle than those who are
                     in the midst of the action. Once I was struggling with the crowd, as eager and
                     undaunted as the best; perhaps I should have been struggling still. Indeed, I
                     know my life would have been very different now if I had married Mehetabel,—if
                     I had married Mehetabel."</p>
                  <p>His vivacity was gone, a sudden cloud had come over his bright face, his figure
                     seemed to have collapsed, the light seemed to have faded out of his hair. With
                     a shuffling step, the very antithesis of his brisk, elastic tread, he turned to
                     the door and passed into the road.</p>
                  <p>"Well," I said to myself, "if Greenton had forty thousand inhabitants, it could
                     n't turn out more astonishing old party than that!"</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>A MAN with a passion for <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >bric-à-brac</foreign> is always stumbling over antique bronzes, intaglios,
                     mosaics, and daggers of the time of Benvenuto Cellini; the bibliophile finds
                     creamy vellum folios and rare Alduses and Elzevirs waiting for him at
                     unsuspected bookstalls; the numismatist has but to stretch forth his palm to
                     have priceless coins drop into it. My own weakness is odd people, and I am
                     constantly encountering them. It was plain I had unearthed a couple of very
                     queer specimens at Bayley's Four-Corners. I saw that a fortnight afforded me
                     too brief an opportunity to develop the richness of both, and I resolved to
                     devote my spare time to Mr. Jaffrey alone, instinctively recognizing in him an
                     unfamiliar species. My professional work in the vicinity of Greenton left my
                     evenings and occasionally an afternoon unoccupied; these intervals I purposed
                     posed to employ in studying and classifying my fellow-boarder. It was
                     necessary, as a preliminary step, to learn something of his previous history,
                     and to this end I addressed myself to Mr. Sewell that same night.</p>
                  <p>"I do not want to seem inquisitive," I said to the landlord, as he was
                     fastening up the bar, which, by the way, was the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">salle
                        à manger</foreign> and general sitting-room,—"I do not want to seem
                     inquisitive, but your friend Mr. Jaffrey dropped a remark this morning at
                     breakfast which—which was not altogether clear to me."</p>
                  <p>"About Mehetabel?" asked Mr. Sewell, uneasily.</p>
                  <p>"Yes."</p>
                  <p>"Well, I wish he would n't!"</p>
                  <p>"He was friendly enough in the course of conversation to hint to me that he had
                     not married the young woman, and seemed to regret it."</p>
                  <p>"No, he did n't marry Mehetabel."</p>
                  <p>"May I inquire <emph>why</emph> he did n't marry Mehetabel?"</p>
                  <p>"Never asked her. Might have married the<pb n="166-167"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000084"/> girl forty times. Old Elkins's daughter, over at
                     K——. She'd have had him quick enough. Seven years, off and on, he kept company
                     with Mehetabel, and then she died."</p>
                  <p>"And he never asked her?"</p>
                  <p>"He shilly-shallied. Perhaps he did n't think of it. When she was dead and
                     gone, then Silas was struck all of a heap,—and that's all about it."</p>
                  <p>Obviously Mr. Sewell did not intend to tell me anything more, and obviously
                     there was more to tell. The topic was plainly disagreeable to him for some
                     reason or other, and that unknown reason of course piqued my curiosity.</p>
                  <p>As I was absent from dinner and supper that day, I did not met Mr. Jaffrey
                     again until the following morning at breakfast. He had recovered his bird-like
                     manner, and was full of a mysterious assassination that had just taken place in
                     New York, all the thrilling details of which were at his fingers' ends. It was
                     at once comical and sad to see this harmless old gentleman, with his naïive,
                     benevolent countenance, and his thin hair flaming up in a semicircle, like the
                     foot-lights at a theatre, revelling elling in the intricacies of the
                     unmentionable deed.</p>
                  <p>"You come up to my room to-night," he cried with horrid glee, "and I'll give
                     you my theory of the murder. I'll make it as clear as day to you that it was
                     the detective himself who fired the three pistol-shots."</p>
                  <p>It was not so much the desire to have this point elucidated as to make a closer
                     study of Mr. Jaffrey that led me to accept his invitation. Mr. Jaffrey's
                     bedroom was in an L of the building, and was in no way noticeable except for
                     the numerous files of newspapers neatly arranged against the blank spaces of
                     the walls, and a huge pile of old magazines which stood in one corner, reaching
                     nearly up to the ceiling, and threatening to topple over each instant, like the
                     Leaning Tower at Pisa. There were green paper shades the windows, some faded
                     chintz valances about the bed, and two or three easy-chairs covered in chintz.
                     On a black-walnut shelf between the windows lay a choice collection of
                     meerschaum and brierwood pipes.</p>
                  <p>Filling one of the chocolate-colored bowls for and another for himself, Mr.
                     Jaffrey began<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC5554-00000085"/> prattling; but not
                     about the murder, which appeared to have flown out of his mind. In fact, I do
                     not remember that the topic was even touched upon, either then or
                     afterwards.</p>
                  <p>"Cosey nest this," said Mr. Jaffrey, glancing complacently over the apartment.
                     "What is more cheerful, now, in the fall of the year, than an open wood-fire?
                     Do you hear those little chirps and twitters coming out of that piece of
                     apple-wood? Those are the ghosts of the robins and bluebirds that sang upon the
                     bough when it was in blossom last spring. In summer whole flocks of them come
                     fluttering about the fruit-trees under the window: so I have singing birds all
                     the year round. I take it very easy here, I can tell you, summer and winter.
                     Not much society. Tobias is not, perhaps, what one would term a great
                     intellectual force, but he means well. He's a realist,—believes in coming down
                     to what he calls 'the hard pan'; but his heart is in the right place, and he's
                     very kind to me. The wisest thing I ever did in my life was to sell out my
                     grain business over at K——, thirteen years ago, and settle down at the Corners.
                     When a man has made a competency, what does he want more? Besides, at that time
                     an event occurred which destroyed any ambition I may have had. Mehetabel
                     died."</p>
                  <p>"The lady you were engaged to?"</p>
                  <p>"N-o, not precisely engaged. I think it was quite understood between us, though
                     nothing had been said on the subject. Typhoid," added Mr. Jaffrey, in a low
                     voice.</p>
                  <p>For several minutes he smoked in silence, a vague, troubled look playing over
                     his countenance. Presently this passed away, and he fixed his gray eyes
                     speculatively upon my face.</p>
                  <p>"If I had married Mehetabel," said Mr. Jaffrey, slowly, and then he hesitated.
                     I blew a ring of smoke into the air, and, resting my pipe on my knee, dropped
                     into an attitude of attention. "If I had married Mehetabel, you know, we should
                     have had—ahem!—a family."</p>
                  <p>"Very likely," I assented, vastly amused at this unexpected turn.</p>
                  <p>"A Boy!" exclaimed Mr. Jaffrey, explosively.</p>
                  <p>"By all means, certainly, a son."</p>
                  <p>"Great trouble about naming the boy. Mehetabel's family want him named Elkanah
                     Elkins, after her grandfather; I want him named Andrew<pb n="170-171"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000086"/> drew Jackson. We compromise by christening him
                     Elkanah Elkins Andrew Jackson Jaffrey. Rather a long name for such a short
                     little fellow," said Mr. Jaffrey, musingly.</p>
                  <p>"Andy is n't a bad nickname," I suggested.</p>
                  <p>"Not at all. We call him Andy, in the family. Somewhat fractious at
                     first,—colic and things. I suppose it is right, or it would n't be so; but the
                     usefulness of measles, mumps, croup, whooping-cough, scarlatina, and fits is
                     not visible to the naked eye. I wish Andy would be a model infant, and dodge
                     the whole lot."</p>
                  <p>This supposititious child, born within the last few minutes, was clearly
                     assuming the, proportions of a reality to Mr. Jaffrey. I began to feel a little
                     uncomfortable. I am, as I have said, a civil engineer, and it is not strictly
                     in my line to assist at the births of infants, imaginary or, otherwise. I
                     pulled away vigorously at the pipe, and said nothing.</p>
                  <p>What large blue eyes he has," resumed Mr. Jaffrey, after a pause; "just like
                     Hetty's; and the fair hair, too, like hers. How oddly certain distinctive
                     features are handed down in families!. Sometimes a mouth, sometimes a turn of
                     the eyebrow brow. Wicked little boys, over at K——, have now and then derisively
                     advised me to follow my nose. It would be an interesting thing to do. I should
                     find my nose flying about the world, turning up unexpectedly here and there,
                     dodging this branch of the family and reappearing in that, now jumping over one
                     great-grandchild to fasten itself upon another, and never losing its
                     individuality. Look at Andy. There's Elkanah Elkins's chin to the life. Andy's
                     chin is probably older than the Pyramids. Poor little things," he cried, with
                     sudden indescribable tenderness, "to lose his mother so early!" And Mr.
                     Jaffrey's head sunk upon his breast, and his shoulders slanted forward, as if
                     he were actually bending over the cradle of the child. The whole gesture and
                     attitude was so natural that it startled me. The pipe slipped from, my fingers
                     and fell to the floor.</p>
                  <p>"Hush!" whispered Mr. Jaffrey, with a deprecating motion of his hand. "Andy's
                     asleep!"</p>
                  <p>He rose softly from, the chair and, walking across the room on tiptoe, drew
                     down the shade at the window through which the moonlight was<pb n="172-173"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000087"/> streaming. Then he returned to his seat, and
                     remained gazing with half-closed eyes into the dropping embers.</p>
                  <p>I refilled my pipe and smoked in profound silence, wondering what would come
                     next. But nothing came next. Mr. Jaffrey had fallen into so brown a study that,
                     a quarter of an hour afterwards, when I wished him good night and withdrew, I
                     do not think he noticed my departure.</p>
                  <p>I am not what is called a man of imagination; it is my habit to exclude most
                     things not capable of mathematical demonstration; but I am not without a
                     certain psychological insight, and I think I understood Mr. Jaffrey's case. I
                     could easily understand how a man with an unhealthy, sensitive nature,
                     overwhelmed by sudden calamity, might take refuge in some forlorn place like
                     this old tavern, and dream his life away. To such a man—brooding forever on
                     what might have been and dwelling wholly in the realm of his fancies—the actual
                     world might indeed become as a dream, and nothing seem real but his illusions.
                     I dare say that thirteen years of Bayley's Four-Corners would have its effect
                     upon me; though instead of conjuring up golden-haired children of the Madonna,
                     I should probably see gnomes and kobolds, and goblins engaged in hoisting false
                     signals and misplacing switches for midnight express trains.</p>
                  <p>"No doubt," I said to myself that night, as I lay in bed, thinking over the
                     matter, "this once possible but now impossible child is a great comfort to the
                     old gentleman,—a greater comfort, perhaps, than a real son would be. May be
                     Andy will vanish with the shades and mists of night, he's such an unsubstantial
                     infant; but if he does n't, and Mr. Jaffrey finds pleasure in talking to me
                     about his son, I shall humor the old fellow. It would n't be a Christian act to
                     knock over his harmless fancy."</p>
                  <p>I was very impatient to see if Mr. Jaffrey's illusion would stand the test of
                     daylight. It did. Elkanah Elkins Andrew Jackson Jaffrey was, so to speak, alive
                     and kicking the next morning. On taking his seat at the breakfast-table, Mr.
                     Jaffrey whispered to me that Andy had had a comfortable night.</p>
                  <p>"Silas!" said Mr. Sewell, sharply, "what are you whispering about?"</p>
                  <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC5554-00000088"/>
                  <p>Mr. Sewell was in an ill-humor; perhaps he was jealous because I had passed the
                     evening in Mr. Jaffrey's room; but surely Mr. Sewell could not expect his
                     boarders to go to bed at eight o'clock every night, as he did. From time to
                     time during the meal Mr. Sewell regarded me unkindly out of the corner of his
                     eye, and in helping me to the parsnips he poniarded them with quite a
                     suggestive air. All this, however, did not prevent me from repairing to the
                     door of Mr. Jaffrey's snuggery when night came.</p>
                  <p>"Well, Mr. Jaffrey, how's Andy this evening?"</p>
                  <p>"Got a tooth!" cried Mr. Jaffrey, vivaciously.</p>
                  <p>"No!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, he has! Just through. Gave the nurse a silver dollar. Standing reward for
                     first tooth."</p>
                  <p>It was on the tip of my tongue to express surprise that an infant a day old
                     should cut a tooth, when I suddenly recollected that Richard III. was born with
                     teeth. Feeling myself to be on unfamiliar ground, I suppressed my criticism. It
                     was well I did so, for in the next breath I was advised that half a year had
                     elapsed since the previous evening.</p>
                  <p>"Andy's had a hard six months of it," said Mr. Jaffrey, with the well-known
                     narrative air of fathers. "We've brought him up by hand. His grandfather, by
                     the way, was brought up by the bottle"—and brought down by it, too, I added
                     mentally, recalling Mr. Sewell's account of the old gentleman's tragic end.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Jaffrey then went on to give me a history of Andy's first six months,
                     omitting no detail however insignificant or irrelevant. This history I would,
                     in turn, inflict upon the reader, if I were only certain that he is one of
                     those dreadful parents who, under the ægis of friendship, bore you at a
                     street-corner with that remarkable thing which Freddy said the other day, and
                     insist on singing to you, at an evening party, the Iliad of Tommy's woes.</p>
                  <p>But to inflict this <foreign xml:lang="FRA">enfantillage</foreign> upon the
                     unmarried reader would be an act of wanton cruelty. So I pass over that part of
                     Andy's biography, and, for the same reason, make no record of the next four or
                     five interviews I had with Mr. Jaffrey, It will be sufficient to state that
                     Andy glided from extreme infancy to early youth with astonishing celerity,—at
                     the rate of one<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC5554-00000089"/> year per night, if I
                     remember correctly; and—must I confess it?—before the week came to an end, this
                     invisible hobgoblin of a boy was only little less of a reality to me than to
                     Mr. Jaffrey.</p>
                  <p>At first I had lent myself to the old dreamer's whim with a keen perception of
                     the humor of the thing; but by and by I found I was talking and thinking of
                     Miss Mehetabel's son as though he were a veritable personage. Mr. Jaffrey spoke
                     of the child with such an air of conviction!—as if Andy were playing among his
                     toys in the next room, or making mud-pies down in the yard. In these
                     conversations, it should be observed, the child was never supposed to be
                     present, except on that single occasion when Mr. Jaffrey leaned over the
                     cradle. After one of our <foreign xml:lang="FRA">séances</foreign> I would lie
                     awake until the small hours, thinking of the boy, and then fall asleep only to
                     have indigestible dreams about him. Through the day, and sometimes in the midst
                     of complicated calculations, I would catch myself wondering what Andy was up to
                     now! There was no shaking him off ; he became an inseparable nightmare to me;
                     and I felt that if I remained much longer at Bayley's Four-Corners I should
                     turn into just such another bald-headed, mild-eyed visionary as Silas
                     Jaffrey.</p>
                  <p>Then the tavern was a grewsome old shell any way, full of unaccountable noises
                     after dark, rustlings of garments along unfrequented passages, and stealthy
                     footfalls in unoccupied chambers overhead. I never knew of an old house without
                     these mysterious noises. Next to my bedroom was a musty, dismantled apartment,
                     in one corner of which, leaning against the wainscot, was a crippled mangle,
                     with its iron crank tilted in the air like the elbow of the late Mr. Clem
                     Jaffrey. Sometimes, <q>
                        <p>"In the dead vast and middle of the night,"</p>
                     </q> I used to hear sounds as if some one were turning that rusty crank on the
                     sly. This occurred only on particularly cold nights, and I conceived the
                     uncomfortable idea that it was the thin family ghosts, from the neglected
                     graveyard in the cornfield, keeping themselves warm by running each other
                     through the mangle. There was a haunted air about the whole place that made it
                     easy for me to believe in the existence of a phantasm like<pb n="178-179"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000090"/> Miss Mehetabel's son, who, after all, was less
                     unearthly than Mr. Jaffrey himself, and seemed more properly an inhabitant of
                     this globe than the toothless ogre who kept the inn, not to mention the silent
                     Witch of Endor that cooked our meals for us over the bar-room fire.</p>
                  <p>In spite of the scowls and winks bestowed upon me by Mr. Sewell, who let slip
                     no opportunity to testify his disapprobation of the intimacy, Mr. Jaffrey and I
                     spent all our evenings together,—those long autumnal evenings, through the
                     length of which he talked about the boy, laying out his path in life and
                     hedging the path with roses. He should be sent to the High School at
                     Portsmouth, and then to college; he should be educated like a gentleman,
                     Andy.</p>
                  <p>"When the old man dies," said Mr. Jaffrey, rubbing his hands gleefully, as if
                     it were a great joke, "Andy will find that the old man has left him a pretty
                     plum."</p>
                  <p>"What do you think of having Andy enter West Point, when he 's old enough?"
                     said Mr. Jaffrey on another occasion. "He need n't necessarily go into the army
                     when he graduates; he can become a civil engineer."</p>
                  <p>This was a stroke of flattery so delicate and indirect that I could accept it
                     without immodesty.</p>
                  <p>There had lately sprung up on the corner of Mr. Jaffrey's bureau a small tin
                     house, Gothic in architecture, and pink in color, with a slit in the roof, and
                     the word <hi rend="i"/>BANK painted on one façade. Several times in the course
                     of an evening Mr. Jaffrey would rise from his chair without interrupting the
                     conversation, and gravely drop a nickel into the scuttle of the bank. It was
                     pleasant to observe the solemnity of his countenance as he approached the
                     edifice, and the air of triumph with which he resumed his seat by the
                     fireplace. One night I missed the tin bank. It had disappeared, deposits and
                     all. Evidently there had been a defalcation on rather a large scale. I strongly
                     suspected that Mr. Sewell was at the bottom of it; but my suspicion was not
                     shared by Mr. Jaffrey, who, remarking my glance at the bureau, became suddenly
                     depressed. "I'm afraid," he said, "that I have failed to instil into Andrew
                     those principles of integrity which—which—" and the old gentleman quite broke
                     down.</p>
                  <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC5554-00000091"/>
                  <p>Andy was now eight or nine years old, and for some time past, if the truth must
                     be told, had given Mr. Jaffrey no inconsiderable trouble; what with his
                     impishness and his illnesses, the boy led the pair of us a lively dance. I
                     shall not soon forget the anxiety of Mr. Jaffrey the night Andy had the
                     scarlet-fever,—an anxiety which so infected me that I actually returned to the
                     tavern the following afternoon earlier than usual, dreading to hear the little
                     spectre was dead, and greatly relieved on meeting Mr. Jaffrey at the door-step
                     with his face wreathed in smiles. When I spoke to him of Andy, I was made aware
                     that I was inquiring into a case of scarlet-fever that had occurred the year
                     before!</p>
                  <p>It was at this time, towards the end of my second week at Greenton, that I
                     noticed what was probably not a new trait,—Mr. Jaffrey's curious sensitiveness
                     to atmospherical changes. He was as sensitive as a barometer. The approach of a
                     storm sent his mercury down instantly. When the weather was fair, he was
                     hopeful and sunny, and Andy's prospects were brilliant. When the weather was
                     overcast and threatening, he grew restless and despondent, and was afraid the
                     boy was n't going to turn out well.</p>
                  <p>On the Saturday previous to my departure, which had been fixed for Monday, it
                     rained heavily all the afternoon, and that night Mr. Jaffrey was in an
                     unusually excitable and unhappy frame of mind. His mercury was very low
                     indeed.</p>
                  <p>"That boy is going to the dogs just as fast as he can go," said Mr. Jaffrey,
                     with a woful face. "I can't do anything with him."</p>
                  <p>"He'll come out all right, Mr. Jaffrey. Boys will be boys. I would not give a
                     snap for a lad without animal spirits."</p>
                  <p>But animal spirits," said Mr. Jaffrey sententiously, "should n't saw off the
                     legs of the piano in Tobias's best parlor. I don't know what Tobias will say
                     when he finds it out."</p>
                  <p>"What! has Andy sawed off the legs of the old spinet?" I returned,
                     laughing.</p>
                  <p>"Worse than that."</p>
                  <p>"Played upon it, then!"</p>
                  <p>No, sir. He has lied to me!"</p>
                  <p>"I can't believe that of Andy."</p>
                  <p>"Lied to me, sir," repeated Mr. Jaffrey, severely. "He pledged me his word of
                     honor that he<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC5554-00000092"/> would give over his
                     climbing. The way that boy climbs sends a chill down my spine. This morning,
                     notwithstanding his solemn promise, he shinned up the lightning-rod attached to
                     the extension and sat astride the ridge-pole. I saw him, and he denied it! When
                     a boy you have caressed and indulged, and lavished pocket-money on, lies to you
                     and <emph>will</emph> climb, then there 's nothing more to be said. He 's a
                     lost child."</p>
                  <p>"You take too dark a view of it, Mr. Jaffrey. Training and education are bound
                     to tell in the end, and he has been well brought up."</p>
                  <p>"But I did n't bring him up on a lightning-rod, did I? If he is ever going to
                     know how to behave, he ought to know now. To-morrow he will be eleven years
                     old."</p>
                  <p>The reflection came to me that if Andy had not been brought up by the rod, he
                     had certainly been brought up by the lightning. He was eleven years old in two
                     weeks!</p>
                  <p>I essayed, with that perspicacious wisdom which seems to be the peculiar
                     property of bachelors and elderly maiden ladies, to tranquillize Mr. Jaffrey's
                     mind, and to give him some practical hints on the management of youth.</p>
                  <p>"Spank him,"I suggested at length.</p>
                  <p>"I will!" said the old gentleman.</p>
                  <p>"And you 'd better do it at once!" I added, as it flashed upon me that in six
                     months Andy would be a hundred and forty-three years old!—an age at which
                     parental discipline would have to be relaxed.</p>
                  <p>The next morning, Sunday, the rain came down as if determined to drive the
                     quicksilver entirely out of my poor friend. Mr. Jaffrey sat bolt upright at the
                     breakfast-table, looking as woe-begone as a bust of Dante, and retired to his
                     chamber the moment the meal was finished. As the day advanced, the wind veered
                     round to the northeast, and settled itself down to work. It was not pleasant to
                     think, and I tried not to think, what Mr. Jaffrey's condition would be if the
                     weather did not mend its manners by noon; but so far from clearing off at noon,
                     the storm increased, in violence, and as night set in, the wind whistled in a
                     spiteful falsetto key, and the rain lashed the old tavern as if it were a balky
                     horse that refused to move on. The windows rattled in the worm-eaten frames,
                     and the doors of remote rooms, where nobody ever went,<pb n="184-185"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000093"/> slammed to in the maddest way. Now and then the
                     tornado, sweeping down the side of Mount Agamenticus, bowled across the open
                     country, and struck the ancient hostelry point-blank.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Jaffrey did not appear at supper. I knew he was expecting me to come to his
                     room as usual, and I turned over in my mind a dozen plans to evade seeing him
                     that night. The landlord sat at the opposite side of the chimney-place, with
                     his eye upon me. I fancy he was aware of the effect of this storm on his other
                     boarder, for at intervals, as the wind hurled itself against the exposed gable,
                     threatening to burst in the windows, Mr. Sewell tipped me an atrocious wink,
                     and displayed his gums in a way he had not done since the morning after my
                     arrival at Greenton. I wondered if he suspected anything about Andy. There had
                     been odd times during the past week when I felt convinced that the existence of
                     Miss Mehetabel's son was no secret to Mr. Sewell.</p>
                  <p>In deference to the gale, the landlord sat up half an hour later than was his
                     custom. At half-past eight he went to bed, remarking that he thought the old
                     pile would stand till morning.</p>
                  <p>He had been absent only a few minutes when I heard a rustling at the door. I
                     looked up, and beheld Mr. Jaffrey standing on the threshold, with his dress in
                     disorder, his scant hair flying, and the wildest expression on his face.</p>
                  <p>"He 's gone!" cried Mr. Jaffrey.</p>
                  <p>"Who? Sewell? Yes, he just went to bed."</p>
                  <p>"No, not Tobias,—the boy!"</p>
                  <p>"What, run away?"</p>
                  <p>"No,—he is dead! He has fallen off of a step-ladder in the red chamber and
                     broken his neck!"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Jaffrey threw up his hands with a gesture of despair, and disappeared. I
                     followed him through the hall, saw him go into his own apartment, and heard the
                     bolt of the door drawn to. Then I returned to the bar-room, and sat for an hour
                     or two in the ruddy glow of the fire, brooding over the strange experience of
                     the last fortnight.</p>
                  <p>On my way to bed I paused at Mr. Jaffrey's door, and, in a lull of the storm,
                     the measured respiration within told me that the old gentleman was sleeping
                     peacefully.</p>
                  <p>Slumber was coy with me that night. I lay listening to the soughing of the
                     wind, and thinking<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC5554-00000094"/> ing of Mr.
                     Jaffrey's illusion. It had amused me at first with its grotesqueness; but now
                     the poor little phantom was dead, I was conscious that there had been something
                     pathetic in it all along. Shortly after midnight the wind sunk down, coming and
                     going fainter and fainter, floating around the eaves of the tavern with a
                     gentle, murmurous sound, as if it were turning itself into soft wings to bear
                     away the spirit of a little child.</p>
                  <milestone n="" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>Perhaps nothing that happened during my stay at Bayley's Four-Corners took me
                     so completely by surprise as Mr. Jaffrey's radiant countenance the next
                     morning. The morning itself was not fresher or sunnier. His round face
                     literally shone with geniality and happiness. His eyes twinkled like diamonds,
                     and the magnetic light of his hair was turned on full. He came into my room
                     while I was packing my valise. He chirped, and prattled, and carolled, and was
                     sorry I was going away,—but never a word about Andy. However, the boy had
                     probably been dead several years then!</p>
                  <p>The open wagon that was to carry me to the station stood at the door; Mr.
                     Sewell was placing my case of instruments under the seat, and Mr. Jaffrey had
                     gone up to his room to get me a certain newspaper containing an account of a
                     remarkable shipwreck on the Auckland Islands. I took the opportunity to thank
                     Mr. Sewell for his courtesies to me, and to express my regret at leaving him
                     and Mr. Jaffrey.</p>
                  <p>"I have become very much attached to Mr. Jaffrey," I said; "he is a most
                     interesting person; but that hypothetical boy of his, that son of Miss
                     Mehetabel's—"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I know!" interrupted Mr. Sewell, testily. "Fell off a step-ladder and
                     broke his dratted neck. Eleven year old, was n't he? Always does, jest at that
                     point. Next week Silas will begin the whole thing over again, if he can get
                     anybody to listen to him."</p>
                  <p>"I see. Our amiable friend is a little queer on that subject."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Sewell glanced cautiously over his shoulder, and, tapping himself
                     significantly on the forehead, said in a low voice,</p>
                  <p>"Room To Let—Unfurnished!"</p>

               <head>A STRUGGLE FOR LIFE.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>ONE morning as I was passing through Boston Common, which lies
                  between my home and my office, I met a gentleman lounging along The Mall. I am
                  generally preoccupied when walking, and often thrid my way through crowded streets
                  without distinctly observing any one. But this man's face forced itself upon me,
                  and a singular face it was. His eyes were faded, and his hair, which he wore long,
                  was flecked with gray: His hair and eyes, if I may say so, were sixty years old,
                  the rest of him not thirty. The youthfulness of his figure, the elasticity of his
                  gait, and the venerable appearance of his head were incongruities that drew more
                  than one pair of curious eyes towards him. He excited in me the painful suspicion
                  that he had either got somebody else's head or somebody else's body. He was
                  evidently an American, at least so far as the upper part of him was concerned,—the
                  New England cut of countenance is unmistakable,—evidently a man who had seen
                  something of the world, but strangely young and old.</p>
               <p>Before reaching the Park Street gate, I had taken up the thread of thought which
                  he had unconsciously broken; yet throughout the day this old young man, with his
                  unwrinkled brow and silvered locks, glided in like a phantom between me and my
                  duties.</p>
               <p>The next morning I again encountered him on The Mall. He was resting lazily on the
                  green rails, watching two little sloops in distress, which two ragged ship-owners
                  had consigned to the mimic perils of the Pond. The vessels lay becalmed in the
                  middle of the ocean, displaying a tantalizing lack of sympathy with the frantic
                  helplessness of the owners on shore. As the gentleman observed their dilemma, a
                  light came into his faded eyes, then died out, leaving them drearier than before.
                  I wondered if he, too, in his time, had sent out ships that drifted and drifted
                  and never came to port; and if these poor toys were to him types of his own
                  losses.</p>
               <p>"That man has a story, and I should like to<pb n="190-191"
                     xml:id="VAC5554-00000096"/> know it," I said, half aloud, halting in one of
                  those winding paths' which branch off from the pastoral quietness of the Pond, and
                  end in the rush and tumult of Tremont Street.</p>
               <p>"Would you?" exclaimed a voice at my side. I turned and faced Mr. H——, a neighbor
                  of mine, who laughed heartily at finding me talking to myself. "Well," he added,
                  reflectingly, "I can tell you this man's story; and if you will match the
                  narrative with anything as curious, I shall be glad to hear it."</p>
               <p>"You know him then?"</p>
               <p>"Yes and no. That is to say, I do not know him personally; but I know a singular
                  passage in his life. I happened to be in Paris when he was buried."</p>
               <p>"Buried!"</p>
               <p>"Well, strictly speaking, not buried; but something quite like it. If you've a
                  spare half-hour," continued my friend H—— "we'll sit on this bench, and I will
                  tell you all I know of an affair that made some noise in Paris a couple of years
                  ago. The gentleman himself, standing yonder, will serve as a sort of frontispiece
                  to the romance,—a full-page illustration, as it were."</p>
               <p>The following pages contain the story which Mr. H——related to me. While he was
                  telling it, a gentle wind arose; the miniature sloops drifted feebly about the
                  ocean; the wretched owners flew from point to point, as the deceptive breeze
                  promised to waft the barks to either shore; the early robins trilled now and then
                  from the newly fringed elms; and the old young man leaned on the rail in the
                  sunshine, little dreaming that two gossips were discussing his affairs within
                  twenty yards of him.</p>
               <milestone n="" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Three people were sitting in a chamber whose one large window overlooked the Place
                  Vendôome. M. Dorine, with his back half turned on the other two occupants of the
                  apartment, was reading the Journal des Débats in an alcove, pausing from time to
                  time to wipe his glasses, and taking scrupulous pains not to glance towards the
                  lounge at his right, on which were seated Mlle. Dorine and a young American
                  gentleman, whose handsome face rather frankly told his position in the family.
                  There was not a happier man in Paris that afternoon than Philip Wentworth. Life
                  had become so delicious to him that he shrunk<pb n="192-193"
                     xml:id="VAC5554-00000097"/> from looking beyond to-day. What could the future
                  add to his full heart? what might it not take away? The deepest joy has always
                  something of melancholy in it,—a presentiment, a fleeting sadness, a feeling
                  without a name. Wentworth was conscious of this subtile shadow that night, when he
                  rose from the lounge and thoughtfully held Julie's hand to his lip for a moment
                  before parting. A careless observer would not have thought him, as he was, the
                  happiest man in Paris.</p>
               <p>M. Dorine laid down his paper, and came forward. "If the house," he said, "is such
                  as M. Cherbonneau describes it, I advise you to close with him at once. I would
                  accompany you, Philip, but the truth is, I am too sad at losing this little bird
                  to assist you in selecting a cage for her. Remember, the last train for town
                  leaves at five. Be sure not to miss it; for we have seats for Sardou's new comedy
                  to-morrow night. By to-morrow night," he added laughingly, "little Julie here will
                  be an old lady,—'t is such an age from now until then."</p>
               <p>The next morning the train bore Philip to one of the loveliest spots within thirty
                  miles of Paris. An hour's walk through green lanes brought him to M. Cherbonneau's
                  estate. In a kind of dream the young man wandered from room to room, inspected the
                  conservatory, the stables, the lawns, the strip of woodland through which a merry
                  brook sang to itself continually; and, after dining with M. Cherbonneau, completed
                  the purchase, and turned his steps towards the station just in time to catch the
                  express train.</p>
               <p>As Paris stretched out before him, with its lights twinkling in the early dusk,
                  and its spires and domes melting into the evening air, it seemed to Philip as if
                  years had elapsed since he left the city. On reaching Paris he drove to his hôtel,
                  where he found several letters lying on the table. He did not trouble himself even
                  to glance at their superscriptions as he threw aside his travelling surtout for a
                  more appropriate dress.</p>
               <p>If, in his impatience to return to Mlle. Dorine, the cars had appeared to walk,
                  the fiacre which he had secured at the station appeared to creep. At last it
                  turned into the Place Vendôme, and drew up before M. Dorine's hôtel. The door<pb
                     n="194-195" xml:id="VAC5554-00000098"/> opened as Philip's foot touched the
                  first step. The servant silently took his cloak and hat, with a special deference,
                  Philip thought; but was he not now one of the family?</p>
               <p>"M. Dorine," said the servant slowly, "is unable to see Monsieur at present. He
                  wishes Monsieur to be shown up to the salon."</p>
               <p>"Is Mademoiselle—"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Monsieur."</p>
               <p>"Alone?"</p>
               <p>"Alone, Monsieur," repeated the man, looking curiously at Philip, who could
                  scarcely repress an exclamation of pleasure.</p>
               <p>It was the first time that such a privilege had been accorded him. His interviews
                  with Julie had always taken place in the presence of M. Dorine, or some member of
                  the household. A well-bred Parisian girl has but a formal acquaintance with her
                  lover.</p>
               <p>Philip did not linger on the staircase; with a light heart, he went up the steps,
                  two at a time, hastened through the softly lighted hall, in which he detected the
                  faint scent of her favorite flowers, and stealthily opened the door of the
                  salon.</p>
               <p>The room was darkened. Underneath the chandelier stood a slim black casket on
                  trestles. A lighted candle, a crucifix, and some white flowers were on a table
                  near by. Julie Dorine was dead.</p>
               <p>When M. Dorine heard the sudden cry that rang through the silent house, he hurried
                  from the library, and found Philip standing like a ghost in the middle of the
                  chamber.</p>
               <p>It was not until long afterwards that Wentworth learned the details of the
                  calamity that had befallen him. On the previous night Mlle. Dorine had retired to
                  her room in seemingly perfect health, and had dismissed her maid with a request to
                  be awakened early the next morning. At the appointed hour the girl entered the
                  chamber. Mlle. Dorine was sitting in an arm-chair, apparently asleep. The candle
                  in the bougeoir had burnt down to the socket; a book lay half open on the carpet
                  at her feet. The girl started when she saw that the bed had not been occupied, and
                  that her mistress still wore an evening dress. She rushed to Mlle. Dorine's side.
                  It was not slumber; it was death.</p>
               <p>Two messages were at once despatched to<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC5554-00000099"/>
                  Philip, one to the station at G——, the other to his hôtel. The first missed him on
                  the road, the second he had neglected to open. On his arrival at M. Dorine's
                  house, the valet, under the supposition that Wentworth had been advised of Mlle.
                  Dorine's death, broke the intelligence with awkward cruelty, by showing him
                  directly to the salon.</p>
               <p>Mlle. Dorine's wealth, her beauty, the suddenness of her death and the romance
                  that had in some way attached itself to her love for the young American, drew
                  crowds to witness the funeral ceremonies, which took place in the church in the
                  rue d'Aguesseau. The body was to be laid in M. Dorine's tomb, in the cemetery of
                  Montmartre.</p>
               <p>This tomb requires a few words of description. First there was a grating of
                  filigraned iron; through this you looked into a small vestibule or hall, at the
                  end of which was a massive door of oak opening upon a short flight of stone steps
                  descending into the tomb. The vault was fifteen or twenty feet square, ingeniously
                  ventilated from the ceiling, but unlighted. It contained two sarcophagi: the first
                  held the remains of Madame Dorine, long since dead; the other was new, and bore on
                  one side the letters J. D., in monogram, interwoven with fleurs-de-lis.</p>
               <p>The-funeral train stopped at the gate of the small garden that enclosed the place
                  of burial, only the immediate relatives following the bearers into the tomb. A
                  slender wax candle, such as is used in Catholic churches, burnt at the foot of the
                  uncovered sarcophagus, casting a dim glow over the centre of the apartment, and
                  deepening the shadows which seemed to huddle together in the corners. By this
                  flickering light the coffin was placed in its granite shell, the heavy slab laid
                  over it reverently, and the oaken door revolved on its rusty hinges, shutting out
                  the uncertain ray of sunshine that had ventured to peep in on the darkness.</p>
               <p>M. Dorine, muffled in his cloak, threw himself on the back seat of the landau, too
                  abstracted in his grief to observe that he was the only occupant of the vehicle.
                  There was a sound of wheels grating on the gravelled avenue, and then all was
                  silence again in the cemetery of Montmartre. At the main entrance the carriages
                  parted company, dashing off into various streets<pb n="198-199"
                     xml:id="VAC5554-00000100"/> at a pace that seemed to express a sense of
                  relief.</p>
               <p>The rattle of wheels had died out of the air when Philip opened his eyes,
                  bewildered, like a man abruptly roused from slumber. He raised himself on one arm
                  and stared into the surrounding blackness. Where was he? In a second the truth
                  flashed upon him. He had been left in the tomb! While kneeling on the farther side
                  of the stone box, perhaps he had fainted, and during the last solemn rites his
                  absence had been unnoticed.</p>
               <p>His first emotion was one of natural terror. But this passed as quickly as it
                  came. Life had ceased to be so very precious to him; and if it were his fate to
                  die at Julie's side, was not that the fulfilment of the desire which he had
                  expressed to himself a hundred times that morning? What did it matter, a few years
                  sooner or later? He must lay down the burden at last. Why not then? A pang of
                  self-reproach followed the thought. Could he so lightly throw aside the love that
                  had bent over his cradle? The sacred name of mother rose involuntarily to his
                  lips. Was it not cowardly to yield up without a struggle gle the life which he
                  should guard for her sake? Was it not his duty to the living and the dead to face
                  the difficulties of his position, and overcome them if it were within human
                  power?</p>
               <p>With an organization as delicate as a woman's, he had that spirit which, however
                  sluggish in repose, leaps with a kind of exultation to measure its strength with
                  disaster. The vague fear of the supernatural, that would affect most men in a
                  similar situation, found no room in his heart. He was simply shut in a chamber
                  from which it was necessary that he should obtain release within a given period.
                  That this chamber contained the body of the woman he loved, so far from adding to
                  the terror of the case, was a circumstance from which he drew consolation. She was
                  a beautiful white statue now. Her soul was far hence; and if that pure spirit
                  could return, would it not be to shield him with her love? It was impossible that
                  the place should not engender some thought of the kind. He did not put the thought
                  entirely from him as he rose to his feet and stretched out his hands in the
                  darkness; but his mind was too healthy and practical to indulge long in such
                  speculations.</p>

               <p>Philip, being a smoker, chanced to have in his pocket a box of allumettes. After
                  several ineffectual essays, he succeeded in igniting one against the dank wall,
                  and by its momentary glare perceived that the candle had been left in the tomb.
                  This would serve him in examining the fastenings of the vault. If he could force
                  the inner door by any means, and reach the grating; of which he had an indistinct
                  recollection, he might hope to make himself heard. But the oaken door was
                  immovable, as solid as the wall itself, into which it fitted air-tight. Even if he
                  had had the requisite tools, there were no fastenings to be removed; the hinges
                  were set on the outside.</p>
               <p>Having ascertained this, Philip replaced the candle on the floor, and leaned
                  against the wall thoughtfully, watching the blue fan of flame that wavered to and
                  fro, threatening to detach itself from the wick. "At all events," he thought, "the
                  place is ventilated." Suddenly he sprang forward and extinguished the light.</p>
               <p>His existence depended on that candle!</p>
               <p>He had read somewhere, in some account of shipwreck, how the survivors had lived
                  for days upon a few candles which one of the passengers had insanely thrown into
                  the long-boat. And here he had been burning away his very life!</p>
               <p>By the transient illumination of one of the tapers, he looked at his watch. It had
                  stopped at eleven,—but eleven that day, or the preceding night? The funeral, he
                  knew, had left the church at ten. How many hours had passed since then? Of what
                  duration had been his swoon? Alas! it was no longer possible for him to measure
                  those hours which crawl like snails by the wretched, and fly like swallows over
                  the happy.</p>
               <p>He picked up the candle, and seated himself on the stone steps. He was a sanguine
                  man, but, as he weighed the chances of escape, the prospect appalled him. Of
                  course he would be missed. His disappearance under the circumstances would surely
                  alarm his friends; they would instigate a search for him; but who would think of
                  searching for a live man in the cemetery of Montmartre? The préfet of police would
                  set a hundred intelligences at work to find him; the Seine might be dragged,
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">les misérables</foreign> turned<pb n="202-203"
                     xml:id="VAC5554-00000102"/> over at the Morgue; a minute description of him
                  would be in every detective's pocket; and he—in M. Dorine's family tomb!</p>
               <p>Yet, on the other hand, it was here he was last seen; from this point a keen
                  detective would naturally work up the case. Then might not the undertaker return
                  for the candlestick, probably not left by design? Or, again, might not M. Dorine
                  send fresh wreaths of flowers, to take the place of those which now diffused a
                  pungent, aromatic odor throughout the chamber? Ah! what unlikely chances! But if
                  one of these things did not happen speedily, it had better never happen. How long
                  could he keep life in himself?</p>
               <p>With his pocket-knife Wentworth cut the half-burned candle into four equal parts.
                  "To-night," he meditated, "I will eat the first of these pieces; to-morrow, the
                  second; to-morrow evening, the third; the next day, the fourth; and then—then I
                  'll wait!"</p>
               <p>He had taken no breakfast that morning, unless a cup of coffee can be called a
                  breakfast. He had never been very hungry before. He was ravenously hungry now. But
                  he postponed the meal as long as practicable. It must have been near midnight,
                  according to his calculation, when he determined to try the first of his four
                  singular repasts. The bit of white-wax was tasteless; but it served its
                  purpose.</p>
               <p>His appetite for the time appeased, he found a new discomfort. The humidity of the
                  walls, and the wind that crept through the unseen ventilator, chilled him to the
                  bone. To keep walking was his only resource. A kind of drowsiness, too,
                  occasionally came over him. It took all his will to fight it off. To sleep, he
                  felt, was to die; and he had made up his mind to live.</p>
               <p>The strangest fancies flitted through his head as he groped up and down the stone
                  floor of the dungeon, feeling his way along the wall to avoid the sepulchres.
                  Voices that had long been silent spoke words that had long been forgotten; faces
                  he had known in childhood grew palpable against the dark. His whole life in detail
                  was unrolled before him like a panorama; the changes of a year, with its burden of
                  love and death, its sweets and its bitternesses, were epitomized in a single
                  second. The desire to sleep had left him, but the keen hunger came again.</p>
               <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC5554-00000103"/>
               <p>It must be near morning now, he mused; perhaps the sun is just gilding the
                  pinnacles and domes of the city; or, may be, a dull, drizzling rain is beating on
                  Paris, sobbing on these mounds above me. Paris! it seems like a dream. Did I ever
                  walk in its gay boulevards in the golden air? O the delight and pain and passion
                  of that sweet human life!</p>
               <p>Philip became conscious that the gloom, the silence, and the cold were gradually
                  conquering him. The feverish activity of his brain brought on a reaction. He grew
                  lethargic, he sunk down on the steps, and thought of nothing. His hand fell by
                  chance on one of the pieces of candle ; he grasped it and devoured it
                  mechanically. This revived him. "How strange," he thought, "that I am not thirsty.
                  Is it possible that the dampness of the walls, which I must inhale with every
                  breath, has supplied the need of water? Not a drop has passed my lips for two
                  days, and still I experience no thirst. That drowsiness, thank Heaven, has gone. I
                  think I was never wide awake until this hour. It would be an anodyne like poison
                  that could weigh down my eyelids. No doubt the dread of sleep has something to do
                  with this."</p>
               <p>The minutes were like hours. Now he walked as briskly as He dared up and down the
                  tomb; now lie rested against the door. More than once He was tempted to throw
                  himself upon the stone coffin that held Julie, and make no further struggle for
                  his life.</p>
               <p>Only one piece of candle remained. He had eaten the third portion, not to satisfy
                  hunger, but from a precautionary motive. He had taken it as a man takes some
                  disagreeable drug upon the result of which hangs safety. The time was rapidly
                  approaching when even this poor substitute for nourishment would be exhausted. He
                  delayed that moment. He gave himself a long fast this time. The half-inch of
                  candle which he held in his hand was a sacred thing to him. It was his last
                  defence against death.</p>
               <p>At length, with such a sinking at heart as he had not known before, he raised it
                  to his lips. Then he paused, then he hurled the fragment across the tomb, then the
                  oaken door was flung open, and Philip, with dazzled eyes, saw M. Dorine's form
                  sharply defined against the blue sky.</p>
               <p>When they led him out, half blinded, into the<pb n="206-207"
                     xml:id="VAC5554-00000104"/> broad daylight, M. Dorine noticed that Philip's
                  hair, which a short time since was as black as a crow's wing, had actually turned
                  gray in places. The man's eyes, too, had faded; the darkness had dimmed their
                  lustre.</p>
               <milestone n="" unit="typography"/>
               <p>And how long was he really confined in the tomb?" I asked, as Mr. H——concluded the
                  story.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Just one hour and twenty minutes!</emph>" replied Mr. H——, smiling
                  blandly.</p>
               <p>As he spoke, the Lilliputian sloops, with their sails all blown out like white
                  roses, came floating bravely into port, and Philip Wentworth lounged by us,
                  wearily, in the pleasant April sunshine.</p>
               <milestone n="" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Mr. H——'s narrative haunted me. Here was a man who had undergone a strange ordeal.
                  Here was a man whose sufferings were unique. His was no threadbare experience.
                  Eighty minutes had seemed like two days to him! If he had really been immured two
                  days in the tomb, the story, from my point of view, would have lost its tragic
                  element.</p>
               <p>After this it was but natural I should regard Mr. Wentworth with deepened
                  curiosity. As I met him from day to day, passing through the Common with that same
                  introspective air, there was something in his loneliness which touched me. I
                  wondered that I had not read before in his pale, meditative face some such sad
                  history as Mr. H—— had confided to me. I formed the resolution of speaking to him,
                  though with no very lucid purpose. One morning we came face to face at the
                  intersection of two paths. He halted courteously to allow me the precedence.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Wentworth,"I began, "I—"</p>
               <p>He interrupted me.</p>
               <p>"My name, sir," he said, in an off-hand manner, "is Jones."</p>
               <p>"Jo-Jo-Jones!" I gasped.</p>
               <p>"No, not Joseph Jones," he returned, with a glacial air, "Frederick."</p>
               <p>A dim light, in which the perfidy of my friend H—— was becoming discernible, began
                  to break upon my mind.</p>
               <p>It will probably be a standing wonder to Mr. Frederick Jones why a strange man
                  accosted him one morning on the Common as "Mr. Wentworth<pb n="208-209"
                     xml:id="VAC5554-00000105"/> worth," and then dashed madly down the nearest
                  foot-path and disappeared in the crowd.</p>
               <p>The fact is, I had been duped by Mr. H—— who is a gentleman of literary
                  proclivities, and has, it is whispered, become somewhat demented in brooding over
                  the Great American Novel,—not yet hatched. He had actually tried the effect of one
                  of his chapters on me!</p>
               <p>My hero, as I subsequently learned, is a commonplace young person who had some
                  connection, I do not know what; with the building of that graceful granite bridge
                  which spans the crooked silver lake in the Public Garden.</p>
               <p>When I think of the readiness with which Mr. H—— built up his airy fabric on my
                  credulity, I feel half inclined to laugh, though I am deeply mortified at having
                  been the unresisting victim of his Black Art.</p>

                  <hi rend="i"/>IN one of the episodes in his entertaining volume of Vagabond
                  Adventures, Mr. Keeler takes the reader with him on a professional cruise in Dr.
                  Spaulding's Floating Palace. This Floating Palace, a sort of Barnum's Museum with
                  a keel, was designed for navigation in Southern and Western rivers, and carried a
                  cargo of complex delights that must have much amazed the simple dwellers on the
                  banks of the Ohio and the Mississippi. Here, on board of this dramatical Noah's
                  Ark, the reader finds himself on the pleasantest terms conceivable with negro
                  minstrels, danseuses, apostolic wax-works, moral acrobats, stuffed animals,
                  vocalists, and a certain Governor Dorr.</p>
               <p>It was with a thrill of honest pleasure that I came upon this picturesque outcast
                  unexpectedly embalmed, like a fly in amber, in Mr. Keeler's autobiography. There
                  was a time when I was<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC5554-00000106"/> proud to know
                  this Governor Dorr, when I hung upon the rotund music of his lips, listened to his
                  marvellous stories of moving accidents by flood and field, and was melted to the
                  very heart at those rare moments when, in a three-cornered room in the rear of
                  Wall's Drug Store, he would favor me with some of the most lacrymose and
                  sentimental poems that ever came of a despondent poet. At this epoch of my
                  existence, Governor Dorr, with his sarcastic winks, his comic melancholy, his
                  quotations from Shakespeare, and his fearful knowledge of the outside world, was
                  in my eyes the personification of all that was learned, lyrical, romantic, and
                  daring. A little later my boyish admiration was shattered by the discovery that my
                  Admirable Crichton was—well, it is of no use now to mince words—an adventurer and
                  a gambler. With a kind of sigh that is at present a lost art to me, I put him
                  aside with those dethroned idols and collapsed dreams which accumulate on one's
                  hands as one advances in life, and of which I already had a promising collection
                  when I was about twenty. I cast off Governor Dorr, I repeat; but, oddly enough,
                  Governor Dorr never cast <emph>me</emph> off, but persisted in turning up at
                  intervals of four or five years in the tender and pathetic character of "the
                  friend of my youth."</p>
               <p>As Governor Dorr is the only gentleman in his line of business who ever evinced
                  any interest in me, I intend to make the most of him; and, indeed, among my
                  reputable acquaintances there is none who deserves to fare better at my hands. My
                  reputable acquaintances have sometimes bored me, and taught me nothing. Now
                  Governor Dorr, in the ethereal shape of a reminiscence, has not only been a source
                  of great amusement to me at various times, but has taught me by his own funest
                  example that whatever gifts a man may possess, if he have no moral principle he is
                  a failure. Wanting the gift of honesty, Governor Dorr was a gambler and a sharper,
                  and is dead.</p>
               <milestone n="" unit="typography"/>
               <p>I was a school-boy at Rivermouth when Governor Dorr swept like a brilliant comet
                  into the narrow arc of my observation.* One day in <ref rend="super"

                     unfortunate.</note>
                  <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC5554-00000107"/> the summer of 18— I was going home
                  from school when I saw standing in front of Wall's Drug Store a showily dressed
                  person, who seemed to me well advanced in years, that is to say, twenty-five or
                  thirty; he was the centre of a small circle of idle fellows about town, who were
                  drinking in with obvious relish one of those pre-Raphaelite narratives which I was
                  afterwards destined to swallow with open-mouthed wonder. The genial twinkle of the
                  man's blue eyes, the glow of his half-smoked cigar, and the blaze of the diamond
                  on his little finger, all seemed the members of one radiant family. To this day I
                  cannot disassociate a sort of glitter with the memory of my first glimpse of
                  Governor Dorr. He had finished speaking as I joined the group; I had caught only
                  the words, "and that was the last of gallant Jack Martinway," delivered in a
                  singularly mellow barytone voice, when he turned abruptly and disappeared behind
                  the orange and purple jars in Dr. Wall's shop-window.</p>
               <p>Who is gallant Jack Martinway, I wondered, and who is this dazzling person that
                  wears his best clothes on a week-day I took him for some distinguished military
                  hero, and with a fine feeling for anachronism immediately connected him with the
                  portrait of Sir Walter Raleigh in Mitchell's Geography,—a work I was at that time
                  neglecting with considerable perseverance.</p>
               <p>The apparition of so bewildering a figure in our staid, slow-going little town was
                  likely to cause a sensation. The next day in school I learned all about him. He
                  was Governor Dorr; he had once been a boy in Rivermouth, like us, but had gone off
                  years ago to seek his fortune, and now he had come back immensely wealthy from
                  somewhere,—South America or the Chincha Islands, where he was governor,—and was
                  going to settle down in his native town and buy the "Janvrin Place,"—an estate
                  which the heirs were too poor to keep and nobody else rich enough to purchase.</p>
               <p>This was appetizing, and after school I wandered up to Wall's Drug Store to take a
                  look at my gilded townsman, of whom I was not a little proud.</p>
               <p>I was so dazed at the time, that I do not recollect how it all came about; but
                  Governor Dorr was in the shop holding a glass of soda-water in<pb n="214-215"
                     xml:id="VAC5554-00000108"/> one hand and leaning elegantly on the Gothic
                  fountain; I entered with the weak pretence of buying a slate pencil; the Governor
                  spoke to me, and then—I can recall nothing except that, when I recovered from my
                  embarrassment and confusion, I was drinking soda-water with the Great Mogul,
                  strangling myself with the lively beverage, and eliciting from him the laughing
                  advice that I should n't drink it while it was boiling.</p>
               <p>It was aggravated case of friendship at first sight. In less than a week my
                  admiration for Governor Dorr was so pure, unselfish, and unquestioning that it
                  saddens me now to remember it, knowing that the stock is exhausted. Every
                  Wednesday and Saturday afternoon—our half-holidays—I hurried to Wall's Drug Store
                  to meet my friend. Here were his head-quarters, and a most profitable customer he
                  must have been, for when he was not drinking soda-water he was smoking the
                  Doctor's cigars.</p>
               <p>In the rear of the shop was a small triangular room where Dr. Wall manufactured a
                  patent eclectic cough sirup, and where he allowed us to sit rainy afternoons.
                  Nothing about me as I write is so real as a vision of that musty,
                  penny-royal-smelling royal-smelling little room, with Governor Dorr sitting on a
                  reversed mortar and accenting the spirited parts of some Homeric story with a
                  circumflex flourish of the Doctor's iron pestle, on the end of which was always a
                  thin crust of the prescription last put up, Rows of croupy square bottles filled
                  with a dark-colored mixture and labelled "Cough Sirup" look down on me from their
                  dusty shelves, and I am listening again as of old!</p>
               <p>In pleasant weather we sauntered about town, or strolled off into those pretty
                  lanes which make Rivermouth, and rural places like Rivermouth, a paradise for
                  lovers. In all these hours with Governor Dorr, I never knew him to let fall a word
                  that a child should not hear. Perhaps my innocence and my unconcealed reverence
                  for him touched and drew the better part of his heart to me, for it had a better
                  part,—one uncontaminated little piece for children.</p>
               <p>Our conversation turned chiefly on his travels, literature, literary men, and
                  actors. His talk, I may remark, was very full on literary men; he knew them well,
                  and was on astonishingly familiar personal terms with all the American authors<pb
                     n="216-217" xml:id="VAC5554-00000109"/> quoted in my Third Reader, especially
                  with Joel Barlow, who, I subsequently learned, had quitted this planet about half
                  a century previous to the birth of my friend. He called him "Joel," quite
                  familiarly, and sometimes his "dear old friend Joe Barlow, the Hasty-Pudding
                  Man!"</p>
               <p>Shakespeare, however, was the weakness or the strength of Governor Dorr. I am glad
                  he did not have the effrontery to claim <emph>his</emph> acquaintance <emph>in
                     propria persona</emph>. I am afraid that would have shaken my faith and spoiled
                  me for enjoying my comrade's constant quotations. I am not sure, though, for I
                  trusted so implicitly in the superior knowledge of Governor Dorr that on one
                  occasion he convinced me that Herrick was a contemporary American author, and not
                  an old English poet as I had read somewhere. "Why, my dear boy," he exclaimed, "I
                  know him well. He is a fellow of infinite jest, and his father edits the New York
                  Sunday Atlas!" And the Governor drew forth a copy of the journal and showed me the
                  name of ANSON HERRICK in large capitals at the head of the paper. After that I was
                  entirely adrift on what is called "the sea of English literature."</p>
               <p>To return to the Bard of Avon, "the immortal Bill," as my friend apostrophized him
                  in moments of enthusiasm. The daily talk of the Governor would have come to a
                  dead-lock; if he had been debarred the privilege of drawing at sight on his
                  favorite poet. Take Shakespeare from Dorr, and naught remains. It was remarkable
                  how the plays helped him out; now it was Othello, and now it was Touchstone, and
                  now it was Prospero who flew to his assistance with words and phrases so pat that
                  they seemed created for the occasion. His voice, at that time rich, strong, and
                  varied as the lines themselves, made it a delight to hear him repeat a long
                  passage. I was not often able to follow the sense of the text, but the music bore
                  me on with it. I can hear him now, saying:— <q>

                  <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC5554-00000110"/> I never read the lines but I feel his
                  hand laid suddenly upon my shoulder, and fancy myself standing on the old Mill-Dam
                  Bridge at Rivermouth, with the water rushing through the sluices and the rest of
                  the pond lying like a sheet of crinkled silver in the moonlight.</p>
               <p>My intercourse with Governor Dorr was not carried on without the cognizance of my
                  family. They raised no objections. The Governor was then in his best style, and by
                  his good-nature and free-and-easy ways more or less won everybody. The leading men
                  of the town touched their hats to him on the street, and chatted with him at the
                  post-office. It must be confessed, though, that the Governor was a sore puzzle to
                  those worthy people. His fluency of money and language was not a local
                  characteristic. He had left the place about ten years before, a poor boy, and now
                  he had dropped down from nobody knew where, like an, aerolite, mysteriously gay
                  and possibly valuable.</p>
               <p>The fact is, he must have been merely a gambler at this period, and had not
                  entered upon that more aggressive career which afterwards made him well known to
                  the police of Boston, New York, and New Orleans. At all events, his fame had not
                  reached Rivermouth; and though my family wondered what I saw in him or he in me to
                  build a friendship on,—the disparity in our ages being so great,—they by no means
                  objected to the intimacy, and it continued.</p>
               <p>What impressed me most in Governor Dorr, next to his literary endowments, was his
                  generous nature, his ready and practical sympathy for all sorts of unfortunate
                  people. I have known him to go about the town half the morning with a blind man,
                  selling his brooms for him at extortionate prices. I have seen the tears spring to
                  his eyes at the recital of some story of suffering among the factory hands, many
                  of whom were children. His love for these pale little men and women, as I think of
                  it, is very touching; and it seems one of the finest things in the world to me
                  now, and at the time it struck me as an epical exhibition of human sympathy, that
                  he once purchased an expensive pair of skates for a little boy who had been born a
                  cripple.</p>
               <p>No doubt these facile sympathies were as superficial as letter-paper, as
                  short-lived at those midges which are born and become great-grand-fathers<pb
                     n="220-221" xml:id="VAC5554-00000111"/> fathers and die in the course of a
                  single hour; but they endeared the Governor to me, and maybe, when the final
                  reckoning comes, all those good impulses will add up to something handsome; who
                  can tell?</p>
               <p>Nearly six months had passed since the beginning of our acquaintance, when one
                  morning my noble friend and my copy of Shakespeare—an illegibly printed volume
                  bound in seedy law-calf, but the most precious of my earthly treasures—disappeared
                  from the town simultaneously. Governor Dorr had gone, as he had come, without a
                  word of warning, leaving his "ancient," as he was pleased to call me, the victim
                  of abject despair.</p>
               <p>What complicated events caused the abrupt departure of my friend and my calf-skin
                  Shakespeare from Rivermouth never transpired. Perhaps he had spent all his money:
                  perhaps he was wanted by a pal in New York, for some fresh piece of deviltry; or,
                  what is more probable, the pastoral sweetness of life at Rivermouth had begun to
                  cloy on his metropolitan palate.</p>
               <p>It may have been five or it may have been ten months after his exodus that my late
                  companion became known to the town in his true colors. He had been tripped up in
                  some disreputable transaction or another, and had played a rather unenviable
                     <emph>rôle</emph> in the New York police reports. I had been entertaining, not
                  an angel, but a gambler unawares. My mortification was unassumed, and I banished
                  the fascinating Governor Dorr from my affections forever.</p>
               <p>A few years afterwards I left Rivermouth myself. The friend of my youth had become
                  a faded memory. I had neither seen nor heard of him in the meanwhile; and the
                  summer when I planned to pass the whole of a long vacation at my boyhood's home,
                  the Governor assumed but a subordinate part in the associations naturally evoked
                  by the proposed visit.</p>
               <p>In my first walk through the town after my arrival, it was with a sort of comical
                  consternation that I beheld Governor Dorr standing in font of Wall's Drug Store,
                  smoking the very same cigar, it seemed, and skilfully catching the sunlight on the
                  facets of that identical diamond ring.</p>
               <p>The same, and not the same. He looked older, and was not so well groomed as he
                  used to be;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC5554-00000112"/> his lower jaw had grown
                  heavier and his figure not improved. There was a hard expression in his face, and
                  that inexplicable something all over him which says as plainly as a whisper to the
                  ear, "This is a Black Sheep."</p>
               <p>At the crossing our eyes met. Would he recognize his quondam chum and dupe, after
                  all these years? The Governor gazed at me earnestly for ten seconds, then slowly
                  drew back, and lifting his hat with a magnificent grand air quite his own made me
                  an obeisance so involved and elaborate that it would be mere rashness to attempt
                  to describe it.</p>
               <p>The lady at my side gave my arm a convulsive grasp, and whispered, "Who is that
                  dreadful man?"</p>
               <p>"O, that?—that is the friend of my youth!"</p>
               <p>Though I made light of the meeting, I was by no means amused by it. I saw that if
                  Governor Dorr insisted on presuming on his old acquaintance, he might render it
                  very disagreeable for me; I might have to snub him, perhaps quarrel with him. His
                  presence was altogether annoying and depressing.</p>
               <p>It appears that the man had been lying about Rivermouth for the last twelvemonth.
                  When he was there before he had mystified the town, but now he terrified it. The
                  people were afraid of him, and Governor Dorr knew it, and was having what he would
                  have described as "a very soft thing." He touched his hat to all the pretty girls
                  in the place, talked to everybody, and ministered to the spiritual part of his
                  nature, now and then, by walking down the street familiarly with an eminent divine
                  who did not deem it prudent to resent the impertinence. For it was noticed by
                  careful observers, that when any person repelled Governor Dorr, that person's
                  wood-house caught on fire mysteriously, or a successful raid was undertaken in the
                  direction of that person's family plate.</p>
               <p>These trifling mishaps could never be traced to the Governor's agency, but the
                  remarkable precision with which a catastrophe followed any slight offered to him
                  made the townspeople rather civil than otherwise to their lively guest.</p>
               <p>The authorities, however, were on the alert, and one' night, a week after my
                  arrival, the Governor was caught <emph>flagrante delicto</emph>, and lodged by
                  Sheriff Adams in the Stone Jail, to my great<pb n="224-225"
                     xml:id="VAC5554-00000113"/> relief, be it said; for the dread of meeting the
                  man in my walks to the post-office and the reading-room, had given me the air of a
                  person seeking to elude the vigilance of justice.</p>
               <p>I forget which of the laws the Governor had offended,—he was quite impartial in
                  his transgressions, by the way,—but it was one that insured him a stationary
                  residence for several months, and I considered myself well rid of the gentleman.
                  But I little knew the resources of Governor Dorr.</p>
               <p>He had been in the habit of contributing poems and sketches of a lurid nature to
                  one of the local newspapers, and now, finding the time to hang heavily on his
                  hands in the solitude, of his cell,—the window of which overlooked the main street
                  of the town, he began a series of letters to the editor of the journal in
                  question.</p>
               <p>These letters, were dated from the Hôtel d'Adams (a graceful tribute to the
                  sheriff of thee county), and consisted of descriptions of what he saw from his
                  cell window, with sharp, shrewd, and witty hits at the peculiarities of certain
                  notable persons of the town, together with some attempts at fine writing not so
                  successful. His observations on the townspeople were delicious. He had a neat,
                  humorous touch which, with training and under happier stars, might have won him,
                  reputation.</p>
               <p>How I enjoyed those letters! How impatiently I awaited the semiweekly appearance
                  of the squalid journal containing them; with what eager fingers I unfolded the
                  damp sheet, until, alas! one luckless morning there came a letter devoted wholly
                  to myself. The "Leaves from the Diary of a Gentleman of Elegant Leisure" no longer
                  seemed witty to me. And in truth this leaf was not intended to be witty. It was in
                  the Governor's best sentimental vein. He informed me that he had "from afar"
                  watched over my budding career with the fondness of an elder brother, and that his
                  heart, otherwise humble and unassuming, owned to a throb of honest pride and
                  exultation when he remembered that it was he who, had first guided my "nursling
                  feet" over the flowery fields of English poesy, and bathed with me up to the chin
                  in that "Pierian flood" which I had since made all my own. And so on through a
                  column of solid nonpareil type. Altogether, his panegyric placed me in a more<pb
                     n="226-227" xml:id="VAC5554-00000114"/> ridiculous light than any amount of
                  abuse could have done. His sentiment was a thousand times more deadly than his
                  satire.</p>
               <p>Though my vacation was not at an end by several weeks, I quietly packed my valise
                  that night, and fled from the friend of my youth.</p>
               <milestone n="" unit="typography"/>
               <p>I find that I am using the capital letter <emph>I</emph> rather freely in this
                  sketch,—a reprehensible habit into which people who write autobiography are apt to
                  fall; but really my intention is to give as little of myself and as much of my
                  friend as possible.</p>
               <p>In the two or three years that followed this ignominious flight from my native
                  town, I frequently heard of Governor Dorr indirectly. He lad become famous now in
                  his modest way. I heard of him in New Orleans and in some of the Western cities.
                  Once, at least, he reappeared in Rivermouth, where he got into some difficulty
                  with a number of noncombatant turkeys prepared for Thanksgiving, the result of
                  which was he spent that day of general festivity at the Hôtel d'Adams. But New
                  York was, I believe, his favorite field of operations, as well as mine.</p>
               <p>I cannot explain why the man so often came uppermost in my mind in those days; but
                  I thought of him a great deal at intervals, and was thinking of him very
                  particularly one dismal November afternoon in 185-, as I sat alone in the
                  editorial room of the Saturday Press, where I had remained to write after the
                  departure of my <foreign xml:lang="FRA">confrères</foreign>.</p>
               <p>It was a melancholy small room, up two flights of stairs, in the rear of a
                  building used as a warehouse by a paper firm doing business in the basement.
                  Though bounded on all sides by turbulent streams of traffic, this room was as
                  secluded and remote as if it had stood in the middle of the Desert of Sahara. It
                  would have made an admirable scenic background for a noiseless midday murder in a
                  melodrama. But it was an excellent place in which to write, in spite of the
                  cobwebbed rafters overhead and the confirmed symptoms of scrofula in the
                  plastering.</p>
               <p>I did not settle down to work easily that afternoon; my fancy busied itself with
                  everything except the matter in hand: I fell to thinking of old times and
                  Rivermouth, and what comical things boys are with their hero-worship and their
                  monkey-shines, and how I used to regard Governor<pb n="228-229"
                     xml:id="VAC5554-00000115"/> ernor Dorr as a cross between Sir Philip Sidney and
                  Sir Walter Raleigh, and what a pitiable, flimsy hero he was in reality,—a king of
                  shreds and patches. "Why were such men born?" I said to myself; "Nature in her
                  severe economy creates nothing useless, unless it be the ruminative moth or the
                  New Jersey mosquito; the human species alone is full of failures monstrous and
                  inexplicable."</p>
               <p>In the midst of this the door opened, and Governor Dorr stood before me. I have
                  had pleasanter surprises.</p>
               <p>There was a certain deprecating air about him as he raised his hat in a feeble
                  attempt at his old-time manner, a tacit confession that he could n't do it. With
                  his closely cropped hair he looked like a prize-fighter retired from business. He
                  was unshaven and pathetically shabby. His features were out of drawing, and wore
                  that peculiar retributive pallor which gin and water in unfair proportions are
                  said to produce. The dye had faded from his heavy mustache, leaving it of a dark
                  greenish tint not becoming to his style of beauty. His threadbare coat was
                  buttoned unevenly across his chest close up to the throat, and was shiny at the
                  cuffs and along the seams. His hat had a weed on it, which struck me as being
                  strange, as I did not remember that anybody had been hanged recently. I afterwards
                  formed a theory touching that weed, based on the supposition that the hat was
                  somebody else's property. Altogether the Governor looked as if he had fallen upon
                  evil days since our last meeting. There was a hard, cold look in his eyes which,
                  in spite of his half-apologetic attitude, was far from reassuring.</p>
               <p>Given a voice in the matter, I would not have chosen to have a private conference
                  with him that dull November afternoon in that lonely room in the old barracks on
                  Spruce Street.</p>
               <p>The space occupied by the editorial tables was shut off from the rest of the
                  office by a slight wooden rail extending across the apartment. In the centre of
                  this rail was a gate, which my visitor, after a moment's hesitation, proceeded to
                  open.</p>
               <p>As I noted down all the circumstances of the interview while it was fresh in my
                  mind, I am able to reproduce the Governor's words and manner pretty
                  faithfully.</p>
               <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC5554-00000116"/>
               <p>Hi closed the gate behind him with laborious care, advanced a few steps, rested
                  one hand upon the back of a chair, and fixed a pair of fishy eyes upon me. If he
                  intended to fascinate me, he failed ; if he intended to make me feel extremely
                  nervous, his success was complete.</p>
               <p>"Telemachus," he said, at length, in a voice that had lost its old music and may
                  be succinctly described as ropy,—"you know I used to call you Telemachus in those
                  happy days when I was your 'guide, philosopher, and friend,'—you see before you a
                  reformed man."</p>
               <p>I suppose I was not entirely successful in concealing my inward conviction.</p>
               <p>"So help me Bob!" exclaimed the Governor. "I am going to reform, and get some
                  decent clothes"—casting a look of unutterable scorn on his coat-sleeve.</p>
               <p>The idea of connecting a reformatory measure with all increase of wardrobe struck
                  me as neat, and I smiled.</p>
               <p>"I am going to be honest," continued Governor Dorr, not heeding my unseemly
                  levity; "'Honest Iago.' I am going to turn over a new leaf. I don't like the way
                  things have been going. I was n't intended to be a low fellow. I ain't adapted to
                  being an outcast from society. 'We know what we are, but we don't know what we may
                  be,' as the sublime Shakespeare remarks. Now, I know what I am, and I know what I
                  'm going to be. I 'm going to be another man. But I must get out of New York
                  first. The boys would n't let me reform. 'The little dogs and all, Tray, Blanch,
                  and Sweetheart, see, they bark at me!' I know too many people here and too many
                  people know me. I am going to New Orleans. My old friend Kendall of the Picayune
                  knows my literary qualifications, and would give me an engagement on his paper at
                  sight; but I 'm not proud, and if worst came to worst I could got advertisements
                  or solicit subscribers, and work my way up. In the bright lexicon of a man who
                  means what he says, 'there 's no such word as fail.' He does n't know how to spell
                  it."</p>
               <p>The Governor paused and looked at me for a reply; but as I had nothing to say, I
                  said it.</p>
               <p>"I 've been down to Rivermouth," he resumed, a trifle less spiritedly, "to see
                  what my old chums would do towards paying my way to New Orleans.<pb n="232-233"
                     xml:id="VAC5554-00000117"/> They gave me a good deal of good advice, especially
                  Colonel B——but I am out just twenty dollars, travelling expenses. Advice, however
                  excellent, does n't pay a fellow's passage to New Orleans in the present
                  disordered state of society. I have collected some money but not enough by a few
                  dollars; and presuming on the memory of those days—those Arcadian days—when we
                  wandered hand in band through the green pastures of American poesy, I have come to
                  you for a temporary loan,—however small," he added hastily, "to help me in
                  becoming an honest citizen and a useful member of society."</p>
               <p>I listened attentively to the Governor's statement, and believed not a syllable of
                  it, not so much as a hyphen. It had a fatally familiar jingle; I had helped to
                  reform people before. Nevertheless, the man's misery was genuine, and I determined
                  not to throw him over altogether. But I did not wish him to consider me the victim
                  of his cleverness; so I frankly told him that I did not believe a word about his
                  reforming, and that if I gave him a little pecuniary assistance, it was solely
                  because I used to think kindly of him when I was a boy.</p>
               <p>The Governor was so affected by this that he searched in several pockets for a
                  handkerchief, but not finding one, he wiped away what I should call a very dry
                  tear with the cuff of his sleeve.</p>
               <p>"'Had I but served my, God,'" he remarked, "'with half the zeal' I have fooled
                  away my chances, he would not have left me in mine age' to solicit financial
                  succor in this humiliating fashion."</p>
               <p>It was the mendaciousness of Jeremy Diddler toned down by the remorse of Cardinal
                  Wolsey.</p>
               <p>"I am well aware," I said coldly, "that the few dollars I intend to give you will
                  be staked at the nearest faro-table or squandered over the barr of some
                  drinking-shop. I want you to understand distinctly that you are not imposing on
                  me.</p>
               <p>Now the journal of which I was part proprietor had a weekly circulation of less
                  than forty thousand copies, and at the end of the week, when we had paid a sordid
                  printer and an unimaginative paper-maker, we were in a condition that entitled us
                  to rank as objects of charity rather than as benefactors of the poor. A
                  five-dollar bill was all my available assets that November afternoon, and out of
                  this I purposed to reserve two dollars<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC5554-00000118"/>
                  for my dinner at Mataran's. I stated the case plainly to the Governor, suggesting
                  that I could get the note changed at the Tribune office.</p>
               <p>He picked up the bill which I had spread out on the table between us, remarking
                  that he thought he could change it. Whereupon he produced a portly pocket-book
                  from the breast of his coat, and from the pocket-book so fat a roll of bank-notes
                  that I glowed with indignation to think he had the coolness to appropriate three
                  fifths of my slender earnings.</p>
               <p>"New Orleans, you know," he remarked, explanatorily.</p>
               <p>The Governor was quite another man now, running dexterously over the bills with a
                  moist forefinger in the gayest of spirits. He handed me my share of the
                  five-dollar bill with the manner of a benevolent prince dispensing his bounties,
                  accorded me the privilege of grasping his manly hand, raised his hat with a good
                  deal of his old quasi aristocratic flourish, and was gone.</p>
               <p>There is this heavenly quality in a deed of even misplaced charity,—it makes the
                  heart of the doer sit lightly in his bosom. I treated myself handsomely that
                  afternoon at dinner, regarding ing myself in the abstract as a person who ought to
                  dine well, and was worthy of at least half a pint of table-claret. I tested the
                  delicacies of Mataran's <emph>cuisine</emph> as far as my purse would allow; but
                  when I stepped to the desk to pay the reckoning, those two one-dollar bills rather
                  awkwardly turned out to be counterfeits!</p>
               <p>Well, I suppose I deserved it.</p>
               <milestone n="" unit="typography"/>
               <p>The frequency with which Governor Dorr's name figured in the local police reports
                  during the ensuing twelve months leads me to infer that he did not depart for New
                  Orleans as soon as he expected.</p>
               <p>Time rolled on, and the Saturday Press, being loved by the gods, died early, and
                  one morning in 1861 I found myself at liberty to undertake a long-deferred
                  pilgrimage to Rivermouth.</p>
               <p>On arriving at my destination, cramped with a night's ride in the cars, I resolved
                  to get the kinks out of me by walking from the station. Turning into one of the
                  less-frequented streets in order not to meet too many of my townsfolk, I came
                  abruptly upon a hearse jogging along very pleasantly and followed at a little
                  distance by a<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC5554-00000119"/> single hack. When all
                  one's friends can be put into a single hack, perhaps, it is best that one should
                  be buried expeditiously.</p>
               <p>A malign Urchin stood on the corner whistling shrilly through his fingers, which
                  he removed from his lips with an injured air long enough to answer my question.
                  "Who 's dead? Why, Guvner Dorr 's dead. That 's 'im" curving a calliopean thumb in
                  the direction of the hearse. The pity of it! The forlornness of the thing touched
                  me, and a feeling of gratitude went out from my bosom towards the two or three
                  hacks which now made their appearance around the corner and joined the funeral
                  train.</p>
               <p>Broken down in his prime with careless living, Governor Dorr a few months
                  previously had straggled back to the old place to die; and thus had chance—which
                  sometimes displays a keen appreciation of dramatic effect—once more, and for the
                  last time, brought me in contact with the friend of my youth. Obeying the impulse,
                  I turned and followed the procession until it came to the head of that long,
                  unbuilt street which, stretching in a curve from the yawning gate of the cemetery
                  into the heart of the town, always seemed to me like a great siphon draining the
                  life from Rivermouth. Here I halted and watched the black carriages as they
                  crawled down the road, growing smaller and smaller, until they appeared to resolve
                  themselves into one tiny coach, which, lessening in the distance, finally vanished
                  through a gateway that seemed about a foot high.</p>

                     <hi rend="i"/>WE are accustomed to speak with a certain light irony of the
                     tendency which women have to gossip, as if the sin itself, if it is a sin, were
                     of the gentler sex, and could by no chance be a masculine peccadillo. So far as
                     my observation goes, men are as much given to small talk as women, and it is
                     undeniable that we have produced the highest type of gossiper extant. Where
                     will you find, in or out of literature, such another droll, delightful, chatty
                     busybody as Samuel Pepys, Esq., Secretary to the Admiralty in the reigns of
                     those fortunate gentlemen Charles II. and James II. of England? He is the king
                     of tattlers, as Shakespeare is the king of poets.</p>
                  <p>If it came to a matter of pure gossip, I would back Our Club against the
                     Sorosis or any women's club in existence. Whenever you see in our drawing-room
                     four or five young fellows lounging in easy-chairs, cigar in hand, and now and
                     then bringing their heads together over the small round Japanese table which is
                     always the pivot of these social circles, you may be sure they are discussing
                     Tom's engagement, or Dick's extravagance, or Harry's hopeless passion for the
                     younger Miss Fleurdelys. It is here that old Tippleton gets execrated for that
                     everlasting <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bon mot</foreign> of his which was quite a
                     success at dinner-parties forty years ago; it is here the belle of the season
                     passes under the scalpels of merciless young surgeons; it is here B's financial
                     condition is handled in a way that would make B's hair stand on end; it is
                     here, in short, that everything is canvassed,—everything that happens in our
                     set, I mean, much that never happens, and a great deal that could not possibly
                     happen. It was at Our Club that I learned the particulars of the Van Twiller
                     affair.</p>
                  <p>It was great entertainment to Our Club, the Van Twiller affair, though it was
                     rather a joyless thing, I fancy, for Van Twiller. To understand the case fully,
                     it should be understood that Ralph<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC5554-00000121"/>
                     Van Twiller is one of the proudest and most sensitive men living. He is a
                     lineal descendant of Wouter Van Twiller, the famous old Dutch governor of New
                     York,—Nieuw Amsterdam, as it was then; his ancestors have always been
                     burgomasters or admirals or generals, and his mother is the Mrs. Vanrensselaer
                     Vanzandt Van Twiller whose magnificent place will be pointed out to you on the
                     right bank of the Hudson, as you pass up the historic river towards Idlewild.
                     Ralph is about twenty-five years old. Birth made him a gentleman, and the rise
                     of real estate—some of it in the family since the old governor's time—made him
                     a millionnaire. It was a kindly fairy that stepped in and made him a good
                     fellow also. Fortune, I take it, was in her most jocund mood when she heaped
                     her gifts in this fashion on Van Twiller, who was, and will be again, when this
                     cloud blows over, the flower of Our Club.</p>
                  <p>About a year ago there came a whisper—if the word "whisper" is not too harsh a
                     term to apply to what seemed a mere breath floating gently through the
                     atmosphere of the billiard-room—imparting the intelligence that Van Twiller was
                     in some kind of trouble. Just as everybody suddenly takes to wearing
                     square-toed boots, or to drawing his neckscarf through a ring, so it became all
                     at once the fashion, without any preconcerted agreement, for everybody to speak
                     of Van Twiller as a man in some way under a cloud. But what the cloud was, and
                     how he got under it, and why he did not get away from it, were points that
                     lifted themselves into the realm of pure conjecture. There was no man in the
                     club with strong enough wing to his imagination to soar to the supposition that
                     Van Twiller was embarrassed in money matters. Was he in love? That appeared
                     nearly as improbable; for if he had been in love all the world—that is, perhaps
                     a hundred first families—would have known all about it instantly.</p>
                  <p>"He has the symptoms," said Delaney, laughing. "I remember once when Jack
                     Flemming—"</p>
                  <p>"Ned!" cried Flemming, "I protest against any allusion to that business."</p>
                  <p>This was one night when Van Twiller had wandered into the club, turned over the
                     magazines absently in the reading-room, and wandered<pb n="242-243"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000122"/> out again without speaking ten words. The most
                     careless eye would have remarked the great change that had come over Van
                     Twiller. Now and than he would play a game of billiards with Bret Harte or John
                     Hay, or stop to chat a moment in the vestibule within Whitelaw Reid; but he was
                     an altered man. When at the club, he was usually to be found in a small
                     smoking-room up stairs, seated on a fauteuil fast asleep, with the last number
                     of The Nation in his hand. Once if you went to two or three places of an
                     evening, you were certain to meet Van Twiller at them all. You seldom met him
                     society now.</p>
                  <p>By and by came, whisper number two, a whisper more emphatic than number one,
                     but still untraceable to any tangible mouth-piece. This time the whisper said
                     Van Twiller <emph>was</emph> in love. But with whom? The list of possible Mrs.
                     Van Twillers was carefully examined by experienced hands, and a check placed
                     against a fine, old Knickerbocker name here and there, but nothing satisfactory
                     arrived at. Then that same, still small voice of rumor, but now with an easily
                     detected staccato sharpness to it, said that Van Twiller was in love —with an
                     actress! Van Twiller, whom it had taken all these years and all this waste of
                     raw material in the way of ancestors to bring to perfection,—Ralph Van Twiller,
                     the net result and flower of his race, the descendant of Wouter, the son of
                     Mrs. Vanrensselaer Vanzandt Van Twiller,—in love with an actress! That was too
                     ridiculous to be believed,—and so everybody believed it.</p>
                  <p>Six or seven members of the club abruptly discovered in themselves an
                     unsuspected latent passion for the histrionic art. In squads of two or three
                     they stormed successively all the theatres in town,—Booth's, Wallack's, Daly's
                     Fifth, Avenue (not burnt down then), and the Grand Opera House. Even the shabby
                     homes of the drama over in the Bowery, where the Germanic Thespius has not
                     taken out his naturalization papers, underwent rigid exploration. But no clew
                     was found to Van Twiller's mysterious attachment. The <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >opéra bouffe</foreign>, which promised the widest field for investigation,
                     produced absolutely nothing, not even a crop of suspicions. One night, after
                     several weeks, of this, Delaney and I fancied we caught a glimpse of Van
                     Twiller in the private box of an up-town theatres were<pb n="244-245"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000123"/> some thrilling trapeze performance was going on,
                     which we did not care to sit through; but we concluded afterwards it was only
                     somebody that looked like him. Delaney, by the way, was unusually active in
                     this search. I dare say he never quite forgave Van Twiller for calling him
                     Muslin Delaney. Ned is fond of ladies society and that's a fact.</p>
                  <p>The Cimmerian darkness which surrounded Van Twiller's inamorata left us free to
                     indulge in the wildest, conjectures. Whether she was black-tressed Melpomene,
                     with bowl and dagger, or Thalia, with the fair hair and the laughing face, was
                     only to be guessed at. It was popularly conceded, however, that Van Twiller was
                     on the point of forming a dreadful <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >mèsalliance</foreign>.</p>
                  <p>Up to this period he had visited the club regularly. Suddenly he ceased to
                     appear. He was not to be seen on Broadway, or in the Central Park, or at the
                     houses he generally frequented. His chambers— and mighty comfortable ones they
                     were—on Thirty-fourth Street were deserted. He had, dropped out of the world,
                     shot like a bright particular star from his orbit in the heaven of the best
                     society.</p>
                  <p>"Where 's Van Twiller?"</p>
                  <p>"Who 's seen Van Twiller?"</p>
                  <p>"What has become of Van Twiller?"</p>
                  <p>Delaney picked up the Evening Post, and read,—with a solemnity that betrayed
                     young Firkins into exclaiming, "By Jove now!"—</p>
                  <p>"Married, on the 10th instant, by the Rev. Friar Laurence, at the residence of
                     the bride's uncle, Montague Capulet, Esq., Miss Adrienne Le Couvreur to Mr.
                     Ralph Van Twiller, both of this city. No cards."</p>
                  <p>"It strikes me," said Frank Livingstone, who had been ruffling the leaves of a
                     magazine at the other end of the table, "that you fellows are in a great fever
                     about Van Twiller."</p>
                  <p>"So we are."</p>
                  <p>"Well, he has simply gone out of town."</p>
                  <p>"Where?"</p>
                  <p>"Up to the old homestead on the Hudson."</p>
                  <p>"It 's an odd time of year for a fellow to go to the country."</p>
                  <p>"He has gone to visit his mother," said Livingstone.</p>
                  <p>"In February?"</p>
                  <p>"I did n't know, Delaney, there was any statute<pb n="246-247"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000124"/> ute in force prohibiting a man from visiting his
                     mother in February if he wants to."</p>
                  <p>Delaney made some light remark about the pleasure of communing with Nature with
                     a cold in her head, and the topic was dropped.</p>
                  <p>Livingstone was hand in glove with Van Twiller, and if any man shared his
                     confidence it was Livingstone. He was aware of the gossip and speculation that
                     had been rife in the club, but he either was not at liberty or did not think it
                     worth while to relieve our curiosity. In the course of a week or two it was
                     reported that Van Twiller was going to Europe; and go he did. A dozen of us
                     went down to the Scotia to see him off. It was refreshing to have something as
                     positive as the fact that Van Twiller had sailed.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>I.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>SHORTLY after Van Twiller's departure the whole thing came out.
                     Whether Livingstone found the secret too heavy a burden, or whether it
                     transpired through some indiscretion on the part of Mrs. Vanrensselaer Vanzandt
                     Van Twiller, I cannot say; but one evening the entire story was in the
                     possession of the club.</p>
                  <p>Van Twiller had actually been very deeply interested—not in an actress, for the
                     legitimate drama was not her humble walk in life, but—in Mademoiselle Olympe
                     Zabriski, whose really perilous feats on the trapeze had astonished New York
                     the year before, though they had failed to attract Delaney and me the night we
                     wandered into the up-town theatre on the trail of Van Twiller's mystery.</p>
                  <p>That a man like Van Twiller should be fascinated for an instant by a common
                     circus-girl seems incredible; but it is always the incredible thing that
                     happens. Besides, Mademoiselle<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC5554-00000125"/>
                     Olympe was not a common circus-girl; she was a most daring and startling
                     gymnaste, with a beauty and a grace of movement that gave to her audacious
                     performance almost an air of prudery. Watching her wondrous dexterity and
                     pliant strength, both exercised without apparent effort, it seemed the most
                     natural proceeding in the world that she should do those unpardonable things.
                     She had a way of melting from one graceful posture into another, like the
                     dissolving figures thrown from a stereopticon. She was a lithe, radiant shape
                     out of the Grecian mythology, now poised up there above the gas-lights, and now
                     gleaming through the air like a slender gilt arrow.</p>
                  <p>I am describing Mademoiselle Olympe as she appeared to Van Twiller on the first
                     occasion when he strolled into the theatre where she was performing. To me she
                     was a girl of eighteen or twenty years of age (maybe she was much older, for
                     pearl-powder and distance keep these people perpetually young), slightly but
                     exquisitely built, with sinews of silver wire; rather pretty, perhaps, after a
                     manner, but showing plainly the effects of the exhaustive drafts she was making
                     on her physical vitality. Now, Van Twiller was an enthusiast on the subject of
                     calisthenics. "If I had a daughter," Van Twiller used to say, "I would n't send
                     her to a boarding-school, or a nunnery; I 'd send her to a gymnasium for the
                     first five years. Our American women have no physique. They are lilies, pallid,
                     pretty,—and perishable. You marry an American woman, and what do you marry? A
                     headache. Look at English girls. They are at least roses, and last the season
                     through."</p>
                  <p>Walking home from the theatre that first night, it flitted through Van
                     Twiller's mind that if he could give this girl's set of nerves and muscles to
                     any one of the two hundred highbred women he knew, he would marry her on the
                     spot and worship her forever.</p>
                  <p>The following evening he went to see Mademoiselle Olympe again. "Olympe
                     Zabriski," he thought, as he sauntered through the lobby, what a queer name!
                     Olympe is French, and Zabriski is Polish. It is her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">nom
                        de guerre</foreign>, of course; her real name is probably Sarah Jones. What
                     kind of creature can she be in private life, I wonder? I wonder if she wears
                     that costume<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC5554-00000126"/> all the time, and if
                     she springs to her meals from a horizontal bar. Of course she rocks the baby to
                     sleep on the trapeze." And Van Twiller went on making comical domestic tableaux
                     of Mademoiselle Zabriski, like the clever, satirical dog he was, until the
                     curtain rose.</p>
                  <p>This was on a Friday. There was a matinée the next day, and he attended that,
                     though he had secured a seat for the usual evening entertainment. Then it
                     became a habit of Van Twiller's to drop into the theatre for half an hour or so
                     every night, to assist at the interlude, in which she appeared. He cared only
                     for her part of the programme, and timed his visits accordingly. It was a
                     surprise to himself when he reflected, one morning, that he had not missed a
                     single performance of Mademoiselle Olympe for two weeks.</p>
                  <p>"This will never do," said Van Twiller. "Olympe"—he called her Olympe, as if
                     she were an old acquaintance, and so she might have been considered by that
                     time—"is a wonderful creature; but this will never do. Van, my boy, you must
                     reform this altogether."</p>
                  <p>But half past nine that night saw him in his accustomed orchestra chair, and so
                     on for another week. A habit leads a man so gently in the beginning that he
                     does not perceive he is led,—with what silken threads and down what pleasant
                     avenues it leads him! By and by the soft silk threads become iron chains, and
                     the pleasant avenues Avernus!</p>
                  <p>Quite a new element had lately entered into Van Twiller's enjoyment of
                     Mademoiselle Olympe's ingenious feats,—a vaguely born apprehension that she
                     might slip from that swinging bar, that one of the thin cords supporting it
                     might snap, and let her go headlong from the dizzy height. Now and then, for a
                     terrible instant, he would imagine her lying a glittering, palpitating heap at
                     the foot-lights, with no color in her lips! Sometimes it seemed as if the girl
                     were tempting this kind of fate. It was a hard, bitter life, and nothing but
                     poverty and sordid misery at home could have driven her to it. What if she
                     should end it all some night, by just unclasping that little hand? It looked so
                     small and white from where Van Twiller sat!</p>
                  <p>This frightful idea fascinated while it chilled him, and helped to make it
                     nearly impossible<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC5554-00000127"/> for him to keep
                     away from the theatre. In the beginning his attendance had not interfered with
                     his social duties or pleasures; but now he came to find it distasteful after
                     dinner to do anything but read, or walk the streets aimlessly, until it was
                     time to go to the play. When that was over, he was in no mood to go anywhere
                     but to his rooms. So he dropped away by insensible degrees from his habitual
                     haunts, was missed, and began to be talked about at the club. Catching some
                     intimation of this, he ventured no more in the orchestra stalls, but shrouded
                     himself behind the draperies of the private box in which Delaney and I thought
                     we saw him on one occasion.</p>
                  <p>Now, I find it very perplexing to explain what Van Twiller was wholly unable to
                     explain to himself. He was not in love with Mademoiselle Olympe. He had no wish
                     to speak to her, or to hear her speak. Nothing could have been easier, and
                     nothing further from his desire, than to know her personally. A Van Twiller
                     personally acquainted with a strolling female acrobat! Good heavens! That was
                     something possible only with the discovery of perpetual motion. Taken from her
                     theatrical setting, from her lofty perch, so to say, on the trapeze-bar, and
                     Olympe Zabriski would have shocked every aristocratic fibre in Van Twiller's
                     body. He was simply fascinated by her marvellous grace and <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">élan</foreign>, and the magnetic recklessness of the girl. It
                     was very young in him and very weak, and no member of the Sorosis, or all the
                     Sorosisters together, could have been more severe on Van Twiller than he was on
                     himself. To be weak, and to know it, is something of a punishment for a proud
                     man. Van Twiller took his punishment, and went to the theatre, regularly.</p>
                  <p>"When her engagement comes to an end," he meditated, "that will finish the
                     business."</p>
                  <p>Mademoiselle Olympe's engagement finally did come to an end, and she departed.
                     But her engagement had been highly beneficial to the treasury-chest of the
                     up-town theatre, and before Van Twiller could get over missing her she had
                     returned from a short Western tour, and her immediate reappearance was
                     underlined on the play-bills.</p>
                  <p>On a dead-wall opposite the windows of Van Twiller's sleeping-room there
                     appeared, as if by necromancy, an aggressive poster with<pb n="254-255"
                        xml:id="VAC5554-00000128"/>
                     <hi rend="i"/>MADEMOISELLE OLYMPE ZABRISKI on it in letters at least a foot
                     high. This thing stared him in the face when he woke up, one morning. It gave
                     him a sensation as if she had called on him overnight, and left her card.</p>
                  <p>From time to time through the day he regarded that poster with a sardonic eye.
                     He had pitilessly resolved not to repeat the folly of the previous month. To
                     say that this moral victory cost him nothing would be to deprive it of merit.
                     It cost him many internal struggles. It is a fine thing to see a man seizing
                     his temptation by the throat, and wrestling with it, and trampling it under
                     foot like St. Anthony. This was the spectacle Van Twiller was exhibiting to the
                     angels.</p>
                  <p>The evening Mademoiselle Olympe was to make her reappearance, Van Twiller,
                     having dined at the club and feeling more like himself than he had felt for
                     weeks, returned to his chamber, and putting on dressing-gown and slippers,
                     piled up the greater portion of his library about him, and fell to reading
                     assiduously. There is nothing like a quiet evening at home with some slight
                     intellectual occupation, after one's feathers have been stroked the wrong
                     way.</p>
                  <p>When the lively French clock on the mantelpiece,—a base of malachite surmounted
                     by a flying bronze Mercury with its arms spread gracefully on the air, and not
                     remotely suggestive of Mademoiselle Olympe in the act of executing her grand
                     flight from the trapeze,—when the clock, I repeat, struck nine, Van Twiller
                     paid no attention to it. That was certainly a triumph. I am anxious to render
                     Van Twiller all the justice I can, at this point of the narrative, inasmuch as
                     when the half-hour sounded musically, like a crystal ball dropping into a
                     silver bowl, lie rose from the chair automatically, thrust his feet into his
                     walking-shoes, threw his overcoat across his arm, and strode out of the
                     room.</p>
                  <p>To be weak and to scorn your weakness, and not to be able to conquer it, is, as
                     has been said, a hard thing; and I suspect it was not with unalloyed
                     satisfaction that Van Twiller found himself taking his seat in the back part of
                     the private box night after night during the second engagement of Mademoiselle
                     Olympe. It was so easy not to stay away!</p>
                  <pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC5554-00000129"/>
                  <p>In this second edition of Van Twiller's fatuity, his case was even worse than
                     before. He not only thought of Olympe quite a number of times between breakfast
                     and dinner, he not only attended the interlude regularly, but he began, in
                     spite of himself, to occupy his leisure hours at night by dreaming of her. This
                     was too much of a good thing, and Van Twiller regarded it so. Besides, the
                     dream was always the same,—a harrowing dream, a dream singularly adapted to
                     shattering the nerves of a man like Van Twiller. He would imagine himself
                     seated at the theatre (with all the members of Our Club in the parquette),
                     watching Mademoiselle Olympe as usual, when suddenly that young lady would
                     launch herself desperately from the trapeze, and come flying through the air
                     like a firebrand hurled at his private box. Then the unfortunate man would wake
                     up with cold drops standing on his forehead.</p>
                  <p>There is one redeeming feature in this infatuation of Van Twiller's which the
                     sober moralist will love to look upon,—the serene unconsciousness of the person
                     who caused it. She went through her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">rôle</foreign> with
                     admirable aplomb, drew her salary, it may be assumed, punctually, and appears
                     from first to last to have been ignorant that there was a miserable slave
                     wearing her chains nightly in the left-hand proscenium-box.</p>
                  <p>That Van Twiller, haunting the theatre with the persistency of an ex-actor,
                     conducted himself so discreetly as not to draw the fire of Mademoiselle
                     Olympe's blue eyes shows that Van Twiller, however deeply under a spell, was
                     not in love. I say this, though I think if Van Twiller had not been Van
                     Twiller, if he had been a man of no family and no position and no money, if New
                     York had been Paris, and Thirty-fourth Street a street in the Latin Quarter—but
                     it is useless to speculate on what might have happened. What did happen is
                     sufficient.</p>
                  <p>It happened, then, in the second week of Queen Olympe's second unconscious
                     reign, that an appalling Whisper floated up the Hudson, effected a landing at a
                     point between Spuyten Duyvel Creek and Cold Spring, and sought out a stately
                     mansion of Dutch architecture standing on the bank of the river. The Whisper
                     straightway informed the lady dwelling in this mansion that all was not well
                     with the last of the Van<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC5554-00000130"/> Twillers,
                     that he was gradually estranging himself from his peers, and wasting his nights
                     in a play-house watching a misguided young woman turning unmaidenly
                     summersaults on a piece of wood attached to two ropes.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Vanrensselaer Vanzandt Van Twiller came down to town by the next train to
                     look into this little matter.</p>
                  <p>She found the flower of the family taking an early breakfast, at 11 A. M., in
                     his cosey apartments on Thirty-fourth Street. With the least possible
                     circumlocution she confronted him with what rumor had reported of his pursuits,
                     and was pleased, but not too much pleased, when he gave her an exact account of
                     his relations with Mademoiselle Zabriski, neither concealing nor qualifying
                     anything. As a confession, it was unique, and might have been a great deal less
                     entertaining. Two or three times, in the course of the narrative, the matron
                     had some difficulty in preserving the gravity of her countenance. After
                     meditating a few minutes, she tapped Van Twiller softly on the arm with the tip
                     of her parasol, and invited him to return with her the next day up the Hudson
                     and make a brief visit at the home of his ancestors. He accepted the invitation
                     with outward alacrity and inward disgust.</p>
                  <p>When this was settled, and the worthy lady had withdrawn, Van Twiller went
                     directly to the establishment of Messrs Ball, Black, and Company and selected,
                     with unerring taste, the finest diamond bracelet procurable. For his mother?
                     Dear me, no! She had the family jewels.</p>
                  <p>I would not like to state the enormous sum Van Twiller paid for this bracelet.
                     It was such a clasp of diamonds as would have hastened the pulsation of a
                     patrician wrist. It was such a bracelet as Prince Camaralzaman might have sent
                     to the Princess Badoura, and the Princess Badoura—might have been very glad to
                     get.</p>
                  <p>In the fragrant Levant morocco case, where these happy jewels lived when they
                     were at home, Van Twiller thoughtfully placed his card, on the back of which he
                     had written a line begging Mademoiselle Olympe Zabriski to accept the
                     accompanying trifle from one who had witnessed her graceful performances with
                     interest and pleasure. This was not done inconsiderately. "Of course<pb
                        n="260-261" xml:id="VAC5554-00000131"/> I must enclose my card, as I would
                     to any lady," Van Twiller had said to himself; a Van Twiller can neither write
                     an anonymous letter nor make an anonymous present." Blood entails its duties as
                     well as its privileges.</p>
                  <p>The casket despatched to its destination, Van Twiller felt easier in his mind.
                     He was under obligations to the girl for many an agreeable hour that might
                     otherwise have passed heavily. He had paid the debt, and he had paid it
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en prince</foreign>, as became a Van Twiller. He
                     spent the rest of the day in looking at some pictures at Goupil's, and at the
                     club, and in making a few purchases for his trip up the Hudson. A consciousness
                     that this trip up the Hudson was a disorderly retreat came over him
                     unpleasantly at intervals.</p>
                  <p>When he returned to his rooms late at night, he found a note lying on the
                     writing-table. He started as his eye caught the words "——Theatre" stamped in
                     carmine letters on one corner of the envelope. Van Twiller broke the seal with
                     trembling fingers.</p>
                  <p>Now, this note some time afterwards fell into the hands of <choice>
                        <sic>Livingtsone</sic>
                        <corr>Livingstone</corr>

                     to me, and I copied it as a literary curiosity. The note ran as follows:—</p>

               <head>PÈRE ANTOINE'S DATE-PALM. </head>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>NEAR the Levee, and not far from the old French Cathedral in the
                  Place d'Armes, at New Orleans, stands a fine date-palm, thirty feet in height,
                  spreading its broad leaves in the alien air as hardily as if its sinuous roots
                  were sucking strength from their native earth.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles Lyell, in his "Second Visit to the United States," mentions this
                  exotic: "The tree is seventy or eighty years old; for Pèere Antoine, a Roman
                  Catholic priest, who died about twenty years ago, told Mr. Bringier that he
                  planted it himself, when he was young. In his will he provided that they who
                  succeeded to this lot of ground should forfeit it if they cut down the palm."</p>
               <p>Wishing to learn something of Père Antoine's history, Sir Charles Lyell made
                  inquiries among the ancient creole inhabitants of the faubourg. That the old
                  priest, in his last days, became very much emaciated, that he walked about the
                  streets like a mummy, that he gradually dried up, and finally blew away, was the
                  meagre and unsatisfactory result of the tourist's investigations. This is all that
                  is generally told of Père Antoine.</p>
               <p>In the summer of 1861, while New Orleans was yet occupied by the Rebel forces, I
                  met at Alexandria, in Virginia, a lady from Louisiana,—Miss Blondeau by name,—who
                  gave me the substance of the following legend touching Père Antoine and his
                  wonderful date-palm. If it should appear tame to the reader, it will be because I
                  am not habited in a black ribbed-silk dress, with a strip of point-lace around my
                  throat, like Miss Blondeau; it will be because I lack her eyes and lips and
                  Southern music to tell it with.</p>
               <milestone n="" unit="typography"/>
               <p>When Père Antoine was a very young man, he had a friend whom he loved as he loved
                  his life. Émile Jardin returned his passion, and the two, on account of their
                  friendship, became the marvel of the city where they dwelt. One was never seen
                  without the other; for they studied, walked, ate, and slept together.</p>
               <p>Thus began Miss Blondeau, with the air of<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC5554-00000133"
                  /> Fiammetta telling her prettiest story to the Florentines in the garden of
                  Boccaccio.</p>
               <p>Antoine and Émile were preparing to enter the Church; indeed, they had taken the
                  preliminary steps, when a circumstance occurred which changed the color of their
                  lives. A foreign lady, from some nameless island in the Pacific, had a few months
                  before moved into their neighborhood. The lady died suddenly, leaving a girl of
                  sixteen or seventeen, entirely friendless and unprovided for. The young men had
                  been kind to the woman during her illness, and at her death—melting with pity at
                  the forlorn situation of Anglice, the daughter—swore between themselves to love
                  and watch over her as if she were their sister.</p>
               <p>Now Anglice had a wild, strange beauty that made other women seem tame beside her;
                  and in the course of time the young men found themselves regarding their ward not
                  so much like brothers as at first. In brief, they found themselves in love with
                  her.</p>
               <p>They struggled with their hopeless passion month after month, neither betraying
                  his secret to the other; for the austere orders which they were about to assume
                  precluded the idea of love and marriage. Until then they had dwelt in the calm air
                  of religious meditations, unmoved except by that pious fervor which in other ages
                  taught men to brave the tortures of the rack and to smile amid the flames. But a
                  blond girl, with great eyes and a voice like the soft notes of a vesper hymn, had
                  come in between them and their ascetic dreams of heaven. The ties that had bound
                  the young men together snapped silently one by one. At length each read in the
                  pale face of the other the story of his own despair.</p>
               <p>And she? If Anglice shared their trouble, her face told no story. It was like the
                  face,of a saint on a cathedral window. Once, however, as she came suddenly upon
                  the two men and overheard words that seemed to burn like fire on the lip of the
                  speaker, her eyes grew luminous for an instant. Then she passed on, her face as
                  immobile as before in its setting of wavy gold hair.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"Entre or et roux Dieu fit ses longs cheveux."</p>
               </q>
               <p>One night Émile and Anglice were missing. They had flown,—but whither, nobody
                  knew, and nobody, save Antoine, cared. It was a heavy blow to Antoine,—for he had
                  himself half<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC5554-00000134"/> resolved to confess his
                  love to Anglice and urge her to fly with him.</p>
               <p>A strip of paper slipped from a volume of Antoine's prie-dieu, and fluttered to
                  his feet.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Do not be angry</emph>," said the bit of paper, piteously; "<emph>forgive
                     us, for we love.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Three years went by wearily enough, Antoine had entered the Church;, and was
                  already looked upon as a rising man but his face was pale and his heart leaden,
                  for there was no sweetness in life for him.</p>
               <p>Four years bad elapsed, when a letter, covered with outlandish postmarks, was
                  brought to the young priest,—a letter from Anglice. She was dying;—would he
                  forgive her? Émile, the year previous had fallen a victim to the fever that raged
                  on the island; and their child, Anglice, was likely to follow him. In pitiful
                  terms she begged Antoine to take charge of the child until she was old enough to
                  enter the convent of the Sacré-Cœur. The epistle was finished hastily by another
                  hand, informing Antoine of Madame Jardin's death; it also told him that Anglice
                  had been placed on board a vessel shortly to leave the island for some Western
                  port.</p>
               <p>The letter, delayed by storm and shipwreck, was hardly read and wept over when
                  little Anglice arrived.</p>
               <p>On beholding her, Antoine uttered a cry of joy and surprise,—she was so like the
                  woman he had worshipped.</p>
               <p>The passion that had been crowded down in his heart broke out and lavished its
                  richness this child, who was to him not only the Anglice of years ago, but his
                  friend Émile Jardin also.</p>
               <p>Anglice possessed the wild, strange beauty of her mother,—the bending, willowy
                  form, the rich tint of skin, the large tropical eyes, that had almost made
                  Antoine's sacred robes a mockery to him.</p>
               <p>For a month or two Anglice was wildly unhappy in her new home. She talked
                  continually of the bright country where she was born, the fruits and flowers and
                  blue skies, the tall, fan-like trees, and the streams that went murmuring through
                  them to the sea. Antoine could not pacify her.</p>
               <p>By and by she ceased to weep, and went about the cottage in a weary, disconsolate
                  way that cut Antoine to the heart. A long-tailed paroquet, which she had brought
                  with her in the ship,<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC5554-00000135"/> walked solemnly
                  behind her from room to room, mutely pining, it seemed, for those heavy orient
                  airs that used to ruffle its brilliant plumage.</p>
               <p>Before the year ended, he noticed that the ruddy tinge had faded from her cheek,
                  that her eyes had grown languid, and her slight figure more willowy than ever.</p>
               <p>A physician was consulted. He could discover nothing wrong with the child, except
                  this fading and drooping. He failed to account for that. It was some vague disease
                  of the mind, he said, beyond his skill.</p>
               <p>So Anglice faded day after day. She seldom left the room now. At last Antoine
                  could not shut out the fact that the child was passing away. He had learned to
                  love her so!</p>
               <p>"Dear heart," he said once, "what is 't ails thee?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, mon père," for so she called him.</p>
               <p>The winter passed, the balmy spring had come with its magnolia blooms and orange
                  blossoms, and Anglice seemed to revive. In her small bamboo chair, on the porch,
                  she swayed to and fro in the fragrant breeze, with a peculiar undulating motion,
                  like a graceful tree.</p>
               <p>At times something seemed to weigh upon her mind. Antoine observed it, and waited.
                  At length she spoke.</p>
               <p>"Near our house," said little Anglice,—"near our house, on the island, the
                  palm-trees are waving under the blue sky. O how beautiful! I seem to lie beneath
                  them all day long. I am very, very happy. I yearned for them so much that I grew
                  sick,—don't you think it was so, mon père?</p>
               <p>"Hélas, yes!" exclaimed Antoine, suddenly. "Let us hasten to those pleasant
                  islands where the palms are waving."</p>
               <p>Anglice smiled.</p>
               <p>"I am going there, mon père."</p>
               <p>A week from that evening the wax candles burned at her feet and forehead, lighting
                  her on the journey.</p>
               <p>All was over. Now was Antoine's heart empty. Death, like another Émile, had stolen
                  his new Anglice. He had nothing to do but to lay the blighted flower away.</p>
               <p>Père Antoine made a shallow grave in his garden, and heaped the fresh brown mould
                  over his idol.</p>
               <pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC5554-00000136"/>
               <p>In the tranquil spring evenings, the priest was seen sitting by the mound, his
                  finger closed in the unread breviary.</p>
               <p>The Summer broke on that sunny land; and in the cool morning twilight, and after
                  nightfall, Antoine lingered by the grave. He could never be with it enough.</p>
               <p>One morning he observed a delicate stem, with two curiously shaped emerald leaves,
                  springing up from the centre of the mound. At first he merely noticed it casually;
                  but at length the plant grew so tall, and was so strangely unlike anything he had
                  ever seen before, that he examined it with care.</p>
               <p>How straight and graceful and exquisite it was! When it swung to and fro with the
                  summer winds in the twilight, it seemed to Antoine as if little Anglice were
                  standing there in the garden.</p>
               <p>The days stole by, and Antoine tended the fragile shoot, wondering what manner of
                  blossom it would unfold, white, or scarlet, or golden. One Sunday, a stranger,
                  with a bronzed, weather-beaten face like a sailor's, leaned over the garden rail,
                  and said to him, "What a fine young date-palm you have there, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Mon Dieu!" cried Père Antoine, "and is it a palm?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed," returned the man. "I did n't reckon the tree would flourish in this
                  latitude."</p>
               <p>"Ah, mon Dieu!" was all the priest could say aloud; but he murmured to himself,
                  "C'est le bon Dieu qui m'a donné cela."</p>
               <p>If Père Antoine loved the tree before, he worshipped it now. he watered it, and
                  nurtured it, and could have clasped it in his arms. Here were Émile and Anglice
                  and the child, all in one!</p>
               <p>The years glided away, and the date-palm and the priest grew together,—only one
                  became vigorous and the other feeble. Père Antoine had long passed the meridian of
                  life. The tree was in its youth. It no longer stood in an isolated garden; for
                  pretentious brick and stucco houses had clustered about Antoine's cottage. They
                  looked down scowling on the humble thatched roof. The city was edging up, trying
                  to crowd him off his land. But he clung to it like lichen and refused to sell.</p>
               <p>Speculators piled gold on his doorsteps, and he laughed at them. Sometimes he was
                     hungry,<pb n="272" xml:id="VAC5554-00000137"/> and cold, and thinly clad; but
                  he laughed none the less.</p>
               <p>"Get thee behind me, Satan!" said the old priest's smile.</p>
               <p>Père Antoine was very old now, scarcely able to walk; but he could sit under the
                  pliant, caressing leaves of his palm, loving it like an Arab; and there he sat
                  till the grimmest of speculators came to him. But even in death Père Antoine was
                  faithful to his trust.</p>
               <p>The owner of that land loses it, if he harm the date-tree.</p>
               <p>And there it stands in the narrow, dingy street, a beautiful, dreamy stranger, an
                  exquisite foreign lady whose grace is a joy to the eye, the incense of whose
                  breath makes the air enamoured. May the hand wither that touches her ungently!</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>"Because it grew from the heart of little Anglice,"</emph> said Miss
                  Blondeau, tenderly.</p>
