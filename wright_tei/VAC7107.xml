Do not decide to purchase this book, except of an authorized agent, before reading this page; otherwise you will, by buying it, unintentionally encourage a fraud habitually practised by dis- honest agents and others upon the publishers, who purpose to have the work introduced only by the Strict Subscription Method, viz.: sold by regular canvassers upon orders from bona fide sub- scribers, and none others. As both agents and publishers are under binding written obligations so to sell it, and in no other way, it necessarily follows that if it is sold in a bookstore, or other- wise than by the above method, there must be a deliberate breach of faith on the part of some party both legally and morally bound to the contrary; hence if the reader, after understandingly pe- rusing this, purchases the volume in any other way than that designed by us for bringing it before the public, or if a bookseller, now informed of this fact, buys and sells it, he or she (unless the book is a second-hand one) knowingly does that which encourages unprincipled parties, in their greed for gain, to betray the trust reposed in them, and deliberately to violate their explicit written agreement. If persons who wish to procure a copy of the book will inform us, we will request an agent to call upon them and supply it. We earnestly desire you to read the Appendix, and learn more particularly our reasons for inserting this page. I. N. RICHARDSON &amp; CO., No. 68 CORNIIILL, BOSTON, MASS.

The press per. petooally groans with a burden uv literatoor, and is bein per- petooally delivered, sometimes to the advantage uv the world, and sometimes vicy versy. I spose, ef I hed consulted the literary men uv this country (wich I didn't), they wood hev sed to me, "Don't publish this book; there's reely no okka- shun for it 1"There isn't? Did the capchus adviser see tile stateuv my pants? Did he observe the wreckt condishun of my boots? Is he aware that I am in arrears for board? Not publish my book! Kin I so far forget my dooty to humanity? Its publikashen will at least do ONE suffrin man good, and that's more than half uv the writers kin say. What rocks it that that one is ME? Wat posterity will say, I don't know; neither do I care. I ain't labrin for posterity; neither did' my father, else I hed bin better off. Posterity may assign me a niche in the temple uv massive intelled, or may not; it's all one to the sub- scriber. I woodn't give a ten-cent postal currency for wat the next generashen will do for me. It's this generashon I'm goin for. So much for Buckinham  I didn't put these thots uv mine upon paper for amoozemont. twelve years, and the standard-bearers, the captins uv fifties and hundreds, the leaders uv the hosts, hev hed a ruther rough time uv it.

When that gileless patriot, Jeems Bookannon, retired to private life, regretted by all who held office under him, Dimocracy felt that she wuz entrin upon a period uv darknis and gloom. The effort our Suthern breth- rin made for their rites, rendered the position uv us Northern Dimocrats eggstremely precarious. We coodent go back on our friends South, for, knowin that peace must come, and that when it did come we wood hev to, ez in the olden time, look to them for support and maintenance, it behooved us to keep on their good side. This wood hev bin easy enuff, but alars! there were laws agin treason, and two thirds uv the misguided people North hed got into a way uv thinkin that the Dirnocrasy South had committed that crime, and they intimated that ef we overstepped the line that divides loyalty from treason by so much ez the millionth part uv a hair, they'd make us suffer; wich they did religiously. I, alone, hev suffered enuff for several families uv martyrs. But I anticipate. Twict doorin the fratrisidle struggle wich drencht this happy land in goar, I wuz drafted into a service I detested- twict I wuz torn from the buzzum uv my family, wich I wuz gittin along well enbugh, even ef the wife uv my buzzum wood occasionally git obstinit, and refooze to give me sich washin money ez wuz nessary to my existence, preferrin to squander it upon bread and clothes for the children, - tvict, I say, I wuz pulled into the servis, and twict I wuz forced to desert to the Dimocrisy uv the South, rather than fite agin em. When, finally, the thumb uv my left hand wuz acksidentally shot off, owin to my foot becomin entangled into the lock uv my gun, wichl thumb wuz also accidentally across the muzzle thereof, and I wuz no longer liable to military dooty, and cood bid Provost Marshels defiance, I only steered clear uv Scylla to go bumpin onto Charybdis. I coodent let Dimocrisy alone, and the eggins--the ridin upon rails--the takin uv the   "-:                PR EFTS.           9 oath--but why shood I harrow up the publlic buzzum? I stood it all till one nite I wuz pulled out uv bed, compelled to kneel onto my bare knees in the .cold snow, the extremity uv my under garment, wich modesty forbids me to menshun tlhe name uv it, fluttrin in a Janooary wind, and by a crowd uv laffin soljers compelled to take the oath and drink a pint uv raw, undilootid water I That feather broke the back uv the camel. The oath give me inflamashen uv the brane and the water inflamashen uv the stumicl, and for six long weeks I lay, a wreck uv my fobrmer self. Ez I arose from that bed and saw in a glass the remains uv my pensive beauty, I vowed to wage a unceasin war on the party wic4 caused sich havoc, and I hev kept my oath. I hev bin in the Apossel biznis more extensively than any man sence the time uv Paul. First I established a church uv Democrats in a little oasis I diskivered in the Ablishn State uv Ohio, to wit, at Wingert's Corners, where ther wuz four groceries, but nary church or skool-house within four miles, and whose populashen wuz unanimously Dimocratic, the grocery keepers hevin mortgages on all the land around em - but alars! I wuz forced to leeve it after the election of Linkin in 1864. Noo Jersey bein the only state North wich wuz on. squelched, to her I fled, and at Saint's Rest (wich is in Noo. Jersey) I erected another tabernacle. There I stayed, and et and drank and wuz merry, but Ablishnism pursood me thither, and in the fall uv '65 that State got ornery and cussid, and went Ablishn, and agin, like the wandrin Jew, I wuz forced to pull up, and wend my weary way to Kentucky, where, at Confedrit X Roads, I hoped to spend the few remainin years uv my life. I wuz happy and contented. Under the administrashen uv President Johnson, upon whose head bless- ins, I wuz livin in the enjoyment uv that end uv the hopes uv all Democrats, a Post Offis, with four well-regulated groceries within a stun's throw, and a distillery ornamentin the landscap3 I.  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7107-00000006"/> 10           PREFIS. only a quarter uv a mile from where I rite these lines, with the ruins uv a burnt nigger school-house within site uv my winder. I wantid nothin more. I hoped to be allowed to live there and thus forever, and that when Death should come, he wood find me at Bascom's, enjoyin the deliteful society uv them wicll I am proud to call my friends. But it wuz not to be so. Grant wuz elected, and per conse- quence I wuz oustid. Weary uv life and heart-sick, I startid a grosery in the 6th Ward, Noo Yorl, where I hed hopes that the Dimocricy wood rally to my support, and give me a suffi- shency uv the two prime necessities uv life, -a roof and lwhis- key. But that didn't anser. I drank up twenty-five per cent. uv my stock, and the balance wuz sold on credit to that class uv Dimocrats whose proudest boast is that they never pay a bill. He needs to be an acoot man who deals with sich. Unable to maintain myself there, I returned to Confedrit X Roads, where I am now livin, and where, probably, I shel die. It is the most sootable place for me, for here I am entirely safe. Massychoosets ideas can't penetrate us here. The aristocracy uv this seckshun bleeve in freedom uv speech, but they desire to exercise a supervision over it., that they may not be led astray. They bleeve they'r rite, and for fear they'd be forced to change their minds, whenever they git into argument with anybody, ef the individooal gits the better uv them, they to-wunst shoot him ez a disturber. Hence Massychoosits can't disturb us here; the populashen is unani- mously Democratic, and bids fair to continyoo so. It is proper to state that the papers uv which this volume is composed wuz written at various times and under various circumstances. They reflect the mind uv the author doorin the most eventful years in his history, and mark the condition uv the Dimocrisy from  week to week.  Consekently they shift from grave to gay, from lively to severe, with much alac- rity, the grate party seemin at times to be lifted onto the top   :im         '      PREFIS.  :.:!    wave uv success, and at other times bein down in the trough {    uv despondency and despair. I endoored life under Linkin, and enjoyed life under that martyred saint, Johnson. But, alas! Johnson cooden't endoor. Dimocrisy undertook to carry the President, and it broke down under the load. Then the President undertook to carry the Dimocrisy, and he broke down under that load. Both were sootable to be carried, but neither hed the strength to carry the tother. And so they lay, both at the bottom uv the ditch uv despondency, lookin helplessly at each other, but neither able to help his fellow-suffrer. They wood hev em- braced, but they hedn't strength eruff to roll together. We hed seasons uv revival. Occasionally a state eleckshun wood result in our favor, and we did succeed in capcherin Noo York. That last triumph give us life; it infused vigger into us. It operatid like a invigorator - a stiff wun - does onto the bowels uv a Kentuckian whose flask is out, and who hezn't bin neer a bar-room for thirty-six hours. It wuz strengtfhenin. But even that wuzn't permanent. The Dimocrisy uv that city hed a good thing, but their very eagernis rooined em. Their grabs were so enormous ez to attract attention, and down they went again. They killed the goose that laid the golden egg. Hed the Dimocratic managels stolen litely, - that is, hed they taken ten years to hev made theirselves million. aires instid -uv five,- they wood to-day hev bin in power, and the Democrisy hev hed a nucleus around wich to rally. But sich is fate. There is fiosts wherever there is flowers. I mite say more, but wherefore? Sich ez the book is, I hist it at the public. Ez the record uv twelve years uv hopes and fears, uv exaltation and depression, it may possess interest or may not- 'cordin to the style uv the reader. Whether it is well or ill received makes but little difference to me. The public will not diskiver its merits or demerits till after they hev bought the book (and paid fobr it, -for books is not like whis- '. .3  ^   &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7107-00000007"/> 12         '  PREFIS. key, sold on tick), and with the buyin uv the book my objeck is attained. They may possibly murmur, but their murmurs won't reach me, for before they kin reach the Cross Roads, with our present mail facilities, I shel hev gone hentz. Before that time my venerable biler, now weakened in spots, will hev bu-stid, and I shel hev gone to join Elder Gavitt, John Guttle, and the glorious army uv Dimocratic marters, wherever they may be. For it is not given to man to live always, for wich a Dimocrat who is too old to change may be trooly thankful. P. V. N. CONFEDRIT X ROADS (wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky), January 29, 1872.   THE Nasby Letters are now collected in a beautiful volume, and the publishers have invited me to write an Introduction. It can be only a word. Beyond the interest in these letters as another instance of a peculiar literature, - illustrated by Major Jack Downing, Sam Slick, and the genius of Hosea Biglow,--they have an historiccharacter from the part they' performed in the war with slavery, and in advancing reconstruction. Appearing with a certain regularity and enjoying an extensive circulation, they became a constant and welcome ally. Unquestionably they were among   the influences and agencies by which disloyalty in all its forms was exposed, and public opinion assured on the right side.  It is im- possible to measure their value. Against the devices of slavery and its supporters, each letter was like a speech, or one of those songs which       stir the 13 ^                         " l a   &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7107-00000008"/> "       INTRODUCTION. people. Therefore they belong to the political history of this critical period. Of publications during the war, none had such charm for Abraham Lincoln. He read every letter as it appeared, and kept them all within reach for refreshment. This strong liking illustrates his charac- ter, and will always awaken an interest in the letters. a An incident in my own relations with him shows how easily he turned from care to humor. I had occasion to see President Lincoln very late in the evening of March 17th, 1865. The interview was in the familiar room known as his office, and also used for cabinet meetings. I did not take leave of him until some time after midnight, and then the business was not entirely finished. As I rose, he said, "Come to me when I open shop in the morning; I will have the order written, and you shall see it." "When do you open shop?" said I. "At nine o'clock," he replied. At the-hour named I was in the same room that I had so recently left. Very soon the President entered, stepping quickly with the promised order in his hands, which he at once read to me. It was to disapprove and annul the judgment and sentence of a court-   1             I N T R O D U C T I N IO    15 martial in a case that had excited much feeling. While I was making an abstract of the order for communication by telegraph to the anxious parties, he broke into quotation from  Nasby. Finding me less at home than himself with his favorite humorist, he said pleasantly, "I must initiate you," and then repeated with enthusiasm the message he had sent to the author: "For the genius to write these things I would gladly give up my office." Rising from his seat, he opened a desk behind, and, taking from it a pamphlet collection of the letters already published, proceeded to read from it with infinite zest, while his melancholy features grew bright. It was a delight to see him surrender so completely to the fascination. Finding that I listened, he read for more than twenty minutes, and was still proceed- ing, when it occurred to me that there must be many at the door waiting to see him on graver matters. Taking advantage of a pause, I rose, and, thanking him for the lesson of the morning, went away. Some thirty persons, including senators and representatives, were in the ante-chamber as I passed out. Though with the President much during the inter- vening time before his death, this was the last business    &#xD;<pb n="16-17 (List of Illustrations) " xml:id="VAC7107-00000009"/> 16        INTRODUCTION. I transacted with him.  A few days later he left Washington for City Point, on the James River, where he was at the surrender of Richmond.  April 6th I joined him there.  April 9th the party returned to Washington. On the evening of April 14th the bullet of an assassin tQok his life. In this simple story Abraham Lincoln introduces Nasby. CHARLES SUMNER.

AN   AUTOBIOGRAPHCAL    SKETCH. CONFEDRIT X ROADS (Wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky,)  Jan. 29, 1872. TO THE PUBLISHER: - ENCLOSED find photograff uv myself, ez you desired. To make a strikin picter, I flung myself into the attitood, and assoomed the expreshun wich mite hev bin observed onto my classikle countenance when in the act uv deliverin my justly celebrated sermon, u The wages uv Sin is .Deatlh." The $2.00 wich yoo remitted to kiver the cost uv the picter wuz, I regret to say, insuffishent. The picter cost 75 cents, and it took $1.50 worth uv Bascom's newest whisky to stiddy my nerves to the pint uv undergoin the agony uv sittin three minits in front uv the photograffer. I need not say that he is a incendiary from Massachoosets. Ez the deceased Elder Gavitt's son, Issaker hez expressed a burnin desire to possess his apparatus, it is probable that public safety will very shortly require his expulsion. But I hd my revenge - ill his pocket is none uv my postal currency. Sekoorin the pictcr, I told '::e: him I wood take it home, and ef my intimit friends, those who kaowd me, shood decide it wuz a portrait, I wood call and pay ifobr it afbre lie left the Corners. Will I do it? Will thia picter-takin Ablishnist ever more behold me? Ekko ansers.  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7107-00000019"/> 3.1        PRECOCIOUS BOYHOOD. Yoo may remit the odd twenty-five cents, either by draft on Noo York, or money order, at my resk. I wuz born in the year 1806,at - I will not say where. I hev reasons for conceelin my birthplace. I don't want to set any town in that State up in biznis. That town hez gone loonatic, and gives Ablishn majorities friteful to contemplate, and I don't want to benefit it by givin it a nashnel reputashen. I don't want to double the price uv its property--to be the means uv erectin a dozen, or sich a matter, uv fust class hotels to accommodate the crowds ez wood make pilgrimages thither to visit my birthplace. The present owner uv the house into wich I first opened my eyes onto a world uv sin, is a Ablishnist of the darkest dye, and I hev no desire to enrich him. Never, by word uv mine, shel he cut that house up into walkin sticks and buzzum pins. My boyhood wuz spent in the pursoot uv knollege and musk- rats, mostly the latter. I wuz a promisin child. My parenco wuz Democrats uv the strictest kind, my mother in partikeler. She hatid eny one that wuzI1't Dimocratic with a hatred that I never saw ekalled. When I say that she woodent borrer tea and sugar and sich uv Whig nabers, the length, and breadth, and depth of' her Dimocrisy will be understood. From sheer cussidnis I shoed hev probably hev bin a Whig, hed not a insident occurred in my boyhood days, wich satisfied me that the Dimocrisy wuz my approprit and nateral abidin- place.

Sullenly I emerged from them walls, on the evenin uv the 30th day, a changed indivijooel. Liftin my hands to heven, I vowd three vows, to-wit: 1. That I wood devote my life to the work uv redoosin the Afrikin to his normal speer. 2. That I wood adopt a perfeshn into wich I cood steel with- out bein hauled up for it. 3. That the water I hed consoomed while in doorance vile, wuz the last that wood ever find its way, undilootid, into my stumick. Hentz, I jined the Dimocrisy, and whoever eggsamines my record, will find that I hev kep my oaths  Uv my childhood, I know but little. AMy father wuz' a leadin man in the humble speer in which he moved, holdin, at different times, the various offices in the town- up to consta- ble, the successive steps bein road supervisor and pound, master. He wuz elected constable, and mite probably hev gone higher, but for an accident that occurred to him the first month. He oollected a judgment for $18, and the money wuz paid to him. The good man wuz a talented collector, but wuz singlerly careless in -payin over what he collected. Ez showin the pekoolier bent uv genuis uv the old man, I repeet a con- versashen I wunst heerd. A man who hed an account to col- lect, wuz consultin one who knowd my father well, ez to the It   esafety uv puttin a claim into his hands. "Is he a good collector?" askt the man.

"Sir!" sed the naber, " he hez the ability, but yoo'll find, when yoo try to git yoor money out uv his hands, that he lacks the response." Cood ther hev bin a more tetchin triboot? He wuz like all men uv genius, unbalanced. His ability was all on one side. The grovelin plaintiff, who didn't admire * sich erratic flites, raised a ruckshen about the paltry sum, and my father "Folded his tent like the Arabs, And ez silently stole away." From that time out, the old gentleman migrated - in fact, he lived mostly on the road. He adopted movin ez a per- feshun, and a very profitable one he made uv it. When his hoss died, the nabors, rather than not hev him move, wood chip in and raise him another. Appreshiatin the compliment they pade him, he alluz went. I menshun these pekooliarities uv my ancestor, becoz "The lives uv all grate men remind us We may make our lives sublime, 'And, departin, leave behind us -" ef our talent runs in that direckshun, ez many debts ez he did, though it does require espeshel talents. This hed its inflooence upon my yoothful mind. I saw not only a great deal uv the country, but much uv mankind, and I aqquired that adaptability to circumstances wich hez ever distinguished me. Even to this day, ef I can't git gin I take whiskey without a murmur and without repinin. t My politicks hez ever bin Dimocratic, and I may say, without egotism, I hev been a yooseful member uv that party. I voted for Jackson seven times, and for every suc- ceedin Dimocratic candidate ez many times ez possible. My Dimocrisy wuzn't partikerly confirmed until I arrived at the age uv twenty-four. My father wuz intimately acquainted with me, and knowd all my carakteristics ez well ez tho lie hed bin the friend uv my buzzum.

"Why, father uv mine?" replied 1, openin my eyes. "Becoz, my son," sed he, L she'll hev a trade wich'll support yoo, otherwise yoo'll die uv starvashen when I'm gone." I thot the idea wuz a good one. Thro woman a cuss come into the world, wich cuss wuz labor; and I wuz determined that ez woman hed bin the coz uv requirin somebody to sweat for the bread I eat, woman should do that snweatin fobr me. That nite I perposed to a milliner in the village, and she re- jectid my soot. I offered myself, in rapid succeshun, to a widder, who wuz a -washerwoman, and to a woman who lied boys old enuff to work, with the same result, when, feelin that suthin wuz nessary to be done to selroor a pervision fobr life, I married a nigger washerwoman wich didn't feel above me. Wood you blieve it? Within an hour after the ceremony wuz pronounst, she sold her persnel property, consistin uv a wash-tub and board, and a assortment uv soap, and investin the proceeds in a red calico dress and a pair uv earrings, insisted on my going to work to support her! and the township authorities not only maintained her in her loonacy, but refused to extend releef to me, on the. ground that I wuz able-bodied. Ez I left that nigger, I agin vowed to devote my life to the work of gettin uv em down to where they vood hev to support us, and that vow I hev relijusly fulfilled. I hev never felt good, ceptin when they wuz put down a peg; I hev never wept, save when they wuz bein elevated. The offices I hev held hev not been many. I hed signers to a petishun for a post-office in Jackson's time, but I killed my chances by presentin it in person. The old hero looked at me, and remarked that it wuzn't worth while throwin away post- offices on sich - that when he wanted em, he cood buy em at a dollar a dozen. Bookanan wuz qgoin to appoint me, but somehow my antecedents got to his ears, and he wuz afberd uv his respecktability; and( I never succeeded till Androo John. son returned to lis first love and embraced us.

SOUTH CARLINY and sevral other uv the trooly Dimikratic States hevin secesht-   gone orf, I may say, onto a journey after ther rites - Wingert's Corners, ez trooly Dimecratic ez any uv em, hez follered soot. A meetin wuz held last nite, uv wich I wuz chairman, to take the matter uv our grievances into consideration, and it wuz finally resolved that nothin short uv seceshn wood remedy our woes. Therefore the follerin address, wich I rit, wuz adopt- id and ordered to be publisht: TO THE WORLD I In takin a step wich may, possibly, involve the state uv wich we hev bin heretofore a part into blood and convulshuns, a decent respeck for the opinion uv the world requires us to give our reasons for takin that step. Wingert's Corners hez too long submitted to the imperious dictates uv a tyranikle goverment.   Our whole histry hez bin wun uv aggreshn on the part uv the State, and uv meek and pashent endoorence on ours. It refoosed to locate the State Capitol atithe Corners, to the great detriment uv our patriotic owners uv reel estate. In this letter the argument of the States Rights secessionists is stated rather than travestied. One of the threats relied upon by the Southern oligar- chy to awaken fears in the North was, that the trade of the South should be withdrawn from Northern merchants. "Our merchant," at Wingert's Corners, congratulating himself on the opening of "trade with the Black Swamp," and his release from his Cincinnati debts, is, or was, the exact type of many of the Southern secessionists. Southern economists really imagined that they could control the laws of trade, or create new ones to suit their own fancy; results demonstrated the fact, that the South needed credit at the North far more than Northern merchants needed Southern custom. The trade of the South was the most undesirable of any which came to our northern cities, as many Southern buyers were wont to settle their indebtedness by certificates of discharge from courts of bankruptcy. In 1860, in the absence of a general bankrupt law, the hope of many secessionists was, that a successful rebellion would give them an excuse for the repudiation of their honest debts.  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7107-00000022"/> 40        REASONS FOR SECESSION. It refoosed to gravel the streets uv the Corners, or even re- lay the plank-road. It refoosed to locate the Penitentiary at the Corners, not-with- standin we do more towards fillin it than any town in the State. It refoosed to locate the State Fair at the Corners, blastin the hopes uv our patriotic groserys. It located the canal one hundred miles from the Corners. We hev never hed a Guvner, notwithstandin the President uv this meetin hez lived here for yeers, a waitin to be urgd to accept it. It hez compelled us, yeer after yeer, to pay our share uv the taxes. It hez never appinted any citizen uv the place to any offis wher theft wuz possible, thus wilfully keepin capital away from us. It refoosed to either pay our rale-rode subscripshun or slack- water our river. Therefore, not bein in humor to longer endoor sich outrajes, we declare ourselves free and independent uv the State, and will maintain our position with arms, if need be. There wuz a lively time next day. A company uv minit men wuz raised, and wun uv two-minit men. The seceshn flag, muskrat rampant, weasel couchant, on a field d'egg-shell, waves from both groserys. Our merchant feels hopeful. Cut orf from the State, direct trade with the Black Swamp obllers: releest from his indebtedness to Cinsinati, he will agin lift his -head. Our representative hez agreed to resine--when his term expires. We are in earnest. Armed with justice and shot-guns, we bid the tyrants defiance. P. S. - The feelin is intense - the childern hev imbibed it. A lad jest past, displayin the seceshn flag. It waved from be- hind. Disdainin concealment, the noble, lion-hearted boy wore a roundabout.

What wuz the beginnin uv it? 1836, about two hundred students from Lane Seminary, near Cincinnati, who had "rebelled" against an order of that institution not to discuss the slavery question, came to Oberlin to pursue their studies. From that day Oberlin be- came a centre of anti-slavery influence. Its professors were men of reputation for learning and moral worth, and were earnestly identified with the anti-slavery cause. Theodore D. Weld and other eloquent orators of that period gave lectures to the students, and they, in turn, went out to scatter the light they had gatlered. Thus Oberlin became an object of intense and bitter hatred on the part of pro-slavery men and pro-slavery parties. At one time its charter was threatened with repeal by the Ohio legislature on account of its reformatory character. Among the more ignorant and prejudiced portion of the Demo- cratic party, an intensely bitter animosity to Oberlin, its teachers, and its stu- dents, was exhibited. The most monstrous stories of amalgamation were fab- ricated and believed in many localities. Oberlin, however, continued to unove forward in its progressive and prosperous career, and vindicated itself most tri- umphantly from all the aspersions of its adversaries. Nor was it ever overrun by negroes, as it was predicted it would be. It has never had more than five or six per cent. of colored students, though they have always received a most cordial welcome at its gates.  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7107-00000025"/> "      THE EFFECT OF OBERLIN IDEAS.

In makin this anouncement, I feel it due my Dimekratik brethrin, that I stait the reasons for takin this step. They run ez follows: 1st.- I want a offis. 2d. I need a offis. 3d. A offis wood suit me; therfore, 4th. I shood like to hev a offis. I make no boasts uv what my speshel claims are, but I hev dun the party sum servis. My fust vote I cast for tlat old Dimekrat, Androo Jackson. For him I voted twict, and I hev also voted for every Dirnekratik candidate sence. I hev fought and bled for the coz, hev voted ez often ez three times at one elekshun, and hev alluz wore mournin around my eyes for three weeks after each campane. I hev alluz rallid to the poles early in the mornin, and hev spent the entire day a bringin in the agid and infirm, and in the patryotik biznis uv knockin down the opposition voters. No man hoz drunk moro whisky than I hev for the party - none hez dun it moar will- ingly.

Ez for my services in this line, let my nose, which has trooly blossomed like the lobster, speak for itself. "Rum hez its triumphs ez the water hath, And this is wun uv em."

On the war queshun my views are ez follows: Bein a naytiv uv this Republic, and hevin livd under the Stars and Stripes, I am in favor uv maintainin the Guverment, and puttin down the rebelyun, and will aid the Guverment in doin it, in all consti- tooshnal ways. But, after a keerfill readin uv my papers, I kin find no constitooshnal warrant for half what is bein dun. I am in favor uv a war for the Union ez it used to was, and the Constitooshn ez I'd like to hev it; but a war uv subgugashen --never! Hents, I am opposed to all this military biznis. Ef a citizen uv Virginny shoots a citizen uv Ohio, let him be arrested, taken before the nearest Justis uv the Peese, and bound over to court. That's the only way to do it.

Resolved, That evry dictate uv patertism reqwires that, in the fight we hev afore us, the Dimokrasy shood present a un- broken front; and therefore, ez differenses may arize amongst us, the General Committee shel, fium time to time, inform the county committies wat the people is expectid to beleve, that we may talk alike in all parts uv the country. Resolved, That the Abolishn party, by ther denunsiashn uv President Davis, hev shown that they hev no regard for our feelins or hizn, and hev exhibited a bitterness towards our misgided Suthrin brethrin, that demonstraits their onfitness to hold eny place wer they kin hev an opportunity to injure them. Resolved, That the stait uv Massychusits is ornery and cussed. That the annimosity exhibited by her men, in the lait   WHCH IS COMPREHENSIVE.       49 fites afore Richmond, towards our misgided Suthrin brethrin, is wat mite be expektid frum a state that hez no Dimckrats, and where every body redes and rites. Resolved, That, while rebels shood be punisht, we are opposed to confisticashun er emansipashun in any shaip; becoz it isnt constooshnal; becoz the South wood be made more desprit, and moar uv em wood be killed, wich wood lessen Dimekratik majoritis in them states; and becoz it wood hev a tendency to make em madder nor they air. On the absorbin question uv nigger I am sound. I am opposed to amalgamashun, and am in favor uv prohibitin any wench from marryin any wun hevin a visable admixter uv white blud. I am ferninst allowin niggers to come into the North, and am in favor uv expellin the thirty-two milylns now here. To force em away, I wood make it a pennytenshiary offence to be shaved by a nigger, and wood regulate the price uv barberin by law, that white men mite be indoost to go into the biznis. Ez for other pints uv naslenel and stait policy, my paper dident cum last nite, and consequently I am somewhat at a loss. In county matters I shcl follow closely the footsteps uv my predecessers. I shel be keerful uv the finds, and shel apply jest ez much ez possible to the grate work uv bildin up the Dimekratik party; alluz, uv coarse, reservin enuff to buy me a moderit farm at the close uv my term. I aint partickeler ez to wat offis I hev. I am willin to servo ez Treasurer, Sheriff, Commishener, or Coroner - tho I cood do the party more good ez Treasurer than in any other posi- shen.

Can- ada, being the nearest and most accessible point beyond the jurisdiction of the government, received a number of those who fled from duty, but probably the greater part concealcd themselves among their native hills, or went to other states. It was amusing to witness the desire for travel which seized men, and the sudden inclination to visit distant relatives which sprang up. Eastern men had urgent business calling them to the west, and western men had interests at stake in the east which demanded immediate attention. In some of the hill districts there were rendezvous of these men in caves and huts, and there were instances in which some resistance was made to officers sent to arrest them. These, no doubt, endured more hardships and experienced more fear than would have resulted from serving a term in the army. But their experiences and the internal history of their flight from duty will probably never be written, as the subject is one to which they do not care to allude. One party ran away from a township in Hancock County, Ohio, swam the dangerous river at Detroit, Mich., and subsisted for months chopping cord-wood for the negroes residing in the vicinity of Windsor. They were excessively chagrined, on their return, to hear that they had taken all this risk and endured all this hardship for noth- ing, for their township, having raised its quota, was never drafted!  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7107-00000028"/> 52       THE HEGIRA OF THE INVALIDS.

Jest ez soon ez our regiment struck Suthrin sile, I made up my mind that my bondage Nwuz drawin to a close -    that I wood seeze the fhst oppertoonity uv escaplin to my natcral firnds,- the soljers uv the sunny South.    Nite before last I run the guard, wuz shot at twice (reseevin two buck-shot jest below the hind buttons uv my coat), but by eggstrordinary luck I escaped.  HHad infantry bin sent after me I shood ihev bin taken, for I am not a fast runner; but the commandant uv the post wuz new at the biznis, and innocently sent cavalry.    Be- tween the hossis they rode, and the stoppin to pick up them ez coodent stick onto thcr flyin steeds, I hbd no difficulty in outrunnin cm. At last I encounterd the pickits uv the Looisiana Pelicans, and givin myself up ez a deserter from     the hordes uv the tyrant Linkin, wuz to-wunst taken afore the kernel.     I must say, in this conneckshun, that I wuz surprised at the style uv uniform worn by the Pelicans.    It consists uv a hole in the seet uv the pants, with the tale uv the shirt a wavin gracefully therefrom.  The follerin colloquy ensood:- Deserters from the Federal army went chiefly in two directions. Tile greater part of the unwilling conscripts fled to Canada, but there were some in the earlier stages of the war wiho not only deserted, but went over to the enemy. These belonged to that class who were willing " to fight as they voted," to use a campaign phrase which obtained during the war. As the number of conscripts increased, the deserters were proportionately more frequent, but the number of those who deserted to the enemy steadily decreased as the contest proceeded, until,- during the last year of the war, this species of desertion ceased entirely. The desperate straits of the Confederates made the field uninviting, and for a year or two before the collapse of the rebellion,the condition of the rebel army was scarcely worse than that described in the text. However much some of the conscripts may have desired the success of the rebellion, and what- ever hardship they may have been willing to undergo " for principle," they were not willing to exchange a comfortable suit of blue for a cast-off suit of rebel gray, nor a certain supply of rations for the precarious and inferior subsistence furnished the Confederate armies.  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7107-00000030"/> 56      THE EPISODE OF THE UNIFORM.

"Never mind," sez the kernel, "he cant git well uv that fever; strip off his uniform and give it to Nasby, and berry him." I judgd, from the style uv the uniforms I saw on the men around me, that I wood rather keep my own, but I sed nothin. When the orderly returned with the deceest Thompson's uni- form, I groaned innardly. There wuz a pair uv pants with the seat entirely torn away, and wun leg gone below the knee, a shoe with the sole off, and the straw he had wrapped around the other foot, and a gray woolen shirt. Sez the kernel: "Don't be afeered uv me, Nasby. Put on yer uniform rite here." Reluctantly, I pulled off my new dubble-soled boots, and I wuz petrified to see the kernel kick off the slippers he wore, and pull em on. I pulled off my pants - he put em on, and so on with every article uv dress I possest, even to my warm overcoat and blankit. Sez the kernel: "' These articles, Nasby, belongs to the Guvment, to which I shel akount for them. Report yoorself to-wunst to Captin Smith."

But, wen the pantaloons wuz awl gone, wen my costoomz wuz a blanket and wun shoe, and I applide for new pants, and the quarter-master onfeelinly remarkt that my dress wuz all rite - that hereafter my costoom wuz to be adoptid ez the uniform uv the regiment - I feel that desershun iwuz no longer a crime, and I deserted. It is entirely onnessary to rekount awl I en- doored in makin my eskape. Suffice it to say, that at Colum- bus I stript the klose off uv an innebriatid solger, and made my way to Amandy Township. My old Dimekratik friends did not kno me, and ez I expected to borry money uv them, I deemed it best not to make myself known.' They were suspishus uv my bloo kote at fust, until wun uv them remarklt how I likt the serviss? To wich I answered, "Dam the serviss!" "Don't admire fitin for the nigger, eh?" "Not any," sez I. "Why not desert?" sez lie. "I hov deserted," sez I. In a instant the aspeck uv things wuz changed. A jug wuz prodoost, and they awl shook hands. Wun, more richer nor the rest, handed me a treasury. note uv $10, sayin, "You may need it." I replide that, as a general thing, I wood hev nothin to do with any paper that bore the babboon likeness uv the usurper  i and tyrent Linkin; but, under the cirkumstances, I wood en- door it until I cood get it changed into Ingeany money.

"And are yoo a deserter from a Suthrin regiment?" sez tlo benevolent old butternut who lied invested $10 in the deserter biznis. "Sartin," sez I. Seezin me by the throat, he ejackulated, "Give me my money, you  swindler!{'  And with a unanimity trooly sur- prisin, they awl yelled, "Give me my money, you swindler - you got it under false pretences." Hevin tho money safe in my pockit, I took thhese compliments with ekanimity, sidlil out and gettin away ez soon ez possible. I am disappointed in Amandy. Frum wat I hed heard, I lied supposed they were kind to deserters. I find that it makeres much difference wich side you desert from. PETROLEUBIV . NASBY. XV. ASSISTS DRAFT RESISTERS.

Wunst more the tree uv liberty is uprooted in my person; wunst more hev the unrighteous tools uv the monster Linkin seized my venerable form     and incar. Hoskinville is a small village in Noble County, Ohio, which was made the headquarters of a body of draft-resisters. Inspired with confidence that a general resistance could be made to the United States authorities in charge of the draft by means of the Knights of the Golden Circle--a secret order instituted to thlrow all possible hndrances in the way of the loyal cause-- the copperhead Democracy of the vicinity made an arnled rendezvous at this point. The movement was, of course, a miserable filure, like the greater re- bellion, of which it was a miniature.  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7107-00000034"/> "      THE HEROES OF HOSKINVILLE. ceratid it in a basteel. So many times hev I bin imprisoned fer opinion's sake, that, ef I kin get a pardner with capital, I shel go into the mnarterin biznis. But to my narrashen. When the news reechd me uv the bold stand made by the heroes uv Hoskinville in opposition to the draft, I determined to throw myself " into the deadly and imminent breech." I made my way to Hoskinville, wuz reseeved with the wildest enthoosiasm by the patriots ther assembled, and wuz to wunst placed in command uv the forces. It wuz a proud day for Nasby! Befbre me stood, leaned, and laid (akordin ez they hed emptied their canteens, wich wuz all filled with new fitin whisky), two hundred uv the brave sons uv Hoskinville, from the rich, hory- headed farmer (uv whom I promptly borrerd 80 odd dollars) to the gay and sportive yooth uv 16, all consoomd with on- quenchable arder. I drilled sech uv them ez were suffishently sober to keep their feet, nigh onto two days, amoozin ourselves, into the intervals with passin resolooshens denouncin Linkir., and pledgin ourselves to resist even unto death. At last our scouts brot us intelligence that two companies uv bloo-coated hirelins wuz within 9 miles uv us, approachin at the rate uv wun and a half miles per hour. "Ha! shouted I, "the ! they comest! Now, men uv Hoskinville and visin- nity, show yourselves men!"Accordinly another meetin was immejitly organizd, chairman and sekretary appointid, and a resolution passed, pledgin the mee in to resist, even unto death, the proseedins to be published r all the Dimecratik papers. We adjourned, and I wuz about drawin on em up in line uv battle, and wuz instructin uv em to hold the muzzle uv the gun from, instid uv toward, theirselves when they fired, and wuz explainin to others the necessity uv puttin the powder down the barrel before the ball, and makin sich other arrangements ez a wise and prudent commander, determined to conker or die, would, when suthin like a dozen uv em ejakilates: Gineral!" Drawin myself up to my full hite, I anserd, "Wat!" "Gineral," sez one uv the oldest, "we are not advantajusly postid.

Negro riots in several of the large cities were created by circulating slanderous fabrications, charging colored people with crimes and scandals. In one city, the scum of its purlieus was excited to riotous proceedings by a false story, charging a promi- nent colored man with insulting a white girl who came to his store as a customer. The calumny was as groundless as any that malice ever invented. Yet it was only by the most resolute efforts of peaceable citizens that a general and murderous onslaught on the unoffending negro population was prevented. 5  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7107-00000035"/> "       THE ENCOURAGING RESULT. villainous contraband.

It became a serious thing though, for on the fourth day so many bed seen me, that they reely sposd the nigger invashen had commcnst, and they hunted me. I run a mile, and findin they were gainin on me, darted into the woods, washed, and come out ez the original Nasby. Lord! what an enthoosiastic meetin we had that night. Their faith in the nigger invasion hed bin shaky, but it was now firm. They had seen em. Wun had seen thirty-eight that day, uv wich number he wuz proud to say he had killed five.

AT a meetin uv the managers uv the ginoowine Dimokrasy, consistin uv the illustrious Vallandigum    and myself; it was resolved to ishoo a address to the soljers uv the Cumberland. Vallandigum, hevin iailed in the habus corpus biznis, is em- ployin his spare time in amusin of hisself in Fort Warin, wich is near Boston.  The dooty, therefor, devolves upon me. SOLJERS: Ez individooels hevin     votes, I esteem  you; ez invaders of Dimelkratil states, ez men engaged in the slawtrin uv Dimekrats by the 1000, ez bloo-coated tools uv a Abolishn despotism, I cannot smile on yodu approvinly. 1 Sum uv you wuz Dimekrats, who, witlhout contemplatin the konsekences to the party, volunteerd.

And I regret to lern that, notwithstandin we hev told you over and over that it is a Abolishn war, you laff at our sollum   warnins, and  many  uv you hev  turned Abolishnists yourselves. We   warned  you  uv the evils that wo od  naterally foller Abolishn victoris. To show you that we proffeside correctly, I call yure attenshun to the fbllerin strictly Dimekratik fact. Since the commensement uv the war, the addishn uv niggers to Northern Ohio hez bin ez follows: The chief reliance of the rebel-sympathing Democracy was in imposing falsehoods on the ignorant, and inflaming their prejudices against the negro population. They represented  that a flood of negroes from the slave plantations would inundate the farms and workshops of the North, and supplant the labor of white men; that they would establish themselves in positions of social equality with white people, even to the extent of marrying into the best and most reputable white families. In one congressional district in Indiana, a couple of wagon-loads of negroes were hired by Democratic politicians to make a journey through the several counties of the district, passing through all the' principal towns, to create the impression that-an immense irruption of negroes into the Northern States was just beginning, from which dire results were to be apprehended. In like manner incredible stories of inter-marriages between whites and blacks, in distant places always, were circulated.  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7107-00000036"/> 68        SOME POLITICAL FACTS.

And so on, ad infinytum. These niggers are workin in sitooashens you wunst okepied. The tailor shops, blacksmith shops. shoe shops, and stores is all filled with these noosencis, fiesh from Suthrin plantashens. So yoo see that while they hev seezed upon yoor labor, you are taxt by a nigger-lovin J government to support them in idlenis. But there is more facts : Number uv soljer's wives who died uv starvashen in Hancock County last week,  . . . .  .  . .  .  . .  1,253 Besides one small woman they did not count.

It is useless to multiply instances. You are exposin yoor lives and helth, just to set fiee a army uv shiitlis niggers, who wont work, and who, by takin yoor places on the farms and in the workshops, will prevent you from earnin a honest livin wen yoo git back.

Ez this work is wat my hart delites in, I organized the pious por- tion uv the Dimokrasy, that we mite do our work well and thorough.   When my gigantic intellek hez a chance, the work is shoor to be well done, and I liev the satisfaction uv  an- nouncin the complete destruction uv two churches, the drivin off uv five preachers, and the ifrightnin uv many wimin. But my mission is not alone to teat down - I bild up. The ijee segestid itself to my fertile mind, that a striklly Dimekratik church and   Sundy  skool wood not only help the  cause, but afford me an easy livin. It wuz dun, and  I am reglarly installed ez the paster uv the First Dimekratik Church uv Ohio. The fbllerin is the order uv exercises:  1. People assemble at the second tootin uv the lhorn. 2.

(The rest uv the Bible we  consider figgerative, and pay no attenslun to it watever.) In the South, and amlong the allies of slavery in the North, great use was made of the Bible in arguments to prove the righteousness of slavery. The main argument was drawn from the cursing of one of the children of Ham hy Noah, in tlhese words :- "Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren." The conclusion was, that 4the negroes were the sons of Canaan, and the southern saints were the I)ious patriarchs in whose tents he was to dwell as a servant. The duty to return fugitives from bondage to their masters was in- ferred from Paul's letter to Philemon. Churches were organized by the Democracy, in various parts of the West, on this purely Democratic basis.  &#xD;<pb n="70" xml:id="VAC7107-00000037"/> 70      THE DEMOCRATIC SUNDAY SCHOOL.           , : 3.

I then held forth from this text: "Whar hev ye laid him?" I statid that the person I referred to wuz the marterd Vallan- digum, and I, in behaff uv a outraged Dimokrasy, demanded uv the tyrant Linkin, "Wher iev yoo laid him?"    A uncpn- vertid individooal sed, "He's laid him out!" wich remark cost The notoriety obtained by Vallandighami and other active sympathizers with the rebellion, had the effect of manufacturing a host of imitators. The sure road to preferment in the Democratic party at that time was "Martyr- dom," and the pot-house politicians in Democratic localities all coveted arrests.

VALLANDIGUM,  July the 7th, 1863. 5 I PREACHED last Sunday from the text, "Break every yoke, and let the opprest go free." I went on to show that this text had no reference whatever to niggers. Niggers wuz ordained to be bondmen, from the very day Noah took a overdose uv tlhe great happyfier, and cust Canaan. But the text, like the Deklarashen uv Independense and the ever-blessid Constitoo- shn, wuz made solely for white men. It lied undoubted refer- ence to the payin uv debts. Wat heavier yoke is ther than notes? and who is more opprest than lie who pays ten per cent.?"' Burn yer notes, and let yer debtors go free," wood be a more correcter readin uv the passage. In our biznis meetin in the afternoon, the question uv the draft wuz considered. It wuz plain that the enrolement cood not be prevented. The enrolin orfisers hed managed to do it, The "sudden shifts" made by the Democracy during the second and third years of the war were exceedingly comical. They veered as the wind blew. A Federal victory made them tolerably loyal, and a Confederate success ! openly disloyal. Tle average Democrat was always in doubt as to precisely  where he stood. !/::i   TWO SETS OF RESOLUTIONS.       " and it wuz a certinty that every name atwixt 18 and 45 wuz down. And we were also satisfied that the draft cood be en- forst, and therefore it behooves us to make it ez light ez possi- ble, more espeshy ez when wun uv us is draftid, he will hev to gs, not hevin the nessary 300 dollars. It is here ez it is in all excloosively Dimekratik communities - the grocery keepers absorb all the capital. The follerin resolutions were past: WAREAS, Our naslen is involved in a horrible, fratrisidle war, the same bein unholy, and waged solely to free the nigger and enslave the white man, wich is therefore our duty to oppose the same; tlerefore, be it Resolvd, That we are in favor uv raisin our quota by vol- unteerin, and hereby urge the same. Resolvd, That we consider the employment uv niggers, ez soljers, ez not only justifiable, but highly commendable. Resolvd, That a committee be appointed to sekoor the settle- ment uv two hundred families uv niggers in this township, ex- cloosively for volunteerin purposes. The resolooshens wuz past, and the committees appointed. The very next day we heerd uv Vicksburg and Gettysburg. I to-wunst blew the horn and got my flock together, told em the news, and offerd the followin resolooshens: WAREAS, Our beloved country is involved in a bloody war against rebels and traitors-- (A old man interrupted me, sayin, "W-h-a-t?"Payin no at- tenshen, I proceeded.) And in sich a crisis the dooty uv every troo citizen is to sustain the guverment; therefore, be it Resolvd, That the Dimokrasy are, ez they alluz hev bin, in favor uv a viggerous prosekooshen uv the war. Resolvd, That our confidence in the great Vallandigum is un- abated; and, bleevin him to be the only actooal war man in Ohio, shel give him our harty support. Resolvd, That the reports uv troubles in Ohio and Ingeany is lies, got up to deseeve the people. The resolooshens wuz past, tho I hed to tell em twice to vote for em.

YISTERDY WUZ set apart by my congregashen ez a day nv fastin and humiliashen for our misforchunes at Gettysberg, and the loss uv Port Hudson and Vixburg. I ishood the follerin direxshens for the proper observance uv the fast, to-wit: 1. Nip before breakfast not to eckseed two jills. 2. For breakfust no animil food permitted, ceptin ham and eggs, beef, etc. 3. For dinner, ditto; supper same ez on other days. 4. Beer to be taken by the single glass, and pretzels to be eaten without salt on em. 5. These rules to be void in the case uv peopil over 35, and invalids, who may hev ther sustainin flooids cz usual. I preecht frum this text: "O, my sole, why art thow cast down?"I told em we wuz cast down becoz uv Meed's whip- pin Lee; becoz uv Grant's takin Vixburg, and Banks's takin Port Hudson. That's what's the matter with us. That's what hez cast a shadder over our countenansis, and changd the hue uv our noses from the brilyant crimson to the gastly bloo!

At this pint sum uv the awjence becum sleepy, and to arowse them I becum faseshus. Why, sez I, wuz the Dimokrasy, who mauld the niggers in Noo York, a most energetic and perseverin people? Becoz, anserd I, they left no stone unturned to effect their purpus. The ijeo uv interdoosin conundrums into the pulpit is originel with me. I closed by exhortin uv em to stand firm. Ef we kin elect Vallandigum, we may yet check the Fedral govment in its victorus career. With Ohio all rite bor constooshnal rites, the game uv subjoogashen wood be playd out. Let us, sod I, never falter nor faint, but press onnard to the mark uv our high callin.

He caught site uv me ez soon ez I en- tered the room, and he rusht into my arms, and droopin his head onto my heavin buzm, wept aloud. "Marterd saint " sez I, with a voice tremulous with emo- shen.

Vallandigham, a Democratic member of Congress from the Dayton district in Ohio for a year or two after the outbreak of the war, was tried by a court martial, and convicted of aiding and abetting the treason of the rebels of the South. President Lincoln modified the sentence of the court martial so as to pass Mr. V. into the hands of the rebels, wliose cause h1e was so zealous in defending in Congress and on the stump. Mr. Vallandigham was aided by the Confederate authorities in making his way to Canada, where a number of Confederate emissaries had made their headquarters, for tle pur- pose of forwarding the plans of the Confederacy, creating disaffection in the North, and gathering information to be transmitted to the JEFF DAVIS govern- &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7107-00000044"/> 82       THE TWO GREAT MEN OF THE AGE. whispered, "Jest keep in this posishn a minnit - the artist uv the Noo York Illustratid Flapdoodle is makin a sketch uv us; "  wich we did, standin locked into each other's arms, and weepin       profoosely fer 15 minits.

There was a great attempt made to excite sympathy for Vallandigham  as a martyr for the cause of political liberty and free speech. But, as Mr. Nasby admits, the attempt was a very decided and laughable failure. On the plea of suffering for free thought and free speech, he ran for Governor of Ohio in 1863, but was defeated by the largest majority that ever overwhelmed an un-  fortunate or unprincipled politician. So manifest were his traitorous purposes -\ thlat patriotic Democrats by thousands refused to vote for him, and the " long  laugh of a world's derision " followed the appeal of the "martyred Vallan- -  dighanl " for support and sympathyl.         -l S: ^t   CONVERSES WITH A BROTHER.         83 fer em, poor men woodent be allowed 'to vote, making me per- petooal guvner.

"' Certinly she canst not; but, thunder! I want to see her spread herself.' "Jest so. Our speakers is in the same fix. The outside egg in the Dimekratik nest is opposition to the war. Tother side uv the nest, 200 eggs distant, is the support uv the war. To kiver em all requires great stretchin capacity." "Troo, too troo. But we must mix it, and trust to luck.

He  went frum  this county, and wen he landid at Noo York, he cum strate to this place.  I reseeved him with open arms. "Josef," sez I, "do yoo still remane troo to the DimekratikB faith?" "Petroleum," sez he, "I do.

In 1848, however, the question of the extension of slavery into the territories acquired by conquest and treaty with Mexico; drew great numbers from the Democratic party, and developed a strong anti-slavery feeling in the Democratic party. In  that year the "Barnburner"I)emocrats of New York openly went into the "Free Soil" movement. In the West this movement became so formidable that the managers of the Democracy became convinced that they must conciliate     ' this anti-slavery element, or go into utter defeat. Accordingly at a State Con- vention in Ohio, in 1849, a resolution was passed declaring that " slavery was  an evil, and that the government should use all constitutional and proper means  to mitigate, and finally to eradicate it." Subsequently, when the southern Democracy demanded the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, a large portion of the Democracy rose in resistance to that outrageous breach of faith. All through its history the chief claim of the 1)emocracy to public confidence was  its supreme and unfaltering devotion to the "Union," against all attempts at revolution or secession. Thus on all these points it made an indelible record. Tie stern behests of the slave power compelled that party to give up, one by one, all its loud professions in favor of these principles. Those who adhered to that party were compelled to give up the Missouri Compromise for "Popu-  lar Sovereignty," and afterwards to yield "Popular Sovereignty" for the doe-  trine that the Constitution carried perforce the institution of slavery into all S the territories in which state governments had not been established, and in all  states in which it was not prohibited by positive legislation. Finally, when the  rebels struck at the "Union " itself, under the lead of Wood, Vallandigham, et al., that party practically ranged itself against the efforts of a faithful ad-  ministration to preserve the Union. Nasby's brother Joseph, who had been exiled during the period of eventful changes in the fortunes and principles of the Democracy, finds that the "Democracy" he left in Ohio, in 1849, was a     I very different thing from what he found passing under that name in 1863. -   JOSEPH'S CONCLUSION.        85 uv lokle legislashen, and shood be exclooded from the territo- ries; and -" "Stiddy," sez I; '" the Dimokrasy is in favor uv extendin it all over the territories."

We are jest now; ez a party, ingaged in the deliteful work uv splittin up the old Union into four parts, as per Vallandigum. Josef, yoor behint the age.

Against northern traitors the feeling was ' especially bitter, and when one was discovered in camp, the feeling of the sol- diers was expressed often in a style very similar to that here described.   AND ITS DISAGREEABLE RESULT.     89 "Five aces, Jimuel," sed the person who flust sed "Wat" to me. "I take the pile, coz yoo cant beet five aces; " and, sweepin the money, he remarkt to me, "Now, parson, wat did yoo say?" "I cum," sez I, "in behaff uv the outraged Vallandigum, who is a exile far away." I found that the sile uv Camp Dennyson wuz alogether too stony to maik preeching for Vallandigum and free speech very pleasant, for no sooner hed the words left my lips, than a shower uv stuns assailed me; wun, that felt ez tho it wayd a tun, prostrated me. A seriz uv outrages wuz then perpetrated, wich beggars deskripshun. I wuz peltid with offensive eggs, and rotten cabbage, and decayd pertaters; in fact, at wun time the air wuz so full uv eggs, that I might hev thot, hed I ben poetikle, that the blessid sun wuz a mammoth hen, badly dis- eased, and a layin rotten eggs a milliun a minnit. Finally, wun uv em sez, "Boys, we aint the prizners this fbller's after. Johnson's Island's wher he wants to go to find his fiends." "Yes," sed another, " and to git there yoo go by water 1" Whereupon, these fiends seezed me, and dragged me thro a hoss-troff fifteen er a hundred times. Then they pourd cole ilo over me, and wuz a goin to set it afire to dry me, ez they sed, but I broke and fled, pursood by one thousand uv these inibori- atid demons. I finally escaped, by passin myself orf ez Horris Greely on to a party uv em who stopt me. I am at present confind to my bed. PETROLEUM V.

VALLANDIGUM,  October the 14th, 1863. j   I'M sad-and sick.   My hed is a fountain uv teers, and mine eyes distil dilootid corn-joose.  My hart is lead, and my sole is pot-bellied with  greef. My lims ake with woe, my manly fborm is bowd, and my venrable lox is turned white.    O,    I Vallandigum, thou hast gone to the grave, and in the same          ,j toom is berrid all my hopes.  Adoo, vane world, adoo! I'll be       t: a -nunnery.                                 ? The fate uv the peeple uv Ohio is seeld.  Vallandigum is not  only a exile far away, but there is a cheerful prospek, wich is       X:; daily improvin, uv his continnerin in the exile biznis for an in- deffynit period uv time. A tyrannikle President hez taken our         : old habis corpusses from us, and persistently refuses to furnish       V! us new wuns; and the people, hevin acquiest by their votes, we lay bound hand and fobot.

Withthhe Re- publican ranks depleted by the enlistment into the army of vast numbers of the : members of that party, and no provision for taking the vote of soldiers in the X field, the Democracy had carried its state ticket in 1862. There was no legis- [;^ lature elected that year. This victory was claimed as evidence of a reaction against the war for the Union. The banishment of C. L. Vallandigham for    S stirring up treason, was the occasion for a strong appeal to the sympathy ofiS! the soft-souled and extremely sympathetic, and he was brought out as the can- didate of the Democracy for the office of governor. This course aroused allijS the energy of loyal men. John Brough, a Democrat of the olden time, was   I nominated as the Union Republican candidate. He was an eloquent and  forcible reasoner, and perfectly familiar with the history of the politics of the  state and of the country. He entered into the canvass with great energy, and : received strong assistance from the most eloquent and patriotic men of the  country. The legislature passed an act providing for taking the votes of sol-m diers in the field, and Brough was elected by a majority of over one hundred  thousand.                             -   AN ATTEMPT AT SUICIDE. .      91 desires to return to the buzum uv his family, and the shootin uv enrollin orfisers and tax assessors will now be considered a crime.

Presently a currier arrivd, bringin the disturbin intellygens that the -northern countis give Bruff thirty thousand, and two minnits thereafter another arrivd, statin that the suthrin countis had got loonatilk and given Bruff thirty-five thousand. With a hart-rendin and sole-tarin shreek, I fell a inannymait corps on the flore. ...  I awoke. An odor uv suthin natrcl filled the room, givin me life agin. It wuz whisky. The worthy woman at whose house I board, lhed bin rubbin the soles uv my feet with a jug, and givin me small doses uv the restorer thro a funnel. Her exershens restord me to life again. I presume the fact uv my owin six months board did not nerve her frajile arm. It wuz revrence. Despondent and weery uv life, I attempted sooiside. I mixt my licker fer a day; I red a entire number uv the Crisis; I peroozed "Cotton is Kiing," "Pulpit Pollytiks," and '(Vallan- digum's Record," but all in vane. Ez a last desprit resource, I attemptid to pizon myself by. drinkin water, but that failed me. My stumick rejected it-I vomited. I am to much prosterated to offer either advice or consola- shen to my Dimekratick friends. We air in a stait uv abgect cussitude.

I PREECHED yisterday frum the follerin text: "WHAT SHEL WE DO TO BE SAVED?" This, my brethrin, is a important inquiry. Speakin ez a  Dimekrat, who for thirty years hez never scratched a tikkit-- vewin things frum a Dimekratik stand-pint-I hev no hesita- shen in sayin that we need savin in a eminent degree. The  dark waives of fanatticism, wich wuz mere rippels in 1856,  were mountin-high in '60, and now they roll unchecked frum  Californy to Mane. One island is yet unsquelched. N0Too  Jersey yet is troo to Dimokrasy--a oasis amid the sterile  desert, a green spot by the wayside, a beekon-lite to the  shipwreckd mariner, a whisky-jug in Maine. Thank hevin for  Noo Jersey--halleloogy! I am prowd to say that I, yoor paster, wuz born in Noo Jersey; that my father sawd wood    i for the President uv the Camden and Amboy, and my mother  wuz his washerwoman. Umble wuz our lot; but wat sez the  good book?"It is better to be a door-keeper at the house uv i  Dimokrasy than a postmaster in the tents uv Ablishnism."    I But to resoom:           . Wat shel we do to be saved? This inquiry is uv pekoolyer interest jest now. Let me ask, Why do we need savin?  Dimokrasy is the pure, refind salt uv the guverment- to    C speek uv savin salt is a absurdity. Ah! my frends, wile Dimokrasy savd the guverment, the guverment savd Dimok- rasy. It wuz a strikin illustrashen uv the eternal fitness uv things. So long ez my venrable frend hed a post-orifis, he wood be wuss than a loonatik ef he did not sustane the guver-  ment that give him the post-orifis. Every thing went on, so long ez we hed the post-orifises. Wat we want just now is  votes; and how to get em is the question. Whisky used to do it; but, alas! the amount uv whisky nessary to convert a Ablishnist to Dimokrasy wood kill him afore he cood vote - they not being seasond vessels.   THE PANACEA FOR DEMOCRATIC WOES.    97 We lost control, my brethren, by bein stubborn. O! let us dodge that fatal errer. The last elecshen showd that we cood not lead the people -let the people lead us. Ef the people want war, let us be war men; ef they want peece, let us sing hosanners to peece! Ef they want war in Ohio, let Ohio Dimekrats be war men, and ef Noo York wants peece, let em be peece men. Our platform is broad enuff to accom- modate all; and on the mane question, which is post-orifis, we kin all agree - halleloogy! Hevin settled the matter uv faith, we will considder that uv works, for faith without works is uv no more use than a whisky- punch without the whisky. Ther must be no draft- the men must be razed by volunteerin. Exstrordinary indoose- ments must be held out for Abolishnists to enlist; for evry wun who goes, stands a lively chance uv troublin us no more. We must hev our voters back frum Canady. My frends, ther were enuff good Dimekrats in Canady to hev saved Ohio and Noo York. They must be hum to-wunst. We need em. We hev not suffishently improved the nigger- we neglect- ed him. Ther is two sides to the war question; but on nigger we air invulnerable. Why? yoo ask. Becoz he has no frends. The Abolishnists air afeerd to defend him, and by tacking uv him to them, we hev wun many a fite. O, bless the Lord for the nigger I He is our tower uv strength. My brethrin, we hev a big job afore us. Let us dally no longer. Think uv the consekences uv another defeet. Sech uv our Dimekratik leeders ez did not git commishns in the army air in a bad way. They can't git whisky on tick for- ever. Sum uv em hev got so low ez to be obliged to drink dilootid camfene, wich hez a bad effek upon the stumick. I tried it wunst. They must be releevd. They must hev their posishens and ther regler salaries, for without em ther stumicks is gone. Brethrin, to the breech to-wunst.

I SUBMTS A PLAN FOR THE SALVATION OF THEJ  DEMOCRATIC PARTY.  CHURCH UV ST. December the 2d, 1863.    1 I Ar not apt to change. Ez the Samist sez, "Wunst I wuz  yung, but now I am old; " but yung or old, it hez alluz bin   I the same with me. Whisky strate hez bin my bevridge, and Dimokrasy my tickit, wun and inseprable, and I hev stuck to em with a fidelity ekaled by few and surpast by none. But    ! the time lhez cum fobr a radical change, in order to save the  good old party I hev ornamented so long.  The rebelyun is played out. Our Suthern brethrin is gone    I in. To use figgerativ langidge, wich will be understood in  the circles in wichl I am accustomed to move, Linkin has made  - four already, and holds high, low, and jack. So long as ther wuz any chance for the 15 Dimelratik states to succeed, it was natrel for us to help em, for we cood easy jine with em   I agin; but cz they are past prayin for, wat is wisdom for us??t Clearly to help wipe em out. Why? In my skriptooral  reedin I wunst found a histry uv a steward who wuz about    *  losin his place. Lilke Hamlet, he soliloquizd: "Wat kin I do?  I can't work, I don't fanvcy beggin, and hev n't got the green- i bax to start a grocery." (Groceries wuz cash in Judee.) A     lucky thot emerged frum his Websterian intellek. "L I hev it," - sez he to hisself'. "I am yet steward. I will giv receets in   full to them ez owes my boss, and wen my day uv trouble     cums I'll board with em."                    i The pint is plane. While in the service uv our Suthrin masters we wuz rayther hard on our Afrikin brethrin. We     did beat em, and choak em, and did despitefully use em.     We can't count on the Sutherners no more - let us elevate the  i nigger to the place his'master okepide in the party. Like the steward aforesed, let us do good to them we was wunst hard on, that we may hev frends when we need em. Let that hory old dotard, Tawny, be assassinated, and sum wun appinted in   A RETROSPECTIVE VIEW.        99 his place, that will reverse his decision, that they hedent eny rites that wite men was bound to respeck; let Samcox and Fernandywood interdoose bills abolishin slavery in the states, and givin evry Afrilin brother a quarter .socshun uv land, a two-hoss team, a red bunnit with artifishel flowers on to it, make em  citizens, and then we'd get evry wun uv em. This wood give us the fifteen Suthrin states as in the happy days uv yore, and the 500,000 uv our cullered brethrin, now in Canady, cood be brot back to the land uv their nativity, and distributed thro Ohio and Noo York, so ez to redeem them states frum the rule uv misgided Republilkins. This plan is fesible, and pekoolyerly adapted to the Dimekratik mind, wich is flexible - very. Let it be adoptid, and wunst more will the good old party repose under the shadder uv the Trezury bildins; wunst agin will the chosen few dror regler salaries; and the nashen flourish under the blessins we lost when Bookannon, the gileless, retired to private life.

These stalwart arm hev    v:? hurled baskitfuls uv unsavry eggs at the pedlers uv polittikle  - heresy, and my skill in eggin Abolishn lecturers wunst made  j[  me justis uv the peese in my native township.

But, alas! heresies crep into our ranks, and ther wuz con-  fooshun. Van Booren bolted and beat Cass; and, notwith-  standin he repentid afterwards, the Abolishn pizon he inter-  P;;'f doost into the Dimekratik body pollytik, remaned. It broke   ?1 out in ugly sores in Ohio in 1848, in the shape uv the feendish(r Free-sile party. Then Chase and Brinkerhoff sluffed orf; and  i. jind with our anshent enemies. Jest afterward the Anti-      Nebraskyv excitement, cruppled with No-nothinism, whaled us,   i and it wuz only by sooperhooman eggsershens that we electid Bookannon. Since, it hez bin nothin but disaster. Bookannon   1 and Duglis got by the ears; Duglis refoosed to cave to his 3 Suthrin brethrin; Linkin wuz electid; war ensood; and .now   ; wat do these old eyes behold? Cass, and Ben Butler, and      Logan, and Dix, and Dickinson, and Dave Tod, strikin hands   1 with Josh Giddins and Horris Greely!

'"Men change, but principles, never," hez bin a motto uv mine for  years, and bleevin in the grate principle of the strong owning  the weak - or, in other words, slavery - I shel never cease  my efforts to make it universal. Ther bein a onreasonable   ig prejudice in the minds uv the weak uv my congregashen aginst !  bein the perpetooal servance uv them as nacher hez made to rool, I called a special meetin of my flock, to consider the i: matter. I interdoost it thus:-  By Hager, I proved that slavery was scriptooral.       4 By " cussid be Kanan," et settry, I shode concloosively that : the nigger wuz the identikle indivijjle who wuz to be the sed slave aforesed.                ' Then it wuz put to vote, and it wuz unanimusly resolvd, that Afriken slavery be interdoost amongst us. I notist, with pleasure, that the poorer the indivijjle, the more anxshus he i; seemed to own a nigger. g Opinions were then interchanged. Absolum Kitt, who is a  carpenter, and who never saved a dollar, hevin alluz hed a sick , wife and a large family of children, sed lie felt that a grate  work hed bin dun that nite. The prowd Anglo-Saxun, whom nacher intended to rool, hed bin that nite elevatid to his  normal speer. Hentzforth ther wuz no more labor for him.  Hte hed a contrak to bild a house for brother Podhammer, and he led no doubt that the brethrin who wuz blest with means,  i! wood make up a puss, and enable him to buy a nigger carpen-  P ter to do his work.  Brother Podhammer aroze. He, uv coarse, wood be glad to assist brother Kitt, but dooty to his own family required a diffrent line uv action. His idee wuz to purchis a nigger carpenter hisself, and - WHAT!" exclaimed Kitt.   WHCH ALSO FAILED.        107 Brother Podhammer resoomd. He intended to buy a nigger carpenter hisself; and bild his house. The cheef beauty uv the grate system, and the wun that makes it altogether luvly, is, that yoo kin BUY yoor labor. But," sed Kitt, "what kin I do if yoo work nigger carpenters?" "Trooly," sez Podhammer, "I know not. A carpenter kin be purchist for $1000, the interest uv wich is $60, and his keepin, say $100 more, per annum. Now, ef Brother Kitt will cum to them wages, and be modritly umble, I mite, for his sake, forego the exquisit pleasure uv hevin a nigger to flog, and still employ him." "But," sez Kitt, turnin pale, "my family wood starve on them wages. Why, I mite ez well be a nigger myself." At this pint I lifted up my voice. I exorted Brother Kitt to patience. The grate Dimekratik idee, that capital shood own labor, must be establisht. It may bare hard upon indivijjles, but wat then?  John Rogers went camly to the stake for principle. Ef Brother Kitt doth not like to accept his normal condishen to-wunst,7 he kin go to sum less favored country, wher the grate instooshon is not establislt. Brother Podger, a blacksmith, sed he supposed the rich uns wood buy a nigger blacksmith, and let him emigrate. Brother Snipes, a plasterer, made a similar observashen. Brother Punt, a bricklayer, remarkt likewise. Whereupon they all, in chorus, similarly exclaimed they'd see us d-d fust, and then they woodent. Whereupon they reconsidered the resolushen establishin slavery.

I don't alluz pay, but I  i never failed in borrerin - wich is useful. Therefore I throw myself into the breech, and demand a hearin.          I am inflexibly opposed to Micklellan's nominashen. I hev  j faith in the soundnis uv his Dimokrasy, but none watever in his ability. Look at it. He wuz placed in a posishen to help the p Dimoklrasy, but instid, he (by weaknis) well nigh rooind it.

A nominee uv the , Dimokrasy must be a man able to control other men. Is he sich? Not any.

He pulled froim his breast-pockit the familiar old bottle, and invited me to takoe hold, wicll I did, wondrin why lie wuz so pleasent to a nigger.  Alas for Dimolk- rasy! I soon found out. HE WANTED     TO IIRE AME1 to work fobr him. Ez the words. fell from his lips, I well lighll flint- ed; but my consternashen wuz redoubled wh1en he askt me if I couldn't git him three or four more kulerd men!  "Kulerd MEN!" thot I, in agony. O, wat a softnin down from the "Nigger " uv a year ago! Sadly I retraced my steps. Washing off ny disgise, I felt, fbr the first time in my life, utterly and cntirely retched. Wen Dimekrats git to callin niggers (" kulerd men," and want cm to work beside em, and drink out uv the same bottle with em, wat better air they than Ablishnists? The fucher uv the Dimolk- rasy is, indeed, dark and gloomy. We can't move the peeple ez we used to. They pay the taxis, and say they ain't so heavy after all. They hev diskivered that guverment munny isn't wuthless; they won't talk enny more about resistin the draft --on the contrary, they are raisin money to send Dimckrats into the army, wich alluz cums back rantin Ablishnists, a knockin down peace men, and forcin em to take tho oath.

( CHURCH UV THE NOO DISPENSASHUN,  February the 29th, 1864. 5  K THE ijeotic ijee uv nominatin Micklellan apperes to be gainin ground among the Dimokrasy. Whenever a party gits a goin   i::i down hill, it seems ez ef double-distilled loonacy invariably takes holt uv the engineers, instid uv the cool, calm wisdom ? nessary to histe it back into ascendency.. I object to the nominashen uv Micklellan for these reasons: 1st. We can't win with him. Who's a goin to vote for him?  ilE : The old hard-headed peace man, who objeks to drafts, won't,  , becoz, wile lie wuz in command he laid, in the swamps uv the Chickhominy, the foundashen for a purty heavy draft; besides, i': he is still drawin pay ez a ginral in this unholy croosade.  / The War Dimekrats won't, coz, ez a orfiser operatin agin the   : South, he wuz not eggsactly a Napoleon. Indeed, a ag  greeved firend uv mine from Georgy likend him unto a kickin  j shot-gun -dangerous only to them ez held it. He hasn't the  elements uv success in him, ez I kin see. He wuzn't born uv poor but honest parence; he never druv horses on the canal; he dident study rithmetic by the fire in a log-cabin; neether did he walk barefoot, in the dead uv winter, thirteen miles, to beg a Congressman to git him into West Pint. There's no precedent for his nominashen. My second reason is:  le .isi i Sii   THE PARABLE OF THE CIRCUS RIDER.    115 2d. Ef electid, he woodent be uv any yoose to me and sich ez I am. Let any Dimekrat who hez bin waitin for offis four weary yeres, look at this. Who is his frends--his neerest? Wy, Fitsjon Porter and that clan. I waz a thinkin uv it over, and I bleev it'll do ez a rool, that the court-marsheld and dismist orfisers are all Micklellan men; and, wen I lum to think uv it, I never knew a deserter that wuzn't. Uv course he'd hev to pervide for em, and wher'd be our chance? Wy, ther's enuff uv these to fill all the orfises, from Secertary uv State down to the umblest post-orifis. Agin: Spose that, ez soon ez he's electid, lie sliood conclood not to hev peace, and shood undertake to finish the war hisself. It wood be jest like him, coz he reely hez a ijee that lie's a gineral. Then the sponsibility uv his doins wood rest with the Dimokrasy, wich Hevin forbid. To think uv us bein spon- sible fobr a Peninsooler campane! Uv course, the Dimokrasy wood then hev to volunteer. Thinlk uv his leavin a hundred and twenty thousend- dejd Ditnelkrats atwixt Washinton and Richmond 1 He wuz all well enuff wen the men to be left with ther toes up wuz Ablishnists. It wood be sooiside on an onparalleld scale to trust him with that many Dimelrats. Agin I say, Heavin forbid! We want a peace man. There's no room for us anywheres else; neether kin we face two ways. 1 wunst attendid a cir- kus, and beheld with astonishment the trooly grate feets uv hossmanship and sich. Wun rider, who wuz also the moral and instructive injy-rubber man, wuz intoxicatid, and consectid he cood ride two hosses, each goin a diffrent way. Tyin his feet to the spiritid steeds, he startid em; but, alars! in a sec- ond he wuz ript in two pieces, and the arena wuz drencht with his goar. Let us take warnin by his sad fate. Our hoss is not a war-hoss -his naim is Peace, and we must hev a man upon whose garments ther is no smell uv-bood. The gentle Brite, the grate Vallandigum, the akoot Fernandywood, the elegant Samcox, any wun Luv that pecoolyer stripe will do us, and give us ground to go on. PETROLEUM V.

Robert Tooms Punt, who hez bin a studyin for the ministry with me for the past four weeks, wuz licenst and ordained. He is a youth uv much promise. He votid twict for Bookannon, and only 18 yeres old, swarin his votes in with a coolnis and ease that  I eggscitid the admirashen uv the patriarks at the biznis. I kin safely say that he hez whaled more Ablishnists, bustid more Methodist Brethrin, and other hetrodox Churches, than any  Dimekrat uv his age in the Stait. He hez a brilliant future.  '  After the usual questions wuz put to him, and satisfactorily ! ansered, the congregashen wuz dismist, and, in the presence  :! uv the elders and deacons alone, I delivered the follerin - charge. BROTHER: Hevin bin reglerly ordained, it only remains for    me to give yoo a word uv council. Yoo are a goin into the  apossel biznis at a rather unfavorable time. Man, wich is born uv woman, hez trouble for his inheritance. I've hed so much   uv it that, ef I hed it to do over agin, I woodent be born at all. The politikle heavins is orecast with portenshus clouds. The litenin uv wrath is leapin frum wun to another, whilst the i thunder, wich wuz wunst at a distance, now roars angrily in our ears. The ole ship Dimokrasy is tossin madly onto the wild waves, with nary a sale set, her seams open, the water (a furrin element to her insides) a rushin in. The stiddiest part uv her crew hev seezed the boats and abandoned her, and i. the rest uv em are a fitin for the helm. '          I In the mean time the old ship is dashin past the haven uv Success, and is headin strate for the rocks uv Destrucshen. To yoo is intrusted a part uv the work uv savin her. Let me  t entreat yoo - 1. Avoid the soljers. With them yoo hev nothin in common.    RULES FOR A DEMOCRATIC MSSIONARY.    117 They will despitefully use yoo. Wunst a party uv em made me drink a pint uv water and take the oath uv allegianse, wich outrages wuz follered by conjestion uv the bowils and inflamashen uv the brain. 2. Alluz preech agin the nigger. It's soothin to a ginooine, constooshnel, suthern-rites Dimekrat to be constantly told that ther is a race uv men meaner than he is. Besides, it's safe- the nigger hez no vote. Ef he hed, we might vary. 3. Alluz hev a marter. The stait-ritcs Dimokrasy alluz sympatlize with a man that's in basteels for sympathisin with the South, for nun uv em know how soon their turn may come. 4. Preech agin amalgamashen at leest four Sundays per month. A man uv straw that yoo set up yerself is the easiest knockt down, pertikelerly if yoo set him up with a view uv knockin uv him down. 5. Alluz diloot yoor whisky for new converts. It takes muclh to convert a Ablishnist, and ef yoo use the pure artikle, it wood kill a ordnary constooshn afbre he'd hev time to vote, wich wood be aggervatin. 6. Sarch the skripters faithfully for sich passages ez "Cussid be Kanann," "Servance, obey yoor masters," and sich. 7. Learn to read, or at least git the shape uv the letters so fixt in yoor mind that when yoo quote from a book or noose- paper, you will hold it rite side up. Eddicashen hez bin a grate help to me. 8. Learn to spell and pronounce Missenegenegenashun. It's a good word. The great leadin ijees uv our sect, wich it is yoor dooty to inculcate, is these: The nigger's a ape, Linkin a goriller, Jeff Davis a chrischen gentleman, the rebellion a struggle for rites, the soljer a bluddy tool, Benbutler a beast, et settry. Yoo are never to bleeve in Fedral victorys, but must alluz credit Confedrit successes. I woodent advise yoo to let yoor faith in the Confedrisy go so fur as to take their skrip on yer salary, neither wood I burn greenbax. I hev dun. Go, my brother.

The clouds that o'ercast our politicle horizon is broke, and rays from the sun uv success hev pierced cm, gildin the noses uv the faithful with a radiance that whisky cannot give. Honey hez cum out uv a carkis - good hez perceeded from Nazzareth. The Radikels hev nominated Fremont! Halle- loogy! They did it at Cleveland.  I never votid for Fremont. , In '56 I didn't like him-in       fact, I aboosed him.

Uv  course no Dilnokrat can vote for him, for there is a triflin difference in our principles; yet about a lhalf uv the Abolishn  party ought to do it by. all means.

We kin elect a Dimekrat! This movement puts a new face upon affairs. We needn't be pertilelerly anxshus any more for Lee's success; in fact, I bleeve it wood be better for us to hev Grant whip Lee and 'take Richmond.  For why?  Becoz. Spozn about the time the Confederasy is playd out we elect a Dimekrat, and spozn that Dimekrat lets up on em, restores ther niggers, pardons em, pays ther debts, compensates them ez hez sustained losses in the war, and penshuns ther widders, woodent they let us hev the heft uv the orfisis awhile?

If he expected any attempt on the part of the government to make a hero of himn again by further attention, he was quite disappointed, for he has remained in political obscurity ever since, notwithstanding very persistent attempts on his part to assume prominence in the Democratic party. The government felt that it had nothing to fear from him, and his former political friends felt that his weight was greater than they could ever afford to carry. When abroad as a suffering martyr in exile, he served a purpose, but his return was the last thing they wished for.  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7107-00000066"/> 124          MXED JOY.

Wat the Dimokrasy   now want is Church extension: hence this sppeal. Dimokrasy is built upon the one ijee that the nigger is a babboon.  That's our corner-stun-  knock it out, and the entire fabric tumbles. The hetrodox Churches insist that the nigger is human, and that he hez a sole to saiv and fit it fobr the skies. This doctrin, ef it pervales, knocks Dimokrasy higher than a kite. For why? Bekause: ef the nigger's human, and not a beast, wher's slavery? Ekko answers, No where. Because: the commandment sez, "Thou shalt not steal," et settry. Ef the nigger's a man, we steal wen we take his labor. Ef he's a beast, wy, then, we hev dominion over him; and may use him ez Wve do the pashent ox. The pint is plane. Tle Democratic divines - there were but few of them - took, during the first years of the war, precisely this ground in defence of the institution which had been made the corner-stone of the party.  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7107-00000067"/> 126       THE ETHOPIAN A BABOON. The Church uv the Noo Dispensashun; uv wich I am paster uv sed Church, in charge, devotes its entire intellek to con- strooin the Skripters in accordence with the Dimekratik ijee. Sum uv our brethren, who still hev Methodist and Presby- terin sooperstishuns into em, appologize for their support uv the grate instooshn, by insistin that they bring the Afrikin over to this country for the purpose uv chrischenizin iv him. Away with sich nonsence! I'll none uv it. Is it chrischen-  like to ceeze a man in his native land and bring him to a furrin shore agin his will? Agin: Ef that's evangelikle, is it proper to maik the forsibly evangelizd heathen work for his board and wun soot uv cleap close, per annum, continooally bein per- swadid to renood effort by the cat-o'-nine tales? Ther is grate gain in sichl godlinis - at least 500 per cent. Most anybody will go into the mishnary biznis on them terms. I, week ez I am, kin bare sich a cross. Besides, wen yoo've got a cargo convertid, why don't yoo send em back? Dost thou desire to convert their children? O, mizable subterfuge! Ef the pa-  I rience wuz convertid, woodent the children be? Ef that's yer ijee, what do ye sell em for? Hev yoo took a morgage onto em for expenses incurd in bringin uv em here, and hev yoo the power uv foreclosin? Bosh! Ef they're human, they hev a warranty deed for their bodies and soles, the same ez we hev. Hence, ez slavery is nessary to the Dincekrati party, we must defend it on solid ground. Therefore my Church, uv wich I am sed paster, in charge, strikes out boldly, and teaches that a nigger is a BABBOON-  a beast. Wen wild, he's anybody's property that capchers and tames him; after wich, him and his young is abslootly his, to do with as secmeth good in his site. (Blackstun.) Troo, amalgamashen, wich alluz appears to be practist wher the instooshn exists, is agin us, for wen a slave hez a man for a father, he's only half babboon. But I never seed any Dime- kratic principle that hedn't a week pint in it. We want money to establish our Church. We must send mishnaries to Northrin Illinoy, to the Western Reserve, and to Massachoositts. It takes money for our preachers to live now, for whisky is 10 cents per drink, even in the most obskoor doggerys. Men and brethrin, kum to our aid.   SEPARATION FROM THE EAST.      127 We hev no lack uv labrers in this grate vinyard. Evry yere the other Churches expel more or less uv their preachers, for irregularitis in swappin hosses, and for extreme conviviality and sich, who are willin to be reseevd into our buzm. They are ready; all we want is means to set em aflote. Remittencies uv 10 cents and upwards thankfly reseeved. I'm President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Board uv Trustees uv the Associashen.

Troo, the next blast that sweeps from the South may bring to our ears the news uv Lee's defeat, but at present writin things is favorable. Wat follers? Its plane that the Dimokrasy kin never live in peace with Noo England.

The North-west must cut off from the East, with a view uv jinin the Confedrisy. Uv course, that nashen woodeut take us with a debt on our shoulders, for they wood hIev to repoodiate it; and they are a gentlemanly style uv people, who won't do  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7107-00000068"/> 128        A GORGEOUS PROSPECT. a dirty thing ef they kin git sumbody else to do it for em, wich they hev never failed to do, sence they bought us Dimekrats up. Hence, they would require repoodiashen, wich we wood do gladly and willinly, for these reasons, to-wit:-- 1. It woodent tech many uv the faitheful, ez them holdin  greenbax and guverment bonds are almost excloosivly Ablish- nists. Therefore, it wood be a punishin uv our enemies.  2. Ez a rool, the Ablishnists wood leave the country in dis.  gust, wich is benefish in two ways: givin the Dimokrasy a clean sweep, and enablin evry indivijjle uv em to git wun uv  their farms -the only way we'll ever git erm.

Troo, we'd hev the post-orfisis; but with a Ablishin Congris to watch us, wher'd be the chances uv stealin, nessary to our support? To eloocydait. The Dimokrasy hev postponed their convcn- shun till it is ascertained how Lee vs. Grant comes out. Ef Lee whales Grant-peace platform. Ef Grant whales Lee war platform. Now the chances air that Lee will be whipt, for the tyrant Linkin hez a spite at that grate and good man. Then we're a war party, and go into the campain on the cor- ruptnis uv the Administrashen, and beat cm, and git the post- orifises. Wat then?  Wy this.

Ez a peace party, we are certin uv gettin the support uv these classis, to-wit:-- The stingy cusses, who object to payin taxis.  The cowardly cusses, who are afraid uv bein drafted.      r Every draft and every new tax adds to our ranlrs; so fast,  indeed, that ef we cood stop the Methodist, Presbyterian, Lu- theran, etc., revivals uv religion, and git whisky back to old  prices, so tlat we cood afford to use it profoosely, we cood be in good shape next fall.  By bein a war party we lose all these people, and take them out, and, in the name of Hevin, wat wood be left uv us! Peace is our best and only holt, and, onless the party takes that dodge, I shel retire, for we can't win but wunst on war, and then the responsibilities we'd hev to assoom wood be too  much for us. The Dimekratik intellek is not hefty. Ez for myself, I've no feers - I kin git along.

A bottle is applied to his nose, wich reassures him, for well he knows wher ther's whisky ther's Dimokrasy. The ifllerin dia- logue ensues:- Question. Are you a Dimekrat? Q.

Do yoo bleeve that a Ablishnist loves a nigger better'n hisself; his wife and children, his uncles and aunts, and sicl? Do yoo bleeve that this war, conseeved by John Brown and innoggeratid by A. Linkin, is bein carried on by Ablislinists for the sole purpose uv frecin the niggers and bringili uv em North, and elevatin uv em a inch or to, so ez to git em over Dimekrats?'

Therefore the incomparable Micklellan wuz not our fust choice. The fact is, the grate George wuz a war man wunst, and wuz the original inventor uv drafts, wich don't make hm ez accept- able to us ez he mite be. But ther's a excoose for him. The Dimokrasy must bare in mind that the unforchnit man hed sunk sum 85,000 Ablishnists sumwher about Richmond, and ez he knew uv the prejoodice existin agin volunteerin under him, he insistid on hevin uv em brot in by draft. It wuz all dun for the benefit uv the Dinmolkrasy, becoz: The Dimekrats drafted wood resist to run to Kanady -the Ablishnists wood go, and, halleloogy! but few uv em wood ever return. On receet uv the news I immejitly called my flock together, announst it to em, and give em the follerin brief biographical sketch uv our candidate, ez follows: George B. Micklellan wuz born uv rich but honest parence, sumwlher, in the yeer 18-. (1 love accooracy.) The nation- ality uv his parence I am not shoor uv, but from the fact that all the bitter old Know-Nothins is a supportin him, I shood think he wuz uv Irish extraction. His great pint was prompt- nis and decision uv character, wich qualities displayed them- selves at a early period. It is on record in the arkives uv the family, that he cried immejitly after lie wuz borned, and com- menced nursin within a hour. He wuz remarkable at school for the same quality. No sooner did the clock strike noon, than young George wood promptly leave the house. The fucher general wuz foreshaddered in the skill with wich lie robbed melon patches. He made reglar approaches, wicll wuz skillful, but his retreats wuz magnificent.  He cood change his base bootiful -  shiftin firom melon patches to orchards with neatnis and dispatch. Another peckooliarity uv young George shows how troo is the sayin, "The child is father uv the man." While George cood alluz very elaboritly stratejiso fended their sympathizers, but had not fought them with sufficient skill and effect to satisfy the friends of the Union; and besides, his extreme solicitudle lest the war should result in the rebels losing their human chattels, so badly impaired his patriotism that he drew few votes more tlan an actual Peace man would have done, had he b een the candidate of the Democracy.  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7107-00000072"/> 136       HS RAILROAD EXPERIENCE. hisself into a melon patch or orchard, he never stratejised his- self out with any melons or apples. He wuz edikatid at West Pint, and wuz finally made Presi- dent uv the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad. Here his decishun agin showd itself: He conseeved the bold ijee uv gravelin the road, wun mornin, at 31 minutes past 11. Wun yeer from that time he announst to the Drektors that 17 laborers and an eklal number uv wheelbarrers hed bin prokoored, and he wuz bizzy, at that time, perfectin a plan for organizin uv em. Two  months after he announced his plan perfected, and that opera- tions hed commenst on a gravel-pit. Four days uv brilliantly successful work follered, wen he announct that he wuz  obleegd to suspend operations, that five wheelbarrers wuz broke; and seven laborers hed the diarrear. He wood reorgan- ize promptly, and proceed. Reorganizin his force, and per- fectin a new plan uv approach, only occupied eight months, and the work wood hev bin commenst by this time, had not  the war broke out. The pay uv the Fedral Guvment bein  larger and more surer than the Confedracy, he relinquisht railroadin and entered the Fedral service. His military career is knowd by all uv us.

McClellan, a graduate of West Point, a martinet of some skill and proficiency, who had served in the Mexican war with some credit as a subaltern, was, by the nmnanuvring of certain Ohio Democrats, imade Major General of the Ohio forces, before the regular organization of the army by the General Government. He was rapidly pushed forward, chiefly by politicians of the party to which he belonged. President Lincoln desired to welcome into the army all patriotic and serviceable men, without distinction of party, and gave the rising officer all the credit and advantage his friends claimed for him. The Admninistration gave himn its entire confidence, and few Imen lhave ever had such splendid opportunity to gain military renown as General McClellan had. But he seemed more anxious to perpetuate slavery, and to provide for the future of the Democratic party, than to subdue the armies of tie rebellion. His period of service was one of deep and painful solicitude to the more dis- cerning and patriotic men of the country, and the patience of President Lincoln towards him was a sore trial to many of his best friends, and begat more dis- trust of his administration than anything else connected with his official course. When the time came for the )emocracy to use the " young Napoleon " tlcy had had in training for the Presidential candidacy, he was in a very poor plighlt for the race. His martial philosophy - his theory of the principles on which the war should be conducted - was fatally defective, and his military efforts in the main ineffective and disastrous. He made, therefore, only a weak and unpopular candidate, for the party which expected so much of hm. t-/  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7107-00000073"/> 138      THE IDEA OF BROTHER GUTTLE.

I dream but seldom, and wen I do, I alluz attribit it to eatin a pound or two more sassage, or drinkin a quart or two more whisky, than I really need, late at nite; and I never bleeved they wuz prophetic, becoz I don't allow that the seat uv prophecy is located in the stumick. These is my theory uv -gosts, dreams, and sich. I hed a dream last nite, wich left a imprcshn on my mind. I hed bin preparin a sermon, provin that "Servants, obey yoor masters," justified the ketchin uv niggers with dorgs, wen 1 fell asleep and dreamed. Methawt I wuz deafd, and hed laid in that stait 200 yeers, and hed awoke, and found myself agin on earth. I saw nothin pekoolyer. There wuz more railroads, and more school-houses, and into wun uv the latter I went. The school-marmnn wuz eggsaminin a class uv youngsters in history. "Who wuz the greatest and goodest men the Yoonitid Staits ever prodoost?" "George Washington and Aberham Linkin." "What did they do?" "'Washington founded the goverment, and Linkir    pre- served it." "Who wuz the wust men the country prodoost?"

What did Arnold, and Davis, and Vallandigum do?" "Arnold betrayed his country, and took up arms agin it; Davis rebelled agin his goverment, and Vallandigum helped him all he cood without gettin hisself into danger."

The Copperhead candidate sunk into obskoority after the war, and he wuz forgotten, wich wuz lucky fobr his cllildren." I notist about half the children hed on bloo ribbins; one fourth wuz drest ordinary, and the balance hed a white rag pinned to their backs. I asked the school-marm wat this    i indicated.

We next find him battlin for the Dimokrasy in the person uv Martin Van Buren. At that elecshun he votid twice, and drunk 1" times. Ez he repeatedly remarkt to me, that day wuz a tryin one. The first hutndred drinks wuz nateral--the balance wuz excess; but he hed pledged his township for a certain major- ity, the candidates hed given him the money to treat with, and lie wuz determined to do it ef it cost him a attack uv delirium tremens. He wuz alluz ready to sacrifice liis bowels fobr the cause. He managed to survive Harrison's elecshun, and wuz active in procurin Polk's triumph. He mourned doorin Fillmore's rane, and rejoist with exceedin grate joy doorin Peerse and Bookannon's. In 1860 he didn't vote for nobody. Ite knowd Duglis wuz a Dimekrat, and so wuz Breclkinridge. He attendid meetins uv both factions, and hoorayd vigerusly for both, but, unforchnitly, the committy who hed furnislit him ticlkets for years wuz divided - one half for Duglis and tother fr Breclkinridge. HHe coodent decide wich wuz the real Dimekratik tickit, and so, on  elecshun day, he went to the poles, and went thro the moshuns uv votin with a piece uv blank paper. But lie hod no doubts ez to opposin Linkin-he knowd he wuz no Dimelkrat, for both committymen told him so. O, with  i what joy he heerd the news uv the firin on Fort Sumter! With what eckstasy he heerd uv Bull Run I No man in the North exhibitid more ability in swearin at Linkin --no one cood retail to better advantage the lies the centrel committy decidid to cirkelait. Brother Punt growd low-sperited at the battle uv Stone   i?; River, and kept failin ez Linkin's dorgs advanced. He britened up a little when Forest killed the niggers at Fort Piller; but Slheridan and the Indiana eleckshuns protrastid him fearfithy, and he becum so redoost that his likker hed to be fed to him with a spoon. Brother Punt wuz a consistent member uv the Church uv the Noo Dispensashun. Before jinin my flock, it wuz his boast that he hed never bin inside a meetin-house. Therefore he rejoist at the oppertoonity uv hearin a pure gospel, into wich,   THE LAST WORDS OF A DEMOCRAT.     147 ef the nigger wuz interdoost at all, he wuz put in and held up hand-cuflt, wich is alluz refreshin to the troo Dimekratik mind. He dispisd Ablishn preachin. Brother Punt's Dimolkrasy wuz uv a broad, comperlensive charicter. He follered the party. Opposed to Stait's rites and secession under Jaxon, he wuz in favor uv both in 1864. Opposed to slavery-extension iin '48, he favored it in '60, and so on. The immejit coz uv his death wuz this tyranikle Administrashen. Whisky hed got so high that he wuz forst to diloot it, and at his age he coodent stan it. He died uv water on the stumick. I wuz with him in his last moments. His mind wandered, and he talked uv goin wher he'd finally hev a post-orfis. The doctor, who wuz a Ablishnist, unfeelinly remarkt, that ef ther wuz mails in the country he wuz goin to, it wood be nessary to hev fire-proof mail bags.

Sherman rode it into Savannor tother day. The harder the work yoo do for the devil, the more death yoo git for wages. We labored faithfully in the service uv slavery. We dismist our conshlenses, went back on our record, swore black wuz white, and vicy versy, even goin so fur ez to go into two wars to perpetuate it. What is the result? Linkin hez abolisht it by proclamation. His lblood-coated hirelins hev abolisht it, nigogers and all, wherever they hev gone, and they hev made sum rather extensive toors. And, finally, the Confederasy, wich wuz institcoted to preserve it, is purposin to throw it overboard ez the price uv recognishen, and this they do without stoppin to enquire wat is to belkum uv us Northern Dimekrats, who hev tied ourselves to it.

But there wuz really no cause for teers. The triumphs the Ablishnists hed gained wuz no advantages. Charleston lied fallen, it wuz troo. While I regretted the hard necessity, I wuz trooly glad uv it. The feelings uv them people hod bin hurt, no doubt. But wat uv that? It wuz easier to let go uv Charleston than to hold on to it. They coodent hold that city any more than they cood Atlanty and Savanner, and, therefore, strategy required its surrender. The good uv the Confedrisy required that they should leave, and O, my bretlhren, with wat alacrity they obeyed the call. They may find it necessary to resine Richmond. Shel me therefore be cast down?

Troo, he made cold- blooded war, in the most fiendish manner, on the brave men uv The northern secessionists had, from the beginning, represented President Lincoln as worse than a brute. The leading men of the party were in a pe- culiar situation at his death. The loyal people compelled them to conceal tile satisfaction they felt at his tragical taking off. Like the Parson, they "wept profusely the moment they saw a squad of returned soldiers coming round the corner."   171  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7107-00000091"/> 172      r  AND ITS EFFECT. the South, who wuz only assertin the heaven-born rite uv roolin theirselves.

Troo, he kept into offlis jist sich men ez wood sekund him in his hell-begotten skeems, and dismist every man who refused to becumr ez de- praved ez he wuz. Troo, he wood read uv these scenes uv blood and carnage, and in high glee tell filthy anecdotes; like- wise wood he ride over the field uv battle, and ez the wheels uv his gorjus carriage crushed into the shuddrin earth the bodies uv the fallen braves, sing Afrikin melodies. Yet I, in common with all troo Dimekrats, weep! We weep! We wish it to be distinkly understood, we weep! Ther wuz that in him that instinktively forces us to weep over his death, and to loathe the foul assassin who so suddenly removed so much loveliness uv character. He hed ended the war uv oppression - he hed subjoogatid a free and brave people, who were strug- glin for their rites, and hed em under his feet; but I, in com- mon with all Dimekrats, mourn his death I Hed it happened in 1862, when it wood hev been uv sum use to us, we wood not be so bowed down with woe and anguish. It wood oev throwd the guverment into confusion, and proba- bly hev sekoored the independence uv the South. But, alas! the tragedy cum at the wrong time! Now, we are saddled with the damnin crime, when it will prodoose no results. The war wuz over. The game wuz up when Richmond wuz evacuated. Why kill Linkin then? For revenge? Revenge is a costly luxury- a party so near bank- rupt ez the Dimokrasy cannot afford to indulge in it. The wise man hez no sich word ez revenge in his dictionary -the fobol barters his hope for it. Didst think that Linkin's death wood help the South? Lin- kin's hand wuz velvet - Johnson's may be, to the eye, but to the feel it will be found iron. Where Linkin switched, John- son will flay. Where Linkin banished, Johnson will hang. Davis wuz shocked when he heard it - so wuz I, and, in common with all troo Dimekrats, I weep. PETROLEUM V.

L HAS A - VISION. SAINT's REST (wich is in the Stait uv Noo Jersey), 1 May the 31st, 1865.  DREAMS wuz common in the old skriptooral times, and wuz considerd ez prophetikle. I hed a dreem last nite, wich may or not mean suthin. Ef it may, Lord help the undersined, is my prayer; continooally. I dreamed I wuz dead-that, assistid by a typhus fever and two doctors, I lied busted the bonds uv mortality, and lied sored to the unknown hereafter. Up I went to the gates uv the tother world, wher I wuz confronted by Peter. "Wher yoo from?" sez he. "Noo Jersey," sez I. "Wuz yoo a good cittizen?" sez he. "I wuz a Dimekrat who never scratcht a tickit," sez I. "Hev yoo votid that tickit for the last four years, and kin yoo read??" sez he. "I hev and kin," sez I. "Then yoor place is below." sez ha. "Git." Wich I did. I met his Majesty, Satan the I., at his door, and he welcomed me corjelly. I wuz disappointed in his personal appearance.

(' Uv course, yoo hevn't," sez 1; t" we average ez good ez -" "That's not it," sez he, gazin onto me with a expreshun uv intense fondness, "that's not jist it. All but about ten or eleven from each county git out by pleadin ignorance, and idiocy, and sich. But it's all rite. I make it up by hevin a heavier force to spare to stir up the few leaders. Yoo kin read print, can't yoo?" he askt anxshusly. "I kin," sez I. "All rite," sez he.

He wuz originally opposed to seceshn." "That's my best holt. Davis wuz alluz a secesh; Benjamin  i wuz, becoz he thot it wood pay - on them I've hed a morgage ever sence they arrived at the years uv accountability. Ste- phens knowd seceshn wuz wrong--he can't pleed ignorance nor nuthin, for he warnd his people agin it, and then wuz bot up into doin it hisself for the poor privilege uv playin second fiddle to Jeff Davis, who drawd a mizrable bow hisself.

But yoo will hev plenty uv clompany. The stand yoor party took, druv thousands uv men into cussednis, wlo knowd better, and who, ef let alone, wood hev dodged me.

"But excuse me- I'll show yoo to yoor apartmence. This way, my dear sir." I objected to goin, and looked anxshusly around for a escape. Observin this, a change come o'er this polite gentleman aforo me. His eyes glistend, a sulphurus stream ishood from his mouth, his feet partid into hoofs, his fingers elongatid into claws.

SAINT'S REST (wich is in the Stait uv Noo Jersey), i June the 23d, 1865.      I THESE is the dark days uv the Dimokrasy. The misfbrchoons that befell our armies in front uv Richmond, the fall uv our capital, fbllered by the surrender uv our armies to Grant and Sherman, hez hurt us. Our leaders are either pinin in loath- some dunguns, incarseratid by the hevin-defyin, man-destroyin, tyrannical edix uv our late lamented President, or are baskin in the fiee air uv Italy and Canady. We hev no way uv keepin our voters together. Opposin the war won't do no good, for before the next elecshun the heft uv our voters will hev dis- kiverd that the war is over. The fear uv drafts may do suthin! in some parts uv Pennsylvany and Suthern Illinoy, for sum     time yit, but that can't be depended on. But we hev wun resource for a ishoo - ther will alluz be a Dimokrasy so long as ther's a nigger. Ther is a uncompromisin dislike to the nigger in the mind uv a ginooine Dimekrat. The Spanish bull-fighter, when he wants to inflame the bull to extra cavortin, waves a red flag  afore him. Wen yoo desire a Dimekrat to froth at the mouth, .     . yoo will find a black face will anser the purpose. There- fore, the nigger is, to-day, our best and only holt. Let us use him. For the guidance uv the faithful, I shel lay down a few plain  xools to be observed, in order to make the most uv the capital  we hev: 1. Alluz assert that the nigger will never be able to take  care uv hisself, but will allhiz be a public burden. He may,  possibly, give us the lie by goin to work. In sich a emergency, The Democracy of the North brought the negro more prominently forward than ever at the close of the war. The certainty that the ballot would very soon be given to tihat race, inflamed the lower strata of that party terribly, which feeling ita leading men made good use of.   "SAVE US FROM NIGGER EQUALITY."     179 the dooty uv every Dimekrat is plane. He must not be allowed to work. Associashens must be organized, pledged to neither give him employment, to work with him, to work for any one who will give him work, or patronize any wun who duz. (I wood sejest that sich uv us ez hev bin forchoonit enuff to git credit, pay a trifle on account, so ez to make our patronage worth suthin.) This course, rigidly and persistently follerd, will drive the best uv .em to stealin, and the balance to the poor-houses, provin kat we hev alluz claimed, that they are a idle and vishus race. Think, my brethren, wat a inspirin effeck our poor-houses and jails full uv niggers wood llev on the people! My sole expands ez I contemplate the deliteful vision. 2. Likewise assert that the nigger will come North, and take all the good places, throwin all our skilled mechanics out uv work by underbiddin uv em. This mite be open to two ob- jecshuns, to-wit: It crosses slitely rool the 1, and white men mite say, ef there's jist enuff labor for wat's here, why not perlibit furriners fruIn conin? I anser: It's thie biznis uv the voter to reconsile the contradicshun - he may beleeve either or both. Ez to the second objecklshun, wher is the Dimelrat wlho coodent be underbid, and stand it even 4to starvashen, of the underbiddin wuz dun by a man uv the proud Caukashen race? and wher is the Dimekrat so lost to manhood ez not to drink blood, ef the same underbiddin is dun by a nigger?  Theo starvin for work' ain't the question--it's the color uv the cause uv the starvashen that makes the difference. Nigger equality may be ,worked agin to advantage. All men, without distincshun uv sex, are fbnd uv flatsin theirselves that somebody's lower down in the scale uv humanity than they is. Ef 'twan't for niggers, what wood the Dimolkrasy do for sumbody to look down upon? It's also shoor to enlist wun style uv wimmen on our side. In times gone by, I've notist gushin virgins uv forty-five, full sixteen hands high and tough ez wire, holdin aloft banners onto wich wuz inscribd-"Save us frum Nigger Equality." Yoo see it soothed erm 'to hev a chanse uv advertisin, 1st, That they wuz frail, helplis critters; and, 2d, That, anshent and tough ez they wuz, some wun wuz still goin for em. *  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7107-00000095"/> 180   GENERAL MARION SUMPTER FITZHUGH GUSHER.

The ginooine Dimokrasy uv the North hed electid enuff members to give the South control uv Congress. In my dream I wuz seated in the gallery uv the House. A member from Noo York wuz introdoosin a bill appropriatin a sum uv money for the purpose uv erectin a monument to the memory uv the Union soljers who fell at Gettysburg: No sooner lied the fanatic red the title uv the bill, than Ginral McGoujum and Swasher, and Kernel Pelter, uv Georgy, walked    over to his seat, and with their canes beat him over the hed twenty or fifteen minits.

The events uv the past four years hev bin momenchus. The war hez ended - to a sooperfishel observer it wood seem disastrusly to yoo and us, but to him whose eagle eye kin pierce the misty fucher, gloriously. Troo, we lost the orfiscs, and hev bin for four long and weary years on steril ground, whose fruits wuz wormy and whose water wuz bitter. So the childern uv Israel wandered forty years in the wildernis, but they finally found a Canan, full uv fatnis, runnin with milk and honey, and sich. So shel we emerge into our Canan ere long. The war hez hed its uses. We hev dislivered that the Suthern Dimekrat cood be depended on to fite; yoo hev dis. kivered that the Northern Dimekrat cood be depended on to do yoor dirty work, thro thicl or thin, and we hev both diskiv- ered that the Ablishnist is no coward, and will really make  sacrifices for principle. Knowin all this, we kin work intelli- gently in the fucher. It is the dooty now uv every Suthern Dimekrat to take the oath to-wunst, and be metamorphosed into loyalty. Then we've got em.

Nigger hez to me bin a intubus   ! -- a nitemare. I never cood see why the species wuz created; never cood I understand whly they wuz put onto the face uv the earth, any more than toads or other disgustin objects. But last nite a lite bust onto me - I seed it all! I wuz low-sperited and deprest. Jeff Davis a pinin in a loathsum dungeon -  the English capitalists a mournin for their cotton-bonds, and refusin to be comforted because the Confbed- racy is not - Mrs. Surratt a. danglin in the air - military courts plenty and  habis corpusis scarce--the loosenis with wich people put ther munny into 7-30's-- the soljers returnin and goin for constooshnel Dimekrats, and the ginral demoralization uv Dimokrasy, all conspired to give me the horrors, and to add to my distress my jug wuz out! To avoid madness, I took up the Bible (I board with a justice uv the peace, who hez to keep one to swear vitnesses on), and happened to open at the 9th chapter uv  Gennesis.

I seed a lite to-wunst-I realized the importance uv the nigger. He is the connectin link in the chain uv circumstances wich led to the formashen uv the Dimekratic party. He hez kept the blessid old macheen a runnin to this day. Observe: Whisky (or wine, wich is the same thing) made Noah tight. Ham saw Noah inebriated. Noah cust Ham, wich turned him into a nigger and a servant. That the Skripters mite be fuilfilled, the childern uv Ham wuz brot to America, to be servants here. Wickid men set themselves agin the Skripters, and tried to make men uv the niggers. The Dimekratik party ariz for the purpus uv keepin the nigger down, and that deliteful biznis hez given them employ. ment for more than 30 years. Ez I shet the book I cood not help remarkin, in the words uv the sammist, "Good Lord, upon what slender threads Hang everlastin things!" Sposin Noah, instid uv plantin grapes, hed gone to practisin law, or into the grocery biznis, or buyin prodoose on commishn, or puttin up patent medicines - he woodent hev got inebri- ated; he woodent hev cust Ham; Ham woodent hev turned black; there woodent hev bin no niggers, no Ablishnists, and, consequently, no Dimekrats.

While the physik wuz a workin, he changed his mind and administerd a vomit. The pashent's stumick wuz in wat mite be called a dilemma. The physik wuz a pullin down, the vomit 'wuz a pullin up, and the poor bowels, undecided wich to foller, allowed the disease to fasten itself, when either wood hev expelled it. The pashent died, and I am happy to state that his estate wuz insolvent, and the ijeotik physician i didn't git his bill. Jest so. Dimokrasy got the stumick-ake when the war com- menst.

The oath give me imflamma-  shen uv the brain, and the water inflammashen uv the bowels, and for six weeks I lay, a ravin maniac. I'cood overlook this, for the Dimek-rat who woodent sacrifice h his aged grandmother fobr the party, is unworthy the name; but I object to nominatin them, for the follerin reasons -also: 1. 'Tain't honest. In 1862 I called the soljers "Linkin t    EIGHT REASONS.         191        purps," and the orfisers '" shoulder-strapt hirelins," and I meant it. They wuz wagin a cruel and unholy war agin Dimokrasy; they wuz redoosin our majorities in the Suthern States at the rate uv some hundreds per day, and now to nominate them, is a flop I'll never make. 2. 'Twon't pay. These fellers sold us out when they took commishns; they sold out the Ablishnists when they flopt back to us, and what guaranty hev we that they won't sell us out, the next turn uv the wheel'? Ef we cood git some decent wuns it mite do; but, good Lord! the soljer who wood do this wood be lower down than we is, wich wood bother a man. All the votes that sicllh men cood controle, we hev alluz owned in fee-simple. 3. 'Tain't justis to us original Copperheads.

When the epidemic wuz known to hev settled down to niggers alone, the Dimokrasy held a consultation, and  fcarin the race wood becum extinct, lied selected these, lied carefully secloodid, em from the world. and hed employed twenty-four uv the most eminent medical men uv the world to be with em constantly - each stayin an hour - that, in case they showed any symptoms, the proper remedies mite be to- wunst applied, afore the disease got a hold. From these two, ef the rest wuz destroyed, it wuz hoped a new stock cood be raised, that thne dangers uv negro equality mite still be kept  afore the Amerikin people.  But all to no purpose.

And Fernandy, wlo lied fobund a jackknife in the nigger's vest pocket, run it into his bowels, and fell a dead corpse across his lbody. Franklin Peerse approached and wailed thus:-- "And art thou gone, last uv the Afrikins? Cood not the avengin ministers uv death hev taken sum other race?

THE world is, and alluz liez bin, full uv delusions. A   lie, well started, vigerously stuck to, and energetically pushed, ansers jest cz well ez the trooth, and will live a long tilme. I hev lived in thisworld uv decepshun long enuff to diskiver that there is a huge diff'rence betwixt the real and     tile ideal. Tlhe war with the Rebellion gave Northern men an opportunity to rid them- selves of a great many popular delusions in regard to the "-chivalry," " hospi- tality," and " courtesy " of the slaveholding gentry. Tble visits nmade b)y our "boys in blue " dispelled many illusions created by the boasts of Southerners, and the letters of sentimental tourists, who felt compelled to write in the popular vein in order to find readers, and lhave their views credited. I  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7107-00000107"/> 202     THE EFFECT OF NOVEL READING. For instance. In my youth I wuz given to readin Cooper's novels, until, becomin infatuated with his descriptions uv the Injin stile uv livin, and the granjer uv the Injin charakter, I determined to jine a tribe, and adopt their habits. I imagined myself a noble red man uv the forest, a chasin the wild deer all the day thro the leafy wood, and sweetly sleepin at nite in a leafy bower, never wunst thinkin uv the friteful'colds I'd ketch sleepin out uv doors, and uv the terrible consekences uv a purely animal diet upon my uneducatid bowils. Filled with these ijees, I made my way to the nearest reser- vation, and the first noble red man uv the forest I saw, wuz! asleep under a tree, with a bottle beside him. I awakened   ; him, and addressed him in the language uv the novels, wich I sposed wuz all he cood understand, thus: - "Why slumbereth the chief uv the Pocasokes? and why are not his feet upon the war-path? The skelp uv his father hangs in the lodge uv Skinewaugh, and his death is un- avenged! Awake!"  The noble llnjin rolled over lazily on one elbow, took a long pull at his bottle, ejackulatir, - '"Ugh! go away. White man dam fool--gimme dime -- buy Injin more rum!" and sank back into his inebriated   f slumber. Hevin seen the ginuine Injin ez he exists out uv the novels, I did not jine that tribe. I used to bleeve in Southern chivelry. Likewise did I bleeve in Robinson Crusoe, the malstrom, and Jackson's cotton- bales; but, ez I afterwards diskivered, there wuz no reality in  these, so I wuz prepared to bleeve the chivelry uv the South wuz a good part bottled moonshine. Wunst, to me, the Southerner wuz a compound uv George 1V., Chevaleer Bayard, Humbolt, and Longfellow, possessin   the deportment uv the fust, the high-grade chivelry and manly r physikle perfecshun uv the second, the learnin uv the third, and the deep poetic feelin uv the fourth. I sposed he wood introdoose his knife into the bowels uv his enemy with the fearlessness and dexterity uv Bayard, apologize with the calm grace uv George, and write his obitchuary like Longfellow, in the style uv Hiawatha.           j       W   THE REAL SOUTHERNER.       203 I bleeved his residence wuz a manshun, his common bever- age the rosiest kind uv wine, quaffed from the most costly goblets; that money with him wuz a matter uv no account; that his time wuz divided between his country, his books, and manly out-door sports.- In war, my notion uv him wuz a cross between Achilles and Wellington, I givin him the credit uv hevin the dash uv the one, the steadiness uv tother, and the heroism uv both. Sich wuz my ijee uv the Southern gentleman. Wood, O wood that this pleasin delusion hed never bin dissipated! It's the nacher, uv the Northern Dimclkrat to look up to sumbody, and I didn't like the ijee uv hevin my idol dismountid. I wuz down South doorin the war, hevin served sevral months in the Louisiana Pelicans, a Confedrit regiment, made up uv the fust families uv that State. I found that I lied bin labrin under a delusion all my life. I wuz in Virginia a while, where yoo are supposed to find the highest type uv Southern chivelrv. On a average the Virginian is as mizable a cuss ez ther is on earth. His manshun is a shamblin cabin; his rosy wine is a style uv potato whisky, so inexpressibly mean that it wood be rejected with inexpressible scorn by the most reckless and abandoned squaw; his costly goblet is a stun jug with a cob stopper, and his highest ijee uv amoosement is quarter races' and poker. Long, lank, lathy, low-browed, peak- nosed, he approaches the appearance uv the Northerner about ez closely ez a ring-tailed baboon resembles Powers' Greek Slave. In war he haint no better than in peace. He fites well enuff when put to it, but he haint no endurence. Ef he don't win from the start, his game is up. And the less he intends to do, the more he blows afbre he commences. His endless blowin about his fitin capacity and resources, afore the war, wuz wat roped us Northern Dimekrats into it, ahd indoost us to stake our politikle fucher on their success. Alass! we wuz fooled in em, and we go down with em. I never want to hear a word agin about Southern chivelry.

Troo, this never hez bin so necessary in the Dimekratik party, wlhose members hez alluz follered their leaders, without askin tile why or wherefor, withl a fidelity beautitful to behold. But people, gincrallv, are inquisitive, and wun reason why we hev never succeeded with the slavery question, is becoz we never hev yet given a good reason why the nigger shood be held in slavery. Wunst it wuz sought to be defended on the ground that the nigger wuz inferior to the white man, but it woodent do. Why? Becoz the full-blown Dimekrat thot to hisself to-wunst, "Ef the stlonger shel own the weaker - ef the intellectooally sooperior shel hold in slavery the intellectooally inferior, LORD HELP ME! Why, I might ez well go into a Ablishn township and select my master to-wunst." The same argument won't do ez to nigger equality. Why shood we say that the' nigger shan't vote, on the score nv his not bein fitted by educashen or intelligence, when the fust and chiefest qualificashen uv a strate Dimekrat is his not knowin Ilow to read? Why, to-day, in my county, ef a Dimekrat kin rite his name without runnin his tongue out, we alluz refuse to elect him a delegate in the county convenshun. It exposes him to the suspishlun uv knowin too much.   AN ETHNOLOGICAL POINT.       205 I hev quit all thlese shaller dodges, long, ago. We must hev the nigger, for jest at this time there ain't no other capital for us to run on; but he must be put on maintainable ground. I put my foot on him, on the ground uv the DIVERSITY uv THB RACES! He is not wun uv us. He is not a descendant uv Adam. Goddlemity probably made him, ez he did the ox, and the ass, and the dorg, and the babboon, but not at the same time, nor for the same purposes. He is not, in any senco uv the word, a MiAN! His color is different, the size uv his head is different, his foot is longer, and his hand is bigger. He wuz created a beast, and the fiat uv the Almity give us dominion over him, the same ez over other beasts. Does the theologian say that this doctrine undermines the Christian religion? I to-wunst reply, that that don't matter to us. Dimokrasy and religion shook hands and bid eacll other a affecshunate ffarewell, years ago. Uv whllat comparison is religion to a Dimekratik triumph? Doth the ethnologist say that the difference atwcen the Caucassian and Afriikin is no greater than atwecn the Caucas- sian and Mongolian? I anser to-wunst that lie is rite--that the Mongolian is likewise a beast; bccoz, don't yoo see, there ain't no Mongolians in this secshun uv country to disprove it. Doth the Ablishnist pint to a nigger whlo kin read and rite, and figure through to division, and in sich otler partiiulors show hisself sooperior to the majority uv Dimekrats? I alluz draw myself up to my full hite, assoom a virchusly indignant look, and exclaim, "He's nuthin but a d-d nigger, anyhow!" wich is the only effective argument we llev led fo)r ten years. Doth the besotted nigger-lover pint to the mulatto, and say, "Wllat vill yoo do with him, who is half beast and half man, wlio ,hez half a sole that is to be saved - for one ihalf uv whom Cllrist died?"' I anser at wunst, tlhat I don't deal in abstrac- shuns, an(d git out ez soon ez possible, for there is a weak pint there, that I lhevent ez yit bin able to git over. This wun weal pint is no argumellt agin my theory, for happy is the Dimekrat who kin propound a theory that hezent a score, instid uv wun, weak places in it. This doctrine ki'vers the whole ground.

Also, he can't vote; fobr wood the lowest white man consent to vote alongside uv a beast, even ef he did walk on two legs? Not any.

Remember the old man's remark: ' Why shood men club apples off uv trees, when, ef they let em alone, they will fall off themselves?' I woodent take the trouble to curn after yoo, and sich ez yoo. I often take a toor thro Jersey. It's my best harvest-ficld. I'm pleasurin" now." Reassured, I asked the old gentleman some questions as to what kind uv biznis he wuz a doin these times, et settry. He replied that biznis wuz good. The Suthern States lied bin his grate field uv labor, and when they rebelled agin thell guverment he thot he hed dead wood on them localities. His soul expanded with joy ez he saw the Churches South plunge into the seceshn biznis, and their preachers throw off the sacerdotle robes and put on butternut uniform. They never hed much religion down there, anyhow; but when they went into seceshn, they threw away that little. "Ez Linkin's hellions advanced," he sed, " my soul shrunk --only occasionally wuz 1 elevatid ez yoo Copperheds riz in the North. Finally, when Lee and Johnson surrendered, I give up all hopes.

They won't hev $2500 to pay fobr pretty octoroons; and, per conse- quence, one uv the commandments will be better observed. So I wuz lo-sperited, and conclooded that the Almity had taken that part uv the country out nv my hands." t' Iow, then," sez I, "' is it that yoo feel so well to-night?" "For two reasons," sez he. "I alluz feel at home in NToo Jersey; and besides that, things don't look so bad after all. You folks up North are doin things to soot me, and so they are South.

Ez the led uv the party I issue this appcal. The time for argument hez passed- all that now remains is ackshen! ackshen!! ackshen!!! Never before wuz tlhere sich need uv work-never wuz there so much at stake. Look around yoo. fcllow-Dimelkrats I See! Uv all the States North, only Noo Jersey remains troo to her anshent prinsipples. The dark waves uv Ablishnism are a sweepin over the land, unchecked, save by Noo Jersey. There, thank God, the arkl uv the covnant rests. There the vestal fires burn brightly. Noo Jersey lez the Dimokrasy she alluz hed - she changes not. Ever since the year before the Revolushen, she hez bin Dimek ratik. No matter wat issues wuz presented--no matter on wich side uv sed issues the Dimokrasy planted themselves, Noo ,Jersey alluz voted that ticket. Sich confidin trust in the leaders, sich Roman simplicity, is refreshin. Wood, O wood that we bed more Noo Jerseys!

Never wuz there sich a assortment uv principles to choose from. In Noo York, we hev on the track a Ginral, who sheathed his sword in the hearts uv his Suthern brethrin, and him we stood on a platform wich recognizes the death uv slavery, and feels good over it, and wich goes for payin the debt, intrest, principle, and all. In Noo Jersey we hev a Ginral on the ticket who run away from Bull Run, becoz lhe didn't approve uv the principles on wich the war wuz bein conducted, on a platform ez strikly Suthern ez the Camden and Amboy cood make it. In Ohio, our platform wuz made by the great Vallandigum, and in it is the pure expressed juice uv Dimokrasy. The great doctrine uv State Rites is avowed, and the rite uv the seceded Staits to agin secede is upheld. Here is diversity--here is pickin. Each. Dimckrat kin pick. wich set uv principles he desires, and the cheerman uv his central committy will cheerfully certify that that set will be made universal, ez soon ez a Nashnel Convenshun convenes. Look at what interests are at stake. Do yoo want to marry nigger wenches? Do yoo want y6or guslin daughters tied by indissoluble ties to disgustin buck niggers? We hev persist- ently petitioned Abolishn legislachers to pass acts preventin us from doin this foul thing, but to no avale. They hev turned a deaf ear to our entreaties, and to-day we stand exposed to all these dangers. Do yoo want a buck nigger to march up to the poles with yoo to vote? Do yoo want their children mixt with yoors in schools? Do yoo want em on juries and holdin offis in yoor township? My God! think uv it! Think uv yoor bein brot up on a charge uv petty larceny, sich ez steelin sheep or chickens, before a nigger justis uv the peace! Think uv yoor bein sued fobr a store bill that hed run ten years, afore a nigger squire! In the towns and cities, think uv bein arrested for bein drunk, by a nigger policeman, and bein arraned in thle mornin before a nigger mayor! Contemplate these picters without a shudder, ef yoo kin. These questions must be met.  They stare us in the fitce. On yoo depends the issue. The nigger is our natral enemy. A collection of Democratic State platforms of 1865 would make an amusing volume. No two were alike, save in denunciation of the negro.   RALLY! RALLY! RALLY!        2" Sum uv our best lites are in favor uv givin him the suffrage, on the ground that in a little while we wood git his votes, on the principle that we ketch all the trash naturally. My frends, be not deseeved. We hev abused the nigger so long and so persistently, that it wood 'take ages afore we cood git lim suffi- shently demoralized to act with us, and afore that time we wood all be in the silent grave, where pollitics is uv no account. On the question uv taxes, and reconstruction, and sich, I refer yoo to the platforms adopted by yoor various State Con- venshuns; yoo may depend upon each bein perfeckly sound. On these minor questions there may be difference uv opinion in localities; but, thank'fleaven, on nigger there is unanimity. "Nigger and him prostrated, " is the rallyin cry uv the Di- mokrasy, North, South, East, and West. I bleeve, in the above, I hev given a full epitome uv the principles uv the party. Wye hev a terrible fite afore us, and it behooves every Dimekrat to buckle on his armor to-wunst. Noo Jersey may be dependid on.  The fbw Ablishnists we hev hev gone so far into spellin-books and grammars, that their talk is all Greek to our voters, and so they are safe firom their contaminatin appeals. She expects every State to do its dooty. She is lonesome, and wants company.  She stretches out her hands appealinly to her sisters, and sez, in winnin tones, "Jine me!"  Will yoo not do it? Shel she appeal in vane? Forbid it, Hevinl   Rally! Rally! Rally!

Sich is the result uv labors Herculian, in the above- named States. What do the people mean? The pure Dimolkrasy, probably, will carry Noo York; but of what consolation is that to me? The two parties, the old, anshent Dimolkrasy and the Ablishn, run a race into the realms uv Radikalism, and the Dimokrasy beat them over a length. With a platform standin by Jolhnson, endorsin his anti-slavery notions, his Suthern oppression notions, llis hangin uv Mrs. Surratt, et settry, and on that platform a soljer who never votid a Dimekratik ticket in Ilis life, who ewent into the war a Radikle Ablishnist and who lknm out a Radilile Ablishnist, I don't know that I hev much to choose atween em. Last week I wuz invited into a county in Noo York, to ad- dress a Dimekratik meetin.

"Well," sez I, " wat is it?" rather angrily, for when I git warmed up and a sweatin, I don't lilke to be interruptid. "Why," sed he, " our constooshn allows a nigger who hez $250 to vote, and most uv em hev that sum, and we make it a pint to sekoor em." "They're a d-d site better off than most uv us white Dime- krats in Noo Jersey, retortid I, a droppin the nigger and goin on agin President Jolinson. "Stop," whispered the cheerman; "our platform indorses President Johnson."   AND A SUDDEN ENDING.        213 "Thunder!" remarked I, droppin President Johnson, and slidin easily into a viggerus denunciation uv the war. "Good God!" sez the cheerman, " stop! Our platform. in- dorses the war." I sed nothin this time, but commenst denouncin the debt. "Hold!" sed the cheerman; " easy- our platform backs up the debt."       - "Well, then," sed I, in a rage, " why in blazes didn't yoo send me a copy of yoor platform when yoo wanltid me to address yoo? Go to thunder, and make yoor own speeches; "  and I stallred off the platform. Time wuz wlen wun speech wood do a man all over the North. Now yoo hev to hev a diffrient wun for every State, wich makes it impossible for me to travel, for wun effort per season is enuff for me.

Don't say to ime that we redoost their majorities. What difference does it mako to a defeatid candidate, whether the majority agin him is one thousand or one hundred? A needle will kill a man ez efflct- ually ez a broadsword, ef it's stuck in the right place. So a majority uv wun is enuff. I hev known men to hold orfises four years, and hev good appetites, on a majority uv one. It's the orfises we wuz a goin fr - it's them our patriots wanted, and it's no consolation to them to say they Imissed by a small majority!

We may recover from this backset, but I hev my fbars. The people is ez stupid ez ever, and our leaders is ez acoot ez ever; but, alas! the fact that we hev failed in everytling we hev undertook, fobr four years, is gettin thro the hair uv thousands, and they look askant at us. Be it ez it may, it makes but little difference to me. A few years, and I shel go hence.

The fatal paper lay near me, explainin the cause uv the catastrophe. The kind-hearted landlord, after feelin uv my pockets and diskiverin that the contents thereof wood not pay the arrearages uv board, held a hurried consultation with his wife as to the propriety uv bringin me to; he insisting that it wuz the only chance uv gittin what wuz owin them--she insistin ef I wuz brung to I'd go on runnin up the bill, bigger and bigger, and never pay at last.

The Ginral is here on the same bizness most uv the Southern men hev in this classic city, that uv prokoorin a pardon, wich he bed prokoored, and wuz gittin ready to go home and accept the nominashen for Congress in his deestrick. The Ginral wuz gloomy. Things didn't soot him, he observed, and he wuz afeerd that the country wuz on the high road to rooin. He led bin absent from the United States suthin over four yeers, wich time lie hed spent in the Southern Confederacy. When he went out the Constooshnel Dimocrisy hed some rites wich wuz respected. On his return wat did lie see? The power in the hands uv Radikals, Ablishnism in the majority everywhere, a ex-tailor President, - a state uv'affairs disgustin in the extreme to the highly sensitive Southern mind. He had accepted a pardon only becoz he felt hisself constrained to put hisself into position to go to Congress, that the country might be reskood from its impendin peril. He shood go to Congress, and then he shood ask the despots who now hev control, whether, - 1. They spozed the South wood submit to hoomiliatin con- dislns? 2. What Androo Johnson means by dictatin to the Conven- shuns uv sovereign States? "Why," sez he, ' but a few days ago this boor hed the ashoorence to write to the Georgy Convenshun that it 'must not ' mark the term-' MUST NOT assoom the confedrit'war debt.' Is a tailor to say 'must not' to chivelrus Georgy? Good God! - where are we driftin? For one, I never will be consilliated on them terms - never! I never wuz used to that style uv talk in Dimekratic convenshuns.

The doctrine uv State Rites must be made the soopreme law uv the land, that the South may withdraw whenever they feel theirselves dissatisfied with Massachoosetts. Uv course this is a olive branch. "Jefferson Davis must be to-wunst set at liberty and Sum- ner hung, ez proof that the North is really concilliatory. On this point I am inflexible, and on the others immovable."  An old man who lied bin listenin to our talk, murmured that there wuz a parallel to this last proposislen.

The Ginral withered him with a litenin glance, and re- soomed: - "I shel, uv course, offer the North sutlin in tho way uv compensation, for the troo theory uv a Republikin Guvernment is compermise. On our part we pledge ourselves to come back, and give the North the benefit uv our comin back, so long ez Massachoosetts conducts herself accordin to our ijees  uv what is rite. But ef this ekitable adjustment is rejected,  all I hev to say then is, I shel resign, and the Government may  sink without wun effort frolm ne to save it.'i  I wuz about to give in my experience, when the old man, who wuz sittin near us, broke in agin: - "My name," sed he, " is Maginnis, and I live in Alabama.

But what I wanted to say wuz, that I spose suthin hez happened doorin the past. fbur years. I was a original secessionist. Sum years ago I led a hundred niggers, and wuz doin well with eln. But, unforchu- nitly, my brother died, and left me ez much more land, but no niggers. I wanted niggers enuff to work that land, and sposed ef cut off from the North, andc the slave-trade wuz reopened, I cood git em cheaper. Hence I seceshed. Sich men ez Genral McStinger told me the North woodent fight or I woodent hev secesht, but I did. I went out fobr wool and cum back shorn. I seceshed with 100 niggers to git 200, and alas I I find myself back into the old government, with nary a nigger. t"But all this is no excoose for talkin bald noncents. Yoo old ass," sed he, addressin Genral McStinger, " yoo talk uv wat yoo will do, and what yoo won't. Heven't yoo diskivered that yoo are whipped? Heven't yoo found out that yoo are sub- joogated? Are yoo back into the Union uv yoor own free will and akkord? Heven't yoo got a pardon in yoor pockit, which dockyment is all that saves yoor neck from stretchin hemp?

I recollect about a year since South Carliny wood never permit her soil to be pollutid by Yankee hirelins, yit Sherman mnarched all over it with a few uv em, and slacely a gun was fired at em. So too I recollect that that sed State, wich wuz agoin to whip the entire North, and wich wood, ef overpowered, submit gracefully and with dignity to annihila. - tion, and sich, wuz the first to git down on her marrow bones, and beg for peace like a dorg. Ef yoo intend this talk for the purpose uv skarin the North, beleeve me when I say that the North ain't so easy skared ez it wuz. Ef it's intendid for home consumption, consider me the people.

"Canada on its way to Mexico!" "Poor Mexico - we bewail thy fate!" Our march resembled very much that uv the childern uv Isrel. Our noses wuz the pillers uv fire by nite, and our breath the piller uv smoke by day. On our arrival to Mexico, the natives uv that country, struck probably with awe at the majestic and flamin expression uv our countenances, hastily gathered up their linen, and silver spoons, and hosses, and sich, and retreated to the mountains.

Immjneitly there wuz an uproar. Them ez coodent read swore vociferously that there wuz nothin fair about that arrangement.

A   CHANGE  OF BASE - KENTUCKY. -   A   SERMON WHCH  WAS INTERRUPTED BY A     SUBJUGATED AND SUBDUED     CONFEDERATE. CONFEDRIT X ROADS (wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky), 2 6ecelnber 9, 1865. S HERE in the great Stato uv IKentuclky, the last hope. uv Democrisy, I liev pitched my tent, and here I propose to lay these old bones when Deth, whllo ez a mortgage onto all uv us, shall see fit to fobeclose. I didn't like to leave Washinton.  I love it for its memories. There stands the Capitol where the President makes his appintnments; there is the Post Offis De- partment, where all the Postmasters is appinted. Tlere it wuz that Jaxon rooled. I hed a respect for Jaxon. I can't say I loved him, for he never used us rite. He hated the Whigs ez bad ez we did, but after we beat em and elevated him to the Presidency, the stealins didn't come in ez fast ez we expected. Never shel I forgit the compliment lie paid me. Jest after his election I presented myself afore him with my pperls, an ap- plicant for a place. He read em, and  scanned me with a critic's eye. "Can't yoo make yoose u'v sich, a man ez me?" sez I, in- quirinly. "Certinly," sez lihe; "I kin and alluz hev. It's sich ez yoo I use to beat the Whigs with, and I am continually astonished to see how much work I accomplish with sicll dirty tools. ily dear sir," sed he, pintin to the door, " when I realize how many sich cusses ez yoo there is, and how cheap they kin be bought up, I really tremble for the Republic." I  didn't get the office I wanted. Yet ez much ez I  love Washinton, I wuz forced to leave'it. I  mite hev stayed there, but the trooth is, the planks uv that city and the pavements are harder, and worse to sleep on, than those uv any other city in the United Staits.

I hed gone the rounds uv the House ez often ez it wuz safe, and one nite commenced on the Senate. Goin into Willard's, I called fbor a go uv gin, wich the gentlemanly and urbane bar keeper sot afore me, and I drank. "Put it down with the rest uv mine," sez I, with a impressive wave uv the hand. "Yoor name?" sez he. Assoomin a intellectual look, I retorted, "Do you know Charles Sumner?"                         j Here I overdid it; here vaultin ambition o'erleaped herself:. Bed I sed "Saulsbury," it mite hev ansered, but to give Sum- ner's name for a drink uv gin wuz a peece uv lunacy fob wich I can't account. I wuz ignominiously kicked into the street. Drinks obtained at the expense uv bein kicked is clheap, but I don't want em on them terms; my pride revolted, and so I emigrated. I iound here a church buildin, uv which the congregation had- bin mostly killed in bushvlwhackin expeditions, and an- nouncin myself az a constooshnel preacher from Noo Jersey, succeeded in drawin together a highly respectable awjence last Sunday. Takin for a text the passage, "The wages uv sin is death," I opened out ez follows :-  "Wat is sin? Sin, my beloved hearers, is any deviashen from yer normal condishn.

My noomerous friends here  insisted that ez I wuz growin into the seer and yaller leaf, I      : shood abandon Dimocrisy, and flote with the current. I can't.

The people uv Kentucky wuz all loyal. Doorin the horrible       ;t fratrisidle war wich hez rent the proud temple uv liberty into tw;ain, they preserved a strict nootrality. I lied a conversation with wun old patriarch, who asshoored me that he lied never taken sides.

I wuz a wanderin on the neighborin hills, a  musin onto the cussednis uv humanity ez exemplified in tle person uv the grocery keeper at the Corners, who unanimusly refbozed to give me further credit fobr corn whisky, wichl is the article they yoose in this country to pizen theirselves with. He asshoored me that he lied the utmost regard for my many virtues; but he diskivered that the one he prized the most I ,  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7107-00000126"/> 236-      THE SOCIAL SLIDING SCALE. hedn't so many uv, to wit, that uv payin for my likker. There- fore the account mite be considered closed. Then, for the fust : time in my life, I bleeved in total depravity. While musin, in a melonkoly mood, on this dark cloud wich fell across my pathway, and the fall uv the Dimocratic party, I ;- came onto a party of men borin for oil. Then the trooth flashed over me. Their operations showed me the way to success - the shoor path to triumph.                  i "When," said I to myself," when men seek gain they bore for it. They go down--never up." Even so with the Dimoc- risy. We dug downward, downward, downward, through all the strata uv society. We went thllrough the groceries; the next stratum was the most ignorant uv the furiners; then we struck the poor whites uv the South; then, below them, the   I heft uv the people uv Noo Jersey; then Southern Illinoy and Indiana; then Pike county, Alissouri; and so on. We never   ii went upward for converts, cause 'twant no use. When a man  !:!, wanted to jine us he alluz hed to come down. We got lots of ' converts. There was a regular slidin scale, which the heft uv Demo- . crats who wuznt born in the party hev slid down; to wit: -- Quarter dollar smiles. 15 cent nips. 10 cent drinks. 5 cent suclks. A flat flask conceeled. A bottle openly. Dimocrisy. We lost our hold fobr two reasons. First, the poor lilker we s hev now kills off our voters too fast.; and the tax on whisky : forced two tliirds uv our people to quit suckin, and ez soon ez ; they begun to git on their feet they jined the Ablishnists.  g Secondly, our leaders spozcd there wuz no lower stratum to   : dig into, and give up in disgust. .              ' But I hev diskivered that lower stratum I hev found it;  ; and when the idea flashed over my Websterian intelleck, 1 shouted Halleloogy The nigger is the lower stratum; and   0 ef we bore down to it, and work it thoroughly, we hev, at least, ; a twenty years' lease uv power.                i We must cultivate the nigger. HE MUST HEV THE SUFFRAGE! It is a burnin shame, that, in this Nineteenth Century, in the full blaze uv intelligence, livin under a Declarashun which de- clares all men " free and ekal," that a large body uv men shood be denied the glorious privilege uv bein taken up to the poles A   THE NEGRO A MAN.         237 and voted. Is not the Afrikin a man? Is he not taxed ez we are, arid more than most uv the Democrisy, for many uv em own property? Is he not amenable to all the laws, even ez we is? Then why, I triumphantly ask, is he not entitled to a vote? Ah! why, indeed? "But this is Ablishnism!" methinks I hear a obtoose Di- mocrisy observe in horrer. "And why give them votes who will use em agin us?" My gentle friend, will they use their ballot agin us? Ef I know myself, 1 think not. Kin they read? Kin they write? Aint the bulk uv em rather degraded and low than otherwise? Aint that the kinld uv stock we want, anid the kind wich hcz alluz set us up? Readin hez alluz bin agin us. Every skool. master is a engine uv Ablishnism; every noosepaper is a cuss. General Wise, uv Virginia. whenl he thanked God there wuzn't a noosepaper in his deestrick, hedl reason to; for do yoo spoze a readin constitooency wood hev ever kept sich a blatherskite ez him in Congress year after year? Then, agin, the Constooshnal Amendment will pass, givin representashen to voters alone. The Democratic States will hev more members iuv Congress and more electoral votes than afore the war; and them States we kin depend on. But my skeem is still more comprelensive.- Them niggers ain't needed in the South. We'll send em North. A few thou- sand will overbalance the Ablishn majority in Noo Jerscey; fifty thousand will bring Ohio back to the fold; the same number will do for New York land Pennsylvany, and the country is saved - we will be able to elect the President. Thus the pit, the Ablishnist dug for us lhe'll fall into hisself; the club lie cut; for us will break his own liead. Honey hez kum out uv tilo carcass; good hez perceded from Nazareth. The nigger smells sweeter to me now than Nite bloomin Serious; he is more precious to me than gold, or silver, or preshus stones. He is the way, and I shel walkl in it. He shel lift me into a Post Orfis. We must give our Afrikin brother, - for is he not a man and a brother? - not only the suffrage, but he must hev land, and the Democracy must give it to him. I want Garrit Davis to instantly interdoose a bill into the Senate givin each family a quarter section uv land, a  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7107-00000127"/> E FOUNDATION OF THE NEW TEMPLE.          4 pair uv mules, and a cook stove; and each female Afrikin brother two fiarin calico dresses' and a red bonnet. I want him to advocate the bill in a speech uv not more than two hours, so that it will stand some chance uv passin. On second thought, I guess some other man hed better interdoose the bill, as the Senate hez got into sich a habit uv votin down everything he proposes, that they'd slather this without con- siderin it, on general principles. Then we've got em. Work ez hard ez theymay at it, it'll take twenty years afore the Ablishinists kin educate em up to the standard uv votin their tikkit; and even that time won't do it if we kin git the tax taken off uv whiskey, so that we kin afford to use it ez in the happy days uv yore. Joyusly I .went home to lay tile foundashun uv the new temple uv Dimocrisy. I slept that nite atween two niggers, and hev bin shakin hands and enquirin after the health uv the families uv all I hev met. It's rather hard for an orthodox Democrat. Sich sudden shifts is rather wrenchin on the con- shence. But what uv that? The Dimocrat who hez follered the party closely for thirty years ought not to balk at sich a triflin change ez this, pertiklerly when it promises sich glori- ous results.

ENJOYS A VISION OF THE NEXT WORLD, SEEING THEREIN MANY CURIOUS THINGS, WHICH ARE PUBLISHED AS A WARNING TO POLITICIANS.   CONFEDRIT X ROADS (wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky), } February 5, 1866. LAST nite I retired to my virtoous couch, at precisely lialf past eleven, after eatin a rather light supper for that time uv night. I alluz make it a pint to eat light in the evenin, for I'm gittin old, and my digestive faculties ain't what they wuz when I wuz young. Alas! we who hev lived out the best part uv our days, wat wood we give to be set back to the time when, with our faculties unimpairel, we cood consoom a good square meal without fear uv consekenses! But   "Them happy days is fled, And never will return."   I paid my respecks to two mince pies, a pair uv pig's feet, some cold tongue, and a plate uv tripe, follered l)y a half dozen doughnuts, and a couple or more uv glasses uv hot wllisky punch; and singler ez it may seem, it didn't set well. I dreamed all night, and my dreams wuznt at all pleasant. Me- thawt I led deceest, and wuz in tile next world. It wuz a singler site that met my vision. The dividin line atwcen this world and the next wuz a swift stream uv water, and every deceest spirit hed to cross it. Tile water wuz sutliin like thlat uv the Dead Sea. A man, unencumbered with anytl)ing, cood walk on it, but they sunk down in it ef they wuz loaded, accordin to what they lied to carry. On the tother side uv tlis Jordan wuz heaven; the dominions uv his majesty Satan the 1st wuz below, and to it a strong under current flowed, which took all them ez wuz too heavy loaded to keep their chins above water. On the bank stood more than two millions uv little devils, who flung onto the shoulders uv thdm tryin to cross, their failins, and weaknesses, and iniquities.   &#xD;<pb n="240 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7107-00000128"/> 240       THE FATE OF THE WICKED. General Breckinridge wuz the first that I saw enter the flood. He bed on a life preserver, labelled "States Rights; " but a peert little devil stuck a pin into it, and it collapsed, the gas with wich it wuz filled smellin horribly. Down he went, and ez he sunk, they commenced peltin him with packages labelled "Treason," "Perjury," and "Murder," and John C. went under. Old James Buchanan went next. The old gentleman didn't keep above water as long ez a able-bodied man could hold a bar uv red-hot iron in his hand. He made one splash, when a weight labelled "Treason " struck him, and down he went. The gentlemanly and urbane devil who had him in charge had a big pile more uv ammunition to discharge at him, but that one wuz sufficient. Vallandigham come next. I wuz surprised to see no one make a motion at him, but he sank all the same. "We never waste effort," sed Satan to me; " he carries enough natural cussedness about him, all the time, to sink him, without pilin any devilment on his shoulders wich is ten days old." Frank Peerce made his appearance, but declined to enter. He wuz immediately seezed, and on each leg wuz tied a weight labelled "IKansas," and they flung him in. He went down like a shot, and that's the last I seed uv him. Garret Davis went in, and to my surprise, passed over safely. Nothing wuz flung at him, for wich I asked the reason. "t Why," sed Satan, " the poor old man isn't accountable. He commenced to talk many years ago, and keeps on talkin. because he really don't know when to stop. I could hev sunk him, but the fact is, I woodcnt endoor what the Senit uv the United States liez hed to, for the past few years, for a dozen uv Tombs lawyvers. Besides this, I'm gettin more from Kentucky now than I am really entitled to. I've a mortgage on two thirds uv that State." Fernandy and Ben Wood come up rather bold, and entered the flood ez though they were sure uv goin through all right. With an inimitable chuckle, Satan motioned away the inexperi- enced devils, and sed, "Leave em to me," and at Ben he hurled i a package uv the New York News, wich swashed him down instanter. Jest ez Fernandy wuz beginnin to reach the other  &#xD;<pb n="-241" xml:id="VAC7107-00000129"/>   SATAN'S IDEAS.         241 shore, he flung onto him an assortment uv weights, labelled "Lotteries " and "Riots," which took him down to the arm. pits, and finished by tumblin onto him a mass, onto wich wnz written "Mayoralty," and down he went; at wich His Majesty drew a sigh uv relief. Seein the style uv the men who sunk, I remarked unto him, - "This war hez bin a rather profitable thing for yoo." "Nothin to speak uv," sed he. "Thle leaders uv the South- erners were, sum uv em, honest, and got through on that account, and the rank and file were ignorant wretches, who ain't accountable, nollow. The leading Copperheads uv the North were mine, anyhow, from the beginning. Any man who cood sympathize with the rebels in sich a struggle, must, yoo will acknowledge, hev hQCd a long career uv iniquity to fit em fobr sich a sin. 'Why," sed he, " do yoo tlhink I use all the shot 1 hev? Not any. Them yoo've seen piled on were used because, bein the last, thhey were on the top uv the pile. "Any quantity uv yoor party escaped me. Them fellows who are yet votin for Jackson I'll never git, and the most uv them ez alluz votes .pnscratched tickets will dodge me. Their innocence protects em. It takes a modritly smart man to be vishus enuff to come to me; he hez to hev sense enuff to dis- tinguish between good and evil, cussednis enuff to deliberately choose' the latter, and brains enuff to do suthin startlin in that- line. Dan Voorhees, uv Injeany, hez all these qualities devel- oped to a degree wich excites my profound respect. Between him and Fernandy Wood it's nip and tuck. Fernandy did wicked things with more neatnis than Voorhees, but for a actual love uv doin em Voorhees beets the world. I sed," continued lie, 't that the war wuzn't uv much yoose to me. I repeat it; it wuz a damage. Afore the war, 1 hed my own way, pretty much, in the Southern States. For every octoroon, I cood count on at least two planters, and under the patriarkle system uv Afrikin slavery (wich, by the way, wuz wun uv my most brilliant consepshuns), octooroons multiplied with a rapidity pleasin to behold. But now, alas! the octooroon biziniss is done, and my best holt is gone. I hev some little hope, how- ever. The Ditnocrisy are displayin a vigger I didn't think they 16  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7107-00000130"/> 242         AND HS HOPES. possest. Ef they kin only git strength enuff to elect the next President and re-establish slavery! The thought fills me with unutterable joy. The redoosin of the nigger to bondage agin wood give me a clean title to evry last one who helped to do it, i and in gittin erm back into their normal condishun (by the way, that's another phrase uv mine), ther'd be enuff slaughterin and murders to satisfy several sich Satans ez I am. I'd help em ef I knowd how, but I can't improve on either their speekers or writers, and ez long ez men will do my work gratis, I don't see the yoose uv interferin." At this pint a couple uv small imps undertook to push me into the stream, and in the struggle I awoke. My dreem wuz o'er, but the impresliun remained. "Kin it be," mused I, pen- sively, " that we are doin the devil's work, and are we to be finally rewarded in the manner I saw in my vision? Ef so, hedn't I better quit and repent?" But I thought agin, that however it mite be for younger men, it wood be uv no yoose for me. I hed voted the strait ticket for thirty years, and the ten or twelve years I hed to live wuz too short a time in which to repent successfully uv  i  sich iniquity. So I sank into sleep agin, this time dreemin that I had turned Fenian--hed elected myself Hed Centre    i for the Stait uv Kentucky, and wuz just investin $75,000 in a magnificent plantashun.

CONFEDRIT X ROADS (wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky), 1 February 15, 18G66.  I HEV hed hopes uv Androo Johnson. My waitin sole hcz bin centred onto hinm for a year back. He wuz the Moses wich I spected wood lead the Democrisy out uv the desolate Egypt into which we hev bin making briclks without straw for five long weary and dreary years. O, how I hev yearned for John. son! O, how I hev waited, day after day, and week after week, and month after month, for some manifestation uv Di. mocrisy wich is satisfactory - suthin tangible - suthin that I cood take hold on. Faith is the substance uv things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen; wich is all light so flir ez religion is con- cerned, but uv no account in politix. A friend uv mnine, wlio wuz a monomaniac on the subjick uv faith, undertook to live on it, under the insane belief that ef a man llad faith, pork wuz tunilecessary.  Wuz the experiment a success?   Not any. When he commenst the trial lie wciglied 200; in a week he wuz down to 125; and in fourteen days he slept in the valley! I hev been livin on flaith for a year or more, and I too am thin. My bones show; light shines through me ; I am faint and sick. O, for suthn that 1 can see and feel - suthin solid! Our Dimocratic newspapers are supportin Androo Johnson. They claim that his policy is our policy; that he is ourn, and we are hizn. They are singin hosanners to him. At his every act they exclaim Halleloogy I in chorus. What is it all about? In what partikleler lhez Androo Johnson showed hisself to be a The Democratic leaders were in great doubt in 1866 as to the policy of adopt- ing President Johnson, and President Johnson was for a time in doubt as to the propriety of adopting the Democracy. The President wanted the Democ- racy, but he also desired to retain in his party the " conservative "Republicans, and therefore at the beginning of his trouble his appointments were all mado from the latter class, much to the disgust of the former.  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7107-00000131"/> 244      "WHERE I1 THE OFFICES?" Dimokrat? In the name uv Dimocrisy let me ask, "WHERE IS THE OFFICES?"Who's got em? What is the politikle convic- shuns uv the wretch who is post master at the Corners, and who only last nite refused, in the most heartless manner, to trust me for postage stamps? Who is the Collectors, the As- sessors, et settry? Are they constitooshnel Dimokrats? Is Stanton, and Seward, and Welles histed out uv the cabinet, and Vallandigum, and Brite, and Wood appinted in their places? Not onct. Every post master, every collector, every assessor, every officer, is a Ablishinist, dyed deeply and in faist colors. Faith without works is a weak institution; its like a whisky punch with the whisky omitted, wich is a disgustin mixter uv warm water and sugar. What is it to me (who hev bin ready to accept any position uv wich the salary wuz sufficient to maintain a individooal uv simple habits) who is beheaded, so ez I don't get a place? Androo Johnson may cut off offish heads ez dexterously and profbosely ez lie chooses; but my sole refuses to thrill when I know that Ablishnists, though uv a different stripe, will be apinted. So long ez Dimocrats are kept out, what care I whllo hez the places? Paul may plant and Apollus water; but uv what account is the plantin and waterin to me ef I don't get the increase? I take no delight in sicli spectacles. Ef Androo Johnson proposes to be a Dimo- crat, - ef lie desires the honest, hearty support uv the party, let him seel lis faith withit works. I visited Washington with the express purpose uv seein the second Jackson. I am a frank man, and I laid the matter afore him without hesitation. I told him that the Postmaster at the Corners wuz opposin his policy and aboosin him continually; that it wuz a outrage that men holdin place under the Admin- istration should not sustain the Administration. In the name uv Right, I demanded a change. I sposed that to-wunst the position would be offered to me; and that after protestin a sufficient time that I did not wish it, and would prefer the appintment of some more worthy man, I should accept it, and go home provided for three years. Im- agine my deep, my unutterable disgust, when he told me that he wood investigate the matter, and probably wood make a change, PROVIDED HE COULD FIND, IN THE VICINITY) SOME ORIGI- NAL UNION MAN WHO WOULD ACCEPT THE PLACE.   THE CENTRAL IDEA.        245 Then the iron entered my soul. Then I felt that in him we had no lot nor part. Our principles are uv a very comprehensive nature. We are willin to endorse Androo Johnson, or any other man. We will endorse his theories uv Reconstruction, or any man's theo- ries. We are elastic, like Injy rubber. The boy who set a hen on a hundred eggs acknowledged to his maternal parent that she could not kiver em; but he remarked he wanted to see the old thing spred herself. We have that spreadin capaci- ty. We kin accommodate the prejudices uv the people uv all the various localities. In Connecticut we are singin John Brown's body lies a mouldrin in the grave, in a modritly loud tone, and supporting a Ablishnist who voted for doih away with slavery in the District of Columby and for the Constooshnel Amendment. 1In Kentucky we are hangin men uv the John Brown style, and mobbin all uv the persuasion uv the Connec- ticut nominee. Sich a variety uv principle, - a party uv sich adaptibility, - kin hev but one great central idee, on wich tfere is no diversity uv opinion, and to which all other ideas is subordinate. That idea is PosT OFFICE! and ef Androo John- son could be got rite on that question, we'd care not wat else he required uv us. We hev our arms around Androo. We are huggin him to our buzzums; but he hez left his baggage to hum. That bag- gage is wat we want; and we slel fling lJim off shortly, onless he changes his policy in this respeck. He kin hev us on easy terms; but he must furnish the ammunishun with which to fight }his battles. Will he do it? That's the question a hun- dred thousand hungry soles, who hanker even ez I do, are daily askin. PETROLEUM V.

PRESIDENT'S 22D    OF FEBRUARY    SPEECH.      - WASHNGTON, February 23, 1866. I DON'T know; but there is a still small voice within me wich whispers, "All is well!" The delusive phantom, Hope, may be playin false with me. The wish may he paternal parient to the thought, and I may be indulgin in a dream from wich I shel be, to-morrer, roodly awakened; but it's my opinion that the day-star uv glory hez ariz onto the Dimocracy; that our night uv glbom is over; and that, at last, the Government, or at least the only part we care about, - the offisis, - is ourn. I heerd Androo Jollnson speak last nite! I stood beside him I I helpt hold him up! I SMELT HS BREATH. It's all rite! I hed hopes when he vetoed that large and varied assortment uv Ablishn abominashens, - the Preedmen's Burow bill, - not- withstandin there were pints in his message I coodent sanction. The veto wuz heavenly, but his reasons were unsound. When  he expressed hisself ez bein determined upon sekoorin the nig- gers in their rites, I felt fearful that there iwuz a honest differ- ence uv opinion atween him and Congress wich mite be settled,  and then what wood become uv us?  Ef the niggers is to hevy  rites, in the name uv Heaven, I asked myself; what difference    I does it make to us whether they hev em by Charles Sumner's system (on whose head rest cusses!), or A. Johnson's! And ez is customary when men ask theirselves questions, I got no answer. Men never ask theirselves questions wich kin be answered.                              } But last nite my doubts wuz removed.  Little Sam Cox, and Dan Voorhees, and the Woods, and me, hed bin with Androo , all day. Tile Ablishhnists avoided him 'after the veto; and    I knowin he'd done sutlhin he wuzn't quite shoor wuz wise, he The famous, or rather infamous, speech of the 22d of February, 1866, settled the status of President Johnson, and indicated clearly his purpose of turning his back upon the loyal men of the country. He continued, however, to appoint Republicans to office, and refused to commit himself specifically to the Democracy. The real Republicans abandoned him from that moment.   A DESCRIPTION OF THE CAPTORS.     247 needed bracin up, and we wuz ready to brace him. Isn't it singular that men, when they go to the devil, alluz go in squads? Cox hed him cornered all day, a readin to hinm extrax from Forney's Press, and choice selections from Sumnor's speeches; and Voorhees and the others wuz a intimatin to him that only in the buzzum uv the Dimocrisy cood he find that congeniality uv sperit so nessary to him; and by the time the serenade wuz ready, he wuz ez ffull uv venom ez wuz possible, and his capacity in that line is immense. Tlhe company all went with him onto the stand, and my eyes saw the first cheerin vision wich they hevy beheld for years. Before us stood ten thousand or more Dimocrats. There wuz the veteran from Lee's army in his soot uv gray, which hed, by continued contact with the pavements uv Washington - wich, not hevin bin slept on much, sense Bookannon's time, they don't sweep--become somewhat uv the color uv the, clay. There wuz the offiser who surrendered with Johnston, and them noble sons uv Baltimore, and Rawly, and Charleston, who, though they didn't serve their section in the field, were ardent in their support uv the cause. There were the old-style Dimocrats uv the North, whose fitith in Johnson's Dirmocrisy, based upon the scene wich took place at the inauguration, wuz greater than mine, hed come on with their applications fobr Post Offises, and who jined so heartily in the cheers wich went up fobr J.' Davis: and there, addressin this crowd, wuz a President --the man who had the appintin power in his hands -wlio cood make and unmake Post Masters! It did me good, and yet I doubtid. Wood he go through with it? Wood he lock horns Nwith Wade and Sumner, and dare the wrath uv Thad Stevens? Wood lhe? fe wavered and shrunk bacl ez he saw the style uv the awdience before him; for he hed bin, for four years, accustomed to better dressed people. But Cox wuz ekal to the emergency.   Samyooel whispered into his ear, "Charles the I.!"' and flamin up like a conflagratid oil well, he waded in. Then I felt tlhat it wuz all right. Then my soul expanded; and ez he went on, pilin * Mr. Sumner, in a speech, spoke of President Johnson as the American "Charles I."  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7107-00000133"/> 248       AND THEIR ENTHEIR E USIASM'. Billinsgate upon Billinsgate, usin Tennessee stump slang, im- proved by a liberal mixture uv the more desprit variety he hed picked up in Washinton and Baltimore, I felt that it wuz indeed well with us. He wuz talkin ez a Dimokrat to Dim- okrats; and it wuz appreciated. Strippin off all the disguise he hed bin a wearin for four years, - washin off, in rage and whisky, the varnish and putty with wich he hed shined up his dullness, and filled up the cracks and cavities wich hed alluz troubled him,- he stood forth ez we knowd him --Androo Johnson! How he did froth and foam! How he did lash his late associates I and how those Dirnokrats who came to Wash- inton with petitions for places in their pockets did wink at each other, and poke, each other in the ribs, with exultation and jocularity wich they cood not conceal! And how the Ablish- nists, wich hung onto the outskirts uv the crowd, in the hope that he wood declare lhimself in sich a way ez to give em some hope, did walk away sorrowful and sore, ez tho they felt that they hed a new trouble afbre em I And how the soljers uv Lee, and the quartermasters wich hed made Richmond their headquarters doorin the war, did cheer and sling their hats into the air, and in the uncontrollable enthoosiasm uv the moment invariably snatch better ones from the heads uv the Northern inen in the crowd! It wuz goljus. While His Eggslency's course gives me hope, I don't want it to be understood that I am prepared to fully and entirely indorse him. I don't go much on men who do things in a state uv madnis; neither 1do I invest heavy in that Dimokrat wich requires an extra load uv likker to make him act and talk like a Dimokrat. Androo Johnson was and is a Dimokrat -a ginooine Dimokrat. The accident nv his learnin to read, in his yooth, gave him a preeminence over us in Tennessee, and put him through the various places he. hez filled. His affinities wuz with us; his style wuz our style, and his habits our habits; and he hed no biznis to ever git out uv the fbld. I cannot forget that he went back on us at a critikle time in the history uv the party. He saw that the effort the Dimtocrisy uv the South wus makin to regain their rites wood be a failure; the aristocracy uv the South hed snubbed him, and refbozed to recognize him; but all this shoed not hev affected him. It's   THE GREAT QUESTION.        249 the normal condishn uv the lower grade uv Dimolrats to be snubbed; and they hev no rite to inquire whether anything the aristocracy uv the party propose is goin to be a failure or not. It's their dooty to obey orders without questioning. Wat spiled Johnson wuz Massaclloosits. He pretended to be loyal, and Massachoosits patted him on the back. They took him into good society. They let him associate with Sumner and sich, and the man became infatuated. He got to drinkin high priced drinks, and wearin clean shirts, and begun to ape the manners uv those into whose sphere he hed bin thrown.

For the reason, that he kin git jist enuff Republilkins, precisely, and no more, to fill the offisis, and they will be uv sich a character ez will do the Dimokrisy no credit.

He's a animal uv the bull kind; and criticism and opposition is to him the red flag wich the Spanish matadors wave afore the animals they wish to infooriate, and they may drive him into our ranks.

Hez there bin, as yit, any well authenticated case uv the removal uv a Ablishnist, and the apintment uv a constooshnel Democrat in his stead?  Not that I hev heard of. Per contra, the Ablish- nists - them ez wuz appinted by Linkin - are still holdin on, Democratic politicians organized meetings in all the Northern States, in ap- proval of the President's speech, and the policy it foreshadowed, all of which were engineered by men wlio yearned for the comfortable offices occupied by their political enemies.

The cost uv one meetin, put in korn whisky, wood not only solace theirselves, but start half a dozen Ablishnists on the road to Dimocrisy. Men is deceptive. I hev hopes uv Androo Johnson myself, and principally becoz Vallandigum and Fernandy Wood hev hopes. Them buzzards kin smell carrion a long distance, and they are seldom at fault. In this case, they may be. They base their hopes on John-son's speech, at Washington, on the 22d. There may be suthin in it; but ain't it possible that the stench wich they took for Dimocrisy, and wich they sposed cum from Johnson, ariz from them ez surrounded him? "But," sez a Dimocrat, whose nose, from long continued lack of supplies, hez softened down from a generous crimson to a ghastly bloo, and who woodent hev a small post orfis at no price, ef it wuznt offered him, " look at the class he spoke to." Wat noncence! Androo wuz mad. There wuz a mass uv bile on his politikle stumick wich must be got rid uv. ITe lia(d sum nasty things to say, and it wuz a part uv the eternal fit- ness uv things that he shood hev a nasty audience to say em to.    . I don't propose to go orf into spasms over the present situa- shun. Johnson proposes to continue the Preedmen's Buro, and hezn't no noshen of repealin the test oath, or uv drawin the military out uv the Dimocratik States. So far as heard from, we uv the South is still in a stait of abject cussitood.

But. before I take down these things, I WANT TO KNOW    WHAT I AM GOING TO GIT FOR IT. Ef Androo Jollnson goes back on his party and his pledges, he, uv course, asks us to go back on ourn. In sich transactions, where both parties, by bein engaged in it at all, confess themselves ruther a low grade of' scoundrels, I think it well enuff to hev the consideration paid down. Ef Androo Johnson wants me, he knows the terms. I am his to command, for a consideration; ez much so ez is the thousands uv Demokrats who hev bin, for the past week, gittin up demonstrations. But I want suthin to go on. When I hev his permission, under the broad seel uv the Post Orfis Depart- ment, to write "P. M." after my illustrious name, I shell be prepared to wade in.

THE PATRIARCHAL SYSTEM. - AN AFFECTING APPEAL IN BEHALF OF A FRIEND. CONFEDRIT X ROADS (wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky), I - -    March 19, 1866.  YESTERDAY I happened to pick up a copy uv a friteful de- praved Ablishin paper, and my horror-stricken eyps wuz glued to the follerin passage, which I read:--     \ "' I am happy to state to you tlhat our fiee negroes are doing finely. We have no trouble with them. They have all gone to work manfhlly. They give an impetus to trade that we never before had. I have sold John Guttle's negroes, this year and last, more goods thhan I ever sold Guttle, and he owned two hundred and fifty slaves. So you see the free negro sys- tem is worlking well with us." Ez I peroozed them lines, tears started involuntarily from my beamin eyes, and coursed in torrents down my venerable cheeks. I know John Guttle well, I may say intimately. He wuz a dear friend, - one uv the few wich I call friend in the most comprehensive sense uv the word. He holds my note for eighteen dollars and 63 cents; and I hcv sumwhere among my papers, wich I have always carefully preserved for refer- ence, a memorandum uv his address, that I mightobe shoor not to forget to send it to him. I give him the note becoz he fur- nished the paper, and it made him easy in his mind - I put down the memorandum becoz it looked business-like. Benevo- lence is a prominent trait in my character. When givin my note for borrered money will do a man good, I never begrudge the trouble uv writin it. But wat I wuz a goin to say wuz, that the fccndishnis uv that item passes belief. The writer puts it in print to seiow that the Ablishn uv slavery benefitted sumbody. I grant him that the merchant, who undoubtedly wuz born in Massachoo- setts, wuz benefitted by the change ; so are the greasy mechan- ics who are now pollutin the soil uv Alabama ; and so, probably, are the 250 niggers; but, in the name uv Liberty, in the name  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7107-00000136"/> 254       AND THE GUTTLE FAMLY. uv Justice, in the name uv the Constitooshun uv the United States, and the flag uv our Common Country, I ask, How ABOUT JOHN GUTTLE? John Guttle is robbed. John Guttle is deprived uv his property. The bread is taken from John Guttle's mouth; his staff' is broken; his dependence is gone; he is bereft. Never shall I fobrget John Guttle or his hospitable mansion, ez I knowed it in the happy years afore the crooel war. He wruz a gentleman uv the old school - one uv the few left us in these degenerate days. His home wuz wun uv unalloyed happiness. Situated just back uv Mobeel, he had the finest plantashun in that section, and bed on it 250 niggers. All shades wuz represented. There wuz the coal-black Cuffee, whose feechers denoted the pure Afiikin, and whose awkward manners showed that he wuz not long from Afrika. There wuz the civilized mulatto, in whose veins the Guttle blood showed; the quadroon, in whom the good old Guttle blood predominated; and the octoroon, which wuz mostly Guttle. The Guttleses wuz eminently a Christian generation. They, wuz devoutly pious; and there never wuz one uv the name who cood not repeat, without the book, all uv the texts bearin on slavdery. The passages in which Onesimus and Hager figger wuz favorites with cm ; but on " cussid be Canaan" they wuz strong. For generations they had mourned over the hard fate uv the sons uv Ham, doomed to perpetual bondage becoz uv the :in uv their father; and with a miassionary spirit ekaled by few and excelled by none, they did their part towards redoosin that cuss, by makin ez many of em ez possible half-brothers to the more favored race uv Japllet, and thus bringing uv em out uv the cuss; and they hed mellered the color uv their charges down from the hideous black to a bright yeller. Under the. old patriarkle system, time passed off smoothly and pleasantly with the Guttle family. Them 250 niggers wkuz obliged, uv course, to work, and their labor wuz money. John bought each uv the male sons uv Ham two soots uv clothes per annum, and each uv the female sons uv Ham one soot. It wuz con. sidered healthy for the young ones to go naked, which they wuz religiously allowed to do, ez none uv the Guttles uv that family wood do any thing agin nater or her laws. The girls   I               THEIR DOWNFALL.         255 hed pianos, and wuz educated at the North; the boys wuz celebrated for horse racing and their skill at losin money at faro. They wuz hospitable and generous to a fault. Their house wuz open house, and their beverages wuz alluz the best. Money wuz no objick to them; for when they had a severe attack of poker, or faro, or hoss racin, they hed plenty uv octoroons and quadroons, with the real Guttle nose, wich brand wuz well known in Noo Orleans, and wood alluz command the highest possible figger that wuz paid in thallt market; or, ef they had no more than they wanted at home uv that style, why, a few field hands wood be sold, and the remainin ones wood be persuaded by the overseer to do the work uv the whole. Jolln Guttle's sons wuz all in the Confederit army. His daughters, willin to sacrifice every thing fur the cause, heroically pledged theirselves to whip the niggers theirselves doorin their absence Now all is changed I A shadder hez fallen across that peace- ful home. The nigger quarters is t;llere, but the niggers is not. Thle broad plantashun is divided up into small fiatins, and half uv it is owned by Ablishnists from the North, who workl theirselves, and who hcv a mcetin house on one cornei uv it, and the niggers a school house on tlid totlher. The race track is plowed up and in cotton; the wlhippin-post and the stocks is taken (down and )burned; all, all the evidenccs uv civilizashun hez fatded afore the ruthless hand uv the invader. Jolin Guttle --that generous old man --subsists by the labor uv his own hands. One uv his sons ekes out a miserable existence running a dray in Mobeel; another, who is gifted with no ordinary intelleck, earns a respectable living playing seven-up, in a small wuray, with his former niggers; and the two girls is runnin a sewing masheen. Tallk not to me uv benefits. What is a dozen tradesmen and two hundred and fifty niggers to the glorious old Rimocratic e1t  Johln Guttle? What is the interest uv a dozen or so uv Noo England mechanics, and the niggers aforesaid, when compared to that glorious aristocracy which can never exist beside em? Kin I go and borrer eighteen dollars and sixty-three cents uv one uv them? No. Becoz, working for their paltry livins, they place a higher value on money, and will not spread it airound ez profoosely ez the noble race which preceded erm.  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7107-00000137"/> 256      JOHN GUTTLE AND DEMOCRACY. Another great wrong is done in this settin free uv Jolln Guttle's niggers. John Guttle hez, uv course, no further interest in the Dimocratic party. Slavery wuz the umbillikle cord which united the Southern slaveholder and the Northern Dimocrat; and, that cord cut, why hez Jolln Guttle any more interest in Dimocracy? We stood ez a Chinese wall between them and the rushin flood uv Ablishn fanaticism; and we made the wall biznis pay. They furnished money, and we did the worl'; and, there bein but few uv us, the orfisis wuz easily divided. Alas! our occupashin's gone. The South is forever lost to us; for she hez no dirty work for us to do.' I appeal to the United States uv America. In behalf uv John Guttle, I say, give him back his niggers. In behalf uv the Dimocrisy North, who are out uv employment, give him back his niggers. In behalf uv his son who is runnin a dray, give him back his niggers. In behalf uv his daughters runnin a sewin machine, give him back his niggers. Make things Normal agin.

I didni't quite understand the lay uv the land around the White House.

Then, hart broke and dead broke, not hevin the wherewith to prokoor more sootable lodgin, I lay pne down on the cold stun steps, and sought refuge from my troubles in sleep. I dreemed a dream.

CHARLES SUMNER is not a very popular man in this section uv Kentucky; on the contrary, quite reverse. He is known here ez an Ablishnist; ez one who is a chief supporter uv that hidjus sin- the infidelity, I may say, for a man may cz well' deny the whole Bible ez to cast discredit upon Onesimus, Hagar, and Ham, onto wich the whole system uv Afrikin slavery rests - the originator, therefore, uv the infidle beleef that Slavery is not uv divine origin, wich, judgin from the ex- perience uv the last five years, appears to be gainin ground in the North. He is not, therefore, popular in this region. The poor whites at the South were made to believe that Hannibal Hamlin was a mulatto, and that Charles Sumner married a negress. The opinion held by this class of Mr. Sumner is fairly stated in the text.   l lTHE SOUTHERN IDEA OF SUMNER.              261 Yisterday I attendid a tea party at Deekin Pogram's, to wich the elite uv the Corners wuz present, incloodin an Illinoy store-keeper luv the name uv Pollock, wich bed bin invited be- cause the Deekin hed, some three months ago, bought a bill uv goods uv him on ninety days' time, and wantid an extension. While at the table enjoyin the "Cup wich cheers, but don't intoxicate very much,' ez Dryden hez it (tho I bleeve, to keep off chills, in this coun- try, they mix three and a half parts uv whiskey to one uv tea), the name uv Sumner wuz mentioned. Mrs. Pogram to-wunst remarked that she didn't want the name uv that ojus'creecher spoken at her table. "Why?" sed I, gratified at the ebulition. "I hate him!" sed she, spitefully. "So do I," replied I; " but what hev yoo agin him, aside from his obnoxious political opinions?" "Didn't he marry a nigger?" sed Mrs. P., triumphantly. "Didn't he marry a nigger - a full-blooded nigger? and hezn't he hed nineteen yaller children, every one uv wich he com- pelled, agin their will, to marry full-blooded niggers? Didn't he ?" "Mrs. P.," sed this Illinoy store-keeper, wich his name it wuz Pollock, " do yoo object to miscegenation?" "Missee - what?" replied she, struck all uv a heap at the word. "Miscegenation- amalgamation-marryin whites with nig- gers." "Do I?" retorted she; "ketch a son uv mine marryin a nigger! They are another race; theyr beasts; and who'd marry em but jist sich men ez Sumner and them other Ablish- nists?" "Then permit me to ask," sed this Pollock, wich wuz bound to kick up a muss, " ef ther's any race uv pure blood in this section uv Kentucky wich is yaller?" "No! uv course not," sed Mrs. P.; " them yaller people is mulatters - half nigger, half white." "And them ez is quite white - not quite, but nearly so -  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7107-00000140"/> 262       POLLOCK THE DISTURBER. about the color uv a new saddle, like Jane, there," sed he, pintin to a octoroon girl uv 18 wich used to belong to the Deekin afore ' the isshooin uv the infernal proclamashen, " like Jane, there, wich is waitin on the Deekin, and - but, good Lord!" sed he,  ? startin up like a tragedian.                   i "Wat!" shouted the company, all startin up.  ' Nothin," sed he: " only, now that Jane's face is in. range  with the Deekin's, wat a wonderful resemblance! She hez the Pogram nose and ginral outline uv face; not Mrs. P.'s angu- larity, but the Deekin all over. My deer sir," sed he, addressin the Deekin, " ef she wuzn't a quadroon, I shood say she looks enough like yoo to be yoor daughter, by a first wife, I shood say, for she hez not, ez I remarked, Mrs. P.'s angularity and gineral bonenis; but uv course, she bein a part nigger, the resemblance may be sot down ez-a-very-remarkable-coinci- dence!" The Deekin turned ez white ez a sheet, and Mrs. Pogram turned ez red ez a biled lobster, from wich I inferred that there wuz trooth in a rumor I had heard about, the Deekin and his wife hevin a misunderstandin about a nigger woman and her baby, about 18 years ago, wich resulted in his bein made bald- headed in less than a minute, and the baby's mother being sold South. The Il!noy store-keeper, uv the name uv Pollock, re- soomed: - "I wuz about askin wat them niggers is, ez is nearly white?" "Why, they'r octoroons, or seven-eights white," sed Mrs. Pogram.

"Well, then," sed this Pollock, who, I spect, wuzn't half so innsent ez he let on, "I see that yoo hev no objection to mixin with the nigger, providin yoo don't do it legally; that amalga. mashen don't hurt nothin, pervidin yoo temper it with adultery. Is that the idee, Mrs. Pogram?" Mrs. P. wuz mad, and made no reply, and Pollock persood the subjick.   A DEMOCRATIC INTERPRETATION.     263 "Jane there, is, I take it, about one eighth nigger. Sllhe got her white blood from whites, uv course; and ez there coodent be no marryin in the biznis, there is proof positive in her face that the 8th commandment hez bin violated about four times somewhere in this vicinity, or wherever her maternal ancestors, on her mother's side, may hev resided. What do yoo think about it, Deekin? Ez a Christian, woodent it be better to marry em than to add a violation uv the commandment to thile sin uv amalgamashen? It wood redoose yoor load jest a half." The Deekin wuz too indignant to reply, and ez it involved a pint altogether too hefty for his limited intelleck, I took it up. -"My dear sir," I remarked, "L yoo don't male the proper dis- tinction, or, rather, yoo don't appreciate the subjick at all. The nigger here sustains only one character with us, - that uv a inferior bein, the slave uv the hawty Caucashen, uv whom we are the noblest specimens; that is, the Deekin is, he bein a Southerner. 'I unfortunately Wuz born in the North, and am a hawty Caucashen only by adoption. To marry a nigger wood be to destroy our idea uv sooperiority, for we marry only our ekals. The intercourse with em, the results uv wich yoo see indications, bein outside uv the pale uv matrimony, is not, ez yoo wood suppose, the result uv unbridled licentiousnis, but is merely the assertion uv our superiority. When the lordly Caucashen (uv whom the Deekin is wich) bids a daughter uv Ham (wich, in the original Hebrew, signifies the hindquartor uv a hog) come to him, and she doth it not, he breaks her head, wich inculcates obedience. One is only a slave indeed when he surrenders all his individual rites. The female slave cannot be considered ez entirely subdooed until she hez yielded to her owner everything. To marry em wood be to elevate cm; the intercourse common among us is not a sin, it bein merely the assertion uv that superiority wich we claim is founded on the Holy Scripter. See Onesimus, Hagar, and Ham." "Yes," sed the Deekin, who wuz now on the right track; "it's a assertion uv our sooperiority; it's a dooty every white man owes to his class, and I, for one, will alluz --" "Let me ketch yoo at it, Gabe Pogram," shouted Mrs. P., "and I'll give yoo sich a cat-haulin ez yoo never - drat yoor  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7107-00000141"/> 264        MORE ABOUT SUMNER.               l sooperiority, and yoor Ham, and yoor Caucashen.

I learned that his father wuz a Dutch grocery-keeper, and his mother an Irish washer-woman; that he run away from home at the tender age uv eight, after murderin, ill cold blood, his grandparents, one uv wich wuz a Algerine and tother a Chinese; that he wuz apprenticed to the shoemakin biznis, and  g hed cut the throat uv his boss and his wife, and immersed the younger children into a biler uv scaldin water, where they were found mostly dead seven hours afterward; that he ac- . quired wealth a sellin lottry tickets and brass clocks, et settry. i: His servants wuz redoost Southern gentlemen wich he hed swindled into his debt, and wich, under the laws uv Massa- choosits, coodent git away, and that his intimate friends and associates wuz niggers, with wich he sot long at the festive   !  board, and drunk champane; that Lucresha Mott wuz his sister,   Ann Dickinson his daughter, Fred Douglas his half brother,     and that he kissed, habitually, every nigger child he met, and   frowned so severely onto white clhildren ez to throw em into   I spasms, and other items uv information uv wichplivin in the   !

I onst saw a woman skinnin live eels, and I reproached her, sayin, "Woman, why skinnest     i thou eels alive? Doth it not pain em?"            [ "Nary I " retorted she. "I've skinned em this way for going I on to twenty years, and they're used to it."          , Even so. The negroes hev bin in bondage so long that     i they're used to it, and Androo fbelin a call to continue in  ,  the Moses bizniss, hez, I hope, turned his attention to the   P Dimocrisy.  It's us he's a-goin to lead up out uv the Egypt  ! uv wretchedness we've bin in for nearly five years; it's us   l that's a-goin to quit brick making without straw, and go up into the Canaan wich is runnin with the milk and honey uv   3 public patronage.

I We  hev bin dooly subjoogated some time, and a waitin for  F this.

For now we are in the Union agin; we are under the shadder uv that glorious old flag wich protects all men ceptin niggers and Ablishnists. The nigger is left to be adjustid by us, who is to be governed by the laws wich control labor and capital. Certainly he is--uv coarse.   THE PROCESS OF RECONSTRUCTION.     269 I saw two uv my neighbors adjustin one last nite. They wuz doin it with a paddle, wich wuz bored full uv holes. He didn't seem to enjoy it ez much ez they did. By that proclamation our states are agin under their own control. Let em go at wunst to work -to destroy all the vestiges uv the crooel war through wich they hev past. There ain't no soldiers now to interfere, for the policy uv keepin soldiers in and among ftee people is abhorrent to freedom and humanity. Go to work at wunst, and build up the broken walls uv your Zion. We must hev Peace and unanimity; and Peace cannot dwell among us onless there's a oneness uv purpose and sentiment. To prokoor this is yoor fust dooty. If there be among you them ez opposed yoo doorin yoor late struggle for Rites, hist em. Their presence is irritatin, and kin not be tolerated. Ablishnism is as abhorrent now as ever, and the sooner yoo are rid uv it the better. It is safe to assume that every man who opposed the lately deceased Confedracy is a Ablislinist. The next step, and the most important, is to tear down the nigger school-houses and churches wich hev bin built here and there, and kindly take the nigger by the ear, and lead him back to his old quarters, wich is his normal position. The Yankee school teachers sent here by Freedmen's Aid Societies shood properly be hung for spreadin dissatisfaction and spellin books among the niggers, but I wood advise mercy and con. ciliation. Tar and featherin, with whippins, will perhaps do ez well, and will go to show the world that our justice is tempered with charity; that we kin be generous ez well ez just. Yoor Legislatures shood be instantly called together, and proper laws for the government uv the Freedmen should be passed. Slavery is abolisht, and the people must live up to the require- ments of the act in good faith. I protest agin any violation uv good faith, but labor must be done, for the skripter com- mands it, and our frail nature demands wat can't be got without it. We don't like to do it, but shel skripter be violated? Not at all. The nigger must do it hisself, not ez a slave, for slavery is abolished, but ez a free man.

The sakred precepts uv the Holy Skripters is bein daily violated by an insane majority, who hev substitooted their own noshens for the safe and pleas- ant revelashens uv Holy Writ, and the practices of their fathers. Cood Noah, when he cussed Ham, and declared thlat he shood be a servant unto his brethren, hev foreseen how his cuss wood hev bin disregarded in these degenerate days, lie wood, I boldly assert (and I make the assertion from wat I know uv tho char- acter uv that eminent navigator), hev kep sober, and not cust HIm at all. For wat's the use uv sich a cuss ef it's to be re- moved jist when you want it to stick? Hied it bin taken off afore cotton wuz profitable. and afore the Southern people lied learned to depend onto their labor, it wouldent lhev bin so bad, and they cood hev endoored it without murmurin. But, alas I not only is the South in a state of abject cussitood, but tho Northern Dimocrasy is likewise. The case stood thuswise: The South depended on the Nig- ger; and the Northern politicians, like me, depended on the South. The nigger wuz the foundashun upon wichll the entire structur rested; and now that he's knocked out, it falls. I wuz in Washington the other day, and wuz a unwillin wit- nis uv a scene wich filled me with unutterable disgust. The niggers wuz a celebratin suthin connected with their onnatural removal from their normal condishun, and wuz a paradin tho streets with bands uv music, and with banners and inscriptions. They hed the impudence to dress up in good clothes, - clothes wich I cood not afford to wear, - and three uv the impudent cusses hed the ashoorance to go so far in their imitation of The more reckless of President Johnson's new friends insisted that he should use the military power in his hands to enforce his policy - that he should treat the acts of Congress as nullities, and administer the government without its aid.  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7107-00000147"/> 276     WHAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD DO. human beins ez to make speeches; and to my horror, the mass uv em hed ben so well trained by somebody that they actily cheered, and ez near ez I cood make out got in the applause at the right place, and all without the assistance uv a indivijual to commence applaudin at the right time, wich we hev gener- ally found nessary at Dimmekratic meetins. Their inscripshuns wuz insultin. They bed em all spelt rite, and they wuz full uv alloosions to ekal rites, and onqualifyed suffrage, and sich, planely showin that the poor, misguided critters bed no idee that they wuz loaded down with a cuss and that becoz uv that cuss they bed no rites watever. In Richmond I saw other evidences uv the terrible breakin down uv the barriers wich Noah set up atween the races. I wuz sittin in a hoss car, when a nigger hed the onparalleled asshoorence to enter and set down. I remonstrated with the chattel, who laft in my face. Thus the old landmarks is bein removed, and thus the foun- dations uv society is a bein broken up. I saw in Richmond fair wimmin who hed, in olden times, never known wat labor wuz, a washin dishes, and cookin their own vittles; and I saw men, who hed wunst lived luxuriously on the labor uv a hun- dred niggers, now drivin drays, and sellin dry goods and gro- ceries, and sich, and my soul sunk within me. Wuz the cuss a mistake ? Wuz the nigger not the race that wuz cussed ? or has he becum so bleached, so lost in the white by amalgama- tion, that there ain't enough uv the black left in each indivijual for the cuss to hang to ?

Clear out the rump Congress; declare our Southern brethren entitled to their seats, and see that they hev em. The Dimocrisy uv the- North, wich wuz latterly for peece, are now fur war.

We met at the Corners last nite to jollify over the brave acts uv our Memphis frends, and I wuz the speeker. I addressed them on the subjick uv the nigger, - his wants, needs, and capacities,- a subjick, permit me to state, I flatter myself I understand. Probably no man in the United States hez given the nigger more study, or devoted more time to a pashent investigashen uv this species uv the brute creashen, than the The rebels of Memphis attempted the destruction of the negro school-houses and churches in May, 1866.

I have contemplated him sittin and standin, sleepin and wakin, at labor and in idleness, - in every shape, in fact, ceptin ez 'a free man, wich situashen is too disgustin for a proud Caucashen to contemplate him; and when he ariz before my mind's eye in that shape, I alluz turned shudderin away. I bed proceeded in my discourse with a flowin sale. It's easy demonstratin anythin yoor awjence wants to bleeve, and wich their interest lies in. For instants, I hev notist wicked men, who wuz somewhat wedded to sin, generally lean toward Universalism; men heavily developed in the back uv the neck are easily convinst uv the grand trooths uv free love; and them ez is too fond uv makin money to rest on the seventh day, hev serious doubts ez to whether the observance uv the Sabbath is bindin onto em. I, not likin to work at all, am a firm beleever in slavery, and wood be firmer ef I cood get start enuff to own a nigger. I bed gone on and proved concloosively, from a comparison uv the fizzikle structer uv the Afrikin and the Caucashen, that the nigger wuz a beast, and not a human bein; and that, conse- kently, we hed a perfeck rite to catch him, and tame him, and use hirn ez we do other wild animals. Finishin this hed uv my discourse, I glode easily into a history uv the flood; explained how Noah got tite and oust Ham, condemnin him and his pos- terity to serve his brethren forever, wich I'insisted give us an indubitable warranty deed to all uv em for all time. I warmed upon this elokently. "t Behold, my brethren, the beginnin uv Dimocrasy," I sed. "Fust, the wine (which wuz the antetype of our whisky) wuz the beginnin. Wine (or whisky) wuz necessary to the foundation uv the party, and it wuz forthcomin. But the thing wuz not complete. It did its Nwork on Noah, but yet there wuz a achin void. There wuz no Nigger in the world, and without nigger there cood be no Dimocrasy. Ham, my friends, wuz born a brother uv Japhet, and wuz like unto him, and, uv course, could not be a slave. Whisky wuz the instrument to bring himn down; and it fetched him.  Ham looked upon his father, and wuz cust; and the void wuz filled. THERE WUZ NIGGER AND WHSKY, and upon them the foundashuns uv the party wuz laid, broad and deep.   THE FOUNDATION STONE.       279 Methinks, my brethren, when Ham went out from the pres- ence uv his father, black in the face ez the ace uv spades (ef I may be allowed to use the expression), bowin his back to the burdens Shem and Japhet piled onto him with alacrity, that Democracy, then in the womb uv the future, kicked lively, and clapped its hands. There wuz a nigger to enslave, and whisky to bring men down to the pint uv enslavin him. There wuz whisky to make men incapable uv labor; whisky to accompany horse racin, and poker playin, and sich rational amusements, and a nigger cust especially that he mite sweat to furnish the means. Observe the fitness uv things. Bless the Lord, my brethren, for whisky and the nigger; for, without em, there could be no Dimocrisy, and yoor beloved speaker mite hev owned a farm in Noo Jersey, and bin a votin the whig ticket to-day." At this pint, a venerable old freedman, who wuz a sittin quietly in the meetin, ariz, and asked ef he mite ask a ques- tion. Thinkin what a splendid opportunity there wood be uv demonstratin the sooperiority uv the Caucashen over the Afri- kin race, I answered, "Yes," gladly. "Well, Mas'r," sed the old imbecile, " is I a beast?" "My venerable friend, there ain't nary doubt uv it." , "Is my old woman a old beastesses, too?" i"Indubitably," replied I. "And my children - is they little beasts and beastesses?" "Onquestionably." "Den a yaller feller ain't but half a beast, is hoe?" "My friend," sed I, "that question is - " "Hold on," sed lihe; " wat I wanted to git at is dis: dero's a heap uv yaller fellers in dis section, whose fldders must hev bin white men; and, ez der mudders wuz all beastesses, I want to know whedder dar ain't no law in Kentucky agin - " "Put himn out!"

"My white friends," sed he, " dar pears to be an objection to ' my reference to de subjeck uv dis mixin with beasts, so I won't i press de matter. But I ask yoo, did Noah hev three sons?"

And the disgustin old wretch threw his arms around my neck, and kissed me, callin me his " long lost brudder." The officer uv the Freedmen's Bureau laft vosiferously, and so did a dozen or two soldiers in the crowd likewise; and the awjence slunk out without adjournin the meetin, one uv em remarkin, audibly, that he had noticed one thing, that Dimoc- risy wuz extremely weak whenever it undertook to defend itself with fax or revelashun. For his part, he'd done with argyment. He wanted niggers, because he cood wallop em, and make em do his work without payin em, wich lie coodent do with white men. I left the meetin house convinst that the Soutlh, who worked the niggers, leavin us Northern Dimokrats to defend the sys- tem, hed the best end uv the bargain. PETROLEUM V.

CONFEDRIT X ROADS (wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky), 1 May 27, 1866. S To HS EXSLENCY THE DISPENSER UV POST ORFICES, ANDROO JOHNSON, PRESIDENT UV THE UNITED STATES. IN accordance with yoor esteemed request, dated the 25th, and received this morning, I to-wunst proceeded to make en- quiry ez to the workin uv the Freedmen's Burow, and the con- dishun uv the Afrikin citizens uv Amerikin descent in this vicinity. The fact that a Ablishnist still holds the Post Orfice at the Corners (wich place, by the way, I hev been solicited to accept), interfered materially with the biziness I hed in hand. I to-wunst tooted the horn, ez is the custom when we hev religious servis, and called my congregashun together. They come runnin in from the different groceries; and here another difficulty ensood. The grosery keepers wanted to know what we wuz a going to hev meetin on week days for? They wuz willin to shut up durin meetin time on Sundays, ez thcy re spected the church, and it give em time to sweep out the ter- backer, et settry; but they'd be d-d ef they wuz a goin to hev the people pulled away from their nourishment on week days. I succeeded in pacifyin em, and went in at wunst ex- aminin the leadin citizens. Their testimony is ez follows:-- CAPTAIN SKELPER WUZ a nigger owner afore the war, and durin the late fratrisidle struggle wnz a captain in the confedrit servis.

When they wuz slaves, never knowed em to refooze to work; know they alluz did work, becoz he generally stood over em with a nigger whip. Since they hev bin free, hez notist a change; not much uv a change, ontil the Nigger Burow wuz establisht. Before that they'd take sich wages ez yoo chose to give em; since then the d-d heathen will stand out bout ez the white men do, and won't work at all onless yoo meet their views, wich made a heap uv trouble, and ma. terially retarded the development uv the country. The Burow hed corrupted the female niggers; ez they hed all bin legally married by the Chaplins to the men they'd lived with, and wuz so sot on livin with em, that there's no yoose uv yoor tryin to get a house wench unless yoo took her husband also. His wife wuz now doin degradin work at home for want uv help. Strongly urged the abrogashcen uv the Burow, and the removal uv the Abolishn Postmaster at the Corners. DEACON McGRATH wUZ convinst in his own mind that the Afrikin wuz now out uv his normal speer, and that the infernal Burow wuz at the bottom uv it. The nigger, afore the Burow come around, wuz docile and easily controlled. His boy Joe wuz wunst a model nigger. He'd get up every mornin at 4 A. M. (wich means in the mornin), and work every day till after dark. Ez soon ez he wuz emancipated, ez they called it, and the Burow come, I told him to get up, one mornin; and he told me, impudently, that he'd concluded lie woodent. I undertook to chastise him with a fehnce stake, whereupon lie sailed in, and whaled me; and the Burow, to which I applied for redress, larft in my face. He left, and is now draggin out a miserable exis- tence in Ohio, on the beggarly pittance uv two dollars a day, and my farm is runnin to weeds. He conclooded by givin it ez his solemn opinion that he never cood be reconciled to the Gover- ment so long ez the Burow wuz tolerated, and that Ablishnist held the Post Orfis at the Corners. GINERAL DINGES considered the Blurow a inkubus upon the State. It interfered between master and servant. Cood git along better ef the nigger wuz left to the nateral laws wich regulates capital and labor. Tried to keep his niggers, and did keep em the past summer till after the crop wuz in, and then tried to settle with em for four dollars a month, with sich de-   HOW IT SPOILED THE NEGROES.      283 ductions for food, sickness, and broken tools, et settry, ez wuz just.

Hauled me up afore the Burow, and wuz forst to pay em each $15 per month. Consider the. Burow ez all that stands in the way uv rekonstruction, though the removal uv the Ablishun Postmaster at the Corners and the appintment uv a sound constooshnel Dimekrat wood grately assist in conciliatin the Kentucky mind. I tried to get some nigger testimony, but cood elicit nothing worth while. One nigger, who spends the heft uv his time at the Corners, wuz opposed to the Burow becoz it stopt rations on him. And Lucy, a octoroon, who formerly belonged to, and still resides with, Elder Gavitt (who is now absent ez a dele- gate to a Southern religious convention at Louisville), testified that the Burow " wuz no grate shakes," becoz bein ez the Elder wuz a widower, and the father uv all her cllildren, and bein she's a free woman, she askt the agent to malke the Elder marry her, and he woodn't do it. But sich evidence is irrelevont, and I didn't consider it worth while botherin yoor Exslency with it. Both, however, strongly insisted on the removal uv the Ablishun Postmaster at the Corners. ABSLUM PETTUS WUZ convinst the Burow wuz agin the pros- perity uv the State, and wuz underminin the moral and physikle welfare uv the nigger. It made him impudent. Hed sum uv em workin for him, and notist at noons and nites he'd find em with a spellin-book and a reader. Didn't bleeve in readin. Coodent read hisself, but hed a cousin wunst who learned; but ez soon ez he cood read he moved off to Injeanny, quit the Democrisy, and become a loathsum Ablishnist. Heerd he wuz killed in the war, and served him rite. Wanted to know what we wood do when the niggers cood all read. Sposed we'd hev to 'lect em to offis, ez the people alluz selected sich, when they cood find em. Didn't bleeve in nigger equality, and wuz in favor uv imediate change in the post orfice at the Corners.

Why, he whipped a nigger hand more than he ought, perhaps, and he died uv the injuries. It wuz a aggravatin case. The nigger wuz sassy, and it cost three hundred and sixteen dollars to pervide for his family. That infamous Burow made me pay for their rashens all winter. He asked, indignantly, ef this wuz or wuz not a free kentry into wich such things wuz permitted. And the Ablishen Postmaster at the Corners ap- proved the tyranikle action. He demanded his removal. I conceive it to be onnecessary to submit further testimony. I know not what luck yoor other commissioners may hev met with in takin testimony on this subjick; but in this vicinity there can't be no doubt that there can't be that love for the Government, without wich free instooshens won't flourish to any alarmin extent, ontil this monster is squelched. The testi- mony is unanimous, and them ez I hev examined are represen. tative men. You may hev notist, also, the singler unanimity with wich they all bore testimony to the necessity uv a change in the Post Offis at the Corners. I endorse all they say on this ques. tion, considerin that that change is ez necessary in the grate work uv pacifyin and conciliation ez is the removal uv the Bu- row. In case a change is made, 1 would say, for your guidance, that I hev been warmly solicited by my friends to accept the position, and to pacify em, hev at last yielded a reluctant con- sent. The fact that I never served in the Confederate army may be an objection; but, to offset that, I voted for Vallan. dygum twice. Ef possible, send me a pardon at the same time yoo send me my commission ez Post Master; for, if the Post Offis don't pay, I may want to run for some other office, in wich event that document would be essential to my success.

THEY hed a ruction in the church at the Corners yisterday, wich bid fair to result in a rendin uv the walls of our Zion, and the tearin down uv the temple we hev reared with -so much care and hev guarded with so much solissitood. When I say "we," I mean the members thereof, ez the church wuz reorganized sence the war by returned Confedrit soldiers and sich Dimekrats ez remained at home nootrel; but inasmuch ez I am the only reglerly ordained Dimokratic paster in these parts I ginerly conduct the services, and hentz hev insensibly fell into a habit uv speakin uv the church ez " my " church, and I feel all the solissitood for its spiritooal and temporal wel- fare that I cood ef I wuz reglerly ordained ez its pastor, wich I expect to be ef I fail in gettin that post offis at the Corners, wich is now held by a Ablishnist uv the darkest dye, wich President Johnson, with a stubbornness I can't account for, persistently refooses to remove. The case wuz suthin like this:- Deekin Pogram wuz charged by Elder Slather with hevin, in broad daylite, with no attempt at concealment, drank with a nigger, and a free nigger at that, in Bascom's grocery, and to prove the charge Deekin Slather called Deekin Pennibacker. The Deekin wuz put onto the stand, and testified cz follows: - "Wuz in Bascom's grocery a playin seven up for the drinks with Deekin Slather. Hed jist beet the Deekin one game and hed four on the second, and held high, low, and jack, and wuz modritly certin uv goin out, partiklerly ez the Deekin didn't beg.

The Court desires to know for herself whether it was really whisky. The pint is an important one for the Court to know. A wicked boy remarked that the pint wood be better onder. stood by the Court if it wuz a quart. The bottle wuz, how- ever, brought, and the Court, wich is me, wuz satisfied that it wuz really and trooly whisky. Ez the refreshin flooid irrigated my parched throat, I wished the trials based upon that bottle cood be perpetocal. I considered the case proved, and asked Brother Pogram what palliation he hed to offer. I set before him the enormity uv the crime, and showed him that he was by this course sappin the very foundashun uv the Church and the Democratic party. Wat's the use, I askt, uv my preachin agin nigger equality, so long ez my Deekins practis it? I told him that Ham wuz cust by Noah, and wuz condemned to be a servant unto his brethren -that he wuz an inferior race, that the Dim. ocrisy wuz built upon that idea, and that associatin with him in any shape that indicated -equality, wuz either puttin them up to our standard or lowerin ourselves to theirn; in either case   GUILTY, BUT JUSTIFIED.       287 the result wuz fatal. I implored Brother Pogram to make a clean breast uv it, confess his sin, and humbly receive sich punishment ez shood be awarded him, and go and sin no more. "Speak up, Brother Pogram," sez I, paternally, and yet se- verely. Brother Pogram, to my unspealkable relief, fobr lihe is the wealthiest member of the congregashun, and one we darsn't expel, replied,- "That he DID drink with the nigger, and wat wuz more, he wuz justified in doin it, for THE NIGGER PAID FOR THE WHISKY!!" "But, shoorly," I remarked, " it wasn't nessary to yoor pur- pose to come in with the nigger arm-in arm, --a attitood wich implies familiarity, ef not affeckshun." The Prisoner. - The nigger and I hed bin pitchin coppers for drinks, and I, possessin more akootnis, hed won. I took the nigger by the arm, fearin that ef I let go uv him he'd dodge without payin. They are slippery. Overjoyed, I clasped him around the nock, and to-wunst dismist the charge as unfounded and frivolous. "My brethren," sez I, " the action uv Brother Pogram is not only justifiable, but is commendable, and worthy of imitashun. Ham wuz cust by Noah, and condemned by him to servo his brethren. The nigger is the descendant of' Ham, and we are the descendants uv the brethren, and ef Noah hed a clear rite to cuss one of his sons, and sell him out to the balance uv theo boys for all time, we hev ded wood on the nigger, for it is clear that he wuz made to labor fobr us and minister to our wants.

THERE wuz joy at the Corners when the Postmaster (who takes the only paper wich comes to the office, ceptin a few wich comes to some demoralized niggers who hev learned to read, and the officers uv the Freedmen's Burow here) read to the crowd the news uv the canin wich Rosso, wich is uv Kentucky, give Grinnell. It sent a thrill uv joy through the State, wich ain't done thrillin yet. Bustin out into nine hearty cheers, we to-wunst organized a meetin for the purpose uv expressin our feelins on the momentous occasion. The bell wuz rung, the people gathered together, and I wuz elected Chairman (they alluz elect me to preside becoz I'm bald-headed; they think bald heads and dignity is inseparable), and Deekin Pogram Secretary, with 36 Vice-Presidents - one for each State. I made a short speech on takin the chair, congratulatin em on the auspicious event wich called us together. Whereupon a Committee on Resolutions wuz appinted, wich, after a short absence, reported ez follows:-- General Rosseau, in feeble imitation of Brooks, assaulted Mr. Grinnell, of Iowa, having been worsted in an argument. Kentucky, of course, indorsed Rosseau.   WHEREAS AND RESOLVED.       289 Whereas, Genral Rosso, a native-born Kentuckian, and there- fore a gentleman, hevin got into a argument with a Iowa sheep- breeder; and, Whereas, hevin got the wust uv the argument, he dextrously turned it into blackguardin; and, Whereas, hevin got the wust uv the blackguardin, he remem- bered the ancient usages uv the chivalrous sons uv the South, and caned him.; therefore, be it Resolved, That we, the Dimocrisy uv Confedrit X Roads, Wich is in the State uv Kentucky, hereby thank General Rosso for his manly vindication uv the character uv Kentucky. Resolved, That we know not wich to admire the most; the dashin Gineral's courage in bravin the public sentiment uv the North, or his prudence in selectin the smallest and physically weakest man in the House to demonstrate onto. Resolved, That ez Thad Stevens is 70 years of age, and lame, and hardly recovered from his fit uv sickness, we suggest that our beloved hero commence a argument with him, feelin that so far ez the argument and blackguardin goes the result will be the same, only so much more so ez to give him a good ex- cuse for killin him, wich wood be doin the South a servis indeed. Resolved, That the Dimocrisy uv Kentucky hevent felt so good sence the Memphis riots. Resolved, That this manly act uv Gineral Rosso's makes up and compensates the South for the outrage he inflicted onto her when he jined the vandal host Wich devastated her soil, and that hereafter he shel be receeved. with just the same cor- diality ez though he had gone into the Confedrit instid uv the Federal servis. Resolved, That the thanks uv the Dimocrisy are due the bold, brave men who accompanied and stood by General Rosso in this'vindication uv the Southern spirit. I put the affirmative, ez is the custom here, it bein the root when the leaders want a thing to pass, never to call for the nays,-and it went through all right., Then I arose, and stated I hed another resolution, wich I wished to offer, and I read it:- 19  &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7107-00000154"/> 290      THE EVERLASTING POST OFFICE.

He spozed this meetin wuz called to congratulate Ginral Rosso, and wat wuz the sense uv mixin up a paltry Post Offis with a matter uv so much importance ez the canin uv a Ablishnist? It was clearly out uv order. I replied, ' Wood yoo be glad, or wood this congregashun be glad, to hev me in the Post Orfis in the place uv that Ablishnist?" The Deekin replied that personally he wood. He had the highest respect for my massive talents and my excellent quali- ties uv head and heart, and besides, he thought probable, ef I got the Post Orfis, he wood stand a chance uv gettin the nine dollars and sixty-two cents borrowed money I owed him, and I called him to order at once. Bascom, who keeps the grocery, and who furnishes me with likker (wich I hev to take for my hair) on the strength uv remittances I am to receeve, insisted on hearin the resolution ef it wood further my gettin the Post Orfis, and so did the be- nevolent gentleman with whom I board, and I resoomed,-- "I kin see a good reason for incorporatin a resolooshun de- mandin a change in the Post Orfis into the proceedins uv this meetin. There wood be, my friiends, no yooseq uv sendin the President a naked resolution demandin this change, becoz he reseeves hundreds and tens uv hundreds uv applications for offices every day; in fact, they pile in at sich a rate that he never opens the half uv them.

The benevolent and confidin individooal I board with seconded the motion, and Deekin Pogram supported it in a short speech, statin that he understood that it wuz Brother Nasby's inten- tion, ef he succeeded in procoorin the position, to devote the first three and a half years' salary towards payin off the small indebtedness he hed contracted sence he lied honored the town by residin in it.

I notice a revival of the work in this part uv the Dimocratic vineyard wich reely cheers me. The demonstrashun our friends made in Memphis, the canin uv Grinnel by Rosso, and the call for a  Johnson Convenshun in Philadelphia, all, all hev conspired to comfort the souls uv the Dimocrisy, and encourage em to renewed effort. It is bringing forth fruit. Only last week five northern men were sent whirlin out of this section. They dusted in the night to escape hangin, leavin their goods as a prey for the righteous. Six niggers hev been killed and one Burow officer shot. Trooly there is everything to encour. age us.  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7107-00000155"/> '292        A PLAIN STATEMENT. The house wuz full. The weather wuz hot, and the pleasant incense uv mingled whiskey, tobacco, and snuff wich ariz wuz grateful to me. The sun shone in on Deekin Pogram's face ez he gently slept, and when the sun hits him square I kill alluz  tell wher he sets, even ef it is dark. He drinks apple-jack instead of corn whiskey, and chaws fine-cut tobacker instead  uv plug, and consekently when in the pulpit I kin distinguish the pecooliar aroma uv his breath from those around him. "My brethren," sed 1, " sich uv yoo ez hev Bibles in yoor houses, kin get somebody to read yoo the parable to wich I shel call yoor attention. A man, wunst upon a time, bed sons, ez many men hev since, and wun uv em wuz a tough one, who hed a taste for that pertikeler branch uv agriculture known ez sowin wild oats. He left his home and went into far countries, makin the old man shel out his share uv the estate, and he lived high, jist, my brethren, ez yoor boys do, or rather, did, when they went to Noo Orleans, in the days when yoo hed a nigger or two, wich yoo cood sell to supply em with money. He played draw poker and faro ; he drank fancy drinks, and boarded at big hotels; and he follered after strange women, which 'll bust a man quicker nor any one small sin the devil hez yet in- vented, ez yoor pastor kin testify. Uv course, his pile give out, and he got down, my friends, did this ingenuous yooth, to rags and wretchedness, and ended in being an overseer uv swine. What did he do? He ariz and went to his father, and the old man saw him afar off, and went out to meet him, and fell onto his neck, and give him a order for a suit of clothes and a pair uv boots, and put a ring onto his finger, and made a feast, killin for the purpose the fatted calf wich he hed saved for another occasion. "My friends, you kin find in the Skripter suthin applicable to every occasion, and this parable fits the present time like a ready-made coat. The South is the Prodigal Son. We went out from our father's house on a expedition wich hezn't proved altogether a success. We spent our share uv the estate, and a little more. We run through with our means, and hev cum down to rags, and dirt, and filth, and hunger. We are, and hevy bin some time, a chawin husks.

Our wallets is barren uv postal currency, and the grocery-kcepors mourn, and refuse to be comforted, becoz we are not. We hev got to the husk stage uv our woe, and wood be tendin hogs, ef the armies, wich past through these countries, hed left us any. We hev come back. In rags and dirt we hev wended our way to Wash. ington, and ask to be taken back. Now, why don't our father, the Government, fulfil the Skripter? Why don't it see us afar off, and run out to meet us? Why don't it put onto us a purple robe?  Where's the ring for our finger, and the shoes for our feet? and where's the fatted calf he ought to kill? My breth. ren, them  Ablishnists is Worse than infiddles--while they preach the gospel they won't practise it. For my part, At this point a sargent, belongin to that infernal Burow, who wuz in the audience, with enough uv soldiers to make opposin uv him unpleasant, sed he hed bin a sort uv an exhorter in his day, and desired to say a word in explanation uv that parable, ez applicable to the present time; and, sez le, " ef I am inter- rupted, remember I b'long to the church military, wich is, just now, the church triumphant." And cockin his musket he pro- ceeded, very much uninterrupted. "The prodigal son," sez he, " wuz received by the old man with considerable doins, but, my worthy friends, he went out decently. He didn't, ez soon ez he withdrawed from the house turn around and make war onto the old gentleman - he didn't burn his house and barns, tear up his garden, burn his fences, and knock down the balance uv his children. Not any. He went away peaceably, a misguided good-fbr-nothin, but yet a peaceable good-for-nothin. Secondly, he come back uv his own akkord.  The old man didn't go after him, and fight for four years, at a cost uv half his substance, to subdue him and bring him back, but when le hed run through his pile, and squandered his share uv the estate, and got hungry, he came back like a whipped dog. "My friends, let me draw a parallel between these cases.

The Con-  t federacy spent not only all it stole, but all it cood borrer, when r it knowed its promises to pay wuzent worth the mizable paper they wuz printed onto. "( The Prodigal, when he did come, come ez penitent ez the consciousness that he hed made a fool uv hisself cood make him. The Confederacy wuz whipped back, but it still swears hefty oaths that it wuz right all the time. 't The Prodigal didn't demand veal pot-pies, and purple robes,  and sich, but begged to be a servant unto the more sensible brethren wich stayed. The South comes back demandin office,   j uv wich the fatted calf, and rings, and purple robes is typical, 1 and considerably more share in the government than it had     before it kicked over the traces, and went out. "Spozn the Bible prodigal hed stopped his parient, and re-  l marked to him thus: ' I am willin to come back, on conditions. i Yoo must pay my debts - yoo must give me an ekal share uv the farm with the other boys - yoo must treat me in all re- specks just ez ef I hadn't gone out, and - this is essential - yoo must take with me all the sharpers who ruined me, all the gamblers and thieves with whom I fell in while I wuz away,    and make them head men on the place; and above all, I hev     with me the two harlots wich wuz the prime cause of my ruin, and they must hev eleven of the best rooms in the house, and must be treated ez yvour daughters.

At every turn I make that Burow stares me in the face, and counteracts my- best endeavors.

CONFEDRIT X ROADS (wich is in the Stait uv'Kentucly), ) July 28, 1866.  MY dreams, uv wich I hev hed many doorin the past five years, hevent bin overly pleasant; indeed, they hev taken more the shape uv hideous nitemares than anything else-- Linkin, Grant, Sherman, and armies dressed in blue, figurin extensively therein. But last nite I bed a vision wich more than repaid me for all I hev suffered heretofore. I lied bin at the Corners assistin in inauguratin a new grocery.  The proprietor wuz a demoralized Ablishnist who lied sold likker surreptitiously in Maine, among them Ablishnists, and conse- kently hed no idea uv the quantity a full grown Kentucky Democrat cood throw hisself outside uv. His entire capital with which he proposed to commence biznis wuz one barrel uv new corn whiskey, and some other necessaries, and ez a starter, The Philadelphia convention, which met a few weeks after the date of this "dream," followed very closely the suggestions contained in it.  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7107-00000157"/> 296        THE ORGANIZATION. to make the acquaintance uv his customers, he announced one free nite, and invited the entire community. His invitashun wuz considered generous, and we met it in the same noble sperit - in a more nobler sperit than the confidin and ignorant man desired, in fact; for when we got through, in about thirty-eight minits, there wuzn't a drop uv the whiskey left, and while the i new grocery keeper wuz a rollin uv us out, he wuz cussin his-  self for a fool. He didn't open agin; he consoomed his-stock in trade in givin the blow-out to sekoor customers. His stock, like A. Johnson's Unionism, didn't survive an inaugerashen. 1 succumbed in a fence corner, and, overpowered ez I wiz,  slept,                             I "A sweetly dreamin-                V Dreamin the happy hours away." Methought I wuz in Pliladelphia, and the 14th uv August had arriv. There wuz a glorious assemblage, ez Doolittle sed, ' uv the brains and hearts uv the. country, and I may add, ez I S and Humphrey Marshall wuz there, uv the bowels likewise.     The Convenshun wuz assemblin. There wuz Seward -present,    g engineerin uv it. On one side uv him I notist, in my dream, a shadowy bein with wings, draped in white, and wearin a     g melonkoly look, with one hand a lyin on his shoulder, a tryin  to take him but uv the hall, while another bein, with wings like a bat, hed him by. the nose, and wuz a twistin uv him jest ez  he desired. I notist that this last mentioned bein hed hoofs, I wich wuz split, and a tail wich he wuz flirtin in great glee. The bein with the tail and hoofs whispered suthin in Seward's  ear, whereupon he moved that that eminent patriot, Ex-Presi-  i dent FRANKLIN PIERCE, be chairman; upon wich the shadowy   ! bein in white unfolded her wings, and flew away, castin at   i William the most sorrowful look I ever saw, the hoofed and .  tailed individooal laughin tremendous. The Ex-President took the chair, and one Vice-President wuz appointed from each State, ceptin Vermont and Massachoosits. My buzzum swelled with emoshen ez that list wuz read; it wuz more like an old-   fashioned Democratic Convenshun than anything I hed heard fobr five long years. I heard the honored names uv Toombs and Rhett, Pryor and Lee, Slidell and Rosso, and Dandridge and Forrest; I heard the names uv Craven and Pollard,   WHO SHOULD BE ADMTTED. *      297 Thompson and Forsyth, and I felt like him uv old-- Mine eyes hev seen thy glory, now let thy servant depart in peace." Nothing but the certainty that I wood at last hev that Post Offis at the Corners kept me from goin up. Singler wat slen. der ties hold us to earth! The Secretaries wuz apinted, and then the committees - two on each from the South and one from the North, wiclh Nvu^ consiliatin. I wuz put on the committee on credcnshals, Ran. dall, the Postmaster-General, bein the Northern representative. We hed our hands fhll. There wuz a rush made on us, so many claimin seats that we locked the doors for two hours to decide what shood be the proper qualification fobr a place. Finally we agreed to admit ez delegates,- FROM THE NORTH -all Democrats who lied bin arrested by Linkin's minyuns; all officers who lied resined rather than to serve in a Ablishun war, and all Republikins who cood show a commishun ez Postmaster and sich, and (this wuz considered necessary to guard agin imposition) who wuz willin to tako his solemn oath that he wuz a steadfast bleever in everytlhing A. Johnson hed did sence Janooary, '66 (ceptin eum small items wich wuz specified), and all he wuz doin, and all he mite do. FROM THE SOUTH - all who cood show a officer's commission in the late Confedrit army; all who had receeved a pardon from A. Johnson, and all who bed lost their niggers in an unholy war, wich inclooded all present. This decided upon, the work wuz done. The delegates took their seats, and the grate work uv Reconstructin the Unyun commenced.  Garret Davis wanted to make a  speech, and a hall wuz hired for him in another part uv the city, and fifty or sixty German emigrants, who coodent understand a word uv English, hired at a shillin an hour to act ez audience. Five kegs uv lager beer, a  flooid wich I hev bin told Germans tio to, bed bin rolled in the hall, and most uv them stayed seven hours and a half. In the regler Hall there wuz a   comminglin which wuz edifyin. Doolittle wood make a  motion, and Vallandigham wood second it. Forrest made a speech, and Randall indorsed it. Seward and John Morrissey were on the Committee on  &#xD;<pb n="298" xml:id="VAC7107-00000158"/> 298         THE RESOLUTIONS. Resolutions, and Dick Taylor and Cowan were occupyin one seat. The resolutions were brief and to the pint. They resolved that,-- Whereas, there hed bin a season uv unpleasantness in our national history, wich, owin to circumstances over wich nobody hed any control, extended over several periods uv. ninety days- each; and Whereas, the unpleasantness resulted from the two sections viewin things each from its own standpint, instead uv viewin things from the other's standpint; and Whereas, both parties wuz highly in the wrong, partikelerly the North; and Whereas, the South, with a magnanimity unknown in history, hed thrown down her arms, and wuz ready to resoom her old position in the Government--nay, more, to take more than her old share in the trouble uv runnin the Government; therefore be it Resolved, That we are fobr the Union ez it wuz. Resolved, That the persistency uv a sectional Congress, in continuin the unpleasantness wich hez to some extent disturbed our system uv Governmelnt, in legislatin while eleven sovereign States is unrepresented, is pizen.             I Resolved, That we view with alarm the manifest determina- tion uv Congress to centralize in theirselves the law-makin power uv the Government, and we pledge our support to our worthy Chief Magistrate, who is a second Jaxon, in his efforts to check their centralizin schemes by vetoin all they may do. Resolved, That all traces uv the late onpleasantness may be wiped out ez soon ez possible, we demand uv Congress an appropriation for plowin over all the fields on wich the citizens uv the two sections who wuz indoost by their respective Gov- ernments, so-called, to carry muskets, cum together, particklerly them uv wich our Southern brethren got the worst uv the dis- putes that ensood.

Resolved, That we are willin, for the sake uv harmony, to admit that Sherman and Grant were, all things considered, worthy uv bein ranked with Lee and Jackson. Resolved, That the safety uv the Government demands that sich ez took part in the late unpleasantnis, from the Southern States, be to-wunst admitted to Congress, and to the other posishens wich they yoost to ornament, and that the more un- pleasant they Vwuz doorin the trouble the more they ought to be admitted. Resolved, That there be gushin confidences, we freely forgive the honored Secretary uv State fobr the too free use uv his little bell door in the late unpleasantnis, believin that he viewed things from his own stand-pint instead uv somebody else's, wich alluz causes trouble. At this pint, His Eggslency, Andrew Johnson, supported by Secretary Wells on the wun side and Vice-President Stephens on one other, with Bukanan in fiont and Toombs b;ehind, entered the hall. Sich a cheerin I never heerd. Hats wuz slung into the air, and seats wuz torn up. Proudly they advanced up the aisle, treading, ez they went, onto a portrait uv Linkin wich a enthusiastic Connecticut delegate tore from the wall and throwd before em. They took their position on the stage, General Buell holdin over em a Fedral flag, and General Henry A. Wise, uv Virginny, a Confedrit flag, both wavin' em to the music uv the bands; one a playin Dixie, and the other Yankee Doodle.

Johnson I Faugh!" and I notist that George spit ez tho' suthin in his mouth didn't taste well. In fact, the Father uv his country looked sick, and spreadin his wings, the sperit moved out uv the hall, shalkin the sperit dust off uv his sper- itool boots ez he shot thro' the sky-lite. There wuz then a blank in my dream. When I resoomed, I was at the Post-offis Department the next mornin. The gullotin hed commenced work, and the supporters uv the constitushun were reseevin their commissions ez postmasters ez fast ez four hundred clerks cood make em out. Ez I pressed forward, Ran- dall hisself give me mine. "Take it, my venerable friend," sez he, with tears a gushin down his cheeks; "take it. No more shall that Demokrat in your township who takes a paper reseeve it contaminated by the touch uv a Ablishin radical." At this critical pint I awoke.

After five weary trips to Washington, after much weary waitin and much travail, I hev got it. I am now Post Master at Confedrit X Roads, and am dooly installed in my new position.

Ef I do'ubt his Democrisy, I look at that blessed comnmission, and am reassured, for a President who cood turn out a wounded Fed- eral soldier, and appoint sich a man ez ME, must be above sus- picion. I felt it wuz coming two weeks ago. I received a cirkler from Randall, now my sooperior in offis, propoundin these ques- tions:  1. Do yoo hev the most implicit faith in Androo Johnson, in all that he hez done, all that he is doin, and all he may here- after do? 2. Do you bleeve that the Philadelphia Convenshun will be a convocashen uv saints, all actuated by pure motives, and devoted to the salvation uv our wunst happy, but now dis- tractid country? 3. Do yoo bleeve that, next to A. Johnson, Seward, Doolittle, Cowan, and Randall Are the four greatest, and purest, and best- est, and self-sacrificinest, and honestest, and righteousist men that this country hez ever prodoost? 4. Do yoo bleeve that there is a partikelerly hot place re- served in the next world for Trumbull, a hotter for Wade, and the hottest for Sumner and Thad Stevens? 5. Do yoo approve uv the canin uv Grinnell by Rosso? 6. Do yoo consider the keepin out uv Congris eleven sovrin states a unconstooshnel and unwarrantid assumption uv power by a secshnal Congris?- 7. Do yoo bleeve the present Congris a rump, and that (eleven states bein unrepresented) all their acts are uncon- stooshnel and illegal, ceptin them wich provides for payin \  salaries? i 8.

Are yoo willin to contribute a reasonable per cent. uv yoor salary to a fund to be used for the defeat uv objectionable Congrismen in the disloyal states North? To all uv these inquiries I not only answered yes, but went afore a Justis uv the Peace an took an affidavit to em, for- warded it back, and my commission wuz forthwith sent to me. There wuz a jubilee the nite it arriv. The news spread rapidly through the four groceries uv the town, and sich another spontaneous outhust uv joy I never witnessed. The bells rung, and for an hour or two the Corners iwuz in the wildest state uv eggsitement. The citizens congratoolated each other on the certainty uv the acceshun uv the President to the Dimocrisy, and in their ehthoosiasm five nigger families were cleaned out, two uv cm, one a male and tother'a female, wuz killed. Then a perceshun wuz organized as follers:- Two grocery keepers with bottles. Deekin Pogram. ME, with my commishun pinned onto a banner, and under it written, "In this Sign we Conker."

But there wuz anuther rea- son why he met to rejoice to-nite. It showed that A. Johnson meant biznis; that A. Johnson wtuz troo to the Dimolkrasy, and that he hed fully made up his mind to hurl the bolts uv offish thunder wich he held in his Presidenshal hands at his enemies, and to make fight in earnest; that he wuz goin to reward his friends - them ez he cood trust. Our venerable friend's bein put in condishun to pay the confidin residents uv the Corners the little sums he owes them is a good thing ("Hear!" "Hear!I  "Troo I " "Troo!" with singular unanimity from every man in the bildin), but wat wuz sich considerashuns when compared to the grate moral effect uv the decisive movement? ("A d--d site!" shouted one grocery keeper, and "We don't want no moral effect!" cried another.) My friends, when the news uv this bold step uv the President goes forth to the South, the price uv Confederit skript will go up, and the shootin uv nig- gers will cease; for the rbdempshun uv the first I consider ashoored, and the redoosin uv the latter to their normal con. dishun I count ez good ez done. Squire Gavitt remarked that he wuz too much overpowered with emoshun to speak. For four years, nearly five, the only newspaper wich come to that offis hed passed thro' the polluted hands uv a Ablishnist. He hed no partikler objccshun to the misguided man, but he wuz a symbol uv tyranny, and so long ez he sot there, he reminded em that they were wearin clhains. Thank the Lord, that day is over!

I hev spent many happy periods in the, course uv a eventful life; but I never knowd what perfeck satisfaction wuz till now. The first week I wuz married to my The famous Philadelphia convention, in 1866, was the most gigantic farce, ever played upon the political stage. An old political manager, Randall,. en-. gineered it, and did his best to make it impress the people, but it was an impossi- bility. The dead politicians of the twenty years previous seized this opportu- nity to air themselves, and their presence was sufficient to kill it. The entrance. of Couch of Massachusetts and Orr of South Carolina, arm-in-arm, was in- tended to be a particularly impressive scene, but the people put the proper esti- mate upon the claptrap, and laughed where they should have wept! The only effect of the gathering was a loud guffaw from Maine to the Ohio River. Mr..

Sweet ez wuz this week, it wuz misery condensed when compared to the season I hev jest passed through. I wuz a delegate to Philadelphia. I wuzn't elected nor nothin, and hedn't any credentials; but the door uv the wig- wain I passed, nevertheless. The door-keeper wuz a Dimqkrat, and my breath helped me; my nose, wich reely blossoms like the lobster, wuz uv yoose; but I spect my hevin a gray coat on, with a stand up collar, with a brass star onto it, wuz w'at finished the biznis. The Southern delegates fought shy uv lme; but the Northern ones, bless their souls 1 the minnit they saw the star on the collar uv my gray coat, couldn't do enuff for me. They addressed me ez Kernel and Gineral, and sed ," this wuz trooly all unmeritid honor,"7 and paid for my drinks; 'and I succeeded in borrowin a hundred and twenty dollars of em the first day. I mite hev doubled it; but the fellows wuz took in so easy that no financeerin wuz required, and it really wuz no amusement. The Convenshun itself wuz the most affectinist gatherin I ever witnist. I hed a seat beside Randall, who wuz a managin the concern, and I cood see it all. The crowd rushed into the bildin, and filled it, when Randall desired attention. He bein the Postmaster General, every one of em dropped into his seat ez though he hed bin shot, aund there wuz the most perfeck quiet I ever saw. Doolittle, who wuz the Cheerman, winked at Randall, and nodded his head, when Randall announced that THE DELEGATES FROM SOUTH KARLINY AND THE DELEGATES FROM MASSACHOOSITS WOOD ENTER ARM IN ARM I With a slow and measured step they come in: and, at a signal from Randall, the cheerin commenst-- and sich cheerinl I Then Doolittle   THE DEMOCRATIC BIRD.       307 pulled out his white hankercher, and applied it to his eyes; and every delegate simultaneously pulled out a white hanker- cher, and applied it to his eyes.

Orr, from South Caroliny, looked partikilerly ashamed of hisself; ez though he wuz goin thro a highly nessary, but extremely disgustin, ceremony, and wuz determined to keep up a stiff upper lip over it; and Couch looked up to Orr, ez though he wuz afeerd uv himia, and ez though he felt flattered by Orr's condecension in walkin at all with sich a umble individjooal. But, to my eyes, the scene wuz significant. I looked into the fucher, and wat did I see, ez them two men- one sneekin, and tother ashamed uv his- self- walked up that aisle? Wat did I see? I saw the Democrisy restored to its normal condishun. I saw the re. union uv the two wings. In fact, I saw the entire Dimokratic bird reunited. The North, one wing, and the weakest; Ken- tucky, the beak, sharp, hungry, and rapacious; South-west, the strong, active wing; Virginny, the legs and claws; Ohio, the heart; Pennsylvania, the stomach; South Caroliny, the tail feathers; and Noo Jersey, the balance of the bird, - I saw, these parts, for five years dissevered, come together, holdin nigger in one claw, and Post Offises in the other, sayin, ' Take em both together; they go in lots." I saw the old Union-- the bold, chivelrous Southerner a guidin, controllin, and di- rectin the machine, and assoomin to hisself the place uv honor, and the Dimokrat uv the North follerin, like a puppy dog, at his heels, takin sich fat things ez he cood snap up; the South- erner ashamed uv his associations, but forced to yoose em; the Northerner uncomfortable in his presence, but tied to him by self-interest. I saw a comin back the good old times when thirty-four States met in convenshun, and let eleven rule em; and ez I contemplated the scene, I too wept, but it wuz in dead earnest.

"Wat's the matter with the eyes uv all the delegates?" sez .  "They've all got Post Offisis in em," sez he; and he worked away faster than ever. While gettin a fresh handkercher (wich I borrered from the hind coat pocket uv a delegate near me, and wich, by the way, in my delirious joy, I fobrgot to say anything to him about)-, I looked over the Convenshun, and agin the teers welled up from my heart. My sole wuz full and overflowin, and I slopped over at the eyes. There, before me, sat that hero, Dick Taylor, and Cuth Bullitt; and there wuz the Nelsons and Yeadons, and the representatives uv the first families uv the South, and in PHLADELPHA, AT A CONVENTION, with all the leadin Demokrats uv the North, ceptin Vallandigham and Wood, and they wuz skulkin around within call, with their watchful eyes on the perceedins.

I didn't go back to the Convention, coz I knowd it wan't no yoose; and besides, after all the teers that hed been shed, the members wringin their handkerchers onto the floor,-it wuz sloppy under foot.

The Southern delegates, some uv em, wuznt so well pleased. "What in thunder," sed one uv em, " did they mean by pilin on the agony over the Yanks- we killed? by pledgin us to give up the ijee uv seceshen, and by pledgin on us to pay the Nashnol Yankee debt?"            \ "'Sh " sed I; "easy over the rough places.

AT TIIE BIDDLE M!OUSE (wich is in Detroit, Michigan),  September the 4th, 1866. STEP by step I am ascendin the ladder uv fame; step by step I am climbin to a proud eminence. Three weeks ago I wuz summoned to Washington by that eminently grate and good The famous tour of President Johnson was undertaken ostensibly in response to an invitation to assist in the ceremony of laying the corner stone of a monu. ment to the lamented Stephen A. Douglas, but really its object was to strength- en the Johnson movement. The President believed that his personal presence would stimulate his followers and overawe the opposition.

When I arrove they lied everything settled cepting the appintment uv a Chaplain for the excursion. The Presi- dent insisted upon my fillin that position, but Seward objected. He wanted Beecher, but Johnson wuz inflexibly agin him.   "I am determined," sez he, '; to carry out my policy, but I hev some bowels left. Beecher hez done enuff already, considerin the pay he got. No, no! he shel be spared this trip; indeed he shel." "Very good," said Seward; " but at least find some clergy- man who endorses us without hevin P. M. to his honored name. It wood look better." "I know it wood," replied Johnson; " but where kin we find sich a one? I hev swung around the entire circle, and heven't ez yet seen him. Nasby it must be." There wuz then a lively discussion ez to the propriety, before the procession started, of' remov-in all the Federal offis-holders on the proposed route, and appintin men who bleeved in us (Johnson, Beecher, and Me), that we might be shoor uv a soot- able recepshun at each pint at wiclh we wuz to stop. The Anointed wuz in favor uv it. Sez he, "Tlhem ez won't sup- port my policy shan't eat my bread and butter." Randall and Doolittle chimed in, for it's got to be a part of their religion to assent to whatever the President sez, but I mildly protested. I owe a duty to the party, and I am determined to do it. refusal a very unpleasant matter, and the President, who had a high opinion of his power before popular audiences, expected to convert the crowds which were certain to assemble to see these great warriors. The speeches he made on the trip are scarcely caricatured in the text. It was in this instance, as in the Philadelphia Convention. The ring of office-holders in each town through which the party passed, organized a ' tribute? to the President, and the people assembled in masses to do honor to Grant and Farragut, but invariably the President was greeted with unequivocal tokens of disapprobation. The venture was a ludicrous failure, and is fairly described in the text.  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7107-00000168"/> 312          THE START. "Most High," sez I, " a settin hen wich is lazy makes no fuss; cut its head off, and it flops about, for a while, lively. Lincoln's office-holders are settin hens. They don't like yoo nor yoor policy, but while they are on their nests, they will keep moder- itly quiet. Cut off their heads, and they will spurt their blood in your face. Ez to bein bnshoord of a reception at each point, you need fear nothing. Calkulatin moderately, there are at least twenty-five or thirty patriots who feel a call for every offis in your disposal. So long, Yoor Highnis, ez them offisis is held just where they kin see em, and they don't know wich is to git em, yoo may depend upon the entire enthoosiasm uv each, individually and collectively. In short, ef there's four offises in a town, and yoo make the appointments, yoo hev sekoored four supporters; till yoo make the appointments yoo hev the hundred who expect to get em." The President agreed with me that until after the trip the gullotine shood stop. Secretary Seward sejested that a clean shirt wood improve my personal appearance, and akkordingly a cirkular wuz sent to the clerks in the Departments, assessin em for that purpose. Sich uv em ez refoosed to contribute their quota wuz instantly dismissed for disloyalty. At last we started, and I must say we wuz got up in a highly conciliatory style. Every wun of the civilians uv the party wore buzzum pins, et settry, wich wuz presented to em by the Southern delegates to the Philadelphia Convention, wich wuz made uv the bones uv Federal soldiers wich led fallen at vari. ous battles. Sum uv em were partiklerly valuable ez anteek-s, hevin bin made from the bones uv the fust soldiers who fell at Bull Run. The Noo York recepshun wuz a gay affair. - I never saw His Imperial Highness in better spirits, and he delivered his speecll to better advantage than I ever heard him do it before, and I bleeve I've heard it a hundred times. We left Noo York sadly. Even now, ez I write, the remembrance uv that perceshun, the recollection uv that banquet, lingers around me, and the taste uv them wines is still in my mouth. But we hed to go. We hed a mishn to perform, and we put ourselves on a steamboat and started.   313 THE PROGRESS. ALBANY. - There wuz a immense crowd, but the Czar uv all the Amerikas didn't get orf his speech here. The Governor welcomed him, but he welcomed him ez the Cheef Magistrate uv the nashen, and happened to drop in Lincoln's name. That struck a chill over the party, and the President got out uv it ez soon ez possible. Bein reseeved ez Chief Magistrate, and not ez the great Pacificator, ain't His Eggslency's best holt. It wuz unkind uv Governor Fenton to do it. If he takes the papers, he must know that His Mightiness ain't got but one speech, and he ought to hev made sich a reception cz wood hev enabled him to hev got it off. We shook the dust off uv our feet, and left Albany in disgust. SKENACTADY. - The people uv this delightful little village wuz awake when the Imperial train arrived. The changes hadn't bin made in the offices here, and consckently there wuz a splendid recepshun. I didn't suppose there wuz so many patriots along the Mohawk. I wuz pinted out by sum one ez the President's private adviser- a sort uv private Secretary uv State ; and after the train started, I found jest 211 petitions for the Post Offis in Skenactedy in my side coat pocket, wich the patriots who hed hurrahed so vociffcrously hed dexterously deposited there. The incident wuz a movin one. "Thank God!" thought I. "So long ez we hev the post offices to give, we kin alluz hev a party." The Sultan swung around the cirkle wunst here, and leaving the Constooshun in their hands, the train moved off. UTICA.--The President spoke here with greater warmth, and jerked more originality than I hed before observed. He introdoost here the remark that he didn't come to make a speech; that he wuz goin to shed a tear over the tomb uv Douglas; that, in swingin around the circle, he hed fought traitors on all sides uv it, but that he felt safe. He shoed leave the Constooshn in their hands, and ef a martyr wuz wanted, he wuz ready to die with neetness and dispatch. ROME.- Here we hed a splendid recepshun, and I never heard His Majesty speek more felicitously. He menshuned to the audience that he hed swung around the Southern side uv the cirkle, and wuz now swingin around the Northern side uv it, and that he wuz fightin traitors on all sides.

I received at this pint only 130 petitions for the post office, wich I took ez a bad omen for the comin election. "OCKPORT.- The President is improvin wonderfully. He rises with the occasion. At this pint he mentioned that he wuz sot on savrin the country wich hed honored him. Ez for himself, his ambisbu wuz more than satisfied. He bed bin Alderman, Member uv the Legislacher, Congressman, Senator, Military Governor, Vice-President, and President. He bed swung around the entire circle uv offises, and all he wallted now wuz to heal the wounds uv the nashen. He felt safe in leavin the Constooshn in their hands. Ez he swung around the cirkle- At this pint I interrupted him. I told him that he hed swung around the cirkle wunst in this town, and ez yooseftul ez the phrase wuz, it mnight spile by too much yoose. At Cleveland we begun to get into-hot water. Here is the post to which the devil uv Ablishnism is chained, and his chain is long enough to let him rage over neerly the whole State. I am pained to state that the President wuzn't treated here with the respeck due his station. He commenst deliverin his speech, but wuz made the subjeck uv ribald laffture. Skasely bed he got to the pint uv swingin around the cirkle, when a foul-mouthed nigger-lover yelled "Veto!" and another vocif- ferated "Noo Orleans!" and another remarked "Memphis!" and one after another interruption occurred until His Highness wuz completely turned off the track, and got wild. He forgot his speech, and struck out crazy, but the starch wuz out uv him, and he wuz worsted. Grant, wich we hed taken along to draw the crowds, played dirt on us here, and stepped onto a boat for Detroit, leavin us only Farragut ez a attraction, who tried twice to git away ditto, but wuz timely prevented. The President recovered his ekanimity, and swung around the cir- kle wunst, and leavin the Cqnstooshn in their hands, retired. At the next pint we wuz astounded at seein but one man at the station. He wuz dressed with a sash over his shoulder, and wuz wavin a flag with wun hand, firin a saloot with a revolver with the other, and playin "Hail to the Chief!" on a mouth organ, all to-wunst.   THE PROCESSION OF ONE.       315 "Who are you, my gentle friend?" sez I. "I'm the newly-appinted Postmaster, sir," sez he. "I'm a perceshun a waitin here to do honor to our Cheef Magistrate, all alone, sir. There wuz twenty Johnsonians in this hamlet, sir; but when the commishn came for me, the other nineteen wuz soured, and sed they didn't care a d-n for him nor his policy, sir. Where is the President?" Androo wuz a goin to swing around the cirlle for this one man, and leave the Constooshn in his hands, but Seward checked him. At Fremont we bed a handsome recepshun, for the offises hevn't bin changed there, but Toledo didn't do so well. The crowd didn't cheer Androo much, but when Farragut wuz trotted out they gave him a rouser, wich wuz anything but pleasin to the Cheef Magistrate uv this nashen, who bleeves in bein respected. Finally -we reeched Detroit. This bein a Democratic city, the President wuz hisself agin. His speech here wuz wun uv rare merit. He gathered together in one quiver all the spark. lin arrows he had used from Washington to this point, and shot em one by one. He swung around the cirkle; he didn't come to make a speech, lhe hed bin Alderman uv his native town; he mite hev been Dicktater, but woodent; and ended with a poetickal cotashun wich I coodent ketch, but wich, ez near cz I cood understand, wuz, - "Kum wun, kum all; this rock shel fly From its firm base - in a pig's eye." Here we repose for the nite. To-morrow we start onward, and shel continue swingin around the cirkle till we reach Chicago. PETROLEUM V. NASBY, P. M.

Here my trials commenst. At the Biddle House, in Detroit, the nigger waiters showed how much a Afrikin kin be spiled by bein free. They hed the impudence to refoose to wait on us, and fobr a half hour the imperial stumick wuz forced to fast. This alarmin manifestation uv negro malignancy alarmed His Eggsalency. "Thank God!" sed he, " that I vetoed the Freed- men's Buroo Bill. I hev bin Alderman uv my native town-   - I hev swung around the entire cirkle, but this I never dreemed uv. What would they do if they hed their rites? The inci- dent made an impression onto him, and at Chicago he resolved to trust em no longer. He ordered his meals to his room, and sent for me. "My friend," sed he, " taste everything onto this table."  "Why? my liege," sed I. "Niggers is cooks," sed he, "and this food may be pizoned. They hate me, for I ain't in the Moses bizness. Taste, my friend." "But spozn,'" sed I, " that it shood be pizoned?  Wat uv my bowels?  My stumick is uv ez much valyoo to me ez yourn is to yoo." "Nasby," sed he, " taste! Ef yoo die, who mourns? Ef I die, who'd swing around the cirkle? Who'd sling the flag and the thirty-six stars at the people, who'd leave the Constooshn in their hands?  The country demands the  sacrifice; and besides, ef yoo don't, off goes yoor offish head." That last appele fetched me.  Ruther than risk that offis I'd chaw strilnine, for uv what akkount is a Dimolkrat, who hez wunst tasted the sweets uv place, and is ousted?  And from Chicago on I wuz forced to taste his food and lilkker-'to act ez a sort uv a litenin-rod to shed off the vengeance uv the nigger waiters. I wood taste uv every dish and drink from  . each bottle, and ef I didn't swell up and bust in fifteen minits At Detroit the colored voters refused to serve the President. At Indian- apolis his reception was anything but flattering. The excitable people were wrought up to the pitch of replying to. him in terms anything but complimen- tary, and the meeting broke up in disorder. The office-holders made amends, however, for they assembled the next morning, and he made his speech to them.   THE OUTRAGE AT INDIANAPOLIS.     319 His serene Highness wood take hold. I suffered several deaths. I resoom my diary:-- JOLIET. -The crowd wuz immense. The peasantry, ez the train approached, rent the air 'with shouts uv "Grantl" "Grant!"His Potency, the President, promptly acknowl- edged the compliment. He wuz sacrificin hisself for them- who bed made greater sacrifices? He lied bin Alderman uv his native town, and Vice-PIresident; lie wuz too modest to make a speech, but ef he wuz Joodas Iskariot, who wuz the Saviour? He hed swung around the cirkle, and hedn't found none so far. He left in their hands the- And so on, until near St. Louis, wlien we penetrated a Dim- ocratic country, uv wich I informed his Majesty. "How knowest thou?" sez he. "I observe," sez I, " in the crowds a large proportion uv red noses, and hats with the tops off. I notice the houses unpainted, with pig pens in front ov em; and what is more, I observe that crowds compliment yoo direct, instead of doin it, ez heretofore, over Grant's shoulders. The Knights, uv the Golden Cirkle, wich I spect is the identical cirkle yoo've bin swingin around lately, love yoo and approach yoo confidently." The President brisked up, and from this to Indianapolis he spoke with a flooidity I never observed in him before. I may say, to yoose a medikle term, that he had a Hemorrhage uv words. At the latter city our reception was the most flatrin uv eny we hev experienced. The people, when the President appeared on the balcony uv the Bates House, yelled so vocifer- ously for Grant, that the President, when he stepped forward to acknowledge the compliment, coodent be heard at all. He waved his hat; and the more he waved it the more compli- mentary the crowd became. "Grant!" Grant!" they yelled; and the more the President showed himself the more they yelled Grant, until, overpowered by the warmth uv the recepshun, and unwilling to expose his health, the President retired with- out slingin a speech at em, but entirely satisfied that the peo- ple wuz with him. The next mornin the office-holders uv the State, without the people, assembled, and he made his regler speech to em, wich appeared to be gratifyin to both him and them.

I REJINED the Presidenshel party at Looisville, and glad I am that I did it at that pint. His Imperial Serenity bed bin pleased ever sence he left Chicago, or rather sence he got near St.  Loois, for two thirds uv Illinois wuz pizen, and Indianapolis wuz pizener. From St. Loois the recepshuns wuz trooly corjel and even enthoosiastic. We got out uv the region uv aristo- crats, and hed come down to the hard-fisted yomanry. I seed holes thro the hats uv men; I seed wat. mite be called the flag uv Democrisy wavin from behind em, which, ez they genrally either had no coats at all, or if any, they were roundabouts, wuz alluz in view. I saw wimen who disdained stockins and dipped snuff, and I felt to home. I wuz among Democracy. The cheerin fobr Grant and Farragut closed ez we got into them regions, and uv the vociferous crowds half uv em, the The President's longing for a hearty reception was gratified at Louisville. The people of that city hurrahed for no one else. In that city Grant and Farragut were ignored.   A TOUCHNG INCIDENT.       321 younger ones, cheered Andrew Johnson, while the old veter- ans, them whose noses wuz blossomin for the tomb, cheered for Andrew Jackson. His Serenity smilinly acknowledged both, by makin a speech to em, and wavin his hat. With these preliminary remarks I resoom my diary:-- "OUISVILLE.--There wuz a magnificent demonstration here. His Imperial Majesty-, who wuz in a eggslent condition to make crowds large enough, remarked to me as we wuz ridin through the streets, "'Splen 'splay! 'Mor'n ten 'unerd sousand people - mor'n ten million people - mor'n ten 'unerd million people --mor'n ten 'unerd sousand million people--and alluvum 'sporters my policy. 'Rah for me!" His Majesty ondoubtedly eggsagerated towards the last; but it is safe to put the throng down at a good many.' That estimate is entirely safe. There wuz the finest display uv banners and sich I hev seen since we startid. The red, white and red wuz displayed from almost half the houses, ladies waved their h;andkerchiefs ez we passed, and men cheered. A pleasin incident occurd here. I noticed one gushin maiden uv thirty-seven wavin her handlercher ez the she wuz gettin so much per wave, and had rent to pay that nite. I recognized her to-wunst. When I wuz a citizen uv Ohio, and wuz drafted into the service uv the United States, and clothed in a bob. tailed blue coat, and hed a Oystran muskit put into my unwillin hands, and forced to fite agin my brethren, our regiment passed thro Looisville and stayed there some days. I wuz walkin one afternoon, when I met this identical angel. She saw my bloo kote, and enraged, spit in my face with sich energy that she threw out uv her mouth a full sett uv false .teeth. I returned em gallantly, wiped my face with my handkercher, and vowed thft handkercher shood henceforth be kept sacred. It wuz; and when I seed her wavin hern at our party, I wept lilke a Philadelphia Convenshen. I stopped the carriage, met the patriotic female, called her attention to the incident, and handed her my handkercher which hed, four years befbre, wiped her spittle. The incident gave new vigor to her arms, and from that time she waved two handerchers, and mine wuz one uv em. I narrated the incident to the President, and he wept. 21  &#xD;<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7107-00000173"/> 322        THE DIARY CONTINUED. There wuz a large perceshen and a great variety of banners. Among the most noticeable, wuz a company nv solgers uv the late war, each with a leg off, dressed in the gray uniforms into wich they hed bin mustered out, with this motto: "We are willin to go the other leg for A. Johnson." Another company uv solgers, who hed each lost an arm, carried this inscription: "What we didn't get by bullets, we shel get by ballots." The President cut down his speech jest one half here. In swingin around the cirkle he omitted to menshen that he found traitors on the Southern side uv it. But he left the constooshn in their hands cheerfully. CINCINNATI. - A very enthoosiastic recepshun - continyood   3 and loud cheers for Grant, wich the President acknowledged. A unsophisticated Postmaster, who jined us here, wanted to know why the people cheered for Grant instid uv the President, to wich His Highn'ess answered that they wuz considrit -they knew his modesty, and wanted to spare his blushes. Another man, who wuz also unsophisticated, asked him, confidenshelly, ef he didn't think there wuz a samenis in his speeches, and that ef he didn't think he'd do better to give a greater variety. His Eggslency asked him how there cood be more variety. "At Cincinnati," sed he, "I observed the followin order;-- "1. I swung around the cirkle; 2. I asked who wuz the Saviour ef I wuz Joodis Iskariot? 3. I left the Constitooshn, the thirty-six States, and the flag with thirty-six stars -onto it, in their hands.  Now, at Columbus, I shel vary it thusly:- 1. The Constitooshn, flag, andttars. , 2. The Joodis Iskariot biznis. 3. Swingin around the cirkle. "At Stoobenville, agin, ez follows: - "1. Joodis Iskariot; 2. Swingin around the cirkle; 3. Con'sti- tooshn, flag, and stars. "And so on. It's susceptible uv many changes. I thot uv that when I writ that speech, and divided it up into sections on purpose." JOHNSTOWN, PA.- A bridge fell down, onto wich wuz four hundred voters, killin a dozen uv em. His Eggslency felt releeved when heerin uv the axident, at bein asshoored that there wuzn't wun uv his supporters on the bridge. He con-   A SPONTANEOUS TRIBUTE.      323 sidered it a spesh Providence. The condukter overheerd the remark, and answered, that ef any uv his supporters wuz killed in that seckshun they'd have to import wun for the purpose. MFFLIN, PA. - A enthoosiastic indivijjle who wants the Post Office at this place very much, fell on the President's neck, and wept, hailin him ez the "Preserver uv the Union." The Presi- dent thanked him for this spontaneous triboot, and left in .his hands the Constitooshun, the flag, and the appintment he desired. BALTIMORE. - There wuz a spontaneous recepshun here, wich wuz gratifying to us. The percesltun wuz immense, and the mottoes expressive. One division wuz headed by the identikle indivijooel who fired the first shot at the Massachu- setts men in 1861. He is a ardent supporter uv President Johnson's policy. One flag wuz capchered from a Injeany regiment at the first Bull Run, at wich the President wept. "Things is becomin normal," sed he, " when the people will stand that. Wat love!- wat unity! The flags uv both sec- shuns, wich was lately borne by foes, now minglin in the same proceshun, and all uv em cheerin ME." At last we arrived at Washinton, hevin swung entirely round the cirkle, and found traitors North and South. The demon- strashen to greet the President on his arrival wuz immense. The clerks in all the departments wuz out (at least them ez wuzn't will wish they hed bin, ez their names wuz all taken), the solgers on duty wuz ordered out, and altogether it wuz the most spontaneous exhibition I ever witnest. The Mayor made a speech. The President asked if he wuz Joodis Iscariot who wuz the Saviour--told him he had swung around the entire cirkle, and hed found traitors on all sides uv it, though sence he left Cleveland, Chicago, and Indianapolis he wuz satisfied there wiuz the heft uv them in the North; but be this ez it ma:y, he left the Constooshn, and the thirty-six States, and the flag with thirty-six stars onto it, in his hands. He had bin Alderman uv his native village, and Congressman, and United States Senator, and Vice-President, and President, wich latter circumstance he considered forchinit, but wuz, after all, an Humble Indivij'le.

POST OFFIS, CONFEDRIT X ROADS     [  (wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky), l September 16, 1866.  I FOUND my flock in a terrible state uv depression, at which, when I was told the cause, I didn't wonder at. There wuz, back uv the Corners, over towards Garrettstown, about three quarters uv a mile this side of Abbott's grocery (we estimate distance here from one grocery to another), five or six families uv niggers. The males of this settlement had all been in the the Federal army ez soljers, and hed saved their pay, and bounty, and sich, and hed bought uv a disgustid Confederate, who proposed to find in Mexico that freedom which was denied him here, and who, bein determined to leave the country, didn't care who he sold his plantashen to, so ez he got greenbax, three hundred acres, wich they led divided up, and built cabins onto em, and wuz a cultivatin it. There wuz a store- keeper at the Corners who come here from. Illinoy, and who i   SPEECHES BY THE BRETHREN.      325 hed been so greedy uv gain and so graspin ez to buy their prodoose uv em, and sell em sich supplies ez they needed. These accursed sons and daughters uv Ham wuz a livin there in comfort. The thing wuz a gittin unendoorable. They come to the Corners dressed in clothes without patches, and white shirts, and hats on; and the females in dresses, and hoops under em ; in short, these apes I ed assoomed so much uv the style uv people that ef it hadn't bin for their black faces, they wood have passed for folks. Our people become indignant, and ez soon ez 1 returned, I was requested to call a meetin to consider the matter, which I uv course did. The horn wuz tootid, and the entire Corners wuz assembled, excepting the Illinoy store-keeper, who didn't attend to us much. I stated briefly and elokently (I hev improved in public speakin sense I heered His Serene Highness, Androo the I., all the way from Washinton to Looisville), and asked the brethren to ease their mind. Squire Gavitt hed observed the progress uv them niggers with the most profobundest alarm. He lihod noticed cm coming to the Corners, dressed better than his family dressed, and sellin the produx uv their land to that wretch- At this point the Illinoy store-keeper come in, and the Squire proceeded. - he shood say Mr. Pollock, and lie led made inquiries, and found that one family hed sold three hundred and seventy-live dollars worth uv truck, this season, uv which they lied laid out fobr clothes and books two hundred dollars, leavin em one hun- dred and seventy-five dollars in cash, which was more money than he had made sense the accursed Linkin passed the emancipashen proclamation. And what hed driv the iron into his soul wuz the fact that wun uv them niggers wuz his nigger. "The money they hev," pursood the Squire, "is MY MONEY; that man worth $1500 is my man; his wife is my woman; her children my children - " "That's -a literal fact I " shouted Joe Bigler, a drunken, re- turned Confederate sojer; " they hev yoor nose exactly, and they're the meanest yaller brats in the settlement."  &#xD;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7107-00000175"/> 326      POLLOCK ADVISES THE RESULT. This unhappy remark endid in a slite unpleasantness, wich resulted in the Squire's bein carried out, minus one ear, and his nose smashed. Joseph remarked that he'd wantid to git at him ever sense he woodn't lend him a half dollar two months ago. He was now satisfied, and hoped this little episode woodn't mar the harmony uv the meetin. Elder Smathers observed that he lied noticed with pain that them niggers alluz hed money, and wuz alluz dresst well, while we, their sooperiors, hed no money, and nothin to boast uv in the way uv close. He wood say - Pollock, the Illinoy store-keeper, put in. Ef the Elder wood work ez them niggers wuz workill, and not loaf over half- the - time at Bascom's grocery, he mite possibly hev a hull soot uv close, and now and then a dollar in money. It wuz here, ez it wuz in all strikly Dimekratic communities, the grocery keepers absorb all the floatin capital, and - He wuz not allowed to proceed. Bascom flung a chair at him, and fobur or five uv his constitooents fell on him. He wuz  carried out for dead. Bascom remarked that he wuz for the utmost freedom uv speech, but in the discussion uv a great Constooshnel question, no Illinoy Ablislinist shood put in his yawp. The patriotic remark wuz cheered, but when Bascom ask't the whole meetin out to drink, the applause wuz uproari- ous. Bascom alluz gets applause; he knowsh how to move an audience.

After service he felt pensive, ruther, and walked out towards Gar- rettstown, meditatin, as he went, on the sermon lie hed listened to that mornin on the necessity uv the spread of the Gospil. Mournin in sperit over the condition of the heathen, he'didn't notis whlere lie wnz till he found hisself in the nigger settle- ment, and in front uv one uv their houses.

They come to the Corners to sell the produx of' their lands; do they leave-their money at his bar? Nary! They spend sum uv it at the store uv a disorganizer from Iliinoy, who is here inter. ferin with the biznis uv troo Southern men, but lie hed never seed one uv em inside his door.

All he wanted wuz a bureau and a set uv chairs ihe hed seen. The motion wuz amendid to inclood Pollock, the Illinoy store. keeper, and it wuz to-wunst acted upon. Pollock wuz reconstructed first. Filled with zeal for the right, his door wuz bustid in, and in a jiff: the goods wich he wuz a contaminatin our people with wuz distributed among the people, each takin sich ez sooted em.

Some may censure us for too much zeal in this matter, but what else cood we hev done? We are high toned, and can't stand everything. These niggers hed no rite to irritate us by their presence. They knowd our feelins on the subjick, and by buyin land and remainin in the vicinity, they kindled the flame wich resulted ez it did. Ez they did in Memphis and Noo Orleans, they brought their fate onto their own heads. Pollock recovered, and with the Yankee school marm who wuz a teechin the niggers, left for the North yisterday. It speeks well for the forbearance uv our people that they wuz permitted to depart at all. PETROLEUiM V. NASBY, P. M. (wichl is Postmaster), and likewise late Chaplin to the expedishn.

I wuz sent for to come to Washington, fi'om my conmlbrtablo quarters at the Post Offis, to attend the convnshun uv sichl soldiers and sailors uv the United States ez bleeve in a Union uv thirty-six States, and who lhev sworn allegianco to a flag with thirty-six stars onto it, at Cleveland. My esteemed and life-long friend and co-laborer, Rev.

I didn't see the necessityr uv hevin a chaplin at every little convenshun uv our party, and so stated; but Seward remarked, with a groan, that ef ever there wuz a party, since parties wuz invented, wich needed prayin for, ours wuz that party. "And, Parson," sed lie, glancin at a list uv delegates, " ef yoo hev any agonizin petitions, any prayers uv extra fervency, offer em up fobr these fellers.

It was a failure quite as ludicrous as any of its predecessors. Tlhe officers who participated were, with a few exceptions, those who had left tilhe service under a cloud, or those who desired position. Generall Wool, tlen in his dotage, was induced to preside. Custar, who, above all thngs, desired thle colonelcy of a cavalry regiment, which he afterwards got, lent his name to it, and so on, ad nauseam. Like every movement made by the President, this con- vention was the cause of a laugh from one end of the country to the other.  &#xD;<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7107-00000177"/> 330      THE SOLDIERS IN ATTENDANCE. good Hevens! they'r mostly druv to it by hunger."

So, receevin'transportashen and sufficient money from the secret service fund for expenses, I departed for Cleveland, and after a tejus trip thro' an Ablishn country, I arrived there. AMy thots were gloomy beyond expression. I hed recently gone through this same country ez chaplin to the Presidential tour, and every stashen hed its pecooliar onpleasant remem- brances.

Why harrow up the public bosom, or lasserate the public mind? Suffice to say, I en- doored it suffice to say that I hed strengthx left to ride up Bank Street, in Cleveland, the scene uv the most awful insult the Executive ever receeved. The evenin I arrived, the delegates, sich ez wuz on hand, held a informal meetin to arrange matters so ez they wood work smooth when the crowd finally got together. Genral Wool wuz ez gay and frisky ez though he reely belonged to the last ginerashn.

They were, ' in a pekuniary pint uv view, suthin the worse for wear, tho' why that shood hev bin the case I coodent see (they hevin bin, to an alarmin extent, quartermasters and commissaries, and in the recrootin service), til I notist the prevailin color uv their noses, and heerd one uv em ask his neighbor ef Cleveland wuz blest withl a faro bank I! Then I knowd all about it. There wuz another pekooliarity about it which for a time amused me.

I notist on the countenances uv the first class a look uv releef, sich ez I hev seen in factories Saturday nite, after the hands wuz paid off for a hard week's work; and on the other class the most wolfish, hunglry, fierce expression I hev ever witnessed. Likewise, I notist that the latter set uv patriots talked more hefty uv tile necessity uv sustainin the policy uv our firm and noble Preli- dent, and damned the Ablishnists with more emphasis and fervency than the others.

Seward (his secretary and chaplin) to draw up and publish to the De- mocracy of the various States holdin elecshuns this fall an ad- dress, or ruther an appeal, firmly beleevin that hed he extendid his tour to Maine, and isshood an address 'to em, that that State wood not hev gone ez it did. William refoozed to take part in the appeal, sayin that it warnt uv no use, and so the dooty devolved upon me. DEMOCRATS AND CONSERVATIVES UV THE NORTH: Appresheatin the gravity uv the isshoo, I address yoo. The signs uv the times is ominus. A Radikle Congress, electid durin the time when the Southin States, wich comprises reely all the intellek uv this people, didn'ttake no part in the elek- shen, bein too bizzy gettin out uv Sherman's way to open polls, --a Congress, I repeat, in which there ain't no Southern man, and wich consekently kant, by any stretch uv the human imaginashen, be considered Constitooshnel, hez dared to thwart the President uv the United States, and set up its will agin hisn! I need skarcely recount its high-handed acts uv usurpas. shen. It passed a bill givin rites to niggers, wich, accordin to   THE SINS OF CONGRESS.       335 Scripter (see Onesimus, Ham, and Hagar, the only three texts in Scripter uv any partikeler account) and the usages uv the Democrisy, ain't got no rites; and the President, exercisin the high prerogatives put into his hands by the Constitooshen, vetoed it. Here the matter shood hev endid. He lied ex. pressed, in a manner strikly Constitooshenel, his objecshens to the measure; and a proper regard for his feelins, and just deference for his opinions, ought, to hov indicated the right course. Here wuz peace offered this Congress. Here wuz the tender uv a olive branch. The President didn't want a quarrel with Congres; lie didn't desire a continuance uv the agitation wich lied shook the country like a Illinois ager; but he desired Peece. Congres cood lhev hed it hed they only withdrawed their crood nosliens uv what wuz rite and what wuz wrong; ratified, ez they shood hev done, sich laws ez the President saw  fit to make: in short, hed they followed the correct rool when we hev a Demoklatic President, and put the Government in his hands, withan abidin trust in his rectitood and wisdom, we mite hev avoided tills struggle, and thus wood hev bin peaceful. But tlhis reckless Congris, bent upon con- centrating power in its halnds instid uv dividin it between him and Seward, passed the bill over his head, regardlis 'uv his feelins! Thle responsibility for the dissension rests, therefore, with Congres. But these questions are altogether too hefty for the Dem. okratic intellek, and I fling em out fobr the considerashen uv the few Post Masters we got from  the Union ranks. To the Dimocrisy I address myself more partickerlerly. Do  YOU WANT TO MARRY  A NIGGER? Tlis ishoo is agin before yoo.  Are you in favor. uv elevatin the Afrikin to a posishen wliere he kin be yoor ekal, or perhaps yoor soopirior? That ishoo is agin before yoo for yoor decision, only the danger to yoo is increased. The matter has become threatening; for, disgise it ez we may, thousands uv em kin read, and they are accumulatin property, and wearin good  clothes to a extent trooly alarmin to the Dimokratic mind. We hev alluz consoled ourselves with the sodthin reflection that there wuz a raco lower down in, the scale uv humanity than us'uns. Shall we continue to enjoy that comfort?

Remove the weight uv legal disability, and ten to one ef they don't outstrip us even, and then where are we goin to look for a race to look down upon? It's a close thing atween us now; and ez we uv this generation can't elevate ourselves, why, for our own peace uv mind, we must, - I repeet it, - MUST pull them down. Agin then I repeet, Do YOU WANT TO MARRY A NIGGER? Yoor daughters wunst carried banners onto wich wuz inskribed  that trooly Dimokratic motto, "White husbands or none!" and in consequence they've bin mostly livin in the enjoyment uv none. Are they to go back on that holy determinashen to preserve the Anglo Sackson race on this continent in its  purity? Do yoo want the nigger-the big buck nigger- the flat-footed nigger -the woolly-headed nigger-the long- heeled nigger - the bow-legged nigger - the NIGGER - to step up aside uv yoo, and exercise the prerogatives uv freemen in this country? Do you want the nigger aforesed to be mayors uv your towns, with all the hatred they hev towards us? Wat chance, O Dimokratic dweller in cities! think yoo yoo'd hev if hauled up afore a nigger mayor on a charge uv disorderly con. duct'? Wat chance wood yoor children hev in a skool uv wich all the teechers wuz niggers? Wat chance wood yoo hev wen arrestid for small misdemeanors, afore nigger judges? How, let me ask, in the name uv High Heaven, wood yoo like to be tried for hoss stealin afore a nigger jury? "But,' say some uv yoo, who, set ravin by drums, and flags, and sich, went off violently into the war, and wuz, perhaps, saved from starvin by niggers, " these niggers wuz our friends in the late war - they fougllht agin the South!" O, wat a deloosion! O, wat blindnis! Troo, they did; and that shows the danger that's afore us; that lifts the fog from the precipice onto wich we are standin, and shows us our danger. Wat does this fact prove? It proves the onreasona- bleness uv the Nigger- his discontentednis with the posishen to wich nacher assigned him, and his cussid disposition to upset the normel condition. The Bible makes him a servant unto his brethren (see Ham, Hagar, and Onesimus, three blessed texts). Science proves him to be, not a man, but a beast; and so, take him ez we may, either ez our brother or ez   THE MAGNANIMTY OF THE SOUTH.     337 a beast, -and Dimocrisy, with that liberality wich hez always distinguished it, gives every man his choice wich theory to take,- his condition is servitood. But he, with a cussidness, a perversity wich I never cood understand, flies into the face uv the Divine decree, flies into the face uv science, and asserts his independence! He turned agin them ez lied fostered him.; turned agin, in many instances, his own parents (in these instances, for convenience, the parents adopted the brethren theory), and for an abstract idea fobught agin em. Tllhat rest- lessness under bonds alarmed the Dimocratic mind. We who owned em under the Skripter (see Onesimus, Hagar, and Ham), and under the eternal laws uv scientific trooth, wuz content with the arrangement, and why shood they not hev bin? Things wuz normal. They worked, and we eat; and ef they hed bin content with this elditable division uv the labor uv life, all wood hev bin smooth to-day. Their takin part agin us at the South, and in favor uv the Federals, is, instead uv a coz uv feelin good toward cm, a source uv oneasiness; instid uv bein ai reason for elevatin uv em, it's my principal reason for depressin uv em.  Sich onsettled minds shood be quieted; thhis itclin to raise their- selves shood be crushed out uv em, that Scienice and Holy Writ (see Onesimus, Hagar, and Ham) may be vindicated. Shel we desert Androo Jolhnson, after all the trouble he hez bin to in gettin back to us? Sliel we elect a Congres this fall so soaked in Ablishin--so filled with objeckshuns to our Southern brethren, ez to refooze to receive em back into tlhe seats which they vacated? Consider! The Southhern Dimok- racy hevn't, and don't, lay up nothin agin yoo. They are willin to forgive and fobrget. They failed, but they are willin to forgiv the cause uv the failyoor. They hevn't got the gov- ernment they wanted, but they find no fault with tlhat, but are willin to take charge of the wun they hev bin compelled to live under. Kin they offer ftairer? The fate uv war wuz agin em. Buryin all hard feelins, they extend to us Chrischen charity, and say, Here we are - take us - give us our old places. They hev bin chastened.

The results of the elec- tions in Ohio, Injeany, Pennsylvany, and Iowa reached me yesterday through a Louisville paper, wich wuz dropped off the cars at Secessionville, wich is the nearest station to us, and wich, I hapnin to be there, I picked up.

In fact, two weeks before, in view of the expected success uv the Democracy, a meetin hed bin held on the subject. Some wuz for at once seezin the niggers wherever they cood be found, and puttin em at work; but the conservatives overruled this. They held that slavery hed bin abolished, and that it ought not to be restored; in fact, tlat, to act in good faith, it cood not be reestablished. Deekin Pogram announced a plan. The town authorities shood pass a ordinance for the proper government uv the niggers. Their good and ourn demanded it. For instance, they shood not be permitted to be out after 7 o'clock, P. M., in the evenin; they shoodent leave the planta- tion onto wich they wuz employed; they shood work every day till 7; and to do away with the pernicious work uv the Freedmen's Bureau, no man and wife wich led bin married by a chaplin uv the Bureau, or by any one else, slbood be employed on the same plantashen, and also no father or mother and child. Sich ez violated these ordinances shood be arrested by any- body, and fined; and in default uv payment uv the fine and costs, shood be sold to the person who wood take his or her labor for the shortest number uv years, and pay the fine and costs aforesed.

Taxes they had got used to, and that didn't move em; and so the speakers wuz emptyin school-houses by tallkin uv the results uv a glorious war, wich they all opposed, and praisin our mutual friend Seward, wich they had alluz blated as a Ablishnist, and hedn't heerd yet that he had jined the Demokracy. Wuz it any wonder that we went under? Ther ain't but one thing left to us, and that we strangely neglected. My liege, why wuz not the NIGGER made the central figger this year, ez be-   ! fore? They is the capital uv the Democrisy, its refuge, its tower of strengthl. I spoke in Berks county myself, following  one of them new-fangled Democrats, who hed set em,all asleep   \ talkin stuff to em that they didn't understand. Mountin the rostrum, I ejaculated, - ' MEN AND BRETHREN, DO YOO WANT TO MARRY A NIGGER?" "No! no! they answered, straightenin up to-wunst. "' Do you want niggers for sons-in-law?' "' No! no! ' "'Do you want laws to prevent you from marryin nliggers?' "'Yes! yes '  "' Do you want to be marched up to the polls by those who tell you how to vote, beside a nigger?' "'No  no!'                           "'Then vote the Demekratic ticket.' And they all re- plied, -- "' We will! we will!' and they did. You see, your Ex- slency, the Dimekratic mind isn't hefty enough to comprehend them fine arguments ez to constitootinality, et setry; and when a speaker deals in em, they suspect his Dimocrisy, and fight shy uv him. But nigger they kin all understand. It's soothin to the Dimekratic mind to be continyooally told that there is   THE MAIN PILLAR.        345 somebody lower down in the skale. They desire a inferior  * race, and therefore hev bin pullin the nigger down toward em for years. Did yoo not notis whenever we went it on the nig- ger we succeeded in awakenin an enthoosiasm, wich, when we neglected him, or selected other issues, wo failed to get? "It's based upon philosophical trooths. The poorer and meaner a man is, the more anxious he is to hev it understood that there's somebody still poorer and meaner than him. Hence, you notis, that them individooals who see a five cent peese so seldom ez to not know its nacher, and who keep the flag of distress wavin from the scat uv their pants, - who, ef niggers wuz sellin at a cent a peese, coodent raise enough to buy the toe nail uv one,-is the most ardent friends uv Slavery. "That pitiful man wich jest- left the presence wuz not to blame fobr the result in his Decstrick. He tried to earn his bread; but wat cood he do?  The Ablishnists knowd he wuz bought with a price, and laffed at him. The Dc'nocrisy, sich ez voted, we'd hev got anyhow. Them ez didn't vote, nor do nothin, wuz the upper class, wich expected the offises them- selves, and wuz disgusted accordinly. "My liege, I hev spoke. Yoo can't do nothin with a new party; for yoo kin only git the Dimocrisy to jine it, and they won't do it onless the bffises is throwd in. Yoo can't run tlhe Dimocrisy on only one issue, and tliat's the nigger; for it's all they kin understand.  So long ez the nigger exists, Dimocrisy endoors; when the race becomes extinct, the party dies. The two is indissolubly bound together; one wuz created for tother, and tother for one. When Noah cust Ham  he laid the foun- dashens uv Dimocrisy.  Ham wuz turned into a nigger because Noah got intoxicated.  His misfbrtune originated with wine e; and whisky, wich is the modern substitoot therefor, bein thelo motive power uv Dimocrisy, hez bin perselkutin lhim ever since. I attriboot the decline uv the Dimocrisy to the bleachin out uv the Afrikin, and that's why I oppose amalgamashen. Yoo can't hate a  mulatter only half ez much ez yoo kin a full-blood; and it will be observed that the intensity uv Demokricy has de- creased precisely in proportion to the scarcity uv pure blacks. Thus Demokrisy is committin suicide; it hez bin the means uv its own destruction.  &#xD;<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC7107-00000187"/> 346        PRESIDENT OR KING.

The Conference ended with this: for they wuz all too much. affected to say anything.

It's ther nateral diet. Last nite I partook uv a pound or so too much, and ez a consekence, didn't sleep well. While I wuz eatin (moistnin my lips with Looisville consolation the while), I wuz a musin onto Seward's question, whether they wood hev Johnson Presi- dent or King, and while musin I fell into the arms uv Morfus. My mind bust loose from the body and sored. Ez I sunk to slumber, the narrow room, wich is at wunst my offis and dormi. tory, widened and enlarged, the humble chairs become sudden- ly upholstered in gorgus style, the taller dip become multiplied into thousands uv gorgus chandileers, the portraits uv His Highness the President, and the other Democrats' on the wall, became alive. I comprehended the situation to-wunst. ANl- DROO JOHNSON had cut the Gorjan, knot with somchoddy's sword: and lied carried out his Policy to its nateral concloo- sion. He was King, and wuz reignin under the title uv ANDROO THE I., and I wuz (in my dream uv course) in Ihis kingly halls. It wuz, methawt, a reception nite. His High Migltiness wuz a sittin onto a elevated throne, covered with red velvet, and studded with diamonds, and pearls, and onyxs, and otler precious stones- onto his head wuz a crown, and lie wuz enveloped into a robe uv black velvet, his nose and the balance uv his face gleaming out like a flash uv litcnin firom a thunder cloud. -Lyin prostrate at the foot uv the throne, doin the oqfis uv a footstool, wuz Charles Sumner, wunst Senator, wichl wuz typikle uv the complete tritumph we hed won over our enemies; while doin other menial offices about the halls, wuz Wade, Wilson, Fessenden, Sherman, and others who hed opposed ththo change from a Republic to a Kingdom.

"Dook de Davis!" was ejackelatid, and Jeffson entered. "'Earl von Toombs," "Sir Joseph E. Johnston," "Markis de Boregard," "Count de Pollard," and so forth. Noticin that the titles I hed heerd wuz mostly tacked to Southern men, I asked Giddy Wells, who wuz standin by, why it -wuz thus, and he sed that Northerners wuzn't reely fit for it. We wuz, he said, a low, grovlin race, and coodent adapt our- selves to the habits uv nobility. The South wuz chivelrus, and cood do it. They wuz given to tournaments and sichll- they hed got accustomed to cirkus clothes, and cood wear a sword without its gettin awkwardly between the legs. North- ern men, sich ez were faithllful, wuz allowed to bask in the smiles uv royalty, but it wuz in sich positions ez sooted their capacity. He, fobr instance, hed charge uv the royal poultry yard, a position which he bleved he filled to the entire satisfac- tion uv his beloved and royal master. He hed now four hens a settin, each on four eggs, and he hoped in the course uv two years, ef there wuz no adverse circumstances, to hev fresh eggs for the royal table. It wuz a position uv great responsi- bility, and one wich weighed upon him. Seward wnz privy counsler, Doolittle wuz steward uv the household, and Thurlow Weed wuz Keeper uv the King's revenue, and wuz a doin very well indeed. By this time the company assembled. His Highness wuz in a merry mood, and unbendid hisself. Ther wuz a rknot uv the nobility gathered in a corner, and after a earnest interview uv a minnit, Count Von Cowan advanced to the foot uv the throne, and on bendid knee demanded a boon. "What, my f:aithful servitor, dost thou most desire?" sed His Highness. "We wood, Your Majesty, hev the prisoners uv state brof into the presence, that we may make merry over em.." "It shel be done," sed Hi's Majesty, and forthwith Baron von Steedman, who hed command uv the King's Household Body Guard, wuz sent for them. In a moment they wuz brot in.

Some one exclaimed, "Bring in Thad Stevens!" at wich His Majesty turned pale, and his knees smote together. "Don't, don't!" sez he; " he's strength enuff left to wag his tongue. Keep him away I keep him away I " and he' showed ez much fear ez men do in delirum tremens when they see snakes. Methawt I made inquiries, and found that things wuz workin satisfactory. General Grant wuz in exile,'and General Sheri- dan hed bin decapitatid fobr refoosin to acquiesce in the new arrangement.

The principal men uv the North lied been capeherd and subdooed, and wuz a fillin menial positions in the palaces uv the nobility. No Lord or Dook or Earl considered himself well served onless he hed a half dozen Northern Coln- gressmen in his house. while the higlier grade uv nobility wuzn't content with anythin less than Guvners. The indebt. edness uv the South to the North hed bin adjustid. A decree hed bin ishood to the effect that Northern merchants who shood press a claim agin a Southerner shood be beheaded :and his goods confistikated. The question uv slavery lied bin settled forever, for the Democratic ijee uv one class to serve and one class to be served wuz fully establisht. There wruz now three classes uv society, the hereditary nobility, the untitled officials, and the people; the latter, black and whte, wuz all serfs, and all attached to the soil.

HENRY WARD BEECHER, GENERAL CUSTAR, HENRY J.. RAYMOND, AND      HON. JOHN   MORRISSEY, EACH ANXIOUS   TO   PRESERVE   HS REPUTATION. - A SAD TIME AT THE WHTE HOUSE. CONFEDRIT X ROADS (wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky), 1 November 7, 1866.  I wuz called to Washington by our patron Saint, the Presi- dent, to comfort his wounded sperit. There ain't no disguisin the fact, - the sperit of Androo Johnson is wounded. He hez endoored the slings and arrers uv more outrajus fortune than any other man who hez lived sence the days uv Hamlit; more, After the October elections had settled the fate of the Johnson party, there was a terrible scattering of his forces. Many Republicans, who had secured the places they coveted, made haste to find more respectable political quarters, and those who had failed, of course deserted him. The Democracy having dis- covered that he had no strength that they could use, left him in a body, and returned to their old camp. He was a sinking ship, and the political rats all deserted him.   "ETTER FROM BEECHER.       351 indeed, than Hamlit endoored, twict over. Hamlit's fither wuz pizoned, and his mother married agin afbre her mournin clothes wuz wore out-- suthin no savin,prudent woman would do; but what wuz that to wat A. JOHNSON endoors every day? Nothin. The cabinet meetin to wich I wuz summoned wuz called for the purpose uv sheddin a tear or two over the election returns, and to consider a variety uv letters wich His Eggscellency lied receeved within a few days. 1 may remarlk that the cabinet bed a gloomy and mildewed look. The fhst wuz from Rev. Henry Ward Beecher. Mr. Beccher remarked that he had the hig'hest possible respeck for the offis wunst held by the good Washington, the great Adtams, and tho sainted Linkin. He omitted remarkin anythin about Pccrco and Bookanan, out uv regard for the fecclins uv the present incumbent, wich, ef he hed read History correct, w uz a ardent supporter uv the Administrashens uv both uv tlhem men, wich he considered stains upon the pages uv American history wich he cood wish mite be obliterated. But wat lhe desired to say wuz, that he bed a higher regard for the good opinion uv man- kind in general than he hed for the good opinion uv the acci- dental incumbent uv any offis; and ez lhe hed, in a hour uv temporary mental aberrashen, wich hed happily passed, endorsed the Administrashen, wich insanity hed worked evil unto him, he'rekested, ez a simple act uv justice, that the President shood cause it to be known that he (Beecher) wuz not considered by the Administrashen ez a supporter thereof. "1 do this," sed the writer, b becoz the impression that I am in the confidence uv yoor Eggslency, wich is onfortunately abroad, hez seriously DAMAGED MY REPUTASHEN. "Trooly yoors," et settry.  The readin uv this letter wuz follered by a minit uv profound silence, wich wuz broken by the President. "Let him pass," sed the great man who hez the dispensin uv the post offisis, "let him pass. But here is another," sed he, bustin into teers; "read that." It wuz from Gen. Custar, him uv the yaller hair, wich hed some reputashen doorin the war ez a cavalry commander. It  &#xD;<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC7107-00000190"/> 352        CUSTAR AND RAYMOND. wuz to the same effect. He hed, when he sposed that the policy uv the President, wich he esteemed ez he must any man who held the exalted position wunst okkepied by the good r Washington, the great Jefferson, and the sainted Linkin- ("The ongrateful dog doesn't respect ME!" sed Androo; " it's the offis I fill;" and he bust into a fresh flood. - When he spozed the President's policy wuz sich ez a soljer and patriot cood endorse, he endorsed it. But he diskivered that it led him, back foremost, into company wich, doorin the late war, he lied alluz visited face foremost and on hossback; and therefore, to SAVE HS REPUTASHUN, lihe must beg that the President wood give it out that he (Gen. Custar) wuz not, nor never bed bin, a supporter uv his policy, and oblige Yoors trooly, ez before. I wuz too hart-broken at this to make any reply, and Cowan and Doolittle wuz in the same fix. The Kernelcy wich wuz given to Custar to keep him in posishen, bed bin promised to a Demokratic captin, who wuz led by a company in the first Bull Run fight, and who threw up in disgust the next day, not likin the manner in wich the war wuz bein conducted; but now the Kernelcy wuz gone, and Custar too; and wat wuz worse, there wuz no sich thing to be thot uv ez dismissin him. The entire company united in minglin their teers. The next letter wuz read by Seward, ez it wuz addressed to him. It wuz from Raymond. He opened with the remark that for the Presidential office he hed the highest respeck. Aside from the considerashen that it hed bin wunst okkepied by the good Washinton, the great Adams, and the sainted Linkin, the President mite be considered the Father of his country, hevin so large a number of helpless children to provide for; and besides, he hed a instinctive respeck for the dispenser of any- thing. It wuz difficult for him, bein a open and simple-minded man, not to adhere to the President; but - "Good Heavens!" shreeked Johnson, " that little fox ain't a goin to speak uv His reputashen!" "Dooty requires the reedin uv the entire dockeyment, pain- fuil to my feelins ez it may be," sed Seward. "l He concloods thusly -   HON. MR.

A editor out West, who wuz sedooced into takin a Post Offis, begged to hov it taken off his hands, tlhat he might save his circulashcn before it wuz everlastinly too late. And finally we come to wun, the seal' uv wich wuz a coat-uv-arms - bull dog rampant, bowie- knife couchant, supported by trottin horses, on a field uv green cloth. It wuz firom Hon. John Morrissey, who lied jest ben elected to Congress in Noo Yolrk. Mr. Morrisey remarked that, ez one uv the pillars uv the Democrasy, he felt he hed a rite to speek. He wished it to be understood that he washed his hands uv any connection with Johnson or his party. He lied seed a litce. In States where the Delnocrasy, uv wich he wuz a pilleL, lied tied themselves to Johnson, they lhed gone down to a prcmatoor grave. Re- speck for the high offis restrained him from sayin that tho Democrasy coodent carry sich a cussid leoad; but he wood say that the result uv the election in Noo York, where they de- pended solely on muscle and nigger, wich is the reel Democratic capital, and succeeded, while where the Democrasy wuzi. loaded down with Johnsonism, they failed, satisfied him that the P1 resi- dent wuz a inkubus. He sed this with all doo respeck for the offis. Mr. Morrissey further remarked that he hed also pcrsoncl reasons for makin this request. He commenced in a humble position, and led filled the public eye long enuff to satisfy his modist ambishen. He hed walloped Sullivan and Heenan; lie hed owned the fastest horses, and won more money at faro than any- man in Amerika. His ambishen wuz satisfied, so fihr ez lihe wuz concerned; but he lioped to leave behld hinm, for his infiant son (wich wuz only twelve years uv age, and wich hed a development uv intelleck and muscle remarkable for one so tender, hevin already walloped every boy in the skool to wich 23  &#xD;<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC7107-00000191"/> 354         A BROKEN HEART. he wuz a goin), he desired to leave that son a honorable name. It hed bin given out that he wuz a supporter uv the individooal who okkepied the Presidenshel offis, and it wuz injoorin him. He wished that stigma removed. A REGARD FOR HS REPU- TASHEN forced him to insist upon it. And this epistle wuz dooly signed, his JOHN X MORRISSEY, M. C. mark.            ! There wuz silence in the Cabinet. This last stroke intensified the gloom wich hed settled onto the Government; and ez I turned my tear-bedewed eyes, I saw the great drops coursin down the cheeks uv every one present. Mr. Seward retired    I without sayin anythin about ninety days, and one by one they all departed. It wuz a solemn time. There wuz other letters yet to be read, but no one hed the heart to open em. I made a move in that direckshun, but Androo prevented me. "I'm sick," mur- mured he, in a husky voice, which showed that his hart wuz peerced. "Help mne to bed." I saw the great man bury his intellectool head beneath the snowy kivrin uv his oneasy colch, all but the nose, which in him is the thermometer uv the sole, and which accordinly glowed, not with the usual brilliant hue, but with a dull, dead, and ghastly bloo. Noticin the convulsive heavins uv the kivers, which betrayed the agitashen uv the breast beneath, I whispered in his ear, ez I handed him his nite drink uv rye whisky flavored with bourbon, that he hed one hold, ez Delaware hed sustained him. A flush uv satisfaction passed over his nose, but it subsided in an instant. "Troo," gasped he, "it's ourn now; but before the next election a couple uv them Massachusits ablishnists will buy the dussid State, and re-people it to soot em;" and he gave a convulsive gasp, and sank into a troubled slumber. It wuz a tetchin occasion. PETROLEUM V. NASBY, P. M. (wich is Postmaster).   A SERMON.          355 CX-XIII.

WHEN the news uv the result of the Illinoy election reached the Corners, there wuz a feelin uv oneasiness wich was trooly affectin; but when the crushin intelligence arove that Hoffman wuz beeten in Noo York, there wuz a prostration wich wuz only ekalled when the intelligence of Lee's surrender reached us. We expected defeat in Illinoy, and some of the other States, but we hed hopes that Noo York wood go Dimocratic, that His Eggslency mite hev some show uv backin by the peo- ple, and consekently some excoose for continyooin to enforce his policy. But that hope wuz taken from us, and uv the entire populashen, I wuz the only one who hed suffishent stamina to preserve the semblance uv cheerfulness, and that wuz only on akkount uv my hevin the Post Offis.

Still, I felt over- whelmed, and sorrowfully I entered Bascom's. There, with their heads bowed in sorrer, and tears flowin from their vener- able eyes, sot Deekin Pogram, Elder Slathers, and a few others of the Saints, who, ez I entered, mekanikally rose, and stood afore the bar; mekanikally Bascom, who wuz likewise bowed down with grief, sot out the invigorator; mekanikally we dosed ourselves, and still in a daze, mekanikally I moved out without payin, Bascom bein too full uv sorrer to notis it. It wuz deemed proper, in a view uv the great calamity, that services shood be held in the church, and at 2 P. Mt.-wich with us mite be said to mean post mortem - we slowly and sadly filed in, the only smilin countenance in site bein that uv a nigger at the door, who wuz to-wunst beitid over the head for lookin happy.  &#xD;<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC7107-00000192"/> 356      A SERVANT UNTO HS BRETHREN.  I gave out the hymn, -                    j "Broad is the road wich leeds to death," - and it wuz sung with tetchin pathos. After the weepin bed subsided, and I got my feelings calmed down so ez to permit me to speek, I commenst explainin to em the causes uv the result. It wuz, I sed, a chastenin sent onto us for our sins; a stripin becoz we hed exalted our horn in our pride; that, gloryin in the possession uv the post offices, the collectorships, the assessorships, and sich, we hed become vainglorious and puffed up, and careless in performance uv dooties. Ther wuz niggers in Kentucky a goin about free, and impiously settin at naught the decrees uv Providence, wich condemned em to be servants uv their brethren ; and here I digressed to eloocydate a pint. I hed seen stricters in a Boston paper onto the common practice uv amalgamashen in the South, wich paper held up the practis to the condemnashen uv pious men. "I My breth- ren," sed I, " them Boston Ablishnists hev no deer understandin uv the Skripter. When Ham wuz cust by Noar, wat wuz that cuss'? He shel be a servant unto his brethren.' Not unto strangers; not unto the Philistine, or the Girgeshite, or the lillerite, but unto his brethren I How cood he be servant unto his brethren except thro amalgamashen? Onless we amalgamated with em, how wood the male niggers be our breth- ren? O, my brethren I we wuz obliged to do these things, that the Skripters mite be fulfilled; and to the credit uv the Southern people, be it sed, that they never shrunk from the performance uv that dooty. The per cent. uv yeller nigghrs in this State attests how faithful Kentucky hez bin." But to resoom. We hev sinned in permittin skools to come in, and unfit em for their normal and scriptural condishen; but these is not all. My brethren, go to Esq. McGavitt's, and get the township Bible, and search till yoo find this yer text: - l And no man putteth new wine into old bottles, else the new wine doth bust the bottles, and the wine is spilled." My brethren, wich is the bottles? The Dimocrisey, uv course; and the most uv em may be considered old ones.

The Ablishnists wich follered Johnson, uv course. New wine is frothy; so wuz they. New wine fizzes; so did' they. New wine hez strength ftr a minnit; so hed they . New wine is unreliable; so wuz they.

So wuz the Skripter fulfilled. And, my brethren, while yoo are at the Squire's huntin up that text, keep on till yoo find another, to wit:- c, No man also seweth a piece uv old clotli onto a new garment, else the new piece that filleth it up takctlh it away from the old, and the rent is made worse." My hearers, Democrisy went to Philadelphy in a soot uv gray, wich' it led bin a wearin for five years. It wuz trooly old, and ther wuz greevious rents in it, made Inostly by bayonets, and sich. O, why wuzn't we content to wear it? Why wuz we not satisfied with it? Agin wuz the Skripters fulfilled. We patched up the Confedrit gray withl Federal blue; we put onto the back, Seward; onto the knees, Randall; onto tlhe shoulders, Cowan; and onto the seat.

I NEVER wuz so elevated, nor never so cast down, in my life, ez last nite, and the entire Corners wuz ditto. The circum- stances uv the case wuz ez fbllows: Me and a party uv friends wuz a playin draw poker with a Noo York commershel travler, I believe they call em, a feller with a mustash and side whis- kers, wich comes South a talkin secesh and a sellin goods. He made some inquiries about the standin uv the deelers at the Corners, and wuz, arter sed inquiries, eggstreemly anxious to sell em goods, for cash. They wanted em on ninety days' time, and on this they split. He agreed with em in principle - he drank to Jeff Davis, and damned Linkin flooently - but on the cash question he wuz inflexible and unmovable. To while away the rosy hours, a knot of choice sperits, him inclooded, gathered in the Post Orfis, to enjoy a game uv draw poker. There wuz me and Square Gavitt, and Deekin Po-gram, and Elder Slathers, and the Noo York drummer. We played till past the witchin hour of 12 M., when graveyards yawn and gosts troop forth--when the New Yorker suckumd. His innocent, unseasoned bowels hedn't bin eddicated up to the standard uv Kentucky wliiskey, wicl, new ez we drink it, is pizen to foreigners. The Deekin and Elder grabbed the stakes wich wuz onto the table, and rifled his pockets on the suspishen that he wuz a Ablishinist, and rolled him out, and wliile in the very act, Pollock, the Illinoy storekeeper, cum rushin in, askin us ef we'd heerd the news. We ansered yoonanimusly that we hedn't. "I'm jist in from Looisville," sed he; "I jist rode over from the stashen. Looisville is in a blaze uv glory!" -The rebels of the Southlern States desired nothing so much as relief from the disabilities enforced upon them as the result of their crime, expecting that through amnesty they would find some way of regaining control of their former slaves.  &#xD;<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC7107-00000194"/> 360    THE JOY WHCH FILLED THE CORNERS.

They hev met and embraced on    1 Horris Greely's plan."                     S Deekin Pogram bust into a hysterical laff, and in his joy handed me the proceeds uv his explorashen uv the pockets uv the Noo Yorker, and like a blessed old lunatic broke for the meetin-house. In a moment or two the bell pealed forth its joyous notes, and in a minit more the half dressed villagers   y wuz seen emergin from theilr respective domliciles in all stiles  uv attire. A few minits sufficed to make them understand wat  t wuz the occasion uv the uproar, and a more enthoosiastic popu- lation never woke the ekkoes. Athre five minutes lhed rolled off into eternity, thler wuz a bonfire blazin on the North -side 8 uv the square, the sed bonfire bein a nigger skool-house wich the Freedmen's Commishn led erected, and wich our enthoo- siastic citizens hed in their delirium uv joy set fire to. It was  emblematic. The smoke cz it rolled to the South methawt assoomed the shape uv a olive branch -- the cry uv the nigger children wich coodent escape. symbolized their desertid con-  dishn, and the smell uv em, ez they roasted, wuz like unto  incense, grateful to our nostrils. A informal meetin wuz to-wunst organized by the lite of the ? burnin skool-house, to wich Deekin Pogram addressed hisself. He remarked that this wuz a solemn occasion, so solemn indeed  i that he felt inadekate to express the feelins wich filled him. His mouth wuzn't big enough to give vent to his sole, though   } ef he didn't he'd bust. "Wat are we met for to-nite, my  friends?" sed he; " wat calls us togetlher? Wherefore these sounds uv joy--wherefore this fire, and wherefore is Bascom sellin likker at half price? Becoz we are rehabilitated - that's wat we are. Becoz the North hez gone into the olive branch bizness agin, and we hev wunst more our rites. We are am-. nestied.. We kin vote - we kin go to Congress--we are agin citizens uv the great Republic."  Pollock, the Illinoy storekeeper, riz and begged permishn to    MODERATE QUALIFICATIONS.      361 say a word. He protested agin these doins. He understood, akkordin to Horris Greely's plan, that universal suffrage wuz  to follow universal amnesty - why then this makin Joln Rod- gerses uv the niggers? Wuz the South a goin to act in good faith? Deekin Pogram replied: Tlhe South never yit broke plighted faith save when she cood make suthllin by so doln. At this present junkter uv afl-airs lie prcsooened the South wood extend, not precisely universal suffiage to the niggers, but the way wood be opened to em.

They ain't fit for the ballot now, and ef we make em so, it overturns our theory, wich we can't do. Still we propose to be just to em.

We shel give every wun uv em the ballot who is able to reed the Greek testament flooently and pass a credible ex- aminashen in Latin, embroidery, French, German, English Grammar, and double-entry book-keepin.

There must be laws prohibitin em from receivin more than $4.50 per month, that they may not become bloated aristocrats and pampered sons uv luxury -the proper development of the country, and likewise the payment of the Confedrit debt, requires manuel labor, wich we wuz never edjucated to do, and therefore the good of the whole requires that they shel resigne their persnel libetty so fur ez to be confined to the plantashuns, onto which they hev engaged to laber, that they may relijusly do sed laber, which is cleerly nessary, for yoo see ef I hire a nigger in Janooary, I must not be exposed to the chances uv his quittin me in July.

It is onnecessary to recount the further doins uv the nite.

The Deekin remarked that it wuz painfuil; but the fact wuz, Elijer must hev a ejucashen. He didn't bleeve in ejucashen, generally speekin. The common people wuz better off without it, ez ejucashen hed a tendency to unsettle their minds. He lied seen the evil effex uv it in niggers and poor whites. So soon ez a nigger masters the spellin book and gits into noose. papers, he becomes dissatisfied with his condishn, and hankers after a better cabin and more wages. He to-wunst begins to insist onto ownin land hisself; and givin his children ejucashen, and, ez a nigger, for our purposes, ain't worth a soo markee. Jes so with the poor whites. He knowd one meloncolly in- stance. A poor cuss up toards Garrittstown, named Ramsey, learnt to read afore the war, and then commenst deterioratin. For two years he refoozed to vote the Dimocratic ticket, then he blossomed out into a Ablishnist, and tried to make the others uv his class discontented by tellin uv em that Slavery wuz wat kept them down, and finally, after pashense ceased to be a vir. choo, and we tarred and fethered him one nite for a incendiary, he went to Injiany. That cuss cum back here, doorin the late onpleasantniss, kernel of a regiment, wich he campt on my farm and subsisted em off it. Sum ejucashen is, how ever, nessary. I design Elijer for Congris, and he must hev it. He's a true Pogram, and nothin will strike in wiclh lkin hurt him. "Why not," sez I, " that the Southern yooth may be properly trained, start a College uv our own? Why, Deelkin, run risks uv hevin the minds uv our young men tainted with heresy?" The entire company wuz struck with the idea, and it wuz earnestly canvassed, and finally decided upon; and I wuz deppytized to start it, wich 1 immejitly did. The name by wich the new college is to be known is "The Southern Classikle, Theologikle, and Military Institoot uv Confedrit X Roads (wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky)." The college grounds is to comprise one hundred akers taken from corners uv the farms uv Deekin Pogram, Elder Slathers, and Capt. McPelter, wich ground they sell the college, seein it's for that purpose, for $300 per aker.

I iEERD, nearly two months ago, that my old friend, John Guttle, uv Mobeel, Bed departed this life, and gone to that other and better world where the wicked cease from troublin and the weery are. at rest, and wuz profbundly shocked. John Guttle wuz my friend, and I much feer his like I ne'er shall look upon agin.  He wuz a Democrat uv the old skool, one uv the few links wich remaned to connect the present generation with the past. Well do I remember the glorious old man I How often hev I sat in the square room in his country resi- dence, and drunk whisky and water with him till we neither on us could see a hole thro a forty-foot ladder; how many times hez he flogged niggers for my amoozment, to show me the proper way uv managin uv em; and how many times hez he lent me small sums uv money, varyin from  five to thirty-one dollars, akkordin to the state uv mellernis he wuz in when I approached him on the delikit subjik I Alas I poor John Gut- tle.

I mourn becoz I loved him, and becoz uv the misfortunes which druv him to a prematoor grave. A. Linkin is responsible for this dark shadder onto my path- way. John Guttle hed three hundred niggers on his plantashens and in his house in town - these wuz wrencht from him by the Proclamashen, and turned out friom his paternal care to starve, which the most uv em are industrously doin at $3 per day. He hed em uv all hues - there wuz the full-blooded Black, the disgustin Mulatter, the pleasant Quadroon, the beautiful Octo- roon, and them which bed so nearly lost the cuss of Ham ez to be hardly distinguishable from' the pure Caucashun; and it wuz noticeable that the nearly white njggers on the Guttleses plantation wuz all beautiful. The Guttleses theirselves wuz perfeck specimens uv manly beautLy, and it probably hed its effeck upon the blacks. The nigger is a imitative animal. It wuz this robbin uv him uv his property - this overturnin uv the normal condishn uv things - which killed John Guttle. He never held up his head after the Proclamashen, but faded away like a frostid flower! I wuz in Mobeel last week on biznis connected with our college (it wuz solisitin funds to endow my Professorship), and I felt that I cood not leave the sity without droppin a dozen teers or sich onto the grave. I felt, ez he hed contribbitted at various times so much to moisten my clay, that it wood be ungentlemanly not to do suthin toward moistenin hizzen. And in pursuance uv my resolve, I wended my way sadly to the cemetary, and, findin the tomb, struck an attitood uv dispair, and leanin pensively onto the monument, strove, to the best uv my ability, to weep, but it wuz a futile endeavor. My eyes woodent give down. I strove to recall his virchoos, but sich is the weaknis uv human nacher that whenever his form rose in my memory, my mind involuntarily wandered to his whiskey, and my mouth would water to sich an extent ez to monopolize all the moisture in my sistem. I cood hev spit onto his grave, but weep I cood not. Alas for poor humanity I When I wuz a standin there tryin to weep, and makin bad work uv it, I notist three beautiful young ladies approachin,   THE MEETING OF THE DAUGHTERS.     369 witlh baskets ov hot-house flowers a hangin onto their arms.

It wuz a techin site; and feelin that I wuz a introoder, not bein a blood rela- shun, and only connected with the deceiest by notes uv hand, I J withdrew a short distants. Skasely lied they got to the tomb, when from the other side approached three more ravishinly beautiful young ladies, with baskits uv hot-house flowers onto their arms. The last ones resembled in a strikin manner the fust ones, exceptin they wuz a shade darker, and their ]hare waved bootiful, whereas the hare uv the fust wuz perfeckly strate. The two parties faced each other on opposite sides uv the toom, and party Number One glared fiercely at party Number Two. "L ize! Flora!

The oldest wun cood stand this impudence no longer, and droppin her basket, went for her, followed by her sisters. It wuz a sperited conflict, and lasted perhaps four minits, or until I parted em, when they gathered themselves together, and departed - one party went one way, and tother, tother. Fillyel love hed done more in the strewin biznis than it sot out to do. The six lovin daughters uv the deceest John hed not only strewed flowers onto his grave, but hair, and collars, and buzzum pins, and shreds uv silk, and water-falls, and cotton, and false teeth, and pieces uv almost everything which goes to make up the sum total uv female attire. Ez I gazed at the wreck and saw their tattered forms vanish in the dim distance, I could not help admittin that when it come to strewin the graves uv deceest ancestors, there wuz sum disadvantages attending the patriarkle system.

Kernel Podgers is a gentleman uv the old skool, who lives in luxurious elegance onto a plantashn uv 1500 akers, and who hez troo piety into him, and alluz wears a shirt-frill. Afore the war he owned 200 niggers, and his sole runnin out after em, he hez managed, sence the war, to collect the most uv em, and get em together on the old place. He hez bin busily engaged in subdooin uv em, and bringing em backl to ther normal condishun; but alas! ther wuz difficulties in the way. The men niggers, with an obstinacy wich I can't account fobr, refused to work for $4 per month, and the wimen, hevin been mostly married to thoer husbands by the chaplin uv a regiment wich wuz stashened here doorin the war, refoosed to re'soom their old relations, and things looked serious. Most men would hev yielded to circumstances and give up, but Kernel Podgers wuz not uv that stripe. He owed a dooty to these misguided beins wich lie felt. he must fulfil; and besides, lie is desirous of' buildin a new house next summer and sendin two daughters (by his wife) to a seminary next season, and he felt that he must bring cm to their senses. He sed that lie stood in the relation uv a faither, figgeratively speekin, to all uv em, and literally to many uv em; and wuz he agoin to let em go on a flyin out uv their normal speer? Not any. The fust day I wuz there, a crisis occurred. John Podgers, his son, insisted upon takin away the wife uv a mulatto, and the nigger, forgettin his posishen, wuz impudent. John struck him, and the degraded wretch waded in and whaled him un. merciful. This, uv course, cood  not be endoored. The Podgers' blood riz, and that nigger wuz seized and catted till lie died. Ef I remember right, he expired while undergoin discipline. It may be he lived till mornin; but it matters not, ceptin that I like to be accurate. It wuz a solem and impressive scene. The Kernel had the Ethiopian's wife present doorin the infliction uv the punish- ment, and to show  her that he did not perceed without X           .  -  &#xD;<pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC7107-00000201"/> 372       THE INSULT TO PODGERS. authority, before commencin he read to her from Scripter the chapters treatin uv Ham and Hager, and the passage commencin " servance, obey yoor masters," and then walloped. him with more vigger than I spozed wuz left in a man so old. He pinted to the nigger on the ground, after he wuz cut down, and tellin her that he hoped it wood be a lesson to her, bade' her go to her quarters. But the perverse creecher didn't. She ran away, and complained to the officer at the neerest post, who instid uv sendiri her back under guard, with his compliments to Kernel Podgers, actilly forwarded her complaint to General Sickles, who forthwith struck a blow at the fbundashens uv the fabric uv Southern sosiety, and ordered the arrest uv the Kernel, who wuz to-wunst placed in doorance vile. There wuz eggscitement in the visinity. I never saw sich a fermentashen. AMen run to and fro with blancht cheeks, and askt, "Wat next? Is our rites to be taken from us? Is Johnson a holler mockery?'" Amld they made up a purse, and begged me to go to Androo, and stand between em and destruckshen. I run up to Washinton, and lied an interview with his Eggslency, the President. He knowd Kernel Podgers, --in his younger days lhe led made his coats, --and ez I fetched upon the old man immured in a dismal dungeon, he wept. But A. Johnson lhez decision uv character. Wipin his eyes, he isshood a order for the revolkashen uv Sickleses'absurd order that niggers shoodent be whipt, and a spesli order com- mandin the offiser who hed the Kernel in custody, to turn him over to the Civil Courts, to be tried in accordance with the laws of North KItrliny. Armed with these documents, I flew back, and the nite I arrived I bed the satisfackshen uv takin the Kernel out uv Jail, and takin him afore a Justis uv the Peace, where he gave bail to appear afore the Common Pleas to answer a charge uv manslaughter, prefered by the widder uv the dead nigger. A day or two after, the case wuz heard, I appearin for the Kernel. I held that the case be dismissed for the followin reasons:- 1. The charge uv manslaughter wuz absurd, for the reason that in the minds uv the Southern people there hez alluz bin   THE TRIAL AND DECISION.       373 the gravest doubts ez to whether the nigger is actilly a man. I held that the length uv his lheel, the thickness uv his skull, the length uv his arm, all showd that he wuz uv a distink species. Ef this is the case, ez a matter uv course, the Kei-nel goes free. 2. The Kernel can't be held, allowin the nigger to be a man. The laws iuv the State uv North Karliny permit the whippin uv niggers, but they don't prescribe the quality uv whippin i wich may be inflicted. It's a matter wich is left entirely to the discreshen uv the whipper. It's a matter with wich the Wvhippee hez nothin to do; neither hiez the State. Ef the Kernel hed shot the nigger he wood be liable, for shootin ain't permitted; but ez whppin is, and ez the quantity ain't pre- scribed, uv course it intends the matter to be left solely to the discreshcn uv the party who hez the power to whip. Nothin kin be clearer than that. Sliel Kernel Podgers be punishht becoz a nigger hedn't powers uv endoorence? Forbid it Heven! Here I rested the case. I showed to the satisfackshcn uv the Court that the law was not only just but humane, and that any sichl absurdity ez punishin the Kernel for carryin out its pervisions wood be strikin a blow-at the framework uv society. The Court coincided with me, and to-wunst discharged the Kernel, amid the acclamashuns uv the crowd. The event wuz sellebratid that afternoon by whippin every nigger witliin a cirkle uv ten miles. The exercise did our people good. It wuz soothin. In the mean time John.- Podgers hed gone afore a Justice uv the Peace and made complaint uv Susan (tliat is the name nv the female wich wuz the cause' uv' the diffilkilty) ez a vagrant, and she wuz so declared by the Justis and put up and sold. Under the circumstances no one wood bid agin .John, and she was struck off to him at $50, wich the Justis, under the pecoolyer circumstances uv the case, refoosed to'take. I saw John a marchin uv her home, and felt happy. The Kernel's gratitood wuz boundlis. "Wat kin I do for yoo?" sed he, wringin my hand in a fever uv joy. Nothin," sed I, "nothin! Virchoo is its own reward.  &#xD;<pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC7107-00000202"/> 374       RENDERING AN ACCOUNT. But our College is languishin for want uv means - let yoor gratitood take that shape." He subscribed and paid $200, wich constoots him a per- petooal Honorary Professer, and $100 to make his wife a per- petooal Honorary Professer.' I borrowd uv him $50 to take me home, ez I coodent uv coorse yoose College funds, and departed $350 better. I left regretfully. Now that this por- tion uv the South is gettin her rites, it is trooly a deliteful place too live, and I shcod like to end my days here.

The brethren wuz somewat disappointed at the result, and Bascom intimated that he bleeved it wuz a d-d swindle; but I withered him with a glance. I showed Deekin Pogram that it wuz not only r eglar, but that it bed the stamp uv the Post Offis onto it, wieh silenced all cavil. I asshoored em that that little balance needn't trouble em - I did not intend to make an assessment onto em, but that I cood wait until the treasury wuz in funds. "But," sed Bascom, " when in thunder will the treasury ever be in funds, ef all the expedishuns result like this one?" 'I explained to the obtoose man that it wuz all rite; that in most uv sich enterprises the expenses eat up the collelrshuns, but that it wuz seed sown. We must," sez I, ,' raiue the wind from the North, and to do it, let us show that suthin hez bin dun." "Wat kin we do?" sed Bascom. "Lay the corner stun uv the Institoot?" sez I. "On the square forninst us is the corner stun uv the nigger church we burnt a month or so ago, ready to our hand. Let us organize a percession and do it to-day, that we may publish to the wolld that the work is commenced, that our friends may shell out libreller than they hev." The idea wuz considered good, and forthwith it wuz actid upon. The stone wuz conveyed to the feeld onto wich the Institoot is to be built, and a cavity wuz hollered out into it. At 4 P. M. (wich is in the afternoon) a percession wuz formed, headed by the Trustees, and we marched out to the feeld. Into the cavity in the stun wuz deposited, with approprit cere- monies, the followin articles: -  A copy uv the Constooshen uv the Confedrit States uv America. A copy uv the message uv Androo Johnson vetoin the Freedmen's Buro Bill. A copy uv the 22d uv Febrooary speech. Portrates uv the Trustees. A copy uv the veto uv the Civil Rites Bill. A pair uv handcuffs. Portrates uv Presi. dent Johnson and Secretary Seward. A nigger whip. A $5 greenback contribbited for the purpose by Elder Pennibacker. A pint bottle uv whisky, seeled, contribbited by Bascom. Then the stun wuz placed in posishen, and after a few feelin remarks by myself, in wich I stated that this wuz a grate day for the Corners, and that posterity wood bless us for the work   TABLEAU.          3" we hed that day done, the crowd dispersed, the Trustees goin back to my offis to draw up a statement uv the ceremonies, and an appele to the northern Dimocrisv for aid. That nite about 9 P. M., I wuz a sittin in my offis a musin onto the evence uv the day, and wonderin whether the Dilnoc- risy wood give down, it okkured to me that there wuz a tlint bottle uv first-class corn whisky, and $5 in currency, agoin to waste in that stun. "Wat'll posterity ever know uv us-?" thot I to myself. "Ef posterity does ever overturn that stun, won't she git jest ez good an idea uv who we wuz friom the other articles? Ef posterity ever reads the speeches uv His Eggslency, and the messages wicls we liev placed there, won't the whisky be inferred? Ef it ain't, posteritv is a consumate ass; and tlus musin, I wended my way thitherwlard, determined to reskoo these two articles from oblivion any how. It wuz pitch dark, but I knew the way. Creepin clautiously up to the stun, I reached out; and horror! Thlr wuz other lhands onto it! Strikin a matcll quickly, there stood reveclcd afbre me the formnns uv Deekin Pogram, Bascorn, and Elder Slathers, to whom the same tliot lhod occurred wich moved me. But my presence uv mind did not forsalk me. Strikin another match, I assoomed a look uv virchus indignashen, wich they all saw afore it went out, and reproacht cm fur thcr worldly- mindednis. How cood they expect the Institoot to prosper when those into whose hands its interests wuz confided, proves recreant to the extent uv steeling the sacred mementoes wiclh were to-day enclosed. "Go home," seo I; "I forgive you tills time, and will not expose yoo ez yoo deserve. I spected yoo all, from the way yoo eyed the bottle and the greenDack, and hastened hither to protect em. Go!" And they went; after wich I tipped over the stun and sekoored the prize. The next mornin they all reproached me with hevin stolen the articles, in privit, wich satisfied me that all uv cm lied gone back for the plunder alter they t hot I'd gone; but they didn't make no fuss about it. They are all good men; but alas! sich is the depravity uv human nacher that they'll bear watchin. PETROLEUM V. NASBY, P. M.

POST OFFIS, CONFEDRIT X ROADS 1 (wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky),  Janooary 10, 1867. ) I wuz rekested a week ago to preech a discourse from the text wiclh the noble and high-minded Guvner Bramlette used with siclh crushin force in his last annual message, to wit: "Kin the Leopard change his spots, or the Ethiopian his skin?" and alluz feelin anxious to do wat I kin for the cause, I did it last nite, or rather essayed to do it. And here let me remark, that there ain't a more devoted people in Kentucky than them lambs ez compose my flock. It wuz a tetchin site, and one wiclh filled my sole with joy, to see em pour out uv the groceries at the first tootin uv the horn, and to see Pennebacker, wich owns the Distillery, stoppin work to come; but the most cheerinf and encouragin sign' to me wuz to see Deckin Pogram, who wuz playin seven-up for the drinks with Elder Slathers, at Bascoin's, lay down his hand when lie bed high low and jack in it, and bed only- three to go. "Elder," sed lie, his voice tremblin at the sacrifice lie wuz a makin, and a tear steelin down his cleek, "Elder, them's the horn. Let us to our dooties. 'LiAion must take the front seat uv temp'ral matters," and, sighin ez lie cast a partin glance at his hand, lie strode out resolootly to the sanktooary. I opened by readin the follerin from Guvner Bramlette's message' - "' The nigger is the inferior uv the white--he lacks the power to rise. Ontil the Leopard kin change his spots, or the Ethiopian his skin, all efforts to repeal or nullify God's laws will be unavailin.' " "My bretherin, these words is words uv wisdom, and fur em let us be thankful. The skin uv the Ethiopian wuz in. In the message of Governor Bramlette, of Kentucky, in 1867, the language given in the text was, singular as it may now seem, actually used.

With the black skin he wuz given all the othler marks uv inferiority. He wuz cust with long arms, immense hands, flat nose, and bowed legs, and that ther mite be no mistake in the matter, he wuz given wool instead uv hair. Halleloogy! Wat a blessid thing for us is this Ethiopian! Wat a consolation it must be to yoo all to know that thler is a race below yoo, and how blessid the refleckshun that they can't'change ther skin, and by tlhat means git above yooI That's the comfort we draw from the skripters. Wat a horror it wood be for Deckin Pogram, snorin so peacefly, ef when the Soopreme Court decides the Ablishn amendment unconstooshnl, and lie gits his niggers back agin; ef ther shood be a new dispensashun, and niggers shoed be permitted to change ther skins! Wat sekoority wood we hey for our property'? Some mornin ,he'd wake up and find em all white persons, wich it wood be unconstooshnel to wollop. "My brethern, ther has bin many efforts to change the skin uv the Ethiopian, or rather ther lhez bin many who wanted to. The Boston Ablishnists hev tried it, but wat hez bin the result? Ain't they niggers yit, and ain't they still the de- graded wretches they alluz wuz? I paws for a reply." I made this latter remark becoz it sounded well, not that I lied any idee that anybody wood reply. Imagine my surprise at seein a gray-headed nigger, wich hed bin, doorin and after the fratrisidle struggle, employed in the Freedman's Burow, rise, and remark that ho-e hed a word to say onto that pint. There wuz a storm uv indignashun, and the impudent nigger, who wuz so sassy ez to presoom to speak in a white meetin, wood hev bin sacrificed on the spot, lied not Joe Bigler, who wu7 half drunk, drawd a ugly-lookin navy revolver, and re- markin that he knowd that nigger, that he hed more sense than the hull bilin uv us, and lie shoed hev his say.

It appears that they'd sent a man North to find a locashen for em, ez they bed made up their minds to run away from the blessins uv slavery wich we are preparin to re-open to em, and this nigger hed arrived, and they wuz assembled to hear his report. "Brother Lee," sed the ringleader to the returned nigger, wich I knowd-he wuz nearly white, and wuz raised in Virginia, and hed bin four years in the army, on the Fedral side uv course, -" are yoo ready to report? Hev yoo found the Promised Land?" Brother Lee replied, that ef he understood wat wuz the Ethiopian idee uv the "Promised Land," he cood safely and  &#xD;<pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC7107-00000207"/> 384      BROTHER LEE'S EXPERIENCE. certainly say that he hedn't. He landed first in Philadelphy, and bein sumwat wearied by the long ride, he took a seat in a street-car which wuz empty. The condulter ordered him out, but sposin he wuz in a State where there wuz ekal rites he insisted on stayin, when the condukter and the driver bundled him out by force. His coat, he observed, showin wher the bloo blouse hed bin ouskiltully mendid, wuz sumwat fraktered in the skuffle. At this narrashen the niggers groaned, and it wuz all I cood do to keep the Deekin from hollerin halleloogy I In N0oo York State he didn't fare so well. He diskivered that a decent nigger there isn't quite cz good ez a very ordinary white man. He happened tlher on 'leckshin day, and narrated that he* saw white men carried up to the poles so eggstreme- ly drunk that them ez hed cm in cjlarge lied to put the ticket atwcen their fingers and anser to their names, while a 'specta- ble nigger hed to show tlat lie wuz worth some property afore he wuz allowed to vote, and then a number uv gentlemen with red faces and clubs made it so onpleasant that but few attempted it. The Deekin punched me in the ribs vociferously. Next he went to Ohio, sposin, uv course, that a State so extremely opposed to bondage wood be the place he wuz in search uv. Agin he wuz disappointed. It wuz worse than it wuz in Noo York, for the Ablishnists wuz a goin on the princi- ple, he rather guessed, uv doin justis without runnin agin anybody's prejudises; or rather, uv lettin justice do herself, for they don't make any move towards helpin lher. There the nigger uv no grade, no matter how much taxes lhe pade, or Ilhow long lie served in the army, wuzn't allowed a vote. The Ablishinists, ez he understood, carried the State on the nigger' question, but wuz now afrade to tetch it for fear they'd lose it agin. Tley've lied it, he remarked, twelve years, but hedn't, ez yit, got all the people edjicated up to the pint uv doin wat all the people knowd wuz rite. His experience in the West wuz very similar.

In Washinton, wher Congress hez give the niggers a vote, he wuz well treated, and it wuz the only place. A gentleman who wants to run for Mayor next spring giv him his dinner, and quite a number of others who wanted small offises did like- wise, but he woodent advise emigrashen there, for it's possible that before the next. elecshun Congress may conclude that suffrage in the Deestrick will run 'em into the ground in the States (their constituents, which are all Ablishnists, not bein edjucated up to the pint), and repeel it.         * 'The Deekin nudged me agin.

Dashin his hat on the ground, he execooted one uv the most frantic Highland flings my eyes ever witnist. It astonished me to see how recklis the old man wuz with his legs. Finally, out uv breath, he subsided with a prolonged shreek uv exultant joy. "Why so jubilant, my venerable friend?" sed I. "Nasby," sed he, " it's better than I hoped for.

AN IMPORTANT CASE AT THE CORNERS UNDER THE VAGRANT ACT.-THE DECISIONS OF        'SQUIRE GAVITT. POST OFFIs, CONFEDRIT X ROADS, (wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky),  Janooary 28, 1867. ) WUx uv the most important cases - important in a national sense-ever tried afore a court uv justis, came off aforo Squire Gavitt yesterday. It was important, becoz it involved the very existence uv the institution upon which Kentucky is built - becoz, upon its decision hung the question whether or not the Bible shood be respectid and its holy injunctions obeyed--whether Kentucky shoed, clingin to the Skripters, go on ez a Christian State, or denyin it, go back into infidelity and barbarism. I scasely need say that the porshens uv the Bible to wich I refer, is the ever blessid chapters relatin to Ham, Hager, and Onesimus - the only parts of the Skripter we pay much attention to. But ef them is attacked success- fully, wat follows? The entire strukter comes tumblin to the ground. Therefore, holdin to Afrikin slavery, we are orthodox believers. The circumstances uv the case wuz suthin like this: A nig- ger uv the name uv Gabriel, wunst the happy and contented servant uv that eminent Christian, Deekin Pogram, becum possessed uv the spirit uv the devil, and sullen, becoz the Deekin sold his wife to raise the means to send his second son, Isaker, wich wuz a studyin for the ministry, to a Theolojikle Institoot, somewheres in Georgia. He run away in the fust year uv the war, and follered the Federal army, finally enlisting, as a sojer. During the progress uv the struggle, lie learned to read. and bein powerful in prayer and sich, he headed a revival, and hevin gifts that way, attracted the notis uv Genril Howard, who hed him instructed, and finally made him an The people of Kentucky refused, for a long time, to recognize the acts of Congress establishing the status of the negro. The courts disregarded the provisions of the Civil Rights bill as recklessly as did 'Squire Gavitt.  &#xD;<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC7107-00000209"/> 388          THE TRIAL. agent uv a branch uv that accursid Freedmen's Burow. After the war, he appeared in this vicinity, salaried by the society, and commenst unfittin the niggers forvtheir normal condishun by teechin on em to read, and establishin Sunday skools among em, wich wuz aginst the dignity and peace uv the common- wealth. The citizens stood it with pashense ontil last Monday. The Deekin hed a dispoot with a nigger relativ to a triflin matter uv wages. The nigger hed bin workin at the stipulated price uv $4 per month-- the Deekin brought in, ez a offset, his board at $2 per week; and ruther than hev any fuss about it proposed to let him work the balance out durin the winter. months. To this ekitable arrangement the nigger demurred, holdin that board wuz inclooded, and this Gabrel advised the nigger to sue, and he did so. Enraged at his interference, the Deekin went before Squire Gavitt, and complained of Gabrel ez a vagrant, and employed me to attend to the case. Pollock, the Illinoy storekeeper, volunteered to defend the nigger, and there wuz a tremenjus excitement over it. I opened the case by statin that the nigger's biznis wuz to prove that he hed vizable means uv support: Pollock insisted that it wuz our biznis to prove that he hedn't, but the court decided agin him. The nigger then swore that he reseeved from his congrega- shen $30 per month for services. I submitted that, ez he wuz a interested party, other proof wood be required. Pollock interdoost the elders of the congregashen, but 1 checkmated him there, by submittin that the testimony uv niggers wuznl't admissable, wich the court decided it wuzn't. Immejitly Pollock submitted that whether or no his client coodent be considered a vagrant, ez he cood testify himself to the fact that he (GabreD hed in his house $200 in greenbax- a suffishent support for a time, at least. Ther wuz a immense eggscitement in the court. "Wher duz he keep it?" asked the Squire, visibly agitated. "In a chest at his house," sed Pollock. "This court stands adjourned for thirty minits," sed the Squire, boundin over the railin in front uv him. "Hold on," sez he; " hold on, Deekin; a fair start is all I want. Don't   HOW THE NEGRO WAS MADE A VAGRANT.     389 take advantage uv my age to get ther first," and pell-mell over one another the entire audience, ceptin Pollock, the nigger, and me, started on a keen run for the house. In a few minits they returned, pantin and out uv breath, when the Squire called the court to order again, wich bein restored, lie re- marked, ef it cood be established that the nigger hed $200 in greenbax it wood nessessarily discharge him, ez no man with that sum cood be considered a vagrant; but lie thot ef thle prizner at the bar shood look in the direckshun uv his house, he'd find it wuzn't ther any more, ez a house, the materyal uv wich it wuz built wuz lyin permiskus. Likewise, probably, lie wooden't be able to find the $200 he hed in his chest. .The place that knowd it wunst will know it no more forever--it hed been confiscated by the enraged citizens. Ho wanted it understood that no such triflin impediment in the way uv justis ez the possession uv $200 cood be allowed within the jurisdick- shen uv this court. The nigger not bein able to prove his means uv support, and ez the court knowd uv its own knollege that he ain't now got any $200, the court wood ask the crim- inal's counsel wat other nonsense he hez to plead. Sed Pollock, the Illinoy storekeeper,- "I wood beg leave to state to this court that, under the Civil Rites law, the defendant cannot be arrested ez a vagrant, ez the law under wich the accused is arrested only menshuns persons uv color, makin a distinkshcn agin em." Never, while memry retains her seat, shel I forget the scene that ensood. Filled with a sense uv the responsibility restin onto him, the Squire rose slowly from his seat, his face uv a deathly palenis, wich hed the effeck uv hightnin, by contrast, the intense rednis uv his nose, and risin to his fill hite, re- marked that the court hed expectid that objeckshen to be urged, and hed, therefore, prepared fur it. That law doesn't bind this court to any alarmin extent, considerin it ez infringin onto the reserved rites uv the States. "1 Will the court be so good ez to menshun, for the informa- shun uv the populace, wat the reserved rites uv the States are?" sez Pollock. "The court insists that it shel not be interrupted when it's deliverin itself uv an opinion. Considerin it ez infringin upon  &#xD;<pb n="390" xml:id="VAC7107-00000210"/> 390         THE DECISION. the reserved rites uv the States, uv whom Kentucky is the cheefest and the loveliest among ten thousand "-- at this pint his nose glowd redder, and it seemed to me ez tho a halo uv lite encirkled his frosty head, ez he fearlessly continued- "the court holds that law to be unconstooshnel, and ez sich, shel not regard it. Hez the counsel anything more to remark?" "Nothin," sed Pollock. "( And knowin the court so well ez I do, I wonder at my makin sich an ass uv myself ez to hev remarkt anything at all." ' Hez the counsel for the State anything to say?," "Nothin," sed I. "I am willin to trust the- case in yoor hands, feelin confident that justis - genooine Kentucky justis -will be done." Whereupon the Squire lied the prizner stand up, and drawin on a black cap, in a very impressive manner, sentenst him to eighteen months hard labor, breakin stone on the turnpike, at the conklushen uv wich Pollock very profanely added, "And may the Lord hev mercy on your sole." The nigger wuz immejitly stript uv his good close, wich the Squire thot wood just fit him, and a soot uv vagrant's close wuz given him, and he wuz to-wunst put to his labor. We hev hopes thlat this will end the nigger- skools in this vicinity, ez well ez the diskontent that hez eggisted among the niggers ever since the disturbin Gabrel lez bin here. The Corners is now enjoyin a holy calm - more so than any period for a month. PETROLEUM V. NASBY, P. M. (wich is Postmaster), and likewise Professor.

The biznis required uv me wuz statid by Seward in his usual loocid style. It wuz merely to cirkelate incognito (wich is Latin for sneakin) among the recently appinted offis-lolders, and assertain ther views upon general politikle topics, but more espeshally ther feelins toward the President and Sekretary uv State.

Transfixin the venerable Sekretary with wun uv my most piercenist gazes, I remarked, - "Sir 1 in imitashen uv the man who inflicted yoo upon this country, wich wuz not the least uv his acts for wichll the country cusses him, I propose relatin a little anecdote. Ther wuz wunst a man who wuz inebriatid; and that he might present hisself in a state approximatin sobriety to the pardner' uv his buzzum, he wuz essayin to vomit, tryin thus to ease his stumick uv the cause uv the onpleasantnis therein; but he coodent do it. He heaved and heaved, but there wuz no result. At this critilkle period another man approacht, who remarked, kindly, that ef he desired to vomit, his best holt wood be to run his finger down his throat. The drunk in- dividooal looked up indignant at this unwarranted interfer- ence with his constooshnel rites. ' Blast yoor eyes, sir,' sed he, 'a are yoo or me bossin this yer puke?'  "This, Sekretary Welles, is the anecdote. I respeck the posishun yoo hold, and dislike sayin anythiin disagreeable; but, sir, this is a puke, and I propose to boss it myself."' I startid to-wunst, and found things in a highly mixed condi- tion. The followin is compiled friom my reports.: In Noo York the Postmasters generally are sound. The cropp wer poor last year; and all kinds uv biznis bein dull, the Postmasters are generally anxious to hold on. They are, therefore, outspoken in their support uv the coz. Them ez wuz men uv good. standin and relijusly inklined, before the rupcher between the President and the party wich redoost him, say but very little in publick, and that little they don't say very long. They generally can't see that ther is any partikeler differense between the President's plan and the plan uv Conigress, and ther bein so little, Congress ought to yeeld for the sake uv peace. The Dimokrats, holdin sich places, are loud enough in support uv the Administrashen; but, good Heaven! the en- dorsement uv sich men is too heavy a load for any party to carry. Now, that I think uv it, I liev at last solved the mys- tery uv our wide-spread defeat last fall. In some deestricks the Dimocrisy found Johnson too heavy a load too carry, and in the others the Johnson men found the Dimokrisy too heavy'a load to carry.

The next place I cum to I found the Postmaster a suspishus character - very suspishus. Whenever he is drunk he spelaks very highly uv the Sekretary uv State, but when sober he avoids politikle matters. I sejest a raise in the salary uv thl offis, that he kin afford to keep drunk all the time. At the next pint I interdoost myself ez a English nobleman in disguise, studyin Amerikin manners and customs, and men- I  shuned carelessly thiat I hed bin to Washinton, and hcd bin presentid to the President and Sekretary uv State.

Another man openly defied me. He wantid me to take the offis off his hands.

At great expense we built onto it a section uv wall; but malkin no account uv our expenditoor, they overturned it.

So, ez a last resort, we stuck two posts in the ground and drawd an iron chain over it. That got em. Force is about the only thing uv any account in this country.

We hev bed serious doubts whether proper ideas cood be instilled into a youth from a book written by a Boston man, and printed in Cincinnati. I submitted to the Board a example fobr a noo Arithmetic, to wit: "A Yankee sent a substitoot into the Federal army at a cost uv $1000, passing off onto him two counterfeit ten dollar not6s. To make up the expenditoor, he to-wunst swindles a innocent Kentuckian out uv $100 in a patent rite, a Alabamian out uv $200 in a Western land trade, and the balance he makes up by sellin wooden nutmegs, wich he turns out uv basswood at a profi't uv 4 cents per one. The grato moral question is, how many nutmegs must this ingenius but unprincipled cuss manufaktur, and how long does it take him, with the im- prooved machinery, they hev to do it?

He pays for his whiskey two dollars per gallon in Looisville, and hez for a reglar customer a Postmaster, wich drinks forty or sixty times per day, and alluz tells him to 'jist chalk it down.' Required the length uv time nessary to bust him under them afflictin circumstances?" Bascom remarkt that long before the book appears in print, heO wood be able to furnish the anser to that little problem. Con- siderin the example a dig direct at me, I wuz uv a noshen to retort; but ther wuz sich a look uv injcrd innosenise'onto Bascom's countenance that reely I coodent. Suthin must be done for Bascom,- I hev lived onto liln too long. The next contribushen I reseeve from frends North shel be devoted to liquidating, in part, the debt I owe him.

WASHNGTON agin I What changes hev been made in the last two years I Not in Washington, fobr this delitefil abode uv official purity hezn't changed a particle, nor never will. From the summit uv Willard's Hotel 1 kin see now, ez I did a year ago, the same signs uv " steamed oysters;" the Capitle, in front, towrin over the trees at the tother end uv the avenue, and behind, the Patent Offis and Post Offis buildings s; the first the Mecca uv every Dimokrat, and the tother uv every Yankee who comes here. Nol Washington ain't changed, but I hev. Formerly, when I visited Washington, it wuz tite times with me. Willard'swuz my hotel thencez now. In them days, before the happy return uv A. Johnson' to reason put some thousands uv Democrats, who hed more stumic than money, and more appetite than small change, into offis, and, per consekence, into condition to pay their bills, I wuz a guest at this hotel; which is to say, I slept on the steps uv the Capitol, and took, or tried to take, my meals at Chadwick's bountiful board. Ef I hed no currency, I hed taste; and ez I It was easy enough in 1866-7 for a Republican of any prominence, who was willing to support Johnson, to get an appointment, but how to secure confirma- tion by the Senate was the rub. Many men of easy virtue, accomplished the desired confirmation by abandoning Johnson, after the appointment was made. Wilcox and Custar were two of the most prominent examples.  &#xD;<pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC7107-00000216"/> 400          WILLARD'S. wuz foragin for subsistence, I alluz made it a pint to forage on the richest paster fields. It's ez easy to cheek a first class dinner ez it is a second class; and besides, I felt that sich a hotel ez Willard's wuz better able to stand sich boarders ez I wuz than them of less patronage. I kept away from the tother hotels out of sympathy for the proprietors. Never shel I forget my last visit here. I hed run the dinin-room guardian' angel for a week, and wuz congratulatin myself on another week at least, when the landlord stopped me hisself, and the follerin conversashen ensood:-- "My friend," sed lie, in winnin tones. "Davis, Garret, is my name!" sez 1, promptly. "We hear enuft," sez he. "Listen! I've let you run a   a week, coz it's my regler practis. Ybo hed a hungry look, but by this time yoo ought to be filled up and able to go at least a week without eatin. Ez yoo ain't uv no earthly yoose to any body, and make no pretensions to bein ornamental -- Git!"and three well-directed kicks landed me onto the sidewalk. But I hev forgiven him. Ite treats me well. He hez confi. dence in me now, ez I hev paid my board in advance. It's a rool he hez, he jocosely remarked, with men of my peculiar cast uv countenance, to hev cm pay in advance. He says it's much the best way. After payin, sich men ez me feel more comfortable about the house, and so do the proprietors. It's me that is changed, --I hev money to pay my bills. Bless the Lord for Seward, Johnson, Randall, and other luxuries! But pleasant ez it is to contrast myoformer posishen with my present proud one, I hev not time to dwell upon reminiscences. Life is short; I am a practical man; and tho it may be pleasant to linger for a moment onto mernry's pleasant fields, I cannot. My biznis in Washington is precisely what every Democrat's biznis here is, to get confirmed. It ain't no trouble for a Kentucky Dimecrat to git appinted, for the President hez so far relaxed his rules in this pertikeler ez to appint them ez wuzn't never in the Confedrit army ; but to get confirmed is the pinch.

"I do not deny that I wuz a ardent supporter uv President Johnson from the beginning uv his career. I wuz filled with a drafted man's magnanimity toward a conkered foe, and up to the -very day I reseeved my commishen I favored consilatory   ti measures.

Time and observashen hev taught me that instid uv consiliashen, coershen is our best holt; and that now military measures are necessary in the Sonth ontil them rebellyus people completely acquiesce in terms imposed by Congris for restorashen. My views on this interestin topic is best defined by the recent speeches uv Hon. Charles Sumner, the eminent and trooly great Senator from the enliteced State uv Massachusetts, and also by the recent utterances uv them lovable Representatives, Thadeus Stevens, uv Pennsylvania, and General Butler, uv Massachoosetts, in all uv whose senti- ments, sich as they hev now, and also themn ez they hev alluz hed, as well ez them which they may hereafter hev, I most heartily and entirely concur.

POST OFFIS, CONFEDRIT X ROADS (wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky), 1 March 25, 1867. ) "BACKERD, turn backerd, O Time, in yoor flite," is the fust line uv a song wich I heerd not long since. Wood that Time cood perform that back ackshen feat, and get us all back wher we wuz six years ago. But Time can't. Time is a perpetooal moshen, wich must go on and on, and wich can't never retrace   I her steps. The situashen ain't pertickelerly agreeable jist now. It hezn't a joocy look, nor does it promise an improvement in the future. The confidence uv the Dimocrisy uv Kentucky is shaken to the extent that it's lost its equilibrium, and totters to its centre. When it falls, I shel be found under the rooins. The passage of the Military Law may be sed to be the last   i feather wich reely ought to break the Kentucky camel's back. It's the'deepest stab at constooshnel liberty and ekal rites, inezmuch ez it not only blasts forever the hopes uv re-estab- lishin slavery, but gives the nigger all the rites and privileges enjoyed by white men. We, who are chiefly interested, are not to be consulted in the matter. Fedral hirelins, whose very presence is pizen to the people uv these States, are to be quar- tered onto us to see that "justis "-- wat holler mockry'l - is done to em. The governments established by Androo Johnson is overturned ef they don't play the Addle to military satraps, and  accept the Constooshnel Amendment, wich perhibits them who wuz our champions in the late effort to destroy a government wich we hatid, from takin hold uv it agin and runnin it. Wuz ther ever sich a mixter uv injustis and per- scripslen?  Wuz ther ever sich severity? Wuz ther ever sich a lack uv magnanimity? And all this time where is John- son?   He vetoed these bills,-- but wherefore? He knowd   1 that the Rump Congress hed a majority uv two thirds,and cood pass em over his veto; why, then, when they set his i   GRECIAN STRATEGY.        405 authority at defiance, didn't he rise in his might and disperse em? Where, too, wuz the Dimocrisy uv the North? Where are they in this crisis, when our dearest rites is bein ship- recked on the iron-bound rocks uv despotismn? Why don't they rally, ez they threatened, and demand that Johnson shel hurl them levelers from their usurped seats, and restore peace, on sich terms ez we shall consider ekitable, to this wunst happy, but now distracted, country. Alas 1 they hevn't time. I see them who breathed so much vengence and slawtrins afore Johnson hed offices to dispose uv, a neglectin us, and a runnin about gittin signatoors to applicashens for Post Offises, and hollerin to us ez they ketch their breath,- "Accept the condishens - git back into the Yoonion, that we may elect the President in 1868, who'll give us all the patronage 1" Their noosepapers all shreek, - "' Accept, and get back into the Yoonion, that we may elect the next President, who'll give us all the patronage I " And that ain't the worst uv it. Them wich we bought up with appintments diskivered on a sudden that a Abolition Senit hed to confirm em, and to sekoor that they hev gone back onto us. Custer is a shinin example, Wilcox is another, and I mite menshun hundreds uv others who hev slid back in tho same manner, Troy wuz taken by the strategy uv the Greeks, who exposed a wooden horse, in the bowels uv wich wuz conceeled armed men, w. ich the verdant Troys pulled inside their gates. An- droo Johnson wuz the wooden horse wich wuz sent into our camp by the Ablishnists, and the offices wuz the armed men in-his bowels. They hev bin our rooin. So long ez they wuz in the dim distance, the Democracy' wuz hungry and feroshus, and capable uv almost anytlhin - so soon ez they got em, they become quiet ez lambs. The Postmaster who holds a com- mishn sez to himself, "Wherefore shel I bust the Government under wich I hev a place 9  Kin I git another under the new one?" and he yells to us, "Accept the terms!"We cap- chered the camp uv the enemy, but are demoralized by the plunder we found. It's the old trick, over agin, these offices, which the white men yoost to play onto the Injins, to wit: -  &#xD;<pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC7107-00000219"/> 406       AN ORGAN BACKSLIDES. evacuatin a posishen and leavin a barrel uv whiskey behind. knowin that the Injin's instincts, like them uv a Kentucky Dimokrat's, wood lead him to git blind drunk, and make him a easy prey to the skelpin knife. The offisis wuz the whiskey wich intoxicated our braves; and our skelps, so to speek, hang at the belts uv our enemies. Sumner hez many, Thad Stevens hez many, and Butler is a gatherin uv em with a rapidity won- derful to behold. But wat marks the demoralizashen uv the Dimocrisy the most, is the follerin extract wich I cut from the Noo York World, wunst our trusted organ. "As regards the popular notion of the odor of the negro, it may be positively stated that he, in this respect, is like the white,--a clean negro bein free from it, and a foul one cursed by it." Ef this be troo - ef the nigger don't stink, then Noah got drunk, and Ham wuz cust, in vane- then Paul sent back Onesimus for nothin, and Hager is uv no more interest to the Dimocrisy than any other female who hez bin dead several thousand years. The Dimocratic party wuz built upon this stink; and ef that corner-stun is knocked out, the temple falls, and buried all beneath its rooins who are sheltered under it, uv whom I am the cheefest and the loveliest among ten thousand. At one fell swoop the wind is knockt out uv the sales uv the   Northern Dimocrisy. Wat is the nigger now to them ef he     ! does not stink?"Popler noshen," indeed! Trooly it wuz a     I popler noshen. That stink led hundreds uv thousands uv, Democrats by the nose. That " odor - ez the writer styles it - wuz our best holt, and wun wich wuz everything to us. That stink wuz all that elevated the Demokrat over the nigger - that wuz our mark of sooperiority. We, at times, wuz not uv the precise odor uv Nite-bloomin serious. A Democratic mass convenshen, when in a tite room, with two stoves in it, wuz not the most odorous gatherin in the world-; but we thanked God continyooally that the smell wich ariz ez the room got hot wuz not the pecooliar aroma uv the nigger, and we wuz comforted. But this writer redooses the whole thing   DISCOURAGED.          407 -the whole difference between the nigger and a Democrat-- to a matter of color and cleanliness.. Wat heresy! Wat iconaclasm ! (this last word meanin, I believe, idol breakin, or suthin uv that sort). Ef this be troo, thein in the nite time, a nigger with hisfeet washed is better than a Democrat! For one, now I care not ef Dr. Cummins' 1 Last Warnin Cry "' be trooly the last. I'm sorry that lie rented his house for ninety nino years, ez it hez a tendency to destroy my faith in his beleof that the world is about peggin out. The sooner Gabrel blows his horn the better I shel be sooted. Here agin this matter uv State offisis comes in. The Dimoc- risy uv Noo York see that nigger suffrage is inevitable, anl to sekoor their share uv it, they're biddin in time; forgettin that while they're acheevin a temporary success on that side uv the cirkle we're losing all control uv the niggers on this. Wat did the South ever care for Dimokratic successes, ceptin ez it bolstered up their niggers? I'm discouraged. I see afbre me trouble. I see but one or two streeks uv lite on my horizon. Ohio won't let her niggers vote no how, and sum other States are in the same fix, and possibly this ackshen may be the sign uv returnin reason. Ohio may, after all, be the rock agin wich the waves uv fanatakism may beet in vane, and conservatism, gatherin strength there, may finally assert itself elsewhere. May the Lord send it, for ef this thing goes on, I'm a lost and rooined mall. PETROLEUM V. NASBY, P. M.

I rekollect wunst uv advokatin free trade and high protective tariff, all within twelve hours (I made a speech in a agricultooral deestrik uv Noo York in the forenoon, at 10 A. M., and in a manufacturin town in Penn- sylvany in the evenin, our platform bein so construktid that both sides cood find a endorsement in it), and hev performed many other feats uv moral gymnastiks; but this last change I hev bin called upon to make is probably the suddenest. Last week Toosday, Deekin Pogram, Captain McPelter, and I, wuz engaged in riddin the Corners uv niggers. We hed endoord em ez long ez we thot possible, and determined on standin it no longer. Selectin three, wiclh we wuz satisfied hed too much spellin-book into em to be enslaved agin, we wuz preparin notises to be served onto em, orderin em to leave in twenty. fobur hours, when I reseeved in the northern mail a letter marked "Free - Alex. W. Randell, P. M. G." I knowd it wuz offishel to-wunst -that blessid signatoor is on my commisshun, and I've contemplatid it too often to be mistaken in it. Its contents wuz brief, and run thus: - "To all Postmasters in the Southern States: The niggers hev votes - consiliashen is our best holt. See to it." This breef, tho not hard to be understood order, wuz sealed with the offishel seal uv the Post Offis Department, stampt into putty instid uv wax, to wit: a loaf of bread, under a roll uv butter, with ten hands a grabbin at it. I comprehended the situation at site, and set about doin my dooty with Spartan firmness. "Deekin," sez I, tearin up the notises, "these nig- gers we hev misunderstood. They are not a inferior race-- they are not descendants uv Ham and Hager--it wuzn't Paul's   WHCH WAS PROMPTLY OBEYED.      409 idea in sendin back Onesimus to condemn him to servitood- we hev misunderstood the situation, and must malke amends. The nigger is devoid uv smell, and is trooly a man and a brother!" "Wat?" said the Deelkin, tippin back in amazement. "Jest wat I say," sez 1. "Read that," and I flung him the letter. The upshot uv the conference wich follered wuz the callin uv a meetin the next nite, at wich all the Ethiopians uv the Corners wuz invited and urged to be present. The trouble wuz to git the niggers to attend the meotin. The fust one I spoke to lafft in my face, and askt me how long it wuz sence I hed helped hang a couple uv niggers, by way uv finishin off a celebrashen. Pollock, the Illinois storekeeper, got liold uv it, and told Joe Bigler, and Joe swore that ef the niggers hedn't any more sense than we give em credit for, in sposin we cood bamboozle em so cheep, he shood go back to the old beleef; to wit: that they wuz only a sooperior race uv monkeys, after all; and by nite every nigger in the visinity wuz postid thoroughly, and out uv all uv cm I cood only git four who would promise to attend, and them the Dcelin hed to pay- $2 apiece to. To give it eclaw I promised one uv em $5 (to be paid at the close uv the meetin) to sit on the stand with me, wich, bein a very poor man, and hevin a sick wife in a shanty near by, who wuz suffering for medicine (wich he coodent git without mnoney), he accepted. At this pint an idee struck me. I remembered Phlliladelfy, and determined to hev a scene rivalin the Couch and Orr biz- nis. "Another thing, Cuff. Understand that it's a part uv tlhe bargain that when in my speech I turn to yoo and stomp, yoo must rise and embrace me." "Wat?" sez he. "Fall into my arms, lovin-like- yoo understand--jest as tho we wuz long-lost brothers!" u"Scuse me!" sed he. "I'se a mity low nigger, and wants to buy de old woman some quinine, and wood do most anything foah dat; but, golly, dat's too much!" "Not a cent," sed 1, sternly, assoomin my most piercinist gaze; "onless this is included!"  &#xD;<pb n="410 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7107-00000221"/> "O        A STIRRING SPEECH.

I spoke to ern elokently on the yooniversal brotherhood uv mankind, holdin that whatever else cood be sed, Adam wuz the father uv all mankind, and that the only difference between a white man and a nigger wuz, the nigger wuz sun-burnt. The nigger, I remarkt, wuz, ondoubtedly, origenally white; but hevin bin, sence his arrival in this country, addicted to agri- cultooral persoots, he hed become tanned to a degree wich, tho it marred his physikle beauty, did not interfere with his sterlin goodnis uv heart. Ther hed bin differences between the races at times ther hed bin onpleasantnises wich no one regretted more than I. The whites uv the Corners hed not alluz bin ez considrit cz I cood hev wished. They hed flogd sevral uv em, and hung many more, and in times past hed held em in slavery and sich; but that shood not be thot uv at this happy time. It wuz constooshnel to do these things then, and Kentucky wuz eminently a law-abidin State.

"Come up and fling yoor arms around me, you black cuss," sed I, in a stage whisper. "Come up!" "No yoo don't, boss I " sed the nigger, in a loud voice, wich wuz audible all over the church, and holdin out his hand. "I can't trust yoo a bressid minit. Gib me de $5 fust. Yoo owe dis chile foah dollars now fo' sawin wood fo' yoah post offis, and ef we's a gwine to hab our rites de fus yoose I shel put mine to will be the gittin dat money. Pay up fus, and de 'brace afterward. I candt do sich a disagreeable ting widout de cash in advance." This ruther destroyed the effect. The unities wuzn't pre- served. The niggers in fiont bust out in a torturing laff, and Pollock and Bigler rolld in convulsions uv lafture, in wich half uv our people joined. Me a standin petrified, in the attitood of embracin, and that cussed nigger standin with his hand ex- tended for the money, with the Deekin and Bascom horror- struclk jist behind, formed a tabloo wich wuz more strikin than pleasant. The meetin wuz to-wunst adjourned, for it wuz evident to the dullest comprehenshen that nothin more coodent be done that nite. Es yoosual I failed fobr want uv capital. Hed I bin possesst uv the paltry sum uv five dollars, how diffrent wood hev bin the result! Perchance we may, tlro that defishency, lose Kentucky. It must never occur agrin--my salary must be raised. I can't make brix without straw. Joe Bigler met me next mornin, and remarklt that he regrettid the occurrence, ez he ardently desired to see the two races a. pullin together. "The fault, Perfessor," sed he, " wuz in not nanagin properly. The next time yoo want a 'spectable nig- ger to sit on the platform with yoo and the Deekin, or kiss or embrace yoo-- git him drunk.

PETROLEUM V. NASBYj P. M. (wich is Postmaster), and likewise Professor. CXXXVII. THE CONNECTICUT ELECTION. WASHNGTON, April 7, 1867. THE news uv the election in Connecticut created the most profound sensashen at the Corners. It cuim to us onexpected, like a clap uv thunder from a clear sky, like a gleam uv sun- lite thro a mass Uv overpowrin black clouds, or like the first streak uv sunlite in the mornin after a long nite uv cholera morbus with no brandy in the house. The Corners hevn't experienct sich a satisfactory spasm uv joy sence the receet uv the news uv the Fort Piller affair. It perdoost a very singler effect on Deekin Pogram. When I told the news, he wuz engaged a trying to convince a nigger, wich formerly belonged to him, that, after all, the Southlerners themselves wuz the only ones wich the niggers cood trust; and that when the time cum for em to exercise the 'lective franchise, ef they bed any regard for their own interests they wood turn their backs on the Ablishnists, who wuz, to a man, hory headed deceevers, and trust them only who knowd em. The Democracy carried Connecticut in the spring of 1867 by the aid of repeaters from New York. The result was received by the South as evidence of the reaction against the radicals of the North, for which they had been so long looking.   A SUDDEN CHANCE.        413 "Samyooel," sed the Deekin, in a affecshmnit tone, with one hand on the nigger's shoulder, " why shoodent we love yoo? Yoo are bone uv our bone, and flesh uv our flesh--we are uv one blood--" (this remark the Deekin got into a habit some years ago uv gittin off when speekin nv the Dimocrisy North, and alluz uses it. It is ruther effective, tho in this instance, ef I hed bin in his place, I shoodent hev slung it out, owin to the pecooliar construckshen wich mite be put onto it)--" and our interests is one, Samyooel." "Deekin," sez I, interruptin him. "Deekin I Connecticut hez spoken in thunder tones, and hez gone Dimocratic!"- "' Wat I " sez he, "Dimocratic?" "Verily," sez I. "L A Goyerner, and three Congressmen out of four." Ther wuz a sudden rupcher uv the friendly relashens oxistin between the Deekin and Samyooel the dark complexioned. If he wuz uv the Deekin's flesh, the Deekin wuz in favor of mortifyin it; for never wuz flesh so belabored ez wuz that unfortunit chattel's. The flesh wuz imejitly lasserated. Ho pitched into him feroshus; and after pummelin the astonished Afrikin, who didn't see why the result of a eleckshun shood work sich a change, till he wuz out uv breath, he condenst wat strength wuz remainin into one vigrous lick, exclaimin,-- "Take that, yoo black swindler. I've talked sweet to yoo -undr fle preten6es. I've bin betrayed into wagti;v soft sawder onto a nigger--into coaxin wher I hev a ondeniablo rite to command - into - " "Wat does all dis mean?" sed the nigger, faintly. "Mean!" sed I to him; "my frend, this is the reaction we've heard so much about - it's arriv. It means that there is a exceedinly good chance uv yoor bein redoost agin to yoor normal speer; uv yoor comin down from the high loss yoove bin a ridin, and uv bein agin a servant unto yoor brethren. It means that Connecticut hez spoken, and that yoor a good deal more valyooable to us now than yoo wuz a hour ago. Go, my friend, and buy salve for yoor brooses; for unless yoor heeled yoor valyoo will be less in the markit. Yoo'd be ashamed to sell for a low price - woodent yoo?" I left the Dimocrisy jubilatin, and come on to Washinton.  &#xD;<pb n="414 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7107-00000224"/> "4       A CABINET JOLLIFICATION. The nite I arrived there wuz high carnival at the White House. The President wuz in tall feather. There wuz Connecticut visible all over him. He hed a wooden nutmeg for a buzzum pin --a minatoor bass-wood ham hung from his watch fob, and in honor uv the occashun they wuz drinkin punches made of Noo England rum, with small slices uv Wethersfield onyuns in em insted uv lemons. Randall sprung toward me ez I entered the room, and clasped me by one hand, the President by tother, and we then - not altogether onlike the three graces - embraced. They hed the advantage uv me, ez they hed one odor-- the onion - wich I hedent, but 1 stood it. Why not, when that odor wuz from the breaths of those hevin the apintin power? I wood hev stood it hed they bin eatin assafoetida. At this juncter Sekretary Welles come in. "Ha I " said he, "why this unwonted hilarity? why this joy wher greef generally holds her courts?" "The Connecticut elecshun," said Seward. "O, to be sure," sed the venerable old man, vacantly; "I remember. Hawley, wuz it, or some other man who wuz elected over - over - wat wuz his name? - our candidate?" "That wuz last yeer I " sed Seward, angrily. "Well, perhaps it wuz. When did that State vote agin?" asked he, innocently, to wich no anser wuz given. But very little attention is paid to Sekretary Welles by any one 'ceptin Seward; and the fact that he occasionally undertakes to keep him postid in current events is ginerally taken ez evidence that he's breakin up. It's evident that he's passin into his dotage. There wuz a pleasant gatherin. Cowan wuz ther, and Sauls- bury, and Garret Davis, and Doolittle, and Seymour, and Brooks, and congratulatory letters wuz read. John C. Breckinridge hoped this auspicious event wuz the beginnin uv good feelin, presagin, ez he trusted it did, the evenchooel triumph uv them wich he hed alluz bin proud to call his friends. Mayor Monroe, uv Noo Orleens, hoped that, after this evidence uv returnin reason,. President Johnson wood not hesitate to re- move that second Butler, General Sheridan, who wuz ojus to every friend the President had in the city uv wich he wuz   I i i JOLIFICATIONB AT THE WHTE3 Houlse.--The three Graces.

General Wise sent his congratulashens; but cz they okkepied thirty-eight pages uv legal cap paper, closely written, they wuzn't read. Mosby sent a allegoricle pipe made uv a corn cob, onto wich wuz carved a symbolicle nig- ger, with the American eagle, a clawin vishusly into his wool, with his congratulations; and Fernando Wood, and Jesse D. Brite, and Dan Voorhees, sent tleirn, and Vallandigllam wanted to lnow now whether or not the President wuz a goin to accept the situashen, and take the Pimocratic party to his buzzum? Ef so, he led a list uv apintments for Southern Ohio, wich he wished made. At this pint the question arose whether or not I led not better move my Classicle and Military Institoot to Connecticut? I am a practicle man, and I to-wunst asked, ez pertinent to the question, whether or not ther wuz a distillery in Connecticut; and sckond, whether or not thler wuz a vacant post offis within four miles uv it. Sekretary Randall replied. He woodent hold oult indoose- ments that he coodent fiulfill. Ho wuz honest. Honesty wuz his best holt - simple, childlike strate-forwardniss in blis dcelins in politix wuz his cheef failin, and lied well nigh been his rooin. The first query wuz easy to anser--the eleckshun returns wood indicate to any man uv ordinary intellek thlat ther wuz distilleries either in Connecticut or very handy to the State; but ther wuz no Post Offisis to spare. To carry the State every wun of em hed bin solemnly promised. The President remarkt that lie reely shoodent think that triflin circumstance wood interfere with givin uv em to other men. At this pint I broke in. I told em firmly that onless I cood hev a better post offis than the wun I hed, I woodent go. I cood go and cood move wat there is uv the College bildins. It woodent cost much to pay fireight on that corner-stun. I spose a better one cood be got in Connecticut at less than the cost uv transportin it, but wherever that Dimocratic College is built that must be the corner stun uv it. That stun is hallowed. Ther are tender assosiashens hangin round it. It wuz the corner-stun uv a nigger school-house wich we burnt to the ground the nite we heard uv the veto uv the Civil Rites Bill. But I won't go to Connecticut onless my subsistence is  &#xD;<pb n="416-417" xml:id="VAC7107-00000226"/> "6       A DEMORALIZED YANKEE. asshoored. Ther is more money ther than in Kentucky; but I doubt whether they wood support me ez well. I kin under- stand why a man kin be a Dimocrat in Kentucky --he's in- terested in niggers. I kin appreciate the Dimocrisy uv Suthern Injeany, Illinois, and Ohio, coz they come from that region, and the sekond generashun ain't got to be voters. I kin understand the Dimocrisv in Heenan's and Fernando Wood's deestricks, but pardon me - I want to keep very clear uv Connecticut Democrats. A people anywhere in Noo Eng- land wich kin deliberitly ally theirselves to us is just the kind uv people I don't want to be among. I instinctively mistrust a Yankee who hez dickered away his interest in Bunker Hill. I hev notist that a Noo Englander wich comes South and married an old maid, or a widder with a plantation, wuz never to be trustid; and it's my experience that a demoralized Yankee--one who hez shed his early trainin, and took up anybody else's moral close - is about the meanest specimen uv a white man on the face uv the green earth. He hez the acootnis wich is born uv a barren soil, without the Puritanism to keep it within bounds; he possesses the ability to make a livin on his native rox, but his laziness impels him to a easier subsistence in milder climes; and instid uv fishin for mackrel he goes South and fishes for men. A Noo Englander, unre- strained by grace, is pizen, and I bleeve Connecticut is full uv em. I hev heerd Massachoosits religion aboozed, but its suthin we may well be thankfill for. I have always been thankful that the Mayflower brot over religion ez well ez brains and will. Among the Connecticut Democrisy I shood stand no show; and, besides, I lev too much self-respeck to soshiate with em on terms uv equality. Instid uv foragin on them, they'd manage to live on me. I hev lambs to sheer in Kentucky, and I don't care about changin em. I don't want to throw any cold water onto this festive occasion, it bein a element we all despise; but, hev we any asshoorence uv her continyooin troo? Ef I understand it, we won by means uv patronage, and runnin a War Democrat - a bein I, in common with all the troo Democrisy, despise. We can't do it agin.

"Thank God!" sed Johnson. "' Wood that both them Convenshens hed bin made up uv the same men. I wood then hev bin bored for places only half ez much ez I am." I wuz a helpin hm out in my weak way.' When the crowd wantin places become too great for human endoorance, I wood say, in a modrit tone, "Let's go out and git suthin ;' and to-wunst fully half wood exclaim, "I Thank yoo, I don't keer if I do!" It wuz a great relief to Jolhnson, but wuz pizen on me. With the most uv em, the anguish, anxiety, and-solissitood in the gittin uv offises and friee drinks wuz about an ekal thing. The offisis they wantid wuz merely the means to that pertikeler end; and so long ez they wuz gittin the latter without the trouble uv the formner, tlhey wuz content. A good constooshen and a copper-lined stumick carried me thro this tryin ordeel, until I caine across a Boston applicant, who, in consekence uv the perhibitory law, lied bin for some time on short rashens, and wuz keen set. Napoleon hed then met lhis Wellington, and I succumd. The man's talent wuz wonderful. Selkretary Seward wuz in trouble about the Blair family.. He hed dlid his level best for em. He hed appinted em to Col- lekterships and furrin mishuns; but the crooel Senit, wich hed no respeck for us, took delite in fistening uv em onto us by perpetooally rejectin cm. Jest after a long siege by Mont- gomery and the old man, I scjestid the purchis uv the Rooshen Territory, to wich not only they cood be sent, but a thousand uv others wich we lhed on our hands; and the Selretary wuz so pleased at the idea thht lie wept like a child. He set imejitly about gittin testimonials ez to the valyoo uv the territory, to inflooence the Senit in ratifyin the treaty he was agoin to make. He wrote to a naval officer about it, who answered more promptly than I ever knowd a naval -offiser to do, ez fol- lows : "It's trooly a splendid country! The trade in the skins uv white bears kin be, if' properly developed, made enormous. There is seals there, and walruses so tame that they come up uv their own akkord to be ketched. "P.

MayI I hope that my scientifik attainmelnts are suffishently well known to yoo to recommend me as a proper person to head the expedishen? May I? "I hev the honor to be," et settry. The President wuzi't favorably inclined. He wuz full uv the old fogy idea that it wuz rather chilly there than otherwise. He hedn't faith in the Isothermal Line, and wuz skepticle about the Gulf Stream. It wuz his experience that the further North yoo got the colder it wuz. For instance, lie remarll;t, that while the people wuz warm toward him in Virginny and Mary- land, last fill, they became very cold cz lihe got North. Wher wuz the Isothermal Line and the Gulf Stream then? Randall, who will lhev his joke, remarklt that the isothermal line twisted. He notist that the people made it cz hot for em ez lie wahtid it ez fur North ez Cleveland; to wichll Selkretary Welles replied, that it only confirmed him in the opinion that for platin vessels uv war, iron wuz preferable to pine plank any time. Seward removed the President's objections to-wunst. He read his letters, wicll set forth the beauties and advantages uv the country twict over.

"Think uv," retortid the Sekretary, with a quiclknis nv in- tellek remarkable, " thinle uv yettin rid uv the Blairs forever!" "Will the Ablishn Senit ratify the treaty?" askt Johnson, eagerly. "I converst with many on the subjick, and they sed ef we cood promise that the Blairs would accept posishens ther, they wood do it cheerfly. For sich a purpose, sed one uv em to me, $7,000,000 is a mere bagatelle." "I'll do it," sed Johnson. "I agree with the Senators for once. Rather then hev it fail, I'd pay it out uv Mrs. Cobb's share in our jint spekelashens. Freedom from the Blair family! Good Hevings! kin one man be so blest?

Befbore it wuz finely con. clooded, some other little incidentals wuz inclooded by the Zar, wich run the price up to $10,200,000, but that wuz notliin for us. Seward wenlt at his work with great energy. The purclhis wuz divided up into six territories (fobr the numberc uv delegates to our convenshuns wuz ltarge, and thhey all lied to be provided for), wich wuz named, respectively, Johnson, Seward, Cowal, Doolittle, Randall, and Welles.

Cin- cinnati went Ablishin stronger than ever. Chicago ditto; and most everywhere the Dimocratic rooster wuz flattenled. The cabinet, when they heerd uv Deekin Pogram's assault upon a nigger, on the receet uv the intelligence uv the election news, notified me officially that a repetishen uv sich loonacy wood be equivalent to a reseet uv my resignation, even tho the post offis shood be discontinyood.

I hev egsamined into the pedigree uv that nigger, and 1 find that his mother hed the lawtiest blood uv Virginny coursin toomulchusly thro her veins - and that stock the Pogralm mix coodent materially depreciate in one generashen. I lied the niggers uv the X Roads handsomely in tow up to yisterday. I lied em attendin services last Sunday at tlhe meetin-house, and by private arralngement lied em seated miscellaneously among the awjence. Delkin Pogram lied a wench, with weighed at least 250 pounds averdupoisc, atwcen him and his wife, whvlile four oter niggers ornamentid his pew. Bascon, with alacrity, consented to three; and Elder Gavitt provided seats for four. It wuz a pleasant site! White and black wuz alternatid lilke the spots on a cllecker-boardl-nig- gers and whites wuz sRlread out tocethcr like the ilt and lean in pork; and ez I seed it I cood hardly restrane my emoshens. There before me wuz the regenerashun uv th Democratic party - there wuz wat wuz to bring us out, uv the valley and shadder uv deatlt into wich we lied fallen, up on the lligl ground uv offishel life. I preached that day from two texts, to wit: ' Uv one blood did 1he1 makel all the nashens uv tlhe earth," and "All ye are brethren." I demonstrated with great fervor the loonacy uv the idea that the Alnighty wood take the trouble to create two or more races when one wood do ez well - wich idea is alluz well receeved in tlhis region. All men Jobrm their idea uv the Deity from themselves; and I never knowd a Confedrit Cross Reoader to maako two things when one wood anser. I refuted the theory, that tlhereo wuz more than one head to the race, by quotin the texts wich treated uv the creashen uv Adam and lEve, and demolished the -Tam doctrine at site. "Ef;" scd I, "Noer did cuss Ham, and condemn Canaan to be a servant unto his brethren, lhow do we know that our colored brethren and sistren is thle desendants uv Ham and Canalan? It may be us for ath we know! Is it his color? Is not black jest ez convenient a color ez white?" "More so," murmured Mrs. Pogram, half asleep, "more so - it don't show dirt." "Is it his shape?

Ef beauty, or comeliness, or shape, is to decide the pint, the Lord help us! Is it his smell? The New York World asserts that the nigher hain't no smell, and ef he hez, why shoodent he hev? Standin under the conmmon flag uv our country, with his hand upon that magna charta, the Deklarashen, and his beamin eye turned exultinly toward our naslnel emblem, the eagle, shall not our Afiikin brother be allowed to smell jist ez lie cllooses? Ef smell must be uniform. then lot our Government establish a Burow uv Perfoomery to-wunst. I take high religious grounds in this matter. Ef lie hez a natural odor, the Lord give it to him. Let us not fly in the face uv the Lord by condemin it. Judge not, lest we be judged. The odor uv the colored gen- tleman or lady is the work uv the Lord--the odor uv yoor unwashed fcet is yoor own--wich shood stand the highest? "I acknowledge that I hev not long held these views. I hev shared the common prejudis, and liev contemned our friends uv color; I hev despitefully used 'cm; I hev gone for 'em, and banged 'em lile old boots. But it wuz becoz I didn't know 'em. I didn't see the kernel of meat utnder the rough shell: I didn't recognize the glitrin diamond in the ebony coal. My eyes hev bin opened. Like Saul of Tarsus, I see a lite. Sence the passage uv the Military Bill I hev diskivered many things. I hev mostly found out all these things sence that occurrence. Let us accept the situashen, and bless the Lord that it hez resultid in developin excellences where we didn't expect to find 'emr." There wuz an affectin scene after service w'Uz over. Deekin Pogram, Captain McPelter, and Elder Gavitt shook hands with em with a degree uv coljality I didn't expect. They develop a degree uv adaptability to circumstances wich I didn't look for. I really bleeve if I'd a told em that it wood hiev a good effeck to kiss the nigger babies all round, tlat they'd a done it. But I spared em this. Thlere is such a thing ez laying it on too thick. But all this wuz spiled the next day. There wuz a heavy mail that day. In addition to the paper wich Pollock, the Illinois storekeeper, takes, ther wuz eight others; and to my surprise they wuz all directed to niggers. "Wat is this?"   THE NORTHERN PAPER.       429 thot 1 to myself. "Hev the Ablishnists uv the Nor tlh deter- mined upon proselytin these men, and are they goin to flood this country with their incendiary readin?

'"Thank Heaven!" sod I, ' our people hev awakened to a sense uv the necessity uv doin suthin ;  and I handed the papers out to em, exhortin uv em to read em, ez they wuz trooth, and nothin but the trooth.

They led loatlhin depicted on their classick feechers. Unable to endoor this, I seezed one uv ein, and asked why I wuz treated thus? Delibritly he pulled out uv hs pockit one uv them cissid Northern papers, and pintid indiginantly to a editorial article. It was perfoosely headed in this wise:-- Shel niggers vote? - Shel the proiud Caucastshc  be redoost to a ekality with the disgustiin Affikin? - Is this a while man's government or not? - Amerikcy for wzhite menc ! - Sod this Ethiopian, with lhis fingers on this headin, " 'Pears like ez ef dah wuzn't jist dat good feelin towards us colored men on de part ob de Dimoc'sy ob the Norf' dat dah ought to be.

Thle Elder wuz snufft out jest oz the flowers uv spring wuz cumin--jest ez the weather wuz a gittin warm enough to go barefooted -jest when it wuzn't nessary to bother about gettin fire-wood, or be concerned lAbout feedin the stock--jest when it begins to be comlfbrtable a sittin onto the grocery stoop -jest at the threshhold uv six months' enjoyment. Why wuz lie taken? Ekko anersl.  The ways uv Providence is inskrootable.  Elder Gavitt wuz a native uv North Karliny, wich State he left in the blush uv early manhood, jist after lie wuz married. Wat he left North Karliny for, I never wuz able to assertane percisely; but I hev understood that it wuz suthin in coInnDec tion with a smoke-house, and the hams w'ich did 1lang therein. He wuz in a Whig nabelriood - his naber, the proprietor of the smoke-house, wuz a Whig - ther wuz sum hams missed- the rinds wuz found in his possession - Whig intolerance and perselkooshen. Upon sich slite evidence lie wuz adjudged guilty of theft, and wuz ignominiously rid on a rale, and ordered to leave the country in twenty-four hours, wich lie did, driftin nat'rally to Kentucky. Tliank Heaven for sicli out- rages! But for sich, Kentucky wood either hev bin a Repub- lican State, or wood hev remained unsettled. Elder Gavitt wuz alluz a Democrat uv the strictest sect. He voted for Jackson, and reglerly for every Democratic candi- date sence. He didn't read very much ; indeed, he coodent do it all all, and wuz, consekently, stedfast in the filith. Heo wuzn't shook about, and driven hither and yon by every wind, but remained thro life fast in the groove into wich lie lied bin origenelly sot. His politikle creed wuz made up uv this one idee, to wit: Hatrid uv Noo England. He hatid Noo England becoz Noo England hatid whiskey, iwich he coodent git along without, and slavery, uv wich he becd a hundred niggers. He votid agin Noo England all his life reglerly, and cz many times on each eleckshen day ez lie cood, without risk. My acquaintance with the deceest commenst about three years ago.

Ther wuz no need uv formal introduckshens - ther wuz already a bond atween us wich knit our souls together. His eye, ez it lit onto my nose, lighted up wi'th a  smile; and ez I gazed on hizzen, I felt that he wuz indeed a man and a brother. He took me in - he sheltered me - he  gave me whlereof to eat and to drink and to make merry, and  with him I tarried till I wuz reglerly installed ez paster uv the i Church, and thereby reglerly provided for.      h     i ; The cause uv the Elder's death wuz a broken heart. He  wruz a ardent Confedrit, and manfully bore up under the     -: reverses of the war. His courage wuz unshaken doorin the  repeated successes uv the Federal larmies; and even when    I, emancipation deprived him uv his slaves, he still hed faith   J; that, evenchooally, all wood be well.

His head bowed with supprcst grief-his bosom throbbed with the emoshen that wuz strugglin for uttrance.   - He wood come over to my offis five or six times a day, and ask me to read him that passage uv the law givin the nigger the  5 ballot. I wood do it, when, without sayin a word, he wood  ,^  reel off, with tears flowin down his wasted cheeks, to Bascom's. '  I wood foller him, to see that no harm came to him. The old man wuz so broken that he'd pay for Ihis own lilkker and mine ? too, without noticin. Fearin to awaken unpleasant emoshens in his mind, I never menshened the latter circumstance.    ^ Things grelw worse with him. When Randall wrote to me    i to consiliate the niggers, the old man obeyed without a murmur. t!^ Democrisy wuz his first idea, and he obeyed her bellests, tho 'twuz consoomnin his very sole.

The iron entered his sole, and    THE SAD EVENT.         433 it wuz eatin him up by degrees. Ite  walled the streets listlessly, his eyes suffoosed with tears, and his lips movin ez ef mutterin suthin to hisself. I become concerned for him, and so did the entire cirkle. Bascom figgered up llis aknkount at his bar, and went to the records to see whether bIis farm n uz unencumbered, and sich uv the neighbors cz lhod lent him small sums sot about gittin em. Last Sunday the pitcher went to the well for the last time. I hed four niggers in his pew, upon whlomn le looked vacantly, but sed nothin. After servis, I stopped him. "Elder," sez I, in a whisper, " it wood e aood  eff good ck efyoo cood liiss them little nigger girls." "Parson!P sed he, tremblin lilke a leaf, " is it absolootely necessary?" "It is the dooty uv evry Dinoklrat, in this crisis, to kiss ez many nigger children ez possible." A strange expression lit up the old man's countenance. In a frenzied manner he kissed all thlere wuz in the church, and comynenst on the adult females uv that persuasion.  With difficulty we restrained blim; but breakin loose firom us, lie startid down the street, a runnin down and kissin every nigger child his eyes restid on. Finally he sunk to the ertlh eggs- austid, and we bore him to bhis house and put Iim to bed. From that bed he never ariz. He wuz a goner. We lidcc  to give him his lilker in a spoon, and I never knowd a Kentluctk ian to recover who wuz past drinkiil out pv a bottle. Slowly his strength wasted. Yesterday lie rallied and asked foli mo. "Perfesser!" sed lie, with an effort, " is Kentucky to rool the niggers, or the niggers to rool Kentucky? Has Dimoc- risy swallered the nigger, or the nigger  swallercdl the Dimocrisy?" And all wuz o'er! Ho fell back a piece uv clay, rvicl never co6d rally to tho poles agin. Basconi and I turned aside and wept. SCd Bascom, ' Hed he lived two years more I wood liev hed }his farm."

Ther wuz Yoonited States officers aboard; but out of respeck for the feelins uv their illustrious " prizner," ez he is techn-ically called. they kept theirselves out uv his site, that their uniforms might not awaken onpleasant refleckshens.

The ladies' cabin wuz originelly assigned to the party; but a female passelnger lied no more regard for the comfort uv the marter than to die on the passage, and they were deprived uv it. The conservative merchant insisted that the corpse be chucked overboard; but Mr. Davis, with a magnanimity charac- teristic uv him, rcfoozed. "No," sed he, " let her rest there. I kin endoor the inconvenience, severe ez it is. It is but one more attempt to breal my sperit." All the way up the most tecllin deference wuz shown lhim. At every landin the people assembled to greet him, wich lhe acknowledged with a condesenshen I never saw before. He conversed but little on the passage. Ez the boat wuz passin pints made historicle by the events uv the great struggle, his eye wood brighten, ef they wuz sich pints ez a Confedrit cood take pride in, and dim withll teers ef they wuz pints at wich ther had bin reverses. The most considrit preparashens led bin made for his resep- shen. Ther wiuz no irons onto him: the only guards in site wuz them wich wuz detailed to keep the crowd from annoyin him, and a carriage wuz in readiness, into wich we wuz driven off at a dignified pace to that resort uv the aristocracy uv Virginny - t}o Spottswood. Here, more considerashen wuz shown.

There wuz sum triflin legal formalities, and the President's counsel made a motion that he be admitted to bail. There wuz a stir in the Court. ' Make it a million!" sed one, "so that the craven North shel see how we kin take keer uv them we love!"But Judge Underwood fixed it at $100,000, and, brisk ez bees, a Noo York Dimocrat, several Richmond Ding crats, and Horris Greely, stept forrerd and signed it.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE TRIP TO RALEIGH. POST OFFIS, CONFEDIIT X ROADS,  ) (wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky),  June 10, 18G7. ) I ACCOMPANIED the President to Rawly.    The President doesn't feel safe at goin anywhere without me to arrange tile details, and do the nice financeerin wicl is necessary. The Rawly trip wuz the occasion of a serious truble in the Cabinet. The President wuz in favor uv it. Ez lie sedy, lie Senator Wilson, of Massachlusetts, Representative Kelley, of Philadlelpha, and other prominent Republicans, in 1867 made the tour of the Southern States, delivering addresses in the principal cities. To neutralize the effect of their speaking President Johnson determined to follow them, and the laying of the corner-stone of a nmonument, to the memory of his father, who died in {Raleigh, N. C., many years before, was made the occasion tiherefor. Mr. Nasby's account of the trip is but little exaggerated. It wts as exquisitely absurd as the great Chicago excursion.  &#xD;<pb n="440-441" xml:id="VAC7107-00000239"/> "O         THE DISCUSSION. wuz essenshelly uv a filial persuasion. He hed alluz experienced a most consoomin love for his parents, partickelerly for them on his father's side. He lhed swung around the entire cirkle uv offishel honor, and lied found traitors on all sides; but he cood lay his hand on his heart and say that he hed never knoswed a troo mail but who, at some period uv his life, hed a f:cther. Why, then, shood we not honor our fathors? How could it be better dun than by layin corner-stuns? His father deceest in 1812, and it wuz time that this dooty wuz attended to. Besides, at this crysis in the affairs uv the country, with Wilson and Kelly a snortin tlhrough the South, he felt it wood be a good thing to show ourselves. Seward felt that it wuz well to go. Filial love wuz cllar- min. Shakspeer, wlio wuz ez justly celebrated ez a dramatist ez one lie cood menshhun wuz for diplomatic telegraffin, remarlt, "How sharpe-r nor a serpent's tooth it is to lhev a thankless child," - the truth of whllich lie led experienced, ez he hed been styled the father uv the Republican party: but that wuz not to the pint. It is the dooty uv every soin to lay corner-stuns. In this case it wood, perhaps, hiev bin more creditable lheal it been dun fifty years ago; but wat difference is it? It is natral ez we are about lbeing gathered to our fathers, that we shood remember em. Besides, lie hed a little speechl wich he felt he'd like to deliver. IToe wanted to bear testimony to the patriotism uv thoe son uv Jacob Johnson - particularly to our colored brethren in North Carliny, who hev bin listeiiin to Kelly and Wilson. Randall didn't bleeve in it at all. He made bold to say that ez the deccast Johnson hod slept without a corner-stun for fifty-five years, he'd manage to git along without it- a wliile longer. It wuz rather late in the day. He bleeved in feelin sorrowful over the decease uv our relatives, but he didn't go much on doin it fifty-five years after date. It wuz too much like bustin into tears over the suffrinls uv the last illness uv ver wife's great-grandmother. The speeches he didn't bleeve in at all. He hed seen some uv it - he led accompanied one toor uv the kind. He lied bin on it. He wuz at Cleveland, at Indianapolis, and Springfield, Illinoy. He begged to be ex- coosed, He didn't keer about tailin sich a kite agin. Ef the   THE DETERMNATTION.        441 people uv the South shood receive us ez corjelly ez the people uv the North did, he preferred to consult his feelils a1dd be absent. He wuz a sensitive plant, and disliked suml tlillns'. Ef his memory served him rite, the demonstrashens coodlelt be considered flatterin. Tlle peoplo didn't fling dead( cats at us, but they did wuss. WhVllere thellcy uz coldl, thcey iwz rathler too cold. Where they wuz inl a volatile lhunor, tlhey wuntz rather too lively. He hed about mllade lp his mind that it wuzn't uv any yoosq to fite it out on that lilne ef it took all sulmmer. Success is a dooty ; but wheln success is as imlpossi- ble ez water in the great -Sahara, wat's the yooso? Whllcreire struggle? Let us go slow, draw our salarics to the cllld uv our 'spective terms, and so live that wcen the sumnmons comres to jine the innoomerable caravanll thllt moes out uv Washinton to'ards their 'spectivo lhomes, weo go not like the dusty slave at nite, wat's bet his all on two pair, but sootlhed and sustained by wat we saved,   go like one whlo's got the wlerlewithlal to live. It wuz a source nv comftort to llim to know tlhat the worst men wuz soon forgotten. Whlo ever speaks uv Tyler, or Peerce, or Bukanonl, now? B1enedict Arnold is only spokent uv on Fourth uv Julys, and Judis Iskariot on S1unldays. It will be so with us in time, for wich thank the Lord. But it wuz determined to go, and I wruz sent to Rawly to findl werle the grave uv the honored fathher of our honored President wuz reely locatid, and to mlake othelr arrangemienlts. I lied difficulty in locatin the grave, and ainl't jest shoor thiat I found the right one. The people uv Rawly wuz anxshus to hev it come off, ez trade wuz dull in tohe rcetil line ; and for I fear that I wood report that the grave coodent be foundd, and this "ip their budding liopes, they giv me the choice uv fiftteen. Selectin the most eligible, I made the uther arrangements and returned. The eggscurzion contrastid very favorbly witlx the one we took last fall. The people receeved us at every stashen with the most affectin deomonstrashuns uv lIuv. "Jolmnson! Jolhnson! Jollnson!7 they yelled at each stoppin-place, wich sounded sweeter in his ears and mine tlian tloe damnable iterashen of "Grant! Grant! Grant! i' wich greetid us at every pint North.

President commence, ';Fellow-citizens!" than Randall wood pull the bell-rope, and off the trane wood start. He wuz determined that the President shouldent speek, wich put me to a grate deal uv trouble, ez after we arrived I bed to write out and telegraph to the papers the speeches the President wood hev Inade. At Rawley, General Battles welcomed the Presidential party, and the President responded. He remarked that in Rawley he first opened his tender eyes, a penniless boy. Here is the scene uv his childhoodL; here is everytlhing to bind man to his fellow, and to associate himn with that withl wich he is associated; here is where the tenderness uv heart hev taken holt upon everything to wich it hicz attaclled itself. But lie wuz wandrin fronm his subjick. His mind went back to the day lihe left this city a penniless boy. Whllere is them he left behind him? He begged to inquire where is the scenes uv his childhlood? Where's the Haywoods? "Killed at Antietam!" shouted a returned Confedrit. "I wuz by William's side when he wuz shot." "Where is the Hunters?" "Runnin a distillery at Waxhlall's Court 'ouse," sed this same fellow, who thot the President really wantid to know. He wuz choked down, and the President proceeded:- "Wher is the Roysters and the Smithses, the Brownses and the Joneses? Wher is the long list of men that lived at that day, and who, like me, command respeck for constancy of devoshen? I feel proud of' this demonstraslen - I feel proud of any demonstrashen. Ez alloosion hez bin made to my boy- hood days, when I wuz a penniless boy, I may say here, ez pertinent to that suljeck, tha;t I hev adhered to the funda- mental principles uv the gov'ment, and to the flag and Constoo- slien. But to return to my subjeck. When I went out foiom among yoo a penniless boy, I adoptid the Constooshen ez my guide, and by them I hev alluz bin guided. To the young I would say that they will be safe in talkin me ez a model. Leavin here a penniless boy, it is not for me to say whether or not I hev succeeded.

All places uv honor is now before em.  I thank you for this corjel welcom. North Caroliny sent me out a penniless boy, and did not afford me sich advantages ez, considerin my merits, I ought to hev bed; yet I luv her. It's better ez it wuz.

I thlank you for this tribute to my many good qualities." And lie startid to go down, wlicn Randall whispered sutliin in his left ear. Risin promptly, anld drawin out his hanker- chief, the President assoomed a look uv snbdood greet, and resoomed. "I lhev come among yoo to participate in the dedicashen uv , a monument to a man wich yoo all loved, tlio it lhez taken sutlin like fifty yeors for yoo to diskiver it. He wuz poor and humble, wich iakkounlts for my goin firomn among yoo a pennliless boy; but uv him I amn proud, - for hieod it not been for him, I woodent hev returned the slinin example to yoo young men wich I am." The corner-stun wuz laid, and the monument set on it. It is uv red limestone, ten fobot ligh. It's ez good a ten foot uv stun respeck ez there is in North Carliny.  Ez the monument was elevatid, there wuz appropriate speeches, and tlchn my little arrangements cum in. A nigger woman I lied took with us from Washington rushed for'ard, and sed, "Bloss do Lord, l'ze bin a waitin ftr dis day to see de President,--our l'resi. dent!" at wich a squad uv niggers i'd picked up and drilled, hollered " 'Ror!"                   v This little affectin sceen over, two quadroons, wich I'd also bro't with us in a privit car, cum for'ard with a expression of' profound greef, at wich the President wept, and tenderly slung bokays uv the clhoicest flowers we cood buy in Wasingtono, upon the tomb.

It wuz a sceen easier to be imagined than described. Ther wuz incidents which occurred wich did nDot appear in the telegraph. When his Excellency wuz speekin uv himself; and rernarlit that his race wuz nearly run, a unregenerated nigger yelled out, "Tank de Lord!"And when the quad- roons wuz a strewin flowers on the grave uv His Excellency's father, I observed rather more titterin among the niggers than I approved uv on so sollumn an occasion.

At the Cabinet meetin leld to discuss the question, Seward expressed a desire to go. Welles follered Seward; but Ran- dall opposed it. "But," sed Johnson, "I foel ez thougll I must mako one more effort to save, our erlin Soutlren 1brethllrenl." 4"Mr. President," rctortid Randall, "I recently went to raise a corner-stun to the memry uv yoor lamenti(d fitlher, who deceest in 1812, onto wich wuz engraved these words:- JACOBB JOHNSON, died from the Efcx uv a Disease superin- doost by a over lEffort to save his 1iodiectds fqom drotzinm.'

He was treated with respect, and that was all.  &#xD;<pb n="446-447" xml:id="VAC7107-00000243"/> "6         RANDALL'S OPINION. we determine upon beforelhnd.  Yoo go thro Delaware, which is ourn; Noo Jersey yoo've bin thro wunst, and they know wat to expect; Noo York will. give a enthoosiastic re- cepshun ef Morrisy and Wood will take holt uv it, and in Con- necticut yoor certain uv a corjel resepshen. That State is full uv demoralized Yankee Dimocrats, who hev bin out to Michi- gan, and left there all ther Pnritanismln bringin back with erm, in its stead, all the cussidnis indigenous to that soil, wich cussidness, grafted onto ther natral cutenis, makes cm rather enterprisin in ther wortlilisnis. In Boston itself, the prospeck is good. There'll be a immense crowd present to dedicate the Masonik Temple, wich we shell claim the credit uv bringin, ez we did the throngs which come to see us on the toor North, but wich wood persist in hollerin I Grant! The trooly good men uv Boston are Ablishnists; but there's some thousands wich want offices, and them, with a sprinlklin uv Demokrats and Conservatives, ought to make us a handsome recepshen. There is yet men in Boston who used to return fugitive slaves, and ther is besides the eminently respectable gentlemen who are so conservative that tlhey hold onto sin becoz it's old and established by precedent, and so aristocratic that they won't do right, jist becoz doin rite is a common thing in that seekshun; who hold onto the cote-tale uv progress, and holler 'Stop!' and who, ef they tie theirselves to a good cause, load it down with their dignity. Like the 2(1 Lootenants uv '61, their baggage is worth more'n they are. But the trip won't hurt us. You can't make the Ablishnists more Ablishn, and them cz foller us for the loaves and fishes we dispense, wood still foller us, ef the road we took led ez strate through perdishen ez a pigeon wood fly. It may be that it's the method by wich we shel finally carry Noo England. Pope sez,- ' Vice is a monster uv such hidjus mien, That to be hated needs but to be seen.' "Now, ef we follered the poet no further, we shood never go, but each one wood keep ez close in his respective apart- ment ez possible. But, knowin mankind, he goes on:- ' But seen too oft, familiar with its face, We first endoor, then pity, then embrace.'   IN NEW YORK.          447 "That's it. We must be seen too oft. We must xnaklo eml famniliar with our face. Ef we stay long enuff, I don't despair uv seecin Boston give yoo an ovRashen, and seein yoo locked in the arms uv Wendell Pliillips. Ef they commence pityin you, the reackshen iwill take thloim to the cnmbracin, and it seems ez though the ought to be, at thallt pint, by this tinec. And tlhen ef yoo make this toor, and say nothing ideotil;, the very novelty uv it will bewilder the people." I And so it wuz decided to go. Threo Maryland the resep- shens wuz all that we desired, and in Delawaro the peoplo comne in crowds to greet us; the the cleers partook so muchl uv the naclier uv the cheerful yells wich the Conftldrit soljers employed when they charged, tlhat Sekretary Sewanrds nerves wTuz somewat shockt.

When it lied finally passed, Mr. Ran- dall annouhst the fact, and the Presidcnshcl face -assoomed its yoosual benine expression, cz we glided into the sacred soil uv Noo Jersey. In Noo York, Morrissy hed done his part. Thller wuz spccta- ble bodies uv cheerers at thi pints tagreed upon, a, cz they hed bin paid librally, the spontaneous cnthoosiasm wuz ez good in quality ez it wuz larrge in quantity. Occasionally a, cheerer, wich lied taken too much uv his wagcs in advance, wood yell fobr Jeff'son' Davis, but it Twuzn't notist. It didn't mar the pleasant uniformity uv the proceedins, or strike any- body ez 6ein singler. They tried terrible htrd to git a speecle out uv us, and the President wuz willin; but Randalll, seeill reporters present, supprest him, and got him off to bed comn- paratively sober, and very early. Arrivin at Boston, I wuz surprized at the length, depth, and breadthl uv the enthoosiasm wich greeted us. Ez ef to show ther greef at the deatli uv Presidents, we notist everywhlere the portraits of our predecessor, Linkin, draped in mournin, iat wicth the President dropt a teer, sayin, "See how they mourn us wen we're everlastinly gone!"

Randall pulled at his coat-talc, when the President remarlkt that lie might say, without egotism, that he didn't desire to make a speech, and stopt. We brought him off in comparla- tively good order. We stopt at the Tremont House. It is a good hotel, and the waiters are, ez they ought to be, niggers. It's soothin to a tlroo Dimekrat to be waited on by a tnigger. You kin dlamn a nigger waiter, but put a white map in that posishen and yoo feel a delicacy about it. When we retired, the President insisted that I shood sleep lyin across thie doorway uv his room. "Why?" asked I. "I am in Boston," replied he, " whl r they stun the prophets. Boston dislikes me. Boston wears to-day a smilin face ; but wat kind uv a hart does that smilin fice conceal? Sumner lives in Boston, and so does Phillips. In Boston they elect niggers to the Lcgislacher, and are tryin to stop the sale uv whiskey. Wat kind uv a place is that for a Dimckratic Presi- dent to trust hisself into?

With this letter in my hand I fell asleep, and dreemed. Methawt I wuz in Noo Orleans at a gatherin uv the Faithful, The more sagacious of the Southern Democracy were for a long time anxious to submit to the inevitable results of the war, but the masses were kept in a state of turmoil by the promises of the Northern Democracy to carry them through. And these promises were made in full view of their inability to carry any of the Northern States.   THE DYING GIANT.        451 who wuz called together for the purpose of considrin wat to do.

"We'll sustain yoo. Northern Dimocrisy is' a giant wich kin yet pertect yoo. He's in his prime, and strong enuff yit to carry yoo throo twice the troubles wich threatens yoo. Depend onto us - we'll carry yoo." And the Southerners whopped over to their side and yelled fiercely, "No submission!" and immejitly the entire bilin luv em startid North with these men, to ascertain the strengtlh and carryin capacity uv the Northern Dimocrisy. Methawt the party travelled until they come to a vast plain in Kentucky, onto wich wuz extendid the prostrate form uv a Giant. It was a Giant, immense in statoo, but emaciated to the last degree. His limbs led bin strong, his teeth terrible, and hs trunk massive; but it wuz plane to see that he wuz pegged out, and a look at its face showed why it wuz -so. Dissipation had redoost him to helplessnis. His face wuz bloatid and bloo, his eyes wuz sot and ghastly, hiis chest was holler and sunken, his legs like pipe-stems, and ulcers, boils, sores, broozes, and contooshens kivered him from head to foot, and he drawd his breath with a effort. He lay a groanin and a groanin. Randall wuz a tenderly feedin him out uv a huge bottle, labelled. "Appintments," which appeared to give him temprary strength; but the effect of thiat wuz lost by President Johnson's dosin him with an offensiv smellin mixter, labelled "Policy," every swaller uv wich wood throw him into a spasm. Governor English was rubbin one arm witlI a liniment Randall gave him, and hed succeeded in gittin up a little circulation in it. "Wat is this?" askt the Southerners. "Northern Dimocrisy!" sed English, rubbin away vigrously. "Is this the Giant which is to carry us?" said the Southern gentleman, viewin the disgustin objict doubtfully. "Certainly!" sed Johnson.

The Giant made an effort, but flopped down agin like a dish-rag. "Gentlemen!" sed Vallandigham, " we shel hev to call upon you to assist in settin him onto his feet, and t4en it'll be all rite with him. He's bin this way afore." Accordingly, the Southerners gathered around him to lift him up. His arms, I notist, wuz marked respectively Connec- ticut and Delaware, and his legs Maryland and Kentucky, and ill them there wuz strength, for ez soon ez the innocent South- erners got near enuiff he wrapped them limbs around em, and sed, "Lift!", "We can't," sed they. "Yoo must," sed he; "I got into this condishen fightin yoor battles, and doin yoor work. I was strong and vigorous until I got to runnin after yoor iharlots; and for yoor sake I wuz druv out uv my native States into this accussid region. Yoo must carry me wat time 1 hev yet to live. Hist me!" Those caught coodent get awtay, and the others generously come to ther aid, and makin a terrible effort, they raised the half-dead bein onto their shoulders, holdin their noses 'mean- while, and prepared to start. Es the percession wuz about to move, Vallandigham  remarked, "Stop a minit, gentlemen!" and, loaded ez he wuz with his war record, he clambered up ther shoulders and took a seat on the carkiss. Voorhees, jist ez badly encumbered, did likewise, and so did the Woods, and Bookannan, Seymour, Toucey, and a hundred or so more, the unfortunit bearers sweatin under this addishnal load. "Is all ready?" sed they. "One moment "   sed Johnson, and him,and Randall, and Seward climbed up. This wuz the last feather. The bearers mite hev staggered off under the carkiss, and them wich climbed onto it first. but this last addishn to ther burden wuz fritefill. It finisht em. Groanin under the weight, they swayed like a leaf in the wind, -  like a majestic tree jist about to fall. They struggled a minit to maintain themselves- but in vain.

Raymond and Thurlow Weed, wich hed bin hangin round, got out from under  jist in time to save theirselves. The Southerners got out from under the putrid mass, tho almost smothered by the stench. Vallandigham and that class made lite uv it, ez they had bin around it. It staggered Johnson some, but he lhod bin accustomed to suthin approximatin very closely to it in the old times, and it didn't serously affect him; but poor Randall, Seward, and Welles were smothered, and died. I wuz tryin to pull Randll's corpse out, when the effort I wuz makin awoke me. I ain't altogether certain but that that dream means suthin. When I think of it, it is rather preposterous for us to hope the Northern Dimocracy will carry us, when they can't carry a single State uv their own ; jist about z )preposterous ez it is for them to look to us for help, when all uv us cz wood jino em hevn't got a vote.

Uv course this doctrine will meet with objectors. We hev a few thin-skinned perfessers uv religion, whose piety service in our ranks hezn't quite obliterated, who will say that these dog- mas undermines the Christian religion. To this I shel answer, Uv wot comparison is any religion a Orthodox Dimocrat hez to a triumph uv the party? Wot hez Dimocrisy to do with religion anyhow? It hez never permitted it to mnix in its pollytix. Dimocrisy bleeves in keepin Church and State ez far apart ez possible. Shood the Ablishnists pint to niggers wich reed and write, I say to-.wunst that there is different degrees uv instink,- that ez one dorg hez more instink than another,'that so one nigger hez more than another; and then I slood wind this answer up by askin him, "Sir, wood you force yoor dawter to marry a nigger, even ef lhe cood reed and write?" This!hez alluz done good service, partikelerly ef yoo walk hurridly away before there is time for an answer. Ther is one pint wich is a stumper--but only one.

When a mulatter dies, wat then? Does the half sole uv thle halfl man drag the instilnk uv the beast behind it in a limpin, lop-sided fashion, into heaven? or does the instink drag the sole into the limbo for animals?"Ef this latter idea be correct," sed he, "t in that limbo how much South- ern sole is floatin about, held in solooshen in animal instinl!"

In short, ez Congress wuz adjourned, and coodent, by no means, be got together till November, the President wuz convinced that it wuz his dooty to improve his time, and be reelly President.- The liberal and shrewd use of patronage was all that saved the President from impeachment. There were Republican Senators who were opposed to it on legal grounds, but there were others who were too deeply indebted to thle President to vote for impeachment.  &#xD;<pb n="464-465" xml:id="VAC7107-00000252"/> "4      THE PRESIDENT'S CONFIDENCE.

My perorashen moved me to toers. It wuz on nigger suffrage. Depictin its untold horrors, I begged em to organize - to rally wunst-more agin this common enemlly.

Slid we contaminate the pure streeln uv Anglo-Saxon blood by muddlin it, with thlo turbid streem uv Etliiopy? '  I finisht my speech there. The meetin thenl resolved they wuz better than niggers; that they never wood consent to bo taxed obr the benefit uv purse-proud aristocrats; that the bonlds shood be taken up with greenlbax; that there stood be a return to specie payment to-wunst; and that they were willin to give millions, ef need be, to resist un1rpashen, but not one cent in taxes in a unconstitooshnal manner.

The President resoomed : "Feelin this day an uncommon solemnity, standin, cz we do, over the mortal remains uv the thousands wich died in tlhe sacred cause uv Liberty, and in defence uv the flag uv our coun -" "Hold!" sed the impetuous Maryland General, "I protest. In the name of Maryland I protest. Shel the Conservatives uv that glorious State be insulted by alloosions to liberty uv wiich they are deprived, and to the flag wiclh is the symbol uv oppression, and under wich we didn't fight?" I sustained the objeckslun, and that wuz struck out. He went on - "When I cast my eye over tlis field, and let it rest for a instant on this spot where the impetuous foemen wuz driven southward by our brave troops ---" Governor Swann remarked tlat on sich an occasion it wood be perhaps better not to menshun tie partikeler direckshuln in wich anybody wuz driven.

It wood read ez well Southl ez North, fim in tlat encounter both sides wuz, at times, driven. I sustained the amendment, and the President went on:- "In fucher years the pilgrim to the shrine uv Liberlty will paws a moment on this spot, to drop a tear over the graves uiv them who here checked the advance uv the hosts uv the rebellion, and --" Governor Swann was averse to this. It wuzn't soothin to the party wich wuz checked. It wood be better to reed, "drop a teer over the spot onto wich fraternal blood wu shed." Seein no objection to the amendment, I lied it done.

I thot so, and it wuz altered accordinly. The President per- . :  ceeded: -.: "Here, upon this spot, the armed hosts of rebellion were : met and hurled back by --"                  '-' Governor Swann sejested that that be omitted. The word  "rebellion," when applied to a brave people, who wuz strugglin  for wat they deemed their rites, wuz, to say the least, too  ! harsh. It wuz struckl olt, and the President went on:- -   ,: "Upon this spot, amid the roar uv cannon, the rattle uvt; musketry, and the clash uv contendin arms, thousands uv the  i: brave sons' uv patriotic sires gave up their lives."     i2 There wuz nothin in this objectionable. It cood apply to  ;  either side or to both, but ez everythin before it lied been stricken out, and ez there wuz alloosions follerin it that wood  hev to be, it wuz advisable to bust it, and accordinly I drew ? my pencil over it.      The President then wanted to ]now wat in thunder he shlood t say. Feelin that lie must say suthin, I prepared for him the  follerin remarks' - : "My Fellow-Countrymen: I appear afore you, not for the   , purpose uv makin any lengthly remarks: I simply desire to express my approbashn uv the ceremonies which hev taken    s place. My appearance is the speech wich I will make.

Yes, in peace and friendship, ez do the silent dead - uv bothl sides.

I endeavored in this to preserve, ez nearly as possible, the singularily beautifiul and loocid style uv the President, that the assembled thousands who shooed hear it mite recognize it to-wunst ez hizzen. Tlhe last sentence wuz oljected to. Tlohe Marylanders didn't know whether they cood sit in silence and hear sich talk about the "' Flag uv the Republic " and the "Constitooshun uv our Fatheors."  But they wuz overrnled. It wuz held, and properly, I tlhink, that the Constitooshhun uv our Fathers shood be lunderstood ez meanin that instrooment afore the Ablishnists lied knocked out uv it all that made it lovely in the eyes of Maryland - the nigger - and the flag ez it wuz at that period. lThey wuz finally satisfied with it, and Binckley teched up the speech in some miner pints for delivery. I didn't stay to the celebrashun, for I lied biznis elsewhlere. I writ the President's speech, so I knew that wuz rite; I h11ard Bradlfbrd's orashen read, and wuz pleased withi it. It wruz a powerful apology fobr the Northern soldiers, and nmust hev 1iad a good effeck onto the Southern mind. Feelin that it wuz all rite, I left agin fobr my feeld uv labor. PETROLEUMn V.

One enthoosiastic Dimekrat, wlho cost us $5, eled to be carried to the polls. He lied commenced early at one uv the groserics, and hed succumbed afolt votin. We found him sleepin peace- fully in a barn. We lifted the patriotic lmaln, and in percession marched to the polls. We stood him on his feet, two men sup- portin him - one on either side. I put a straight ticket into his fingers, and takin hs wrist witl one hand, held his fingers together with tother; and guided his hand to the box. Ez it neared the winder, he started ez efa electric shock hed struck him, and, straightenin up, asked, "Is it the sthrate ticket? Is Constooshnel Amindmint No! onto it?"

But when it come to givin uv em the &amp;  privilege uv votin beside him, it coodent be thot uv. He cood never consent that a race whose heels wuz longer than hizzen shood rool Ameriky.

I didn't quite see the force uv his objecshen, for it never ; okklirred to me that bein sent to Congris wuz the nateral  : consekence uv votin. I hev voted for thirty years, at many  elections four or five times, but I hev never bin to Congris. Wher is the constituency wich wood elect me? But it wuzn't  ): my biznis to controvert his posishen. It made no difference to me wat his reason wuz for votin ez I desired him to vote.   : The nigger-lovers beat up one man to vote for'the Amend- -. merit, wich, I saw by his dissatisfied look, hed bin over-per -ff swadid.

It wuz a glorious meetin, and I wuz a rubbin my lhands and feelin good at the prospeck uv an improvin occashun, tiX when, to my utter disgust, I saw the door open, and Joe Bigler,. : who wuz born to be my pest, come in, with Pollock, and twenty i or twenty-five niggers, old and young, male and female, whte, : yaller, and black, and all uv ecm took seats together in the   -corner uv the church. I knowd by the meek look uv the nig- gers, and the eggstrcem quietood uv Bigler hisself; that suthin a wuz up, wichll wood develop itself. Bigler and Pollock gen-  erally develop. I opened the meetin by remarkin that " the times wore an : auspishus look. The power uv the nigger in Amerikin politics lcd bin demonstrated. The nigger lied bin so manipulated in Ohio and Pennsylvany ez to give us these States, which we cood hold. But the Dimocrisy uv Ohio and Pennsylvany bed    : g a work to do, wich they cannot neglect with safety. They hed declared the nigger inferior to the Caucashen, and they must I  keep him so. The nigger must be kept jist wlher he is, to serve ez a irritant to Ditnocrisy. Oho gives the nig'gers uv ' W that State certain fLcilities for learnin to reed and write;  accomplishtmlents wich no laborin class wich is to be guided,  I controlled, and workoed excloosivoly by a sooperior class, needs ; ; or hiez any biznis with. So soon ez a man begins to reed he ie begins to hev an inquirin mind, and begins to feel a dissatisfac- tion with his speer. Let Ohio repeel these laws to-wunst, tliat the nig,gers may not -  "{ Reverse the arrangement," sed Bigler, "and git to be  sooperior to the white. Is that it, Perfesser?" "Not eggsackly that," returned I, not knowin wat he wuz  J drivin at," but ez Ilevin ordained the niggers to be inferior  i  to us, and serve us, it looks rather dangerous to "      i ; "Give him a chance to rise? That's wat yoor gettin at, I see. I am a Dimocrat, ez yoo know; but I don't shudder from that cause - not any. I hev faith in the Lord, wich yoo ap- pear to lack, wich is strange, considerin yoor profeshun. Ef   AND THE REGULAR INTERRUPTION.      483 mv colored friends here wuz ordained by the Almighty to alluz okkepy an inferior position to us, why, they'll do it anyhow, onless, indeed, we degrade ourselves below ther level. Ef I understand yoor idea, it is that the proud Caucashien is the only favored race wich fixes its own posishen itself, and that all the other races lied places assigned them, wich Godalmity herin fixed, they can't pass. That bein the case, wat's the yoose, Perfesser, uv our foolin away our time a tryin to strengthen his laws by any act uv ours? Ef the Almighty fixed it, kin we do it any better than lie?" "But spos'n the nligger, el' we don't keep him down by law, shood rise above us?" "I shood unanimously conclood that ther lied bin a mistake in the figgers, and that we wuz, after all, thel( sons uv Ham and they uv Japlheth. How wood yoo like that? But that ain't wat ails us. There ain't whtere our danger is. Dimocrisy, like a man with a tape-worm, carries the elements uv its own destruclkshen. Missegenashun is wat's sappin the fbunda- shuns uv the party.  Agrecin with yoo that the nigger's place is fixed, and that the Dimocrisy coodent git along with- out the niggeer, I hdler utter my solemn warning agin the con- tinycoal lessenin uv the race, becoz that race is our rock, and onto that we stand. Wat sense is there in wastin our capital, or ruther dilutin it?" "i Wat do yoo mean?" aslt I, not gittin at the drift uv wat he wuz drivin at. "Mean! IMy meanin is plain. The blacker the nigger is, the further lie is below us; the whiter he is, the nearer our ekal lie is. In this calculashun we don't take intelligence, or vircho o, or anything of the lkind into account, but percced upon the hypothesis that a devilish meanrwhite man is consid- erable better than a smart and honest nigger. Therefore, any drop uv white blood in a nigger's veins makes him just ono drop less objectionable. Look at the specimens wi ll I hev brought with me to illustrate my pint. The light-colored nig- gers will rise." And every cussed one uv em got up, ez ef by majic, and I saw to-wuinst wat he wuz goin for.

Ef this is done, let me    entreet yoo, brethren, to stop the bleecllin process.

Be- sides, when it's all run out - when the nigger don't show at all - then wat is to prevent em from walkin off alone, and settin up biznis for themselves ez white men? What will become uv the Dimocrasy then?" All this time the niggers wuz titterin, and the white women wuz gaspin for breatl, and the men wuz turnin red and1 wlite by turns.

Gently disengagin him, I led him .to Bascom's, fearin   -  that so great a waste uv flooids wood cut short the old saint's ^ life, unless that waste cood be repaired. We supplied the deficiency to-wunst. Never saw I sich a picter.

The Deekin wuz there, and I beleeve      ! every white male citizen uv the Corners wuz in his seet afore : the glad peals uv the bell lied ceased pealin.

Kernel McPelter wnantid no pay. He waid  is niggers. To accept pay wood be to acknollege the right uv a Illinoy goriller to releese em, wich he wood never do. He lied one , - he saw  her to-day--wich he wood hev back agin. Her  and lher husband, wich lied -bin marrllied sence thevy wuz torn from him, hed purchist ten alers uv ground up toards Garretts- II town, and wuz a livin onto it. Uv course, ez the emancipashun I wuz illegal, the produx uv their labor sence that time wiuz hizzen, jest the same ez though they remained in their normal condishen.  The ten akers woodent nlake lim good, but they bed two children born to em sence, wich, ef niggers brot any  price, wood do suthin toards it.                 * Bascom perferred to hev Government pay ther valyoo, and   ! let em stay free. They all hed some property now --least ways they could do wat they pleased with their money. Troo, the heft uv the proceeds uv their labor went to Pollock for dry  goods, and groceries, and sich, but he bleeved that they wuz a  imitative race. Ef they followed the eggsample sot em by their  white sooperiors, tley wood, in time, leave the heft uv it at his  bar, He   hed a few uv em under trainin now, and he notist  that they wuz better customers than the whites, ez they didn't swaller their rashens and tell him to " jist chalk it down." A   sense uv the meetin wVuz then taken, and a majority voted I to fust try to redoose them to their normal condishen. and ef that wuz decided to be impracticable, then we cood, with still 6 better grace, demand their valyoo uv the Government.

'The Yoonyun ez it  wuz I' Foller me i " t   AN EFFORT AND A FAILURE.       489 And forthwith the entire congretgashun piled out, rushinDr toward the nigger settlement on the Garrettstown road. Arrivin at the settlement, a consultashen wuz held. It wuz desided that I shood advance to the doors uv the houses and demand surrender, but I declined.  Kernel McPelter volunteered, and we all waited the result., He lnoclied at the door uv the first house. "Wha' d'ye want?" exclaimed a voice. "1 want yoo," sed the Kernel. "Wa' ftah?"  "My friend," sed the Kernel, impressively, " cf I recognize yoor dulcet tone, yoor my nigger. Four years ago yoo wuz , set free, yoo sposed, by Linkin; but we've done awaty with that. Come forth, and give yoorsclf up; you slid, cf yoo go peaceably, hev yoor old quarters agin, and be treatedl ez uv old."  "1 Go away, white man, and stop yoor foolin. Dis nigga's in bed!" "Break down the doors!" yelled the Delkin, " and hev done with it!" and a rush wuz made. The doors wuz brolke down, and in a minit the nigger and his wife, and two children, wuz out in the street, bound, and the Kernel hed the iurnitoor packt, ready to take to his own liouse. In the mean time assaults lied bin made on two other houses, with ruther diflferent results. Declin Pogram led one on the house uv a former slave uv hizzen, and wuz disabled by a charge uv shot in his leg, and the infooriated nigger threw v open the winder and swore tlhat he'd empty totlher barrel into the head uv the first man who came withn range.

It wuz desided that the alttemlpt to re-enslave em be given over for tht nite, and carryin tlhe Deekin, who wuz weak from loss uv blood, we made our way to the Corners agin.  The result demonstrated to me the impossibility uv the two races livin together in harmony.

Kin you, I asked, so degrade yorselves, and so blast the self-respeck uv yoor children?

The "martyrs " had already aired their grievances too many times to make such a gathering profitable. Edson -  B. Olds, of Ohio, was confined a sliort time in Fort Warren, and Mulligan and .

It requires too much uv an effort to weep, to do it on all olikashiuns.          :? Elder Abslum Pennibacker, to-wunst the strength and orna-  ment uv the meetin house luv wich I hey bin for two yeers the  pastor, departid this life at 2 P. M. this afternoon.

When one kin confer satisfaction at so little trouble ez carryin an onion in his pocket handkerchief e lie wood be a   broot indeed ef lhe did not prove hisself ekal to the occasion. Elder Pennib':mker wuz born in Pennsyl1any, uv real old Denmocratic stoclk. Tie wuz born amid the scenes uv the wNar= uv Intlependcnce, and lhe grlewed "p With levolooshenay  merneies inspirin him.

The old gentleman dyin, Abslum inherited the paternal akers, and paternal nig- gers, and become a man among men. The genius uv the msan nlow began to develop. Untrameled by the narrer views uv his paternal ancester, he boldly launchllt out for hisseli: 1-ie early distinguished hisself by his inventive genius, wicll took the retal Kentucky shoot. Twas hiin w ich conceeved the idea, uv braidin small wire into the lashes uv nigger whips ;. and not satisfiedl with that, lie, er ate a onth's Ihad study broughl t out the improvement in the nigger-paddle uv borin holes into it. He lhed a desprit struggle to get it adoptid.  Tlire blind plaiters uv the neighlborhood hed fiith in the old paddle, plain, and tfle Elder wuz'fbrst to demonstrate, by actooal experimllent on his niggers, its sooperior'ity. [Ie killed two in doin if, but loe fri- umplied. It wuz found that more cliastisclcent cood be in- flicted with it in a given time, tlhan by the old method, and that it lasted longer.        t I need not say wat his politics wuz. He wuz never nothin but a Dilnocrat. He commenst his career votin tlhree tihmes bor Jackson, and the candidates wich follered in succession l!edt no cause to complain uv his zeel. Under Bookahnan his faithhiulni s wuz rewardid.  The postABfis wich I now I otl wuz giv en him, and lhe discharged the dooties f:aithfully (iand to the best uv his ability.

The    -- offiser inl commanld wuz so anxlious to consiliate hm that le : wood gladly give cm up, withlout bein )ertikiler about pl'oofs,  and the Elder gathered, in tlhat way, in two molnths, over a hlundred. It required a good deel of ridin, and that fittigue, :! combined with the exposule incident to bushwhaclkin Fedal  pickets, wicll wuz guardin his fbnces and sich, brought on a spell uv sickness from which he never fiully recovered. The  Emancipaslen Proclamashen nearly finisht ,lim, and lhe lingered along, a broken man, ontil Jolhnson's 22d uv Febrooary speech, vich acted ez a tonic onto hm. He revived, but tie efbclek wuz temporary. Ez   the Conservatives made headway, he  came up, and ez Congris triumplled, he went down, and thus  he lived like a candle in a tin lantern, flickrin or quiet, ez the wind blowd. He pluckt up amazinly after the eleclishuns last fall, but alas, the treachery uv Meade and the re-instatement  uv Stanton wuz two   blows fi'om wich lhe cood not hope to  :- recover. And so, yesterday at 2   P. M.? wich in this case means post mortem, he died.  "Send in Sairey!

Isn't that the case ?"  &#xD;<pb n="506-507" xml:id="VAC7107-00000275"/> oUV         MR. BIGLER'S GRIEF. "Probably it is, but at the same time we ought to extend a helpin hand to our brethren North, who are inakin a valyent  fite- on this thing. Parson, we must hold a meetin on this  question, and resolve."'                     : Willin to accommodate Bascom, I called the meetin, and last nite it took place. It wuz an enthoosiastic gathrin. Skasely hed the horn tooted afbore the church wuz filled. It wuz curiosity : wich brot ern. None uv em but Bascom, Captain McPelter, and :  : myself; knowed vat a bond wuz, anlld the wantid to find out. ; I wuz called upon to state the objeck nv the gathrin. I opened  with a movin appeal to the people who wuz grloanin ullder a load uv taxashen, for the benefit uv the lordly bond-hlolders uv ;: the country; wlose very life blood wuz a bein suckredl out uv  em by the bond-aristocrats uv the country. At this pint Joe Bigler, who wuz uv course in the auicnce, commcnst weepin plerbosely, butt disgustiinly loud. lie ilrly  bellered, and displayed altogether too much emoshun. "n r. i gBlcr, " sed I, "woodlet a little less violent sorrer "Parson," sod lhe. "Iever helvin paid a  cussid cent IV taxes in nrI Slfb, I never krnowdv afbre how Inuch I wuz bein op- pressed. But I'll cont;ale  lyself if I kin. I'll colr up my woes if' they bust mne." I  then Nwent on to explane the Pcndleton ijee.  First, the Government owes abolut four hundred thonsand millions uv  dollers, moleo or less, vilh is borrowed. The Ablishn ijee is to tay this off ez it fitIls due, in gold, and in the mean tirme to pay  interest  onto the bonds ez pIr agreement on the face uv emn. Eut tlis is oppressive. T'lis payin interest is wat's eatin us up.  llelrefre , Pendleton  proposes to pay these bonds by ishooin fiour I und'led thousand million uv grcenbax. Wlien   F tlese gre enax wear out, so that they ain't passalle no morle-  so tlhat Bascom won't takel em for drinks, for instance, - lhy, then we'll pl'ritt more greenbax and give em ncw ones. I don't sec that the debt is paid off ally, but we git out uv the intrest. We ishoo a  non-bealin intrest note wich the greenback is, for . mn intlest-bearin note wich the pr'sent bond is, and compel te  bond-holders to take em, thus releevin us, tie tax payers, uv   ; the weight uv taxashen we are now compelled to carry. This ,hi ?;   AN UNEXPECTED RESULT.       507  ee is not,. however, original with Pendleton. He's bin a teelin my thunder. I subsisted many yeers in Noo Jersey by he same expedient. Whenever I owed a man I gave him nmy  ote, and felt that a great load wuz off my mind. When it )ecame doo, ef it made the creditor eny easier in his mindlil, I ook it up by givin him another, and so on, pervided lie wuzI villin and led faith enuff to pay for .the stamps. It Ivuz an    J asy and simple method uv gittin on in the world without ,npleasantnis. Captain McPelter, late uv the Confedrit army, wantid to Know cf the greenbackl wuz good enuff for the soljer, ef it vuzn't good enuff for the bondholder!? Bascomn endorsed all that lbed bin scel, and demandid resoloo- bhens, moovin ones, wich he presentid, and they wuz passed. At this pint occurred suthin wich wuzen't downsin the [)ill. Skasely hed the resolooshens passed, when Joe Bigler steepped forward and remarkt that he hed votid for them resolooshensl becoz he beleeved i emll. But lie wantil the ijee carried threrd to its logical conclooshen. He owed Bcascom eighty odd dollars, wich wuz bel{rin interest, and hed bin ibr some time, and wood, probably, for some time to come. Now, what is justis in governmental matters, is ekally so in privit lifeb. ITo demandedl uv Bascom that note, and thllat e accept in its stead one wich bore no interest. He lhed borne this burden too long, and it wuz high time that lie bo rlleeved. Deekin Pogram felt that lie lmust agree with Mr. Bigler. Bascomn leld his note for $190, wricl lehcd bin runnin on intrest for a long time, and lie felt that lie cooden't stand it o - "Why, blarst yer eyes," sez Bascom, "I lent yoo that money to save yer farm from bein sold out from under yer fet!" 1' Troo, but there's a princiDle in it. I can't toil to pay interest to yoo no more tlan I kin to the Government. Let us be consistent, G. W., watever we are." At this juncter every man in the buildin rose to his feet very excitedly, all uv ein in korious comnienst. "Bascom  holds a note uv mine, wich bears interest, and H" And Bascom, badgered ez he was, flung hmself out uv tlhe church in disgust.

They follered him with- out eny forinal adjournment to his grosery, but he hed antici- : pated that, and hed locked it. But all nite they hung around  4 tle place, yellin, "Give me my note! Give me my note!" and they hed faith that they finally wood bring him to terms.   : But along about seven o'clock the' people began to change tlheir toon. It wuz time for their mornin bitters, and they ex- claimed ez one man,  Bascom! why don't yoo open out?     i Let us in!"                          : i All uv a sudden the door wuz flung open, and there wuz re- veeled to the gaze uv the Corners the most impressive tabloo  ever witnest. In the centre uv the room stood Bascom, with a  := burnia pine knot in his hIand, wildly wavin it over his head; athfre him stood a barl uv whislky, on end, with the head out. ? We growd pale.                       -   . "I 11! ha!" laft he, with the most malignant and feendish   : expression upon his countenance, "it wuz yoor turn last nite;  i this mornin its mine.

Under the old patriarkle system, it wuz the custom uv the niggers to go by the name uv their trooly patriarkle masters, s wich wuz nessary, and not only nessary, but proper. Onto    - every plantashen tlher wood be Ceesers, Hannibals, and Pom- peys, and the only way to distinguish em wuz to call eln Cee- ser Pogram, Hannibal Gavitt, et settry. This ansered( very   : well ez long ez they wuz in a state uv skriptooral servitood; indeed, the proud Caucashen masters rather liked it, ez the frelkency with wich their names wuz called indilated the extent uv their possessions. But sence these cusses hev sot up for themaselves, it ain't so pleasant. Now that they kin own prop- erty and perform all the functions uv men, the same ez eny oneo else, it lbez become distasteful to the Corners. It is a singular fact that the Corners hez diskivered, since the niggers wuz sett free, sutlhin they never knowd afore, to-wit: The niggers hez  an odor unlilke thl whte.

Wat transpired thrilled me; in fact I never felt sich a thrill uv joy in my life ez I did when I saw this battle- scared veteran heave in sight.  He came, proudly bearin aloft    ; the Flag, wich, when the South hed her rites, and owned the     c niggers body and soul, in tee simple, wuz reely and troolv the Flag uv the Free, but wich now that, alars! there ain't a slave under its shadder, and all are permitted to do ez they please, is  I the symbol uv the most oppressive and  grindin tyranny -wich the world ever witnist.                       ; But, nevertheless, the devoshun  to the old flag, wich a site uv it stirred up in the breasts uv the people, uv Pettusville,   [: reely surprised me.

SIR : Understandin, ez we do, that yoo chivalrously made a wager (wich is a bet) with a Wisconsin Ablislinist, that yoo cood walk friom Vixburg to Waslinton carryin the Amerikin flag unilfurled without being insulted nor nothin, and hevin receeved testimony from Icadin Democrats uv Wisconsin, wich is entirely satisfactory to us, that yoo are not in no sense, nor never wuz at any time, in sympathly witlh the Ablishen, or ez they falsely style theirsclves, the Rcpubli- kin party, we extend too yoo the lhospitallities uv lettusville.

Under the shadow uv that blessid flag we sold niggers at auction in Washinton, and that  flag, that symbol of Freedom, wood hev floated over the deck uv every slave ship wich sailed from Africa, but for the unjust and sooisidle laws wicllh forced the philanthropists in the binIlis to sale under other penants4 In yoor hands, and the hands uv  sich ez you, the flag is to us the old flag it wuz then, and it's sacred to us, becoz under it we cood do all these things.  That's why we love it, and that's why we tolerate it. Hed it i remained sich we never wood hev raised our hands agin it. When sich ez Polk and Bookanon bed the control uv it we wuz !: satisfied with it, and reverenced every stripe and every star - for to us that flag meant suthin. It meant freedom for us- - free trade in niggers - it meant Suthern soopremacy - it   i.. meant the rite to buy niggers - sell niggers, import niggers - export niggers - flog niggers- lllut liggers. So long cz the flag vuz sich we loved it. But whllen the North dispooted i!: our control uv it, and put it in the hands uv A. Linkin, an Ablishnist, it wuz our flag no more. Then we felt it must come down - that its mission wuz ended, and that to us it   $ ,wuz nothin. I fired onto that flag. I raised my hand agin it, : and proud I am.

Jn the rooral deestriks, once or twice, where the people, in their dolitefitl unsofistication, don't read noosepapers, and consckently didn't jist know tile object uv his carryin the flag, lie wuz went for rather ruff; but a few words convinst em that lie wuz sound, and it didn't iin- commode him,.

In the olden time, afore the inog- !- gerashen uv the Ablisheners, we hed a-short way uv disposin  I, uv sich. It wuz a maxim in the South tlat ther cood be peece only wher ther wuz a perfeck yoonanimity uv sentiment, and to  bring about that onenis uv idees - that deliteful concord wich ! wuz so desirable- we were in the habit uv shootin or hangin . the most stubborn uv those wicll didn't agree with the majority,'  and tarrin and featherin those who were yet accessible to   ? Kentucky reasoll. By viggerusly persooin this course the  :  - minorities in this vicinity wuz kept tollably small and con- trollable. Why these cusses lhevent bin so treated passes my  I comprelhenshen.  Our convenshun to nominate candidates for county offices wuz lheld yesterday.  I wuz clhcerman uv course, for I now  okkupy that posishen (since it twuz discovered that Captain McPelter kin write he hez bin Sekretary), and I felt a sinkin ?j: sensashen when I saw that cuss, Bigler, and that other cuss, Pollock, enter the door.  Deekin Pogram, ez he saw em, biled over. Risin to hs feet, the venerable old patriark inquired, in a voice tremulous with emosliun, wat in thunder he wuz there for.           :i: "Josef, hev yoo a rite to set in a Democratic convenshun, holdin, ez yoo (o, opinyunsthe reverse uv Dimocratic?

We resolved we lied the utmost confidence in Androo Johnson, President uv the Yoonited States, pervided I e wuzi't impeeclhed; ef he rwuz, then we sliood lcv thoe privilee uv considerin him worthy uv confidence or not, cz the circumstan- ces uv the case shood warrant. 2.

That the thanks uv the Delnmocracy is due the people uv the Sout,h for tlheir iYorbetrnce in not yisiix to ^veep- t1le Ylvdic\,l faction from the face uv the earth. At this pint Bigler arose.

"I demand, ez a wlito man," sed this Bigler, "l that t'is resolooshun be added. Let every white man, every proud Caucashen, who believes in race, say 'Aye,' and with em- phasis."

WASHNGTON, May 2, 1868. THE President is uv the opinion that lie will be impeeclhed, wich opinion is shared by his confidenslel fiicnds. Indeed, Randall fell onto his neck when lie told him that lie hed come to that conclooshun, and remarkt that tlat wuz the first correct conclooshun  he hed come to senc he hed bin Presi- dent. Ef anything will stop it, it will )be the speeches wich are delivered for the prosecooshun. He hez some liope tlhat the people, when they see the avalanche uv words that lcz bini piled onto him, will hey their hatredl tiurnetl  into pity, atd tlhat pity will in this, ez in other matters, melt into love. But that's a thin reliance, an d he knows it, and is, tlerefore, preparin to leave Washinton.  He hez alreddy bid adoo to Mrs. Cobb. They met for the last time this mornin.  She wood hev  ac. companied him to Greenville; but he sed, "Nay. To yooso the words uv another- 'My fate it is too cold for thee, Mrs. Cobb; 'Twould chill thy deerest joy; I'd rather weep to see thee free, Mrs. Cobb, Than keep thee to destroy.'  &#xD;<pb n="526-527" xml:id="VAC7107-00000285"/> 526      THE PRESIDENT'S SIMPLE WANTS. "Here we part. I hev no longer the pardnin power, or dis- posal uv offices. Ef I shood git to be Mayor uv Greenville, which is in State uv Tennessee, I mite, perchance, give yoo tlme disposal of the one polece uv that anteek town; but, alars! he cood not afford to pay yoo enuff to keep yoo in garters. No! no! Farewell I'm scooped. A. Johnson's okkepashun's gone." Mrs. Cobb wuz led out, bathed in teers. I am informed, however, that she is in comfortable circumstances, havin bin ruther savin doorin that halcyon period uv pardnin rebels. She bled em handsome, and put suthin by for a rainy day. I told the President this, and he wuz visibly releeved. It wuz sejested by a council uv his friends, that lhe shood return qui- etly and by the neerest route, to wich he assented. HTe wood go, he sed, unostentashusly and without display to Greenville, by way uv Baltimore, Philadelphia, Noo York, Noo tHaven, (Conn.), Savannah, Mobeel, Noo Orleens, Looisville, and Diu- buke, Iowa. '"Write to all my friends," sed he, " and beg uv em not to offer me any ovashens, or anytliin uv the sort. I desire to glide into history ez a martyr (with a halo round my head), wich bowed meekly and uncomplaininly to the behests uv the d-dest tyranny on the globe. Tell em that the most I desire in the larger cities is processions, with appropriate moosic, banners, and sich, to receeve me at the cars rand to escort me to my hotel, and a simple balcony from wich to address my fellowr-citizens, that I may set their hearts at rest by asshoorin uv them that I am cz devoted to the constitoo- shen now ez ever, and to tell em how much I hev suffered in their behalf. I want no wreath, no gaudy chaplets wove for me; no illuminashens, no nothin. I wood merely sejest that at each place the percession be headed by a tomb - a mausoleum -on wheels, drawed by ten black horses, all clothed in mourn- in, the tomb to bear the inscription, "Impeachment: In tiis is buried Androo Johnson, and with him the constitooshen, the flag, and the liberties uv his country, wich he wood hev saved." It mito be well to hev anotiler follerin behind it with a wax figger uv Columby bustin the mausoleum, and histin a wax figger uv me out uv it, chuckin the constitooshen at me ez she does it, exclaimin the while, "Rise, second Washington - rise, step-father uv yer country." These little allegories wood in-           HS DETERMNATION. .       527 culcate a great moral lesson, and wood inspire the people with awe." Randall oljected. "Wat's the yoose?" lie sed. "Ef I am in the car with yoo, - and I spose I shel hev to see this thing out, - the Ablishnists will jeer and flout me, and say, Go up, bald head!' The inscripShens they will laff at, and they Won't do our people eny good, for not one in ten kin read enl."' Welles wuz in favor uv the mausoleum, only lie wood lhev a slite change. He wood hev Columbia supported by him, ez Neptoon, the God uv the briny deep, puttin a wax sceptre, labelled "Veto," in the hands uv the wax President, with tho inscripshen, "With tlis lie wood heov saved the Constitooshll." Randall wuz overpowered, but he did not give up hi s pint. "I lhev decided on this," sed the President. "I shel not pervent the people from testify]in tleir devoshen to llme, anid bearin witness to my many virchoos. I hov already received tenders of percessions ez terrible ez armiess witl blanners. The Blood Tubs uv Baltimore, the K illers uv Philadcllfy, and the Ded Rabbits uv Noo York, hev all expressed a desire to do me this honor. In Noo Haven, the Noo Yorkers kin go tlher to make the percession, jist ez easy ez they went up ther to vote our ticket in the spring, cz I slid not be in two places tlhe same day. In the Soutli, of the Confledrits I hcv pardoned will all turn out, the wprcessions will boe miles inl length, and ef they do not, the Ku Klux will be on hand." Randall cautioned himn not to count double. ' Yoo are probably aware," sed lie, " that the Ku Klux is made up almost entirely uv the patriots yoo pardoned. But that don't matter; yoo will still be ovatid to yoor heart's desire. 1 hev corre- spondence. Here is a letter from a prominent Noo York Dim- ocrat: ' ev him come this way.

His comin wood stir up our voters to some extent, and help to swell the majority for Seymour.' "Another one says,-- 4"I hev no objeckshun to yoor funeral percession passin tliro Noo Haven.

"' I He bed better come to Richmond, I think. We cood git up a percession wich wood terrify the niggers and white loyal- ists, and possibly keep em from ratifyin the Constitooshun. I will make the speech, and will say any good things uv Johnson yoo may sejest, for I am an old man 'nd hev no further hopes for myself, and am consekently reckliss.' "I hev," said Randall, "others uv similar import from Noo Orleens, Mobeel, Vixburg, and Memphis. The writers all mani- fest the most ardent devoshen to -  "I knowd they wood," exclaimed the President. ' I yit hev friends." "- To the candidate uv the Noo York Convenshun, and ez they all appear to think that this percession thro the country wood help em, I am willin. I can stand it.

When the coat wuz talen off he wuzn't so broad and massive; whlen the vest wuz gone lie wuz positively flat- chested; when the shoulder-braces wtuz removed he became hump-backed; and when the pants wuz snaked off lie stood afore us the merest skeleton I ever beheld - a weak, shaky, wheezin skeleton. Our folks looked disappointed, but it wuz too late to change. A loose two-sided wrapper wuz thrown over him, Gov. English elimbed onto his shoulders, Vallan- dygum jumped into one pocket and Pernandy Wood into the other, the brass band tooted, the crowd yelled, he made one convulsiv start, but in vain.

Wine! to feed sichl a nose ez I carry about. Wine to satisfy tlhe cravins uv sich a stumick ez milne! Faugh Disgusted at the tlhinness uv the beverages, I retired into a friendly hos- telry kept by Dennis O'Shaughnessey, and at his hospitable bar, solaced myself with three fingers uv KIentucky sus- tenance. There wuz no enthoosiasm among the citizens uv Chicago wich I naterally fell among. T'le s'loon keepers, wiclh in re- menmbrance uv the Demoklratic Convenshun uv 1864 lhad made extra preparashuns, \uz gloomy, sad, and disappointed. These places, garnisht for the occasion, wuz sad and lonely. There wuz an entire absence uv that gentle gurgle wich to me is so pleasin; there1 wuz none uv the generous noses and faces lighted up withl the radiance born uv the barl, wich I am so accustomed to. It's the last Republican convenshen I sliel ever attend. The idea uv a confrence sittin in the samine city with a convenslien! The idea uv minglin politics with religion! Will there be confriences in Neoo York in Jooly? On my return, we wuz a settin in Bascom's a discussin the nominashens. Deekin Pogram wuz indignant. "Good Heavens!" said lie, with lorror in his sainted fhce, (" kin it be that men perfessi. nashnel views wood offer sich a insult to Kentucky ez to nominate sich a man ez Grant, who, sword in hand, devastated her fbeltile fields, and piled the bodies of' her nootral sons who resisted his advance mountains high?

Say lothin, Deckin, that yoo'l hev to take back." Feelin that rite here wuz a splendid I chancel e f1o an ilnlrovin discourse on the nacher, objicks, and atims uv Democracy, 1 opened out onto ean. '"DimocrisY," 1 remarkt, "is distinguished chleefly for its elasticity in adaptin mneans to ends. One wood .suppose' thlatl Postoffis is its cheef end. In one sense it is.

But, my bretlbring. lot it be remembered that success is tlhe main objick. Success is wat Bascom wants, that 1, bcin continyood in offis, may hev the means to pay for the likker I consooen, and to avoid the necessity uv bein continyoo-ally rekested to chalk it down, whch practis ho esteems disgustin, and one wich greatly increases his labors.

Success is the main pint, and ef Hancock is  the way, walk ye in it; ef Chase or Seymour is the way, walk ye ditto, for with either uv these men all these things we'll hev. When they come to us they leeve ther former selves behind. But mathnks I hear one say, Hancock is a soljer, Seymour a anti-repudiator, and Chase a Ablislnist! Wat uv that? They may be wat they like when they go into offis, - assosi- ashen with us fetches em sooner or later. Tlhe road down is a easy one to travel. It's easier to slide than to climb, wich is the reason why so many more are damned than saved. De- mocracy, like Bascom's new likker, holds a man when it gits him. Johnson wuz a good enuff Ablishnist till he called onto us for help, and then he wuz lost. Let Chase stay with us a week and he'd forgit all his old ideas, yoo bet. Shood yoo poke that silver pitcher at him the niggers give him at Cincin- nati, for defendin a fugitive, and he'd swear like Peter he never saw it - only differin from Peter in that he'd stick to it. And there is no goin back, for the principal ones. Ther remorse kind o' drives em deeper and deeper, till they finally are worse than ez tho they originally wuz uv u,; Let us, my brethren, never reject any help wie kin git. Let it come in any shape and from any source, it'll finally assimilate to us and be ulv us. Ez I conclooded my remarks, my circle all agreed that it wuz safe to take whatever we cood git from the enemy, and we retired, I feclin that whatever other localities mite do, the Corners wuz safe. Wat an outrage it is, tliougl, that the Ab- lishnists nominated sich a man for Vice-President ez to make Grant perfectly safe from bein removed ez Linkin wuz. Ef he's elected he'll serve out his time sure. PETROLEUM V. NASBY, P. M. (wich is Postmaster).   A PROPER NOMNEE.  .      537  CLXVI. THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY. POST OFFIS, CONrEDRIT X ROADS ) (wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky), June 1, 18(8. ) THE matter uv a Presidensh candidate hez opprest me, and hez also exercised the gigantic intellex who congregate at the Corners. We hev desided tlat Checf Justis Chase won't do. We kin support him cheerfully, for his method uv conduktin the impeachment trial hez satisfied us uv his hankerin for a staudin in our party. Besides tlis, havtin made a start, we con- sider him safe anyhow. The man wich kin take a nominashen at our hands, or identify hisself with us, may alluz be countid onto. The Ablishnists never forgive sich, and thor ain't no other place to go. When Johnson and Doolittle and tlat crowd left the Ablishnists, I knew Vwlero they would land better than they did. Facilis (descensus averni, wich beil translated into the vulgar tongue, means, the road to wich is macadamized. Hancock won't do, becoz our Southern breth- ren llev a prejoodis agin the flag he drawed his sword under. Pendleton wood anser the West, but tlh East is opposed to him. I therefore, after givin the matter matoor considerashcn, hev desided to propose for the posishcn the name uv Jethro L. Kippins, uv Alexander coulty, Illinoy. I hev the follerin reasons fob insistin on his nominashen - 1. He's geographically level. By lookin on the map, it will be seen that that county in Illinoy is the extreme south-west- erly part uv the State. It is a Northern county with South- ern ideas. Across the river is Kentucky, west is sdutl-east- ern Missoury, and east is lower Ijcany. Tlhey grow tobacco there, and yearn after slave labor ez intensly cz we do across the river. 2.,Nobody knows him. The name uv Jethro L. Kippins, hez never filled the soundin trump uv fame. With him on our tikkit several pints wood be gained. On all the questions on  &#xD;<pb n="538-539" xml:id="VAC7107-00000291"/> 538        JETHRO L. KIPPENS.              I wich there is a doubt in the minds uv the Democracy, Jethro L. Kippens is uncommitted. He is unembarrassed with views, and on troublesome questions hez nary an opinyun. The trouble Pendleton hez with the greenbax wood not affect him, neither wood any uv them other questions wichl are ruther embarrassin than otherwise. Hfe lez but one political princi- ple, wich he holds is enuff for any one man, and that is Democ- racy, ez it hez bin, ez it is, and ez it may be. He beleeves firmly in the cuss uv Canaan, he holds close to Oncsimus and Hagar, and lez sw\orn a solemn oatlh that no nigger shel ever marry a daughter uv hizzen. This noble sentiment, wich alluz strikes a responsive cord in every buzzum, wood be emblazoned on the Kippins banner. 3. Jethro L. Kippinses posishen on the war question is happy., He opposed all the steps wikh led to it, and when it finally broke out, lie proposed the only troo Demokratic way uv stoppin it. It wuz his opinyun that we hecd ing rite to coerce the South -that thlero wuz no warrant in the Constitooshen for any sich perceedin. "'Ef Boregard fires onto Major Anderson," sed lie, "It lIMajor Anderson go afore the nearest Justice uv the Peece and lhev hhimn bound over to keep the peece, and ef the Justis can't enforce his warrant, why that ends it. We can't go beyond the Constitoosln." After hostilities actooally begun, his posishen wuz eminently satisfactory to both sides. He wuz in favor uv the war, but opposed to its prosecooslien. He re- markt that the South lied committed a indiscreshen, but were lie in Congris lhe shoodn't vote for nary man nor dollar for carryin on a war agin cm. His two sons served in the war, one in the Confedrit servis atnd one in the Fedral - both ez sutlers. The war bore heavy on him -he made great sacri- fices. Tllhree other sons lie supported in Canada doorin the continyobance uv the unnaclrel strife. 4. Jethro L. Klippins hez all the elements uv popularity. He wuz born in a log cabin; he studied Daboll's Arithmetic by the lite uv a pine knot, held for the purpose by his mother; he drove hoss on the canal, wuz a salt boiler in Southern Oho, a wagon boy on the Nashnel Rotad, wuz left an orphan when six weeks old, swept a store in his early yooth, went down the   HS QUALIFICATION.        539 Mississippi on a flat boat, wuz in the Mexikin war, and lhez a consoomin pashen for horses. He hez, in this, the advantage of Grant, ez his pashen wuz so consoomin that-it got him into a temporary difficulty, wich required 12 men, a Judge, and two lawyers to settle, one uv'tlhe lawyers bein the State's Attorney uv the county. These facts in his biography I got fron his own lips. Ef there's anly discrepancies, uv course the committee on biograplly will reconcile ern. It may be tleat lie may hev done too much - wich is to say, ef all he sez is troo, lhe wood be two or three hundred yeatrs old. Ef so, it will hev to be pared down. He hez bin justis uv the pecco ten years in his native tojwnship, wich gives him a splenddid knowledge uv constooshnel law. 5. He's trooly naslinel in his views. He knows no North, no South, no East, no West, tlo notlin. That last qualiticashen mite prejudis some agin hn, but to me its lis chieof lolt. For with sich a man in the Presidelslel chair I wood be safe. We hev an abundance uv sich men ez Wood. Seymour, Vallaln- dygum, et sottry, who kin manage a President, but whlo are too odorous to be electid very nucll to that posishen them- selves. Therefore, it's necessary that precisely sicll a man ez I hev described be electid; and the fact that Cliase knows too much, is the objection I hev to hm. Polk wuz malwn^eacl,uz Pierce eminently so, and poor old Bookannon was wonderfully pliable. Sich is t4he candidate wich I present. There are many pints in lsig favor. Our people wood to-wunst exclaimr" Who'n thunder is Kippins?" and before they cood find out, tleo day uv election wood be on cm, and thley'd vote him. His licvin no record is also in his fvor. Wat wood Pendleton, Vallan- dygnm, Seymour, and WTood give ef they hed no record'? A record is like a tin kittle to a dog's tale - it's a noisy appen- dage, wich makes the dog conspicuous, and invites everybody to shy a brick at him. I hevent menshund in this, nor shel 1, who would be a proper man for the seckund place on the ticket. I hev my opinion. Kentucky is deservin uv recognishun-- that's all I lhel say.

NASBY   A DELEGATE  TO NEW  YORK. NEW YORK (at a cheep boardin 1 house), July the 4, 1808. EF I  hed knowd just wat I lied to go thro with, I never wood figgered for the posishen I now okkepy., Hed I knowd tlhe troubles wich was to beset me, the Corners mite hev gone onreprcsented, and the Democrisy mite hev nominatid a candi- Ikate without my help. I am at a cheep boardin house, wich is salubrusly sitooated on an alley, the landlady bein one uv the anshent IKings uv Ireland, wich her name is O'Shaughnessy. I  coodent get rooms at the Aster, nor the St. Nicholas, ez I coodent git a  clerk to look at me. And that insult mite be added to injoory, the unfeelin woman who presides over the manshen I  inhabit, peremptorily refoozed to reseeve me ontil I paid in advance. I  tried sevral places, but ez I hedn't no baggage, the pervailin opinyun seemed to be that advance payment wood be better, and I  wuz forst to return to her. tMy advenchers on the route were noomerous, if not pleasant. At some pint in Ingiany, wher we changed cars, I found the trane we hed to take full uv delegates. In lookin around fobr a seet, I  dlilskivered but one that hadn't two in it, and that one bed in it a  disgustin nigger, who bed the impoodence to be   ASSAULTS A NIGGER.        541 well drest, and hed a carpet sack beside him. My )cmokratic blood riz to-wunst. Feelin that in a car filled with Demokratic delegates, anything I shood do to a nigger wood be safe, I stawkt proudly up to him, holdin my nose. "Good Lord!" sed I, " wat a smell." 1' Good Lord!" ekoed the delegates wich got on at that stashen, " wat a terrible smell." "Iy gentle Afrikin frend," sed I, seezin him by the collar, 'I I regret the necessity uv sayin disagreeable things, but yoor impudence in gittin into a car uv white gentlemen, with the disgustin odor inseparable from the Afiikin race, is too much. And more especially do I wonder at, yoor keepin yoor sect, while I and other white gentlemen are standin." "Out with the nigger!" yelled the lately arrived delegates; "hustle thhestilllnkin cuss." "Merciful H-Ievens, wat a smell " sung out others uv cm. "Hist him!" "Hist him!" Seein myself thus backed, and feelin tlhat a little zeal wood be safe, ez niggers can't vote, I knockt llis hat out uv theo winder, and follered up that demonstrashen with h serious attempt at liftin him out uv the seat. I wood hev succeeded, but the nigger resisted vigorously, to-wit: lie knockt three uv my front teetli down my throte, pulled out wat little there wuz left uv the hare that hangs in scanty festoons about my venrablo temples, and blackt both my eyes. I wuz lyin on my back in the passage, somenwat astonished, the nigger a standin over me, with his boot heel over my face, when some gentlemen calne in from another car and restrained him. "Mr. Williams," sed they, " let him up. He's poor whte trash, and not worth wastin yoor indignashen onto. Let him up, Mr. Wiliiams, let him up." "Sirs," sed I, risin to my feet, tremulous with rage, " is this the treatment I am to expect all the way to Noo York? Am I to be pounded to jelly by5 a nigger,-- a stinkin nigger, sirs, whose odor even now makes the car ontenable to gentlemen uv refined sensibilities,--a d to heer the nigger addresst ez "Mister" after that, instido uv bein tored to pieces by the infiuriated spectators! O shame, where is thy blush?"

Apologize, sir, to Mr. Josef' Williams, Delegate at Largefor the State uv Tennessee!"  I almost fainted. This nigger, then, wuz a delegate! Heo wuz a regler delegate, armed and equipped with regler cre- denshels to a Demokratic Convenshen, arnd I lied been guilty, in my zeel, uv. assaultin uv him! Gladly I apologyzed, and ftrther, I humbly begged permission to sit beside him; wich he accordid with a graciousnis I never saw ekalled. It wuz astonishin the change that crept over the Injeany delegates. They crowded around us, and shook him by the hand; they didn't smell any odor at all any more; on the contrary, they seemed to like him. They addrest him' ez  "' Mister," and sevral uv em, introdoocin him to ther friends who got on at various stashens, yooscd the prefix "' Honorable." It's wonderful wat a difference it makes with a nigger to have a vote, and also how lie votes! Hed that Williams bin infected with Ablishinnlsm, I make no donbt that the stenchl wich I reely fancied I smelt when I fust undertook to subjoogate him, wood hev continyood to the end uv the trip. In olden times it -wuz observed that slave niggers didn't smell-- it wuz only the free ones. It is a settled fact now that Demokratic niggcrs are inodorous! I mite hev known, however, that the nigger wuz a free nigger, by the way he pitched into me. No nigger in a state uv servitood wood ever hev did sich a thing. That much they owe to the war, anyhow.  My principal object in goin to Noo York wuz to do wat I cood toward secoorin the nominashen of Jethro L. Kippins. I found the delegates badly tore up. The offers made for votes wuz so rediculously low that there wuz much disgust man- ifested. The trouble wuz, that the markit wuz over-stockt. Ied the Convenshen bin pretty elally divided, and the balance uv power held by a few clost mouthed souls, they cood hev made a good thing of it. But where a whole Convenshen is in the markit, and all ther inflooenshel friends, no candidate can afford to buy. I withdrew TMr. Kippens to-wunst, for he hez but a small farm, and that mortgaged to a grocery keeper.

A FUTILE ATTEMPT TO RATIFY THE NOMNA- TIONS AT THE CORNERS. POST OFFIS, CONFEDRIT X ROADS ) (wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky), July 31, 1868. ) WE hed last nite a ratification meeting at the Corners, wich started out gloriously, but didn't end so happily ez it mite. I Probably there never was a more unsatisfactory ticket, or a more contradic- tory one, than that nominated by the Demnocracy in 1868, and the platform was quite as absurd and contradictory as the ticket.   SEYMOUR AND BLAIR.        545 bed gone to a good deal uv trouble about it, and led made all arrangement for a feast uv reason and flow uv sole, elalled by few ratifications and surpassed by none. The blessed Deacon, McPelter, and Issaker Gavitt, who ex- pect respectively to hold the posishens uv Assessor, Collector, and Whiskey Inspector for this district, come down handsomely with the funds, enuff to enable me to dekorate the post offis with flags and transparencies, and myself with a pare uv ready made pants, wich I muddied considerable to make em look old, so that they shood not suspect ther funds lied bin applied in that way. Human nacher is a inscrutable mystery. They wood objeck did they know I bed clotled myself with tlher money instead uv wastin it on taller candles and sich, wich burn out and leave nothn behind. I wuz econornikle in my expenditoors, or rather little expense was nessary. Desirin to wake the enthoosiasm uv the Democ- risy, I procoored a parsel uv Confedrit battle flags, wicll the returned heroes hed brot home with em. and lied the talismanic words, Seymour and Blare," painted across em. The effeck wuz gorgus! Ez nite approacht I lied tie transpaCrencies, saved over from a celebrashen wich lied bin leld after Chicka- mauga, lighted up. The enthoosiasm, ez the populace saw these, and listened to Captin MePelter, ez lie red em to em, wuz overpowerin. How they cheered ez the words flaslt out into the nite, "Southern Rites, Southern Men, and a Southern Government I " Death to Northern Hirelins!"  Dowxn with the gorilla Linkin!" "Jeff Davis and the Confedracy for- ever!" "No quarter to Fedral invaders!" And when Bore- gard's black flag, onto wich "Seymour and Blair" wuz painted in red letters, wuz unfurled, tler arose sich cheers for the nominees uv the Noo York Convenshun ez I led never lieerd before, nor expect to again. At this time, jist ez everythin wuz a gitin red hot, the trouble commenced. Pennibacker, wich runs our biggest and best distillery, jumped onto the platform, at my suggestion, and pro- posed three cheers for Seymour and Greenbacks, and thrbo groans for the bloated bondholders. Tle crowd, with troo Dimokratic docility, wuz agoin to cleer, when Bascorm, who hez some 5.20's, riz, and swore that he'd be d-d cf that shoed 35  &#xD;<pb n="546-547" xml:id="VAC7107-00000295"/> 546           TROUBLE.                 be.

"Don't Vallandygum, Pendleton, and dirty shirt Dean sup- port him?" yelled Pennibacker.                 : "Yoor doctrin," sed Bascom, excitedly, " is a d--d swindle -a peace uv theevin, wich a Arab wood be ashamed uv, and Seymour sed so." "Yoor proposishen is a outrage onto opprest people, a grindin uv em into the earth under the heels uv bloated aristo- crats and pampered sons uv luxury, and the platform Seymour stands onto says so," shouted Pennibacker. "Yoor a swindler " excitedly yelled Basoom; whereupon they clinched and rolled orf the platfbrm titely huggin, and making extraordinary physilde efforts at injoorin each other. To direct the attenshun uv the populis from this untoward5 circumstance, I rekested Issaker to sing out three cheers for Blare! "Three cheers fobr Blare I " sung out Issaker, " the Missouri statesman, who will rid us uv Freedman's Burows and military rool."

I swore four year ago to lick any man who hurrahed for any member uv the Blare family." And this infooriated wretch pounced onto Issaker, and they rolled off the stand to join Bascom and Pennibacker, who hadn't settled their onpleasantnis yet.

I sprang down to separate em, wlien McPelter turned upon me, and wood hev sacrificed me on the spot, but the Corners rusht, ez a man, to save me. Ez I owe the most uv em, I am entirely safe here, and ez I shel be ontil I pay my debts, I shel never die uv violence. At this pint the fite became general. Some uv the people sided with Bascom, some uv eim with Penlnibacker (akkordin ez they bought whisky by the bard or by the drink), and tle balance uv elmi assisted Bigler and Issaker Gavitt, ez thler incli- nashun promptid em.

POST OFFIS, CONFEDRIT X ROADS  (wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky),  November 5, 1868. ); BAD news travels fast. We hev heerd from enuff uv the States to know that the butcher Grant - he wich wunst afore stood in the way uv the Confedracy -hez been elected Presi-   : dent, and that Seymore and Blare, our gellorious standard- bearers, hev bin defeeted ignominously. This ends it! This finishes it! There iz no longer hope for Democrisy. Our star is ot in gloom. Never Ahel I forgit the gastly appearance uv Deekin Pogram's face ez the fttal nooze wuz told him. A single tear rolled from his left eye, down his furrowed chllek; it glittered fobr a brief moment on the tip uv his brillyent nose, and plunged off into space! How like our hopes! Never a word sed ihe, but sadly beckoned me to foiller. Sadly he walked to the square, mournfully he pulled down the Confedrit flag which hez waved from the pole in front of Bascom's, tenderly he foldced it, and placed it under the barl uv whisky in the bar. "Thar let it rest," gasped he in a husky tone; "it will never kiss the breezes no more*" And overcome with emoshun, the good old man bisted in a flood uv tears, wich saved his life. The drain uv moisture from his system made it necessary for him to tale suthin to fill its plase, and that suthin wuz strengthnin. To save him I took suthin strengthnin too. I won't say a word ez to the causes uv this most terrible defeat. Seymore wood make speeches, wich hez alluz bin fatle to Presidenshul aspirants, and Blare wood rite terrible letters, wich is just ez bad. Besides, Blare fairly represents us, wich druv off all the decent people, and Seymore rutfher prides his- self on bein a gentleman, wich chilled the ardor of our party. The nominashuns were unforchnit, but I don't reproach em. It's fate. I hev reason to sigh. For Pollock will git the Post Offis after all. The hiz hands are contaminated by bein taken into   THE DARK FUTURE.        549 the hands uv niggers, - his hiands wich handles kaliker and draws molasses, and iz consekently degraded by earnin his own livin, - his hands will pass out to Deekin Pogram the paper wich the Corners takes! The Deekin, ez he thot uv tlfis, bust into teers agin. "I shel stop that paper," sez he, "and the Corners shel go back into the darkness uv ignerance. I shell never go agin for a letter, nor will 1 hIev one written for me to any body. When a Ablishn fafce is at the general delivery I shel stop paternizen the Post Offis!  Will the new Administrashun deprive a whole community uv a paper merely to give one uv its supporters a posishun? We shel see. But I cood endoor the loss uv my posishen; for principle I kin look marterdom squarely int the face; but I ,se othor and more terrible results followin this catastrophe. Wat uv the niggers'? Wat uv us. We sliel hev niggers votin at the Corners! We shel liev, at our poles, all uv thle black cusses wlho live between here and Garretstown, a votin ez regler cz though they wuz white men. We shcl hev cm defilin the sakred ballot-box ez tho they wuz not uv a cussid race. I see darkl lines afore our poor State. They will here- after hold the land wich they hev bought, and wich they live on, by a sure tenure, and they will increase and multiply. Pollock will buy ther proldoos, and they will work and git money. This money they will lend to us, - for we must lhev it to sustain lifb,- and they will take mortgages onto our land. (When I say osur, I mean Deekin Pogram and sich.) Ez we never work ourselves, and will not hev, under the present arrangement, the mneans of compellin the labor necessary to our support, we kin Ilever pay; and the result will bo, this beautiful land uv ourn wich we so deeply love, will pass out uv the hands uv the stronger and better race into the control uv a weaker and less powerfil people. The Deelkin was re- markin sutlin to this effect, when Joe Bigler remarkt in reply, that the Deekin bed better throw himself onto the sympathy uv his sons. "Why, they can't work any more than I kin," sod tho Deekin. "I don't mean yoor white sons!" sed this terrible Bigler.  &#xD;<pb n="550-551" xml:id="VAC7107-00000297"/> 550          A PROPHECY.

The people will be deprived uv their innocent amoosements. This Grant will send on armed hirelins, clothed in ojus bloo, with muskets and sich, who will prevent our shootin niggers,  and who will protect on ther farms and in ther houses the ojus . Northerners who hev settled in our midst. We shel see the glorious Southern system decline stidily and shoorly. The whipping posts will rot and the stox will decay; the yelp uv dorgs will no more be heard, and the cheerful crack uv the pistol and the shreek uv the man wat has got his gruel will no more be heerd in the land. Bascom, after he hez the few farms still unmortgaged in the visinity, will close, and go to Looisville and embark into the wholesale grosery trade and jine the church, and give librerly to Sunday skools; his grosery   i will fall into dekay, and the sine will hang by one hinge. We shell see churches and skool houses, factrys atnd villages every- where. The Pogram place uv 2,000 akers will be divided up into twenty farms, and onto them will be the bustlin Noo Yorker, the cool, calculating Yankee, the stiddy, hard-workin German, who will display his grovelin nacher by working himself instid uv forcin niggers to do it for him. We shel be run over with skool-marms, deluged with acadamies, plastered over with noosepapers, stunned with machinery, drove crazy by the whirr, crash, and clash of mowin machines and reapers. And there will be cheese made at the Corners. Pennibacker's distillery will be turned into a cheese factry, and weak whey will run wher now the generous high wines flash along the troughs. Ther will be no rectifyin at the Corners; the hog pens will be abolished, and in ther sted will be skool houses. And methinks I see in my mind's eye, Horasho, the speerit, the ghost uv the departed Pogram (for he won't survive it long), a hoverin over the scene, ez Hamlick's father did. The blessed shade will look in vain for his house - on the spot wher it stood will be an academy. He will turn to Bascom's, but ther he will find a deestrict skule. "To Pennibacker's!" he will gasp, in a speerit whisper, and   A CHANGE OF BASE.        551 with a speritooal smack uv his speritooal lips he will hover over it, but the smell uv cheese in the place uv the strengthen- in odors in wich he delites, will send a speritooal shuddyr thro him. A ghost uv a tear will run down his speritooal nose, linger for a minit at the tip, like a dew drop on the rose, and fall! Then will the dissatisfied ghost demand to be taken back to purgatory, a place less tryin to his nerves. All is up With me and us.

Johnson wuzu't nominated for the Presidency by the Dimocricy. When I statid that I desired to go to Noo York, and that all that prevented it wuz capital enuff to start a grosery, Bascom to-wunst remarkt that that shoodn't stand in the way. "I mite ez well give yoo two barrils to-wunst," sed he, "and  be done with it, ez to hev yoo prolong it, a drink at a time, for six months. Indeed it wood be more economical, ez it wood save me the labor uv drawin it. I give two barrils uv whisky to git rid uv - that is, to establish -- our friend in a new field uv labor." McPelter and Pennibacker contributid money enuff to pay the freight onto the likker, and to provide the necessary fixters for a bar, and that nite I left the Corners, hopin never to be compelled to return. But feelin the truth uv the proverb that there's many a slip betwixt the cup and lip, I didn't resine the Post Offis, but lockt it, leavin directions with the boy who carries the mail to leave Deekin Pogram's paper at his house. On my way to Noo York I indulged in the most pleasin dreams. I fancied myself behind my own bar; gittin my own likker at wholesale; uv hevin a back room into wich caucuses shood be held; hevin a suffishent run uv biznis, and the consekent control uv enuff votes to be on speakin terms with Governor Huffman and Mayor Hall; uv bein nominatid for Alderman; uv havin contrax; uv buildin a house on Fifth Avenoo, and bein a ginooine Noo York aristocrat; uv havin my carriage, with thl coat uv arms uv the Nasby family onto the panels; uv goin to Congris, in the place uv Morrisy, and so on. It wuz a lovely dream, but I wuz destined to a sad awakenin. I rentid a grosery store in a convenient corner uv 6th Ward, and put over it, in bold letters, the legend, "Michael O'Nasby," with the harp wich wunst thro Tara's halls, its sole uv moosic shed, paintid conspicyous; and bein a troo Amerikin, I hed the green flag uv ould Ireland paintid rite above the Stars and Stripes.    ji -IL-    .

I bed mly two barrils conveniently mounted; I hed thirty glasses in a pan; and a plate uv crackers back uv em, to showiv merely, ez no one yooses them in the Gtlh Ward. In the mean time I lied made many pleasant acquaintances. Two Aldermen and fobur or five gentlemen connected with the city governmtent hed lookt in, and interdoosed theirselves, and exprest theirselves pleased at my comin. Bcin a stranger hi the city, they gave some valuable advise. "rrThe first thing to do," sed one uv em, "is to malke ac- quaintances. I wood suggest that you hev a formal openin. We will, ef the idea strikes yoo, take the trouble to invite a few friends in, say to-nite, to save you the trouble, that you may establish yourself.

My return from Noo York so ignomiously, on foot, wuz a scri- ous disappointment to my friends at the Corners. They felt when I left em that they had me fixed for life, and their sorrer at my ontimely return wuz genuine. Bascom, cz soon ez he saw me enter his bar, weary and footsore, remarked, with a profane ejaculashen, that I'd be his rooin yet. I am a man uv ackshun. To-wunst I called a meetin uv my friends to consider the situashlen, and to arrange for another vencher. I remarkt to em that I had not lost faith in Noo York; that I wuz certin that thlat wuz my field.* I proposed that another outfit shood be furnished men, the same ez before, and that I shood hev one more trial. But they unanimously declined, feelin that I hedn't suffishent control uv my own appetite for a grocery keeper, and that investments in that direcshun wood be a waste uv capital which the Corners cood not afford. Various methods uv malkin a livin were sejested, but none met my approval. One wood sejest this tling in San Fran- cisco; another in Alaska; and each one wood swear thlat every one wuz the very thing. Their readiness to agree, and thle numerousnis uv the miles the places wuz away, satisfied mo that distance was the main pint with em. That misable wretch, Joe Bigler, happened in at a moment when they wuz a discussin the feasibility uv a conductership on -a street railroad in Noo Orleans,- -z the the directers uv the companies hadn't all got dissipated nephews to fill sich responsible places, - when he remarkt that the obtoosenis uv humanity wuz one uv the wonders uv the nineteenth century. "Make uv him," sed Josef, " a Dimokratic organ grinder, saw off his yite leg, dress him in bloo, git him an instrooment  &#xD;<pb n="556-557" xml:id="VAC7107-00000301"/> 556       JOE BIGLER'S SUGGESTIONS. wich will play Dixie,' the ' Bonnie Bloo Flag,' and sich toons, and plant him on the side walks uv Louisville, Noo York, or any other Dimekratic city, and his forchaon is made." "But why dress me in bloo? Why not in gray, ef I play Confedrit toons?" "Innocense! Didn't the Dimocrisy always wear bloo while they wuz whistlin Confedrit toons? Eveny in the North they don't object to a bloo coat, so that they know that there's a  Confedrit heart under it?"  "But," replied I, "I wuzn' t a soljer: wich is, only ez a draftid man, and then only for a short time." "That don't matter," remarkt Josef; 4' no more wuz the fieft uv Dimocrisy. Tile bulk uv em wich served, did so as draftid men. But that circumstance is in yoor favor. The regler organ grinders, them wich wuz volunteers, put onto a placard wich hangs onto their instrooment words to this effect:- "Elllisted July 10, 1862 - shot thro the leg at Anteetam.' "Yoo kin put onto yourn this proud inscripshen:-- "' Draftid September 6,1863 - desertid September 30,1863; lost rite leg in an encounter with Provost. Marshels, October 10, 1863.' "Sicll an inscripshen wood melt the heart uv every Dim- okratic passer-by, and they'd fill your cigar-box with coppers. Wich uv em cood resist such an appeal?- Think uv wat a harvest yoo'd reap in Louisville when Breckinridge comes home, and in Frankfort when he is inoggeratid Governor of Kentucky! 1It's the dodge for yoo, Pma'on." I thot the matter over for a minnit, and it pleased me. The life uv an organ grinder is by no means to be despised. It's a dreamy, poetical, contemplative sort uv eggistence. Ez tiler ain't no manyool labor in it beyond the mere turnin uv a crank, I am satisfied that it wood soot me. Then one sees so much uv life. Constantly before yoo is a ever changin panorama; yoo see humanity in all its phases; and when nite comes how sweet the rest, how inspirin the likker, wich yoo hev honestly earned by yoor manly exertions! ' Is it neccessary that I shel hev a leg ampitatid?" askt I. "Certainly!" replied Josef. o   AN OBSTACLE.         557' "Then I declinel " sed I. "Aside from the pain, I hev regard for them legs. They saved my life in all the skirmishes I wuz in doorin my breef term uv servis ez a drafted man in '63. I will not part with one uv em." "This is triflen with your friends, sir!" ejaculatid Bascom. '"Yoo hev the way opened for a honist livin, and yoo refoose to walk ye into it. This cannot be permitted." '"It cannot be permitted!" ekkoed McPelter, Pennibacker, and the rest uv em. "Joseph, hev yoo suffishent skill to ampetate a limb?" asIkt Bascom. 'I hev," replied Joseph, " ef yoo will furnish me a carvin knife and handsaw. I've seen it done in Confedrit hospitals. Troo, the victims didn't most alluz survive. Ef yoo do stand it, Parson, think uv the glorious life organ-grindin is; ef yoo dio under it, console yourself by thinkinl how much organ-grindin yoo've escaped! Bring the knife and saw, and somebody twist a handkercher about his log." And forthwith they ceazed me, throwd me onto the bar, and tied me there, and brot a dull knife and landsaw, and that cuss wood hev hackt into my leg bed it not bin for Deeklfi Pogram. "Joseph Bigler!" sed this more than saint, "trooly tell us the chances Uv his survivin this operashen?"

Ef he dies its gone; ef he lives he may strike suthin that'll enable him to pay it." "Slash away, Bigler!" remarkt Bascom, vishusly; " he owes me seven hundred dollars for drinks sence he's bin here, and ef lie lives he'll double it in a year."              s There wuz an animatid discussion, cz to whether he shoodl go on or stay his eager hand.

To Miss Soosan Murphy I owe my present happiness. The minnit I hotist that she hed put in a claim agin the Govern- ment for property yoosed doorin the war by Fedral soljery, I to-wunst saw where my finanshel salvashen wuz. Immejitly I histed my shingle ez a agent to prossekoot claims agin the Government for property destroyed or yoosed doorin the late onpleasantnis, by Fedral troops. That shingle hedn't bin out A Miss Susan Murphy filed a claim against the Government, in 1869, for property destroyed by the Federal armies. Had it been allowed, every rebel in the South would have followed her example promptly.   A PROSPEROUS BEGINNING.       5 659 an hour before Joe Bigler hed red it to half the citizens uv the Corners, and in two hours I lied biznis on my hands, and money in my pockets. Ez a matter uv course, I insisted upon a retainin fee uv ten dollars in each case. Issaker Gavitt and his two younger brothers wuz the first clients I bed. Their case is one uv pekoolyer hardship, and I feel ashoored tlat Congris will to.-wunst afford em the relcef they ask. The property dcstroyed wuz a barn and its contents, wichl wuz destroyed by Buel in the second yeer uv the war; that is, the contents wood hev bin destroyed only they wuzn't in the barn, ez they lied bili sold jist previously to the Con- fedracy. But ez the Eldel, peace to his ashes, took Confedrit munny for sed contents, wicll munny he, in a moment uv en- thoosiasm, invested in Confedrit bonds, wich finally got to be worth nothin, we put in a claim for the valyoo uv the contents ez well ez uv the barn. 'Bein 70 years uv age when the war broke out, he did not volunteer in the Confedrit service, and consequently never fired a shot at the Old Flag. His two youngest sons did, it is troo, but the Elder can't bo held responsible for them boys. The estate is entitled to damage jist the same ez theo the Elder wuz alive. Elder Pennibacker hez also claims to a considerable amount, ,wich is fo ffences, crops, barns, and sich, do(ctroyed by Fedral armies. The Elder is not quite certain but that the fbnccs wuz destroyed by order uv a Confedrit General, wich wuz retreetin, and it is possible that the crops, barns, and sich, wuz yoosed up at the same time. It wuz doorin the war, at any rate, and ez the Fedral Government wuz, in his opinyun, to blame for tho war, wich never wood hev bin carried on lied it yeelded ez it ought to hev done, why the Fcldral Government ought to pay all these losses. Uv course I shan't put all the Elder's talk into the petishen. AMiss Jane McGrath's case, wich is the one I sliel push the hardest, is one wich, ef Congris does not consiery fvovrably, it will show that Congris hez no bowels. Miss M[cGrath is a woman.

It will be showed, I make no doubt, that when her oldest brother's regiment (he wuz a ColoneD left for the seat uv war, that Miss McGrath presented to it a soot uv colors wich she made with her own hands, wich soot included a black flag with skull and cross-bones onto it. Sposin she did? It wuz loyalty to wat sihe considered her State. And the fact that doorin the war she rode twelve miles to inform a Confedrit officer that four Fedral soljers wich hed escaped from Anderson-  ville wuz hid in her barn, shood not operate agin her. Onto lier piano ther wuz a choice collection uv Southern songs, and ther is a rumor, that in Louisville wunst she did spit in the face uv a Fedral offiser; but wat uv that? Is a great Govern- \ ment goin to inquire closely into sich trifles? Miss -McGrath  give me the names uv three Fedral Generals who campt on her   place doorin the last year uv the war, wich wood certify to her loyalty, wich, ef they didn't, wood show that there wuzn't any  gratitood in humanity. Deelin Pogram liez uv course a claim. The Deekin's horses wuz all taken by a Fedral offiser, wich wuz the more agravatin, ez the Deekin lied, in addishen to his own, jist bought 25, wich he wuz to hev delivered to General Morgan, uv the Confcdracy, the next day, who wuz to hev paid for em in gold. They were gobbled. For these horses the Deekin claims payment. He wuz. doorin the war, strictly nootral. Kentucky did not secede, neither did the Deekin. His boys went into the Confedrit service, and on several occasions lie mite hev cleaned his trusty rifle ;and gone out at nitc to git a crack at Fedral pickets. Habit is strong, and ez ther were no schoolmasters to shoot, the Deekin must shoot somethin. He considered the war a great misforchoon, and many a time hez the old patriark, with teers streemin down his cheeks, exclaimed, ' Why won't Linkin withdraw his troops and let us alone?"He lez bin since the close uv the struggle a hankerin arter Peece. "Let us hev Peece!" is his cry. '"Give me back my niggers; let me hev things ez they wunce wuz, and I shel be soothed into quietood."  He voted for Micklellan in 1864, and for Seymour in 1868, but that nv course won't count agin him in the matter uv the claim. The minnit lie decided to put in the- claim he -   ANOTHER OUTRAGE.        561 withdrew from the Ku-Klux, uv wich associashun he hez bin chief for this seckshun. He's sorry now that he shot any niggers since the close of the war. He is an inoffensive old man, whose pathway to the tomb needs soothin. The horses he lost he counts worth $10,000, and lhe uv course wsants remuneration to the amount uv $10,000 more for the anguish he suffered seein uv em go. Almost every white citizen uv the Corners hez a claim, uv wich I sliel hev the proselootin; that is them wich kin raise the retainin fee. Some hundred or more who never hedl any- thing before or doorin the war, and who are in the same con- dishen now, hev put in claims fob sums rangin from $10,000 to $20,000, offerin me the half' I git. I may take cm. They kin swear to each other's loyalty, wich will redoose the cost uv evidence to a nmere nominal sum. I shel hie me to Washinton and get Mrs. Cobb to take hold with me, giving her a share. Ef slid spcceeds with Congris ez well ez she did with the President, the result will be all that I kin desire.

Niggers will vote in Ken. tucky the same ez white men, and the star uv liberty is sot forever I They may go so far, ez they will be in a majority, ez to disfranchise the brave men who served in the Confedrit  army. Ez might hev bin expectid, the intelligence affectid the Cor- ners profoundly. We wuz all a settin in at Bascom's ez happy ez we cood be. A new barrel hed bin tapped. Deekin Po- gram had money, and I wuz not altogether unprovided, ez a   : letter hed bin dropped into the Post Offis that mornin wich contained a remittance nv six dollars to a lottery concern in Noo York. Ez I boleeve lotteries to be swindles, and demoral- izin in their nacher, I opened the missive and confiscatid the contents. I will never be the means uv leadin young men to rooin thro the agency of lottries - never. It wuz a pleasant scene. The fire wuz a burnin brightly, wich reflectin on -our respective noses, gave the room a more than usual briteness; B;ascom wuz behint the bar, his elbows leanin onto it, waitin for the orders wich he knew wood be made; Captain McPelter wuz a smolkin his pipe, peacefly, a watchin the clouds that ariz, formin a sort uv halo about his i head; while Deekin Pogram and myself wuz just in the act uv takin suthin hot wich hed bin fixed for us. At this moment  Pennibacker's boy rode up on Bascom's mule and hove a paper at me wich contained the fatal intelligence. I read it aloud. There wuz no more innocent mirth that nite. Deekin Pogram's hand relaxed its holt onto the glass and it fell to the floor, the precious flooid wastin itself thro the cracks, and the old Saint fell from his chair in a swoon. I hed more presence uv mind --I drank mine with one convulsive gulp, and then dropped the empty glass. The effect, so far ez manifestin greef wuz concerned, wuz the same ez tho I hed dropped it, likker and all, and it wuz better for me. The glass wuz Bascom's - the sensashen in my bowels perdoosed by the likker wuz mine. That, even constitooshnel amendments can't take away from me. It didn't take long to figger how this outrage, ef it is con. smmatid, will effect the Corners. Ther is in this peeceful: township sixty-three loyal white voters, uv wich number thirty-   HOW IT WAS.          5        J nine vindicated their manhood in the Confedrit servis, the others bein too old, ceptin Pollock, wich is firom Illinoy, and uv Ablishen proclivities. Garrettstown is ill this township, and countin them in, ther is two hundred and forty-four.adult male niggers, and tlter wood hey bin a baundred more hed  lig- gers all bin born bullet and rope proof. So long cz these nig- gers wuz in their normal condislien uv servitood they wvuz indispensable sence they wuz crooelly owrested from us, we hev made em a most ez yooseful to us by lhevin the law into our own hands. They hev, ez a rool, accumulated suthin, Ibr they labor. We uv course held the offises. Issaker Gavitt is Assessor, and Deekin Pogram Treasurer, and the niggers lhe bin made to pay all the taxes that hev bin paid. They cood. ent help theirselves, for the la'w hez terrors when wceldid by strong- and willin hands, and the hands uv our offishels are both strong and willin. But for these niggcrs the township government wood be a mere nothlin. Issaker didn't dare to a6sess Basoom for fear he'd stop supplies onto him, nor wood Bascom hev any nv the white citizens taxed, for watever they shood pay in taxes, tlat went either into the County or State Treasury, wuz so much lost to him. Ile wuz anxious to hev thle niggers sweat, fob uIV the money collectid uv them  he got a large per cent., either through the Collector or Treasurer, wic l wUZ clear  gain, cz they don't patronize him anyhow. In various other ways we  hed em. Pennibacker is Justis Uv the Peece, and hez bin for yeers, and hle hield the scales firmly. The niggerl wood occasionally labor in plantin time or in harvest for the wvhite citizens whlo owned land, and, filled with the idea that they wuz free citizens, they wood, in the most insolent manner, demand pay for their services. Uv course they wood be refoosed, whereupon they wood bring soot before Pennibacker. The result uv their venchur it is onnecessary for me to state. "What biznis hcz a nigger in this Ter court ? "  wood the in dignant embodimentmv the   majesty uv the law thunder fbrth, with a face as black as a cloud. And dismissin the soot, he wood promptly ishoo an execooshen agin em for costs.

The niggers, after a few experiments, declined to seek justis at that fountain-head uv  the article. Then agin in case uv assault and battery, and inquests on the ded bodies uv niggers, it wuz nessary to hev Pennibacker Justis. Niggers wich wuz found ded hanging on a tree, and with bullet holes into em, wuz reglerly found guilty uv dyin by visitation uv Providence. Ez they hedn't votes, uv course none uv the offishels wuz afraid uv em. I heard one uv em, wunst, who hed bin fined twenty dollars for striking Issaker Gavitt, wich hed in a playful mood chased his daughter thro the Corners, groaninly exclaim that he wisht he'd bin born in Ireland instid uv Ameriky.  But now how will it be with us? They will vote, and they hev a majority. Pollock will be made Justis uv the Peace, Joe Bigler Assessor, and a nigger constable. Wat sekoority hev we? Niggers will soo us and git judgment, and the nigger constable will serve execooshens onto us. Why, Deekin Po- gram owes enuff to niggers to swamp every aker lie holds, and Bascom wood sweat severely. And when we punch one uv their heads for insolence to us, then to be arrestid by a nig- ger, and taken afore a Justis elected by niggers, and be fined or perchance imprisoned! It's too much. When this happens, will the Corners, I ask, be a place for gentlemen uv pride and culcher? Nay. And to this it must come. I see one weak spot in the amendment, viz.: It provides that no State shel disfranchise anybody becoz of race or color, but don't say that people can't be disfranchised for other causes, and I eagerly seezed hold uv that ez a shipwreckt mariner does to a plank. "Wat good will that do us?" groaned the Deekin. "Why, we kin disfranchise em on the skore of ignorance!" remarked I; " the niggers can't all read?" "No more kin I," replied Isaaker Gavitt, mournfully. "I'd be cut out with em."  And upon givin the matter matoor reflection, I saw. that ther wuz no bottom to that hope. By makin readin a test, the   THE END OF JOHNSON.       565 sooperior class at the Corners wood be more hurt than the in- ferior class. Thank Heaven, ten States kin block this game, and save us this torment. O, that they may do it! O, that that bitter draft may be spared us! May the Dimocrisy uv the North put forth their strength, and save us this last degradation. PETROLEUM V. NASBY P. M. (wich means Postmaster). CLXXIV. THE LAST CABINET MEETING.-THE END OF THE JOHNSON REIGN. WASHNGTON, D. C., March 5, 1869. THE agony is over! A. Johnson, spurned by an ungrateful people, wich didn't deserve so sweet a boon, is wunst more a privit citizen, and uv no more account than I am - not ez much, for I am still a Postmaster. Ez I wuz in at the birth uv the Johnson party, so it wuz my painful dooty to be in at the death. I wuz present at the first and the last uv its Cabinet meetins. Tlhe first wuz an eggsiler- atin scene; the last the most mournlful I ever witnist. At the first we startid out with high hopes; fresh in our offisis, with a Treasury to draw on wich seemed to us to hev no bot- toin, and with sich menl ez Raymond, Weed, t al., to give us  claracter, and the voices uv the thousands uv patriots, wich wanltid offis, biddin us God-speed; at the last there wuz left only those who bed becone so fixed tlat they couldn't get away, and every one uv em conshus that the next day at 12 M. they wuz forever lost. The harlot commencin her career with youth, beauty, strengtl, and store clothes, is one thing; the   i same bein holler-eyed, sunken-cheeked, dirty, and drabblcd,  turned out to die on a dunghill, ain't so pleasant to look at.  The meetin wuz held in the same old room, in wich I hev seen more weepin than ever fell to the lot uv one man. (The    i E'  &#xD;<pb n="566-567" xml:id="VAC7107-00000306"/> 566 '       THE CALM PRESIDENT. administrashun uv A. Johnson will be known in histry ez the moist Administration.) It wuz in this room that we decided to veto the Freedman's Buro and Civil Rites Bill, and all the other acts uv the 39th and 40th Congress; it wuz in this room that we received the news uv the eleckshpens uv 1866, '67, and '68; it wuz in this room that the Philadelphia Convenshen wuz determined upon, and the tetchin march uv Couch and Orr, arm in arm, up the aisle wuz arranged, the President writin at the same time his little speech, in wich lihe mentioned the fact . that ez he read the account thereof he couldn't restrain his emoshun, but bustid into a flood uv teers; it wuz in this room that the spontaneous triboots uv respeclk toward His Eggslency at various times and places wuz arranged, and the details   ? thereof fixed up; in short, it wuz in this room that all the acts wich gild the memry uv the late administrashen wuz decided upon and evenchually wept over. Ez I entered it, for the last time probably, I bust into   i teers on the threshold, and jined the other weepers who licd bin distilin briny grief fobr some hours. Indeed, so long hed  i they bin weepin that one friend uv the President, who hed a Kentucky countenance, howled piteously fobr some liquid to replace tlat wich he hed lost. A bottle wuz handed him, and he wept no more. I tried it to strengthen me agin the waste that I knowd must ensoo. Ingratitood is not my failure. Till A. Johnson gits back to Tennessee my eyes shall not be dry. The President wuz terribly calmn and composed. "I Weep I my friends I " sed he, " weep. I can't blame you, fbr you are about to be deprived of me! But in this tryin hour I will be calm. I hev swung around the entire circle uv offishcl honor. I hev bin -" At this pint his voice trembled and his eyes wuz suffoosed. "( But, no! I will be myself. Sekretary Seward, is there any more acts uv an unconstitutional Congress to veto?" "No - pockitin uv em ansers the purpose." "Is there anybody to pardon?" "No one - but stay. Now that I think uv it, two counter- feiters, one whisky speculator, a Confedrit officer or two, and wat's left uv the assassination party, still linger in Basteels or in exile."                      *   THE LEAVE TAKING.        567 t I must finish my work.

He wrote with a firm hand, a fillin uv eml out, wich only took a second, ez he hez blanks printed for all the various offences man kin be guilty uv. ,' Now then my dooties is accomplished, and I cheerfly resine the power wich I wood hev laid down long ago but for the sake uv my bleedin country. I wood bev saved my native land - Enough. Admit our ftiends." ' Mayor Munro, uv Noo Orleans, Mrs. Cobb, a score or more uv Confedrit officers, and a flood uv unforchenet men who hed bin accoosed uv tamperin with an unconstooshncl currency, and a hundred, more or less, uv Federal offis-holders, filed in and shook the President coljelly by the hand, dropin a silent, elokent teer ez they passed. There wuz, in addishen to these, several hundred poor wretches who hed bin layin about Wash- ington for months waitin for posishens, but who hcdn't got em. They hed no money to get home with, and they insisted that the President must and shood furnish emn moans. One uv em demanded uv Randall $500, but that great man finally got rid uv him by loanin him a clean shirt and a box uv paper collars. The man wuz deprest, though still hopeful. "This," sed he, wavin the shirt in air, " this is all I hov to start on agin; when I enmbarlkt into Johnsonism my friends fell off. In remorse I took to likker, and step by step went down till I became the loathsome objiclk yoo behold. But I shel now reform, and try to be somebody. Disguised in this shirt I may inspire confidence and find a helpin hand. But don't none uv yoo speek to me on the street."' Ez I saw him the next evenin, in a state uv hilarity, hangin to a lamp-post, repeatin porshens uv the late President's flire- well address to passers by without any clean shirt on, I judged remorse bed overcome him again, and that the clean sl]irt hed bin pawned, poor fellow! Then come the most saddest scene uv all. The President hed to bid adoo to his Cabinet.

"My liege, 'your tried friends' wuz in the gang uv counter- feiters which jist left the presence. They wuz not only tried, but convicted."                         Sekretary Seward wuz vizably effected. That afternoon he had heerd uv an Island for sale, the principal volcano on wich hIed mostly stopped gushin, and he wept to think he ihedn't time to complete negociashens for it. It wuz offered for    [ s$20,000,000, and he considered the price a mere bagatelle. Sekretary Welles wuz the only cheerftul one in the party. He lied no idea that lie wuz to stop bein Sekretary uv the Navy; he expectid to go along ez theo nothin iled happened. Seward and Randall lied bin tryin for an hour to make him comprehend the sitooashen - that thler wuz to be a change - but to no purpose. He coodent get it thro him. I undertook to impress it onto his intelleck, but my efforts wuz fitile. Huggin to his buzzum a model uv a Erie canal boat wich he had determined to re-model into a revenoo cutter, He kept on  i sayin, "Why-why shood I go out? I wuz under Linkin       \ and then Johnson. There ain't no more difference between Linkin and Johnson than thlere is between Jolinson and Grant is there? I agreed with Linkin and with Johnson, and I shel agree with Grant, doubtless. Why shood I differ with Grant?"                  b          I Randall smiled a sardonicle smile at the aged inftlnt, and . remarkin that he (RandalD lied lied a good time uv it anyhow, the recolleckshon whereof the d-d Abolislnists coodent rob him uv, shook hands with A. J., addin that he didn't bear him any ill will. "I'm a lrooined man," continyrood Randall, "but I'm ez much to blame ez yoo are. I shel go into histry coupled with yoo. My bloornin boys, when they arrive at man's estaite, will apply to the Legislachers uv their respective States to hev their names changed to suthin else. I'm young, and can't die in a few yeers, ez Welles kin, and must therefore drag out a longer eggsistance, but I don't blame yroo. I went into it, takin the chances, and I stand the hazzard uv the die. I shel serve the ambishus youth uv this country cz an Awful Eggssample." But little remained to be done.

They appintid a , committee uv Connecticut men to keep him busy till after his successor wuz installed, and shakin hands all around, each sheddin a manly tear, the last Cabinet meeting uv A. Johnson's administration passed into histry.                  I Uv the inauguration Ulv Grant the next day, I hev not the  heart to write. Suffice it to say that niggers participatid in it. Niggers wuz on the sidewalks, not ez in the olden time, humbloe  and meek, but in chairs, waitin to see the procession pass,   .  amoosin theirselves the while readin noosp'apers.          i Deekin Pogram, who wuz with me, called my attenshen to       this, askin ef it wuz possible for a Kentuckian whllose eyes     i behe'ld sich a site to hev any further faitht in repvublikin in-  p stooshens? The old saint shuddered visibly ez a nigger in a     1 dress coat, plug hat, and shiny boots passed us, nearly knockin us into the gutter in their haste, his wife onto his arm, dressed in the heighth uv fashion, with a panyer. He smiled feebly and in a bewildered way, but sed notliin. The site uv a lligger regiment marchin in the perceshun finished the Deckin. HH  grew so faint that I lied to take himn to his lodgins. ie lcft the same evenin for the Corners. The mnembers uv the late Administrashen hev not decided wat to do. Browning will probably go illnto a claim agency in Noo York. Randall remarkt that ef Sammy Cox and Jack Rogers cood succeed in Noo York, he hot he cood. Mrs. Cobb will go to Noo York, and probably the pardon brokers, lobbty- ists, and sich, will do likewise. A dozen or two Faro banks packed up to-nite, and others will speedily follow em. In con- sekence uv this breakin up in the Administrashen and its supporters, the poleece force uv Washington hez bin already lessened. I sliel accompany the late President to Tennessee, and take my leave uv him then. He will want some faithful friends to console him on that dreary passage, and who so fit for the offis ez the undersined?

P. V. N. CLXXV.  MR. NASBY   WITNESSES A   PROCESSION   OF  THE SONS OF ERIN.  POST OFFIS, CONVEDRIT X ROADS  (wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky), March 20, 1869.  I HAPPENED to be in Albany, wich is in the State uv Noo York, on St. Patrick's Day, and wuz a gratified and pleased observer uv the percession in honor uv the patron saint uv the Green Isle. It wuz a gorgeous site, and one wich warmed my heart. There wuz men in cockt hats on horseback, with green sashes onto cm; there wuz officers uv the various societies in carriages, with green sashes onto em; there wuz the sturdy sons uv Erin on foot, with green sashes onto em, all walkin or ridin, serene in the knowledge unv the fact that, no. matter what cussed macheens mite be invented for diggin on rail-   THE ENTHUSIASM.        571 roads; or carryin brick and mortar to the tops uv buildins, none uv em sed maclepens cood ever vote. Then the, enthoosiasm uv the Dimocratic offis-holders uv Albany exceeded anythin I ever witnest. The Dimocratic members uv the Legislacher, and the state and county offishils, wuz all in conspikuos posish. ens, the high ones bowin urbanely, and the low ones cheerin vociferously. I wuz at a winder uv the Delevan IIouso, - at wich, ez I bed no baggage, I led talen the precaution to pay in advance, for fear I mite, absent-mindedly, leave without payin my board, wich I did at the suggestion uv the gentle . manly and urbane clerk,- when I wuz roodly pusht aside by an impetuous gentleman. Noticin that he wuz a small man, I seized him, and demanded wat in blazes he meant by pushin me. " 3Iy dear sir," sed he, in agony, " please give me yoor place - do give me yoor place! I am a candidate for alderman next spring!"Pityin him, I yeelded, and in a minit he wuz a wavin a green flag from the winder, and shoutin "Rah l!' with all the venom that wuz in him. Ez I lookt at him and the other expectants, I cood not lielp thinkin wat a happiness it must be to be an Irishman in Ameriky. The next mornin I opened the paper, and read the account uv the banquet the previous evenin. My respeck for the       i Celtic race increased largely ez I read. I learned from the  speeches made at that banquet by invited Dimocratic guests who wuz present, and the letters from distinguished Dimo- crats who hed been invitid but who wuz not present, that the    I Irish not only diskivered Ameriky, but thlat they won the in- dependence uv the colonies, beat the British in 1812, carried     on the Mexikin war, and finally, alone and unaided, put down the late onpleasantnis. One speeker, who expects to be May-     I or uv Albany, expresst it ez his beleef that the magnetic needle, gunpowder, and the telegraff wuz the invenshun uv Irishmnn.  The letters written by the leadin Dimocrats uv the State, to be read at the banquet, tetched me. Governor Hoffman paid a fittin triboot to St. Patrick, and remarkt that it wuz the first I time for years that he hed omitted to take some part in the celebrashen uv St. Patrick's Day, and the thought cut him to    i the quick.  Champlain, the Attorney-General uv Noo York, remarkt that ez Irishmen hed borne so honorable a part in ,  &#xD;<pb n="572-573" xml:id="VAC7107-00000309"/> 572          A DREAM. everything that hez tended to increase the moral, intellectooal, and physikle strength uv the country, his sympathy twines closter and closter around ern and that he consekently shud- dered at the prospeckt nv any obstruction being placed in the way uv their bein made citizens ez fast ez possible. The other letters from distinguisht Noo Yorkers wuz mostly uv the same tenor. Ez I wuz readin this, and thinkin to myself how the leadin Dim- ,ocrats uv Noo York never forget that there's an eleckshen ahead, I fell asleep, and in that sleep I hed a most curious vision. Methawt I wuz7 5et ahead twenty yeara. The fifteenth  amendment hed bill passed, and the niggers wuz all voters. I wuz sittin by my winder in the Delevan House, when the sound uv brass moosic broke the fearful stillnis that yoosually pervades the streets uv that city. A percession hove in site  and, to my horror, they wuz niggers! There wuz niggers in cockt hats on horseback, niggers in carriages with banners, and niggers on foot. '"Wat is this?" askt I, in indignashen. "Why, it's a celebration uv the birthday uv St. Gumbo, the patron saint uv Afriky!" renarkt a Dimocratic alderman, who stood beside me. "Turrallh! Turrahl!" shreeked he, pushin me asside, and bendin hIis head out uv the winder so ez to be seen, wavin vociferously a black flag, wich I learned led bin adopted ez the nashnel color uv the Afrikins in Ameriky. The : enthoosiastiv aldem'man wuz7 rowardcd for his eggsertions wit h a grashus smile fromn a pekoolerly disgustin black nigger with a sash onto him, who wuz seeted in a baroosh. "Rah! Rah!" shouted the Dimocrisy from all the winders ez the percession filed by. Ez they wound their way up to the Capitol, I notist the entire buildin wuz decorated with black flags in honor uv the day, and to my disgust I wuz informed that the state officers wuz all Dimocrats. In my dream I picked up the Dimocratic papers the next morning, and read an account uv the banquet that took place that evening. I notist some familyer names appended to ruther familyer-looking letters. Hoffman, who hed got to be a Senator, addrest the Chairman uv the Committee on Invitashens ez "Ceezer Squash, Esq.:   "ETTERS OF REGRET.        573 M1y deer sir "! and remarkt that it wuz the first time for yecrs that he'd not taken some part in the celebrashen uv "St. Gum- bo's Day," but biznis preventid. He regrettid deeply that he cood not be present and jine in the festivities. "Convey to the noble sons of Afriky present," he went on to say, " my sense uv the honor conferred upon me, and my ashoorance that * ez my heart beats, it shel beat in yoonison with theirn. I rec- ognize the valyoo uv the Afiikin populashen to our common country, and yeeld to no one in admirashen uv their noble qualities. I am, sir, yoor most obedient servant." Smothcerin my disgust at this performance, I read on. Champlain, who wuz by this time Governor uv N0o Yorkr, hevin receeved all the nigger votes, and wuz a candidate obr re-elekshun, remarkt in his letter that offishel biznis prevented him from attendin. "It is most nateral," he romarkt., "for Amerikins to yoonite witlh Afilikins everywhere, and h1 felt it the more ez lie thought uv the honorable part the Afiikins lied borne in all that hez tendid to increase the moral, intellectooal, and physikle strength uv our growip country." Tlhe other letters and toasts werrp ez much, like these ez two peas. They all expressed ig-he  4, vosihen for tl\o Afrikin race, and the most ardent admirashen for the Afiikin character; . One enthoosiastic Dimocrat, who was a candidate for Prison Inspector, or suthin, went so far ez to remark that he had a rite to be present, ez he wuz proud to say his grandmother, on his' father's side, hed Afrikin blood in her veins, and out uv re- gard for her he lied named his two darlin children respectively Pompey and Plillis. He loved the Afrikin race, and wuz proud that he cood lay his hand on his heart and say, "I too am an Afrikin!" Another lamentid that he cood not say lie hed Afiikin 1bloo( in hs veins, and Fernandy Wood, who still wantid to be Mayor uv Neo York, proposed the health uv the late l'red Douglas, to wich Jim Brooks respondid. John Morrissey propose(d the memry uv Fred Douglas, and Ben Wood the health uv William Wells Brown. In fact so ardent wuz the admirashen uv the grate lites uv the Dimocrisy for the Afiikin, that, in my dream, I regretted that I hed not bin born in Afriky.  &#xD;<pb n="574-575" xml:id="VAC7107-00000310"/> 574        A CROWNING DISGRACE, At this pint I woke, pleased at findin that wat I bed seen ? and read wuz all a dream, that the paper I held in my hand cortained an account uv an Irish and not a nigger celebrashen, and that the names uv Hoffman and Champlain wuz appended  to letters addressed to Irishmen only. But I wuz sad after all. When the cussid amendment is a part of the soopreme law ulv the land, and the niggers hev votes, will not these men court" em and fondle em the same ez they do other men with ballots? thought I. Will there not be then the same reason for slob-  berin Pompey that there now is for slobberin Patrick?

EF the Dimocrisy uv the North arn't satisfied by this time that the ultimate intenshen uv the Ablishnists is to subjopgate em and redoose em to the level uv the nigger, the voice uV one risin from the dead woodn't avail nothin. Yesterday the last outrage wich a chivalrous people has been compelled to bear was perpetrated onto a citizen of the Corners. A NIGGER IS NOW AN OFFIS-HOLDER AT THE CORNERS I I shel state the case calmly. The posishen uv Assessor uv Internal Revenoo for the Dees- trick uv wich the Corners is the centre, hez bin held by Cap- tain Hugh McPelter, late uv Morgan's cavalry, C. S. A. That he hez filled the posisben to the satisfaction uv the citizens uv the Corners, no one denies. He is a distiller--in fact he and Elder Pennibacker run the two distilleries in the town, and   A NIGGER ASSESSOR.       ' 575 A they hev did a thrivin biznis. McPelter wuz Assessor, and     j Pennibacker Collector, and ez a consekence none uv the capi.-  tal uv the Corners hez bin substracted and carried to Wash-    1 ington to feed the Ablishen theeves there. Ez no tax hez ever    i bin paid on the whiskey at this place, Bascom hez bin enabled ,  to continyoo to sell it at five cents per drink, -wtle everywlhere : else the regler price is ten and fifteen. There wuz other ad- vantages in havin the Assessorship and Collectorship in their hands. By simply hintin to em that it wuz my dooty ez a Fedril offis-holder to investigate their modes uv doin the gov- ernment biznis, I hev not only bin the happy recipient uv scores uv two gallon jugs, but I hev bin enabled at divers and sundry times to prokoor loans uv em uv various amounts, the lowest bein $1.75, and the highest reachin $20. This happy condishun uv affairs is,bustid. Gabrel Bvbcock,     a nigger--that is, a half nigger-- formerly the property uv Deekin Pogram, and who looks enuff like the Delckin's oldest son, Jehiel, to be his half-brother, wuz last week appinted and confirmed Assessor in the place uv Captain McPelter, and im. mejitely he entered onto the discharge" uv his dooties. There are many feechers pekoolyerly aggravatin in the ap- pintment. To begin with, this Babcock wuz notoriously ob- noxyus to the Corners doorin the late onpleasantnis. At the beginnin thereof he run away from Deekin Pogram and entered the Fedral servis. He wuz partikerly activ and cussid. His knowledge uv the country made him yooseful to the Fedrial offisers ez a guide and scout, and at least one Fedral victory is chargeable direct to the information he brot. Then his wife wuz knowd to hev hid five Fedral soljers who lied escaped from Andersonville. When he finally fell into the hands uv Captain McPelter at Fort Pillow kin it be wondered at that he wuz left for dead? or kin it be wondered at that the people uv the Corners wuz surprized when he appeared among emn at the close uv the war with one leg off and one arm stiff? Not much. Captain McPelter wuzn't in the habit uv half doin his work, and the appearance uv this nigger who hed passed through his hands ruther astonished the captin. Doorin his absence he hed learned to read and write, and he wuz made a teecher in the Freedmen's Skool wich wuz es-  &#xD;<pb n="576-577" xml:id="VAC7107-00000311"/> 576       THE POWER HE WIELDED. tablisht in this place, and now he's Assessor, with Pollock on his bond. Ez a matter uv course we despair uv the republic. Wat freedom kin there be for us with a nigger in offishel posishen ? \ to tyranize over us? Wat man uv culcher, uv ejucashen, uv refinement, kin afford to live in a community where a disgustin { mulatto is made not only our ekal but our sooperior? Deekin Pogram said this indignantly to Joe Bigler, who im- mejitly askt the Deekin whether or not he didn't count Bab- cock's mother his ekal thirty years ago? Wich question, wich was askt in the presence uv the Deekin's wife, who hez a temrn- per, wuz the occasion uv severe remarks between the worthy pair. Joe Bigler delites in openin old sores. The first act uv this Babcock in his offish capassity wuz the shuttin up uv McPelter's and Pcnnibacker's distilleries, and Bascom's bar, on the skore that none uv em hed ever taken out licenses, or even paid any taxes. There wuz the most ter- rific ebulishn uv feelin at this act of tyranny that it hez ever bin my lot to witness.          - "Kill the d-d nigger!"I "Hang the black cuss         !  "Down with the Afrikin despot!"  Shoutid the infuriated citizins. With a refinement uv crooel- ty wich cood only be the offspring uv a most depraved- and vishus mind, he shut np these places at seven o'clock in the mornin, before one uv the citizens hed hed his mornin bitters! Hed he postponed it cn hour we might hev fought it out, for some one else would hev prokoored a supply before noon, and things would hev gone on normal. But here wuz the entire populashen uv the Corners at 7 A. M., with throats like lime- kilns, and nary a drop to be hed for love or money. The skeemi wuz well considered and successful. The citizens cood hold out but fifteen minits, and they surrendered. They gave bonds, to wich they all appended their marks, to indemnify the government for back taxes, and compelled Bascom to take out license. This done, the nigger, who wuz backt up by Bigler and Pollock, opened his doors, and the multitood surged in and wuz satisfied. To think uv a nigger holdin the destinies uv the Corners in his hands!   A BLIND GOVERNMENT.        5" Ez a matter uv course, Elder Pennibacker will follow next; ," indeed he wants to resign now, for, sez he, with the Asscssor. ship in hostile hands uv wat avail is it to be Collector?"And then, how long will my head stay on my shoulders? Is a nig- ger to take my place! Already Bascom hez raised his price to 10 cts. per drink, and notified mo that likker from this time out is cash, and already hez Pennibacker and McPelter re- foozed to lend me a cent! My kingdom is crumblin. Tho eleckshen uv Grant wuz the wedge wich is rivin me from stem to stern. I shel be compelled to go hentz a broken man. Good Hevings, why coodn't I lhev died while Johnson wuz still President! The blindness uv this present Administrashen is trooly astonishen. Things wuz settliun rapidly at the Corners. Mc- Pelter wuz becomin pacified, and Deekin Pennibacker like- wise. They wuz not satisfied with the Government, nor did they approve uv anything it did, but they were passive. Now the old sores is opened. Now McPelter is breathin slaughter, and is for lettin slip the dorgs uv war. And wat hez Grant got in return? Why, a nigger who waz already hizzen, and the two whites at the Corners who voted for him last fall, and will agin, anyhow. General Grant evidently don't mean to pacify us - he ain't on the soothe, nor hez lhe a clear idea uv wat is needed to conciliate. I shel go next. There is to be a meetin held next week to protest agin these changes, but it won't avail nothin. We are all marked. r-  PETROLEUM V. NASBY, P. M.

POST OFFICE, CONFEDRIT X ROADS )    I (wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky), : May 8, 1869. ) THE presence uv Pollock, the Illinoy store-keeper, at the Corners, hez alluz bin a source uv uneasiness to the old set- tlers -the bloo blooded chivalry, who hev alluz bin born here, and who hev lived here from time immemorial. An Illinoyan by birth, an Ablishnist by perfesion, and a Storekeeper by practis, he hez, from Ihis originel advent here, bin an unmitiga- ted thorn in the side uv the Kentuckians wich live at the Cor- ners, wich thorn hez rankled and rankled, till it hez festered and finally broke. There are sevral reasons why he hez bin unpopler. Hee credited the citizens uv the Corners, on his first arrival, for sich goods ez they needed, and hed the impoodence to insist- upon pay. Deekin Pogram, in less than two months from the openin, wuz in his debt suthin over a hundred dollars, and the wretch not only insisted on payment, but abslootly sood him, and wood hev recovered the amount, bed Squire Gavitt, who wuz then Justis uv the Peace, ishooed papers. Findin that the officers uv the law uv the Corners wood not interfere in favor uv a disturber, he refoozed to sell another dollar's worth save for cash, and from that time he hez rigidly adhered to that rool. Ez he keeps the only stock uv dry goods there is in the Corners, the citizens are obliged to paternize him, and they hev to pay. This iron hez bin entrin their soles for years, and finally it wuz decidid to hist him, and take the chances uv somebody else comih in his place. The ackshen uv citizens wuz hastened, by the fact that two friends uv hizzen wuz comin from his old home in Illinoy, to start a Wagon and a Cooper shop in the Corners, wich wuz an increase uv just that number uv carpet-baggers, besides wat hands they mite bring with em. This alarmed our citizens, and it wuz felt nessary to take   JOE BIGLER INTERFERES.      579 steps to stop it. Accordin a meetin wuz called uv the natives, wich met last nite at the church. In assoomin the chair (I alm ex-offisho chairman uv all meet. ins held at the Corners), I remarkt that the exigencis uv the times demanded that suthin be done. The peece and yoo- nanimity uv feelin uv the Corners coold not be disturbed by the influx of carpet-baggers. The trooly Southern sole wuz wrung, the Southern heart wuz bleedin, but there wuz a pint beyond wich the Southern sole and heart cood not go, and that pint wuz carpet-bagTgers. The Southern heart loathed tle spawn of the North, and the chivelrons Southern sole cood not and wood not bear to hev Northern agitators olkkepyin their places and bringin with em  their ijecs, wich were alluz in opposishen to ourn. Ef sich wuz to be the case, farewell the sunny South and her instooshens. I ask in conclooslin for an expresion uv opinyun firon the citizens assembled. To my   consternnshin, Joe Bigler riz, tho whllel e came from I can't sav. IlHe commenst by relnmakin. that attaclmcent to one's native soil, and a desire to hold office in it, wuz one uv the higlest and holiest instinks uv our fallen nachers. ITe cood and did sympathize with the chairman uv thp meetin fully, and agreed with him in everything he had said. He did not beleeve that needy advencherers from the cold and fiozen North shood come here and possess theirselves uv the soil to the excloosion uv them  native and to the manor born. Never! never! never   I He hed a Southern leart and a Southern sole, and he wood never consent to be crowded out by them alien to us. -He hed drawd up rcsolooheen. which he begg'ed to submit, viz.:- 2Iesolved, That the native born citizens uv the Confcdrit Cross Roads, wich is in the State uv Kentucky, denounces ez disturbers, interlopers, and carpet-baggers, wich can't be toler- ated, all those within her borders wich wuz not born there.

I saw the strategy uv the de. testable wretch to-wunst. It wuz me he wuz aimin at. I wuz   : the mark uv his infernal mashenashens. I remembered, for the first time in four years, that I wuz not a native uv Ken- tucky; that I wuz a Northner, and that I had come to Ken-    I tucky an advencherer! In agony I arose and protested, but   i too late! The resolooshens passed yoonanimusly, and Joe  Bigler stood griunin at me like a feend.  "Now," sed he, " now that I kin act by authority, now that I kin kwunst more act in accordance with the wishes uv my   / fellow-citizens, from whom I hev bin so long unhappily separa-  ted, I perpose to go for a carpet-bagger. Parson, your time hez come!"I And the wretch made for me vishusly, and bed me by the throte in less than a second. Immejitly Bascom, and Pennebacker, McPelter, and the rest   3 interfered, and dragged the villin away.  "Wat does this mean?" they askt. "Why this assault?" "Why? Isn't the Parson afore us a carpet-bagger?" aslkt  J Bigler. "Wuz he born at the Corners? Hez he a rite to stan on the soil uv Kentucky, and say, thank Hevin, I too am a Kentuckian! Possibly I may hev misunderstood the tenor uv the resolushens 'wich I writ, and wich yoo passed. Ef so, forgive my zeal."  "But, Josef;" sed Deekin Pogram, "the Parson is not, ac- cordin to our idee, a carpet-bagger." "Too troo," said Bigler, in reply; " he hed no carpet-bag  when lie came." "That isn't percisely wat I mean. The Parson is a Con- stooshnel Democrat. He agrees with us in sentiment, and - " "A lite breaks in onto me,' remarkt Bigler. "I see a dis- tinkshen. We denounce men ez carpet-baggers and interlopers and sich, not becoz they are carpet-baggers and interlopers, but becoz they don't interlope accordin to yoor noshens.

"Resolved, That we bust the heads only uv disturbin carpet- baggers. "Resolved, That all Northhern Republikins comin here is car- pet-baggers, and all Northern Dimokrats is not. "TIls," sed Josef, "i makes the matter plain to the dullest comprehension. Let em pass." I objected, but Biglel, stubborn ez a pair uv mules, insisted, and ez by this time the church wuz lbalf iill uv niggers, which he insisted shood vote, ez they wuz not only native born Ken-    tuckians, but many uv em hed the best blood uv Kentucky runnin in their veins, it wuz passed over our heads, and the meetin adjourned, Bigler and Pollock, fbllered by their ad- herents, goin off in high glee.

POST OFFIS, CONFEDRIT X ROADS (WichL is in the Stait Uv K-entuceky), ; May 28, 1869. ) THE agitashen uv the question uv niggers labrin with white men in Washington reached the Corners four weeks ago, and perdoost, ez mite hev bin expectid, most profobund feelin. Our white artisans assembled to-wunst and passed resolooshen's in sympathy with their brethren in Washington, and urgin uv em   : to hold out to the bitter end rather than compermise their dignity by lowerin themselves to the level uv the greasy Afri- ken. The meetin wuznt a large one, for we hev only five mechanics uv the hawty Caucashen race at the Corners, but it wuz enthoositmtic. Three uv the five bed bin at Bascom's four days, hevin bin jist paid off by a new-comer, for a house they bed repaired for him, and they wuz in a frame uv mind for    ) most anything that wuz eggscitin. I directed the attenshun uv these men to the fact that a nig- ger plasterer wuz even at that time employed in plasterin a house between the Corners and Garrettstown, and I askt em ef they wuz content to lay still and see an inferior race taeo the bread out uv tlheir mouths in that way? I implored em, ez labrin men, to preserve the dignity uv labor. Shel niggers invade yoor okkepashens?                     They wuznt none uv em plasterers, but they replied, "Never!  Never!" and demanded, with the utmnost promptitood, to be showd the wretch, that they mite go for him. But I restraned  em till I b[ed organized em into a Free Labor Unyun, which perhibited anybody from workin at anythin wich didn't jine it, and wich perhibitid niggers from jinin it. This preliminary work accomplished, I remarkt, "Follow me 1" They did it with alacrity. On reachin the house we halted, and there our eyes rested onto a site wich blarsted em. There wuz a nigger, a full. blooded nigger, with a cap onto him, and overalls, plasterin I   THE NIGGER PLASTERER.       583 away, whistlin and singin (sometimes one, sometimes another, and then agin bothl to-wunst) Methodist hymns. And ever and anon the unthinkin man of inferiority wood stop and exe. coot a brealk-down, and ]aff to hisself, so that lie could be heard a mile. The disgustin wretch displayed his grovelin, nacher by drinkin water out uv a bucket wich he led handy by him. We made short work uv it. We informed him that the laborers uv the. Corners lied organized a Union, and that no one cood be permitted to work within its boundaries ceptin members thereof.' "Berry well I " remarkt the Afrikin cuss, calmly puttin on a dab uv mortar and smoothin it, " berry well I'll jine the Yoonyun."' "But you can't. No nigger can boe .admitted." "Den I specks I shel lhev to go on and work widout bein a member. De ole woman and de babies must hab dar bread, yoo know." Sich insolence cood not, uv course, be tolerated. We bed stated the case to him calmly and dispassionately. We ied informed him uv the laws we lied made, and this wretch de- liberately defied us, by insistin that lie sliood go on with lhis work I Ther wuz but one course to take, and we took] it. We snaked' the platform out from under him; we tore up his mortar bed; we broke hs trowel and otler tools, and notified him offishelly that any attempt at resoolin work would result in lvnchin uv him. The next day we found that the nigger hed in trooth quit plasterin, but lied fbund employment ez a strilker in a black- smith shop. Uv course sich an outrage on the pure Caucashen employed in that shop, wich his name wuz O'Toole, cood not be permitted, and ez O'Toole refbosed to work with him, ho wuz dischlarged. The next day I notist him on the streets, rather pale and haggard than otherwise, carryin home a shin, bone uv beef wich lie lied bouglit. The next day after 1 ob- served that he lookt better, and I diskivered that ho hed found employment at last on a turnpike road -wich is bein built east uv the town.

The I nigger wuz discharged. He made but one or two more efforts.  5 He undertook to git work at various places, but by this tilme it wuz well enuff knowd that the citizens uv the Corners wuz .: inflexibly opposed to the recognisin uv em in any capassity, and he yeelded. He got very thin, and pale, and haggard, and ! his large family likewise. It wuz evident that they wuznt feelin very well at home. Notis the nateral result of freedom! He ASgLOOTLY BEGGED! 13ut uv course the Corners wood give nothin to a nigger. Then the instinktiv nateral cussidness uv the nigger - the infernal depravity wich is inherent into all uv em -began to display itself. He demoralized rapidly, and in a week became a most disgustin objick-. He stole chickens uv Deekin Pogram, leastways Deekin Pogram's chickens wuz missin, and who should hev stole em but this nigger? He stole corn uv Elder Pennebacker, and wuz finally detected takin -a - ham from Bascom's smoke-house. There wuz no doubt ez to his guilt; he wuz taken in the act, with the fatal ham in his ? possession. He hed taken it home, and his wifbe wuz fiyin large slices uv it. There cood be but one endin to sich a succession uv crinies. The citizens were too much incensed to await the uncertain ackshen uv the law, and they hung him at site. The Corners will never tolerate a nigger theef in their midst, no how, Uv course I improved the occasion. Ez his body wuz a swingin in the air, I askt our people to behold the fruits of Radicalism and Fanatycism. That nigger wuz wunst the happy  t slave uv a happy owner; there wuz ntween em a nateral re- lashen. The nigger workt, and his owner eat, and thus wuz, fulfilled the entire dooties uv life. He wuz not huing then, for he wuz worth too much money to hang. Hlow hed it bin with him sense? He demanded to be made a free man; lie wuz made a free man, and here he is. I told em that there wuz no need uv sayin more; that body a danglin in the air, wich its sole wuz a marchin on, wuz the most elokent sermon wich cood be preacht.

There wuz a nigger woman's body pulled out uv the dan a day or two after- wards, \wich somebody remarkt vuz the wife uv the deccast, and Captain McPelter remarkt that when ihe went to the cabin uv the deceest nigger to- secoor his share of' the furnitoor, that two leadin niggers from Garrettstown were notist malkin off with the children. But there's no tellin whether there's any trooth in these rumors or not. I think I shel go to Washington, and put myself at the head uv the anti-nigger labor movement now bein inogurated there.

Davistown, Boregard, and 1al the towns in that section uv tho State, representin the intelligence and wealth -uv the real old Kentucky stock uv thiose localities. General McDingus, late C. S. A., uv Secessionville, wuz made President, with thirty-two Vice Presidents, wich comprised all the delegates present. This wuz done, ez all uv em seemed to want to be officers. General McDingus stated the object uv the convenshen to be the devisin uv means to increase the commercial importance of the section, to develop her resources, to increase her manu- fakterin interests, and to show the recooperative power the Soutli possesses. Kentucky wants manufakters, Kentucky wants populashen, and to devise means uv gittin these is the objick uv our assemblin. He begged the members to com- mence to-wunst. Kernel McPelter, from the Committee on Invitashens, wuz about to perceed to read letters he hed received from promi- nent Southerners, when Captain Podgers, of Davistown, begged  leave to offer a resolooshen. He saw sittin in the convenshen, with ez much ashoorence ez tho ho hod a rite there, a wretch, with whose name he woodent sully his mouth, who hed come   BLACK SHEEP.         587 from Massychoo - no, he woodent sully his mouth with the name uv that State - from a ablishn State, and hed startid in Davis- town a factory for makin pig iron! employin therein thirty-five men, which hed bot a plantasben uv a distrest planter, and put thereon twenty houses, a skool-house, and a church! He stig. matized this man ez a carpet-bagger. He hed been repectedly warned by the citizens uv Davistown to leave, but lie lied lafft at the warnin. On threatenin his factory, lie lied armed his operatives with double-barrelled shot guns, and with those hed held the citizens at bay. This man hez strength enuff to keep up his factry, but he shel not sit in convenshhn with Southern gentlemen. Major Bangum remarkt that at Boregard they lhed a diffrent way uv meetin these difficulties. A calpet-bagger from 'Penn- sylvany undertook to start a store at Boregard, but we nipt it in the bud at the beginnin. We gave him twenty-four hours to leave, and he left. Hed Captain Podgers commenst in tilne, afbre the evil took root, it cood hev bin eradicated. Deekin Pogram statid that an attempt lied bin made to plant a cotton factry on a water-power at Confedrit X Roads, and give in detail the method adoptid to prevent it, both speeches bein receeved with cheers, which showd that the Southern heart wuz still ez Southern ez ever. Captain Podgers offered the followin resolooshen:- Resolved, That all carpet-baggers be requested to leave the Hall doorin the session uv t he Converlshen. It was carried with loud applause, after which Captain Mc- Pelter read the letters lhe hd received, or rather passed over em to me to read, ez I do the most uv it for the Corners. JEFFERSON DAVIS -President DAVIS, I exclaimed, ez I kist the letter - regretted that he could not be present. His heart still beats for the Sunny South - I cood get no further with the readin ,uv this epistle. The most enthusiastic and vociferous cheers it hez ever bin my lot to hear broke from the throng in the buildin, Captain McPelter endin with the genooine Southern chargin yell, at wichl the niggers in the vicinity uv the buildin grew pale and took to the woods. They'd heard it before, and not bein advised that the meetin wuz purely a Commershal Convenshen, they wuz seriously affrighted.  &#xD;<pb n="588-589" xml:id="VAC7107-00000317"/> 588         THE WORK DONE. General Boregard regretted that he cood not be present,  but- Agin I wuz interruptid by cheers, wich made the very roof  shake, and the members uv the Convenshen threw up their hats to an extent wich fairly darkened the air. Letters wuz attempted to be read from other noted leaders uv the South in the late unpleasantnis with the vandals uv subjugatin States, but at the menshen" uv each uv their names the cheerin wuz so extraordinarily vociferous ez to prevent anything bein heard. At this pint, while the enthusiasm wuz at its highest pitch, Deekin Pogram riz, and remarkt that Confedrit X Roads wuz, he wuz aware, painfully defishent in many things. They hed but one store, and that wuz run by a despicable carpet-bagger, and Bascom's whiskey wuz not alluz uv the best; but one thing she could boast uv, namely, her wimmen. "Stand up, Mi- randy! he remarkt to that gushin damsel; "and the others in the gallery may ez well rise likewise," wich they all did, wavin Confedrit flags, and bustin out into that ever-inspirin anthem, "The Bonny Bloo Flag." "There," remarkt the Deekin, "there is our jewels. Three cheers for our daugh- ters! t The effeck uv this was somewhat spiled by a dozen or more quadroons, risin with Mirandy and the rest uv em! That ojus, denloralizin villin, Joe Bigler, who delites in spilin tetchin  tabloos, hed em snug in the gallery all the time, and he sprung em onto us thus crooelly!  General Belter, uv Boregard, offered a resolooshen denouncin  the reconstruckshen measures, President Grant and his Cabi-  net, the oppressive Nashnel debt, carpet-baggers, and the - Republican party; Major Flair offered one, implorin the  Northern Dimocracy to stand firm agin the constooshnel  amendment; Captain McPelter one, insistin on the revokashen uv all laws bearin onto those who had served on the side uv State rites doorin the recent collision uv States; all of wich was adopted enthoosiastically, when the convenshen adjourned, sine die. The delegates, congratulatin each other on the noble work that hed bin done for the South that day, took a partin drink at   A SINGULAR OMSSON.       589 Bascom's at the expense uv our citizens, wich Bascom wood not set it out till some responsible citizen, wich lied land with not more than two mortgages on, wood make hisself responsible for em, and wuz a gittin into the wagons to dust out to their respective homes, when one uv em reiarkt - "W've forgot one thing I " "No we hevint," remarkt General Dingus. "We've done every thing that's yoosual at Southern commercial convenshens. We've cheered for Davis and Boregard; we've admired the women, denounst the ablishen party, and demanded our rites - wat more wuz there to do?  "We haint sed a cussid word about commerce." "Thunder!" remarkt the General, "it's a fact. D-d ef it didn't slip my memry entirely. We must assemble agin." And the meetin was again convened. The work was accomplished in short order. Resolooslens wuz passed demandin the buildin uv a railroad by the ginral Government from Davistown to Secessionville, and four differ- ent lines uv road to the Pacific, witl branclles endin at Con- fedrit X Roads, Secessionvillc, Davistown, Boregard, and sich other towns ez mite consider it to their interest to hev em. In addition to these it wuz demandid that dredges be taken from the harbors on Lake Erie and other Northernl waters, and kept twelve months in the year at work in Camp Run to keep it navigable to the Ohio river for boats uv all classes. A reso- looshen wuz offered demandin uv the Governmdnt the buildin of a levee around Deekin Pogram's farm, a part uv wichi is frekently overflowed in the spring and fall, and also the gravlin or plankin uv the roads in the county, but it wuz considered best to withdraw these, ez they didn't feel like askin too much to-wunst. Other resolooshens wuz passed, demnandin recom- pense for the loss uv niggers, and property destroyed doorin the war, in order that there might be that harmony so much to be desired between the Government and Kentucky, and the meetin adjourned, this time for keeps. Ef these acts uv justis is done, well and good; ef not, Kentucky protests. The Con. venshen hez hopes uv results fbllerin its ackshen.  PETROLEUM V. NASBY, P. IM.

ON A FARM, THREE MLES FROM CONFEDRIT X ROADS - (wich is in the Stait uv Kentuc-ky), June 29, 1869. )  THE die is cast I The guilloteen hez fallen! I am no longer Postmaster at Confedrit X Roads, wich is in the State uv Kentucky. The place wich knowd me wunst will know me no more forever; the paper wich Deekin Pogram takes will be handed out by a nigger; a nigger will hev the openin uv let- ters addressed to parties residin hereabouts, containin remit- . tances; a nigger will hev the riflin uv letters addrest to lottry  managers, and extractin the sweets therefrom; a nigger will be. - But I can't dwell upon the disgustin theme no longer. I hed bin in Washington two weeks assistin the Caucashens . uv that city to put their foot upon the heads uv the cussid - niggers who ain't content to accept the situashen and remain ez they alluz hev bin, inferior beins. To say I hed succeeded, is a week expreshen. I organized a raid onto em so effectoo-.  ally ez to drive no less than thirty uv em out uv employment,  twenty-seven uv wich wuz compelled to steel their bread, wich give us a splendid opportoonity to show up the nateral cussid- ness uv the Afrikin race, wich we improved. . On my arrival at the Corners, I knew to-wunst that suthbin wuz wrong. The bottles behind the bar wuz draped in black; the barrels wuz festooned gloomily (wich is our yoosual method of expressin grief at public calamities), and the premises gen. erally wore a funeral aspeck. "Wat is it?" gasped I. Bascom returned not a word, but waved his hand towards the Post Offis. Rushin thither, I bustid open the door, and reeled almost agin the wall. AT THE GENERAL DELIVERY.

"Show him, Ceezer I " And the nigger, every tooth in his head shinin, handed me a commishn dooly made out and signed. I saw it all at a glance. I led left my biznis in the hands uv a depetty. It arrived the day after I left, and Isaker Gavitt, who distribbited the mail, gave it to the cuss. Pollock made out the bonds and vent onto em himself, and in ten days the commislin come all reglcr, whereupon Bigler backt the nigger and took forcible posses- sion uv the office.  While I wuz absent they lied hed a perces- sion in honor uv the joyful event, sed perceshn consistin uv Pollock, Bigler, and the new   Postmaster, who  marchled through the streets with the stars and stripes, banners and sich. Bigler remarkt that the perce4sion wnzn't large, but it wuz talented, eminently respectablej and extremely versatccl. He (Bigler) carried the flag and played the fife; Pollock carried a banner with an inscripshen onto it, "' Sound the loud timbrel o'er Egypt's darl sea.," and played the bass drum; while the nigger bore aloft a banner, inscribed, "Where Afric's sunny fountins roll down the golden sands," withl h'is commis- sion pinned onto it, playin in addishen a pair uv anshent cym- bals. Bigler remarkt further that the perceshun created a positive sensashun at the Corners, wich I shood think it wood. "It wuzn't,"  sed the tormentin cuss, "very much like the grand percession wich took place when yoo received yoor commishn. Then the whites at the Corners wuz elated, for they spectid to git wat yoo owed em in doo time, and the nig- gers wuz correspondinly deprest. They slunk into by-waT s and side-ways; they didn't hold up their heads, and they dusted out ez fast ez they cood git. At this percession there wuz a change. The niggers lined the streets ez we passed, grinnin exultinly, and the whites wuz deprest correspondinly.  It's singler that at the Corners the two races can't feel good both at the, same time."

There wuznt a  dry eye among em; and ez I thot uv the joys once tastid, but now forever fled, mine moistened likewise. There wuz a visi-  ble change in their manner towards me. They regarded me with solisitood, but I cood discern that the solisitood wuz  H! not so much for me ez for themselves. "Wat shel I do?' I askt. "Suthin must be devised, for I  can't starve." "Pay me wat yoo owe me!" ejakelatid Bascom. "Pay me wat yoo owe me I " ejakelatid Deekin Pogram, and  the same remark wuz made by all uv em with wonderful yoo- nanimity. Watever differences uv opinyun ther mite be on other topics, on this they wuz all agreed. "Gentlemen I "I commenced, backing out into a corner, "is this generous? Is this the treatment I hev a right to expect? ; Is this -" I shood hev gone on at length, but jist at that minnit Pol. lock, Joe Bigler, and the new Postmaster entered. "I hev biznis 1" sed the Postmaster; "not agreeable biznis, but it's my offishel dooty to perform it." At the word "offishel," comin from his lips, I groaned, wich wuz ekkoed by those present. "I hev in my hand," continyood he, "de bond giben by my predecessor, onto wich is de names uv George W. Bascom, Elkanah Pogram, Hugh McPelter, and Seth Pennibacker, ez sureties. In dis oder hand I hold a skedool ob de property belongin to de 'partment wich wuz turned ober to him by his predecessor, consistin of table, chairs, boxes, locks, bags, et settry, wid sundry dollars worf of stamps, paper, twine, &amp;c. None ob dis post offis property, turned over to my predecessor  by his predecessor, is to be found in do offis, and do objick ob dis visit is to notify yoo dat onless immejit payment be made uv the amount thereof, I am directed by de 'partment to bring soot to-wunst against the sed sureties."  Never before did I so appreciate A. Johnson, and his Postmaster-General Randall. Under their administrashen wat Postmaster wuz ever pulled up for steelin anythin?  Eko ansers. This wuz the feather that broke the camel's  back.    DESPAIR.          593 "Wat!" exclaimed Bascom, " shel I lose wat yoo owe me, and then pay for wat yoo've stole'? 7" "Shel I lose the money," sed Pogram, "wich I lent yoo, and in addishen pay a Ablishen government for property yoo've confiscated?"               , "But the property is here," I remarkt to Bascom; " yoo've got it all. Why not return it, and save all this trouble." "Wat wood I hev then for the whiskey yoo've consoomed?" he ejakelated vishusly. "It's all I've ever got from you; and I've bin keepin yoo for four years." ' Didn't that property pay yoo for the likker?"I asked; but Bascom wuz in no humor for figgers, and he pitched into me, at wich pleasant pastime they all follered soot. But for Joe Bigler, they wood hev killed me. Ez it wuz they blackt both my eyes, and rolled me out onto the sidewalk, shuttin the door agin me. Ez I heard that door slam to, I felt that all wuz lost. No offis! no money! and Bascom's closed agin me! Kin there be a harder fate? I passed the nite with a farmer three miles out, who, bein sick, hedn't bin to the Corners, and consekently knowd nothin uv the changes. I heard the next day the result uv the ruckshun. Bascom returned sich uv the property ez hedn't been sold and con- soomed, wich consisted uv the boxes. The chairs led bin broken up in the frekent shindies wich occur at his place; the locks bed bin sold to farmers who yoozed em on their smoke houses; the bags hed bin sold for wheat, and so on. The stamps, paper, twine, and sich, figgered up three hundred and forty-six dollars, wich wuz three hundred more,: dollars than there wuz in the Corners. Bascom advanced the forty-six dol- lars, and the three hundred wuz borrowed uv a banker at Secessionville, who took mortgages on the farms uv the impru- dent bondsmen for sekoority. Uv course I can't go back to the Corners under eggsistin circumstances. It wood be un- comfortable for me to live there ez matters hev terminated. I shel make my way to Washinton, and shel see if I can't git myself electid ez Manager of a Labor Assosiation, and so make a livin till there comes a change in the Administrashen.

NASBY RECEIVES A LETTER FROM      HS S STEADFAST FRIEND, PEPPER'S TAVERN, HOLMES Co., O.,  August 22,1869. i I LEFT the Corners the day after I lost my position, and, without any speshal purpose, wandered up into my old stampinr grounds in Ohio. I wuz received with a corjality wich affected me profoundly. Them wich bed bin turned out uv offises cood sympathize with me, and them wich hed never got em, felt it still more deeply, ez they eggsaggerate the benefit to be derived from ofishl posishen, and actilly wonder how a man wich ever held an offis kin survive decapitashen. I hed no difficulty in borrowin enuff dollars uv the sturdy yeomanry uv this section to not only keep me afloat here for a time, but to pervide again a passage through an Ablishn country, ef sich need be. My expenses here will be light, ez I ain boardin and drinkin on tick exclusively. I told the land- lord the first day to mark it down, ez it wuz inconvenient to make change fifty times per day. He possibly may wish he hed taken the trouble to make change. The sceen reminds me uv Bascom's so much that I actilly shed teers. Democrasy is alike everywhere. Ther wuz the bar, with the big-bellied bottle with tansy in it, and the big- bellied bottle without tansy in it; ther wuz the box uv pipes, the two lemons wich are doomed never to be yoosed, ez lemon- joose weakens likker; ther wuz Pepper, the landlord, with his sleeves rolled up, a leanin onto his elbows onto the bar; be   PEPPER'S.          595 hind him a portrate uv Jackson, on his fomin steed, wavin his sword towards the British, beside it a hand-bill for a mass Con- venshun uv the Deestrick last year, commensin with the trooly orthodox line, "Do you want to marry a nigger?" in large, black type, with-a picter uv Wendell Phllillips Ikissin a wencll, at wich the Democrasy hev indignated reglerly for ten yeers. Seetid on bustid cheers, empty nail kegs, and leaning on the bar, wuz a groop wich was simply a dooplikit uv the X Roads, and so akkerit that I caught myself sayin "( Deekin " lots uv times. J sed "Captain" to a nman who wuz so near like McPelter, ez to justify the suspicion that the father uv the present Hugh hed many yeers before bin a citizen uv that visinity, but I wuz keerfill not to do so agin, Ketchin me by the throte, he sternly remarkt, "Sir! don't put zalry uv theln titles onto me, sir. I wuz no Captain, thank Heven." IIo wuz passified when I told him that his remarkable resemblance to a Confedrit Captin occasioned the mistake, wrich pleased him so that he to-wunst askt me to take suthin. This opened a new field to ine, wich I worked. I diskivered to-wunst an amazin resemblence between all uv emn and distinguishht Southern commanders. We fell to talkin uv the old times wich tried men's soles, in the earlier years uv the war. Pepper, the landlord, gave a most affectin reminiscence uv the shootin uv two returned veterans, in the very room in wich we sot. The spot on which they fell he hed put the stove over, that it mite be kept sakred. 31r. Bortle, an old saint, whose nose wuz lightin his pathway to the toom, hed a more tragicle tale to tell. He wuz one- uv them wich sholdered his fowlin peece to resist the draft up in this County, and wuz taken by bloo-coated hirelins and carted off to Camp Chase, where he wuz kept in doorance vile for weeks, with nothin watever to live onto but the yoosual rashens uv a soljer! One old relic uv the war, wich, his name it wuz Babbitt, accompanied Vallandygum through the lines, wich lines wuz commandid by Rosecrans. He wuz present wlhen that accursed villain - that tool uv the despotic ape, Linkin - hed the impudense to aboose our martyred Saint, and his blood biled ez he heered it.

Ez I gazed at the familyer stamp onto the envelope, wich I hed yoozed so many times, I kissed it in extacy; ez I thot that it wuz inflicted onto the paper by : the hand uv a nigger, indignashen seezed me. But passin    i this, I read ez follows                    i CONFEDRIT X ROADS (wich is in the Stait uv Kentucky), } August the 19th, 1869. . MY DEAR, DEAR FRIEND: Absence, it, is sed, conkers love, but that won't work in your case. I had tried to forget yoo, and lied well nigh succeeded, but in overhaulin somne papers yesterday, I happened to come across some uv yoor notes of hand for small amounts borrowed uv me at different times, and I realized to-wunst the force of the old line--        i "Tho lost to site, to memry dear,"       : and I bust out into a flood uv tears. Crops is a totle failyoor here. The season hez bin favorable, but we hev bin so entirely without labor that we put in but very little seed. At the time wre ought to hev hed our corn  plantid, Issaker Gavitt, Kernel McPelter, Elder Pennibacler, and our sons wuz scourin the country to get enuff niggers to plant for us, but ez they each hed land uv their own, they  woodent do it. So uv course there wuz none uv any account put in. The little that wuz put in won't amount to nothin, ez we coodent git niggers enuff to tend it durin the growin sea- son, and the weeds took possession uv it entirely, Joe Bigler sejested that ef we'd spend half the time plantin uv it that we did holdin meetins to devise ways to get nigger labor, we'd hev a bustin crop. But yoo know Josef; he's a lost carikter; he works with his own hands. One uv the most tetchin sites  ! I ever beheld wuz at Bascom's early in May, jist after our committee had returned from a frootlis search after hands to  i do our plantin. The entire Corners wuz present; but there wuz a settled gloom onto their faces, wich even the refresh- ments they wuz consooming coodent entirely dissipate. They wuz grooped about the bar-room  ez yoosual. Elder Penni. backer wuz a leanin in a chair, with his back on a. table, in the corner, and the others wuz a sittin on kegs in various parts uv the room.   THE LACK OF LABOR.       , 597 "Wo is us!" sighed the Elder, puttin his feet onto a keg, that he mite rest easier, and pensively squirtin tabacco jooce at a fly on the wall opposite, " where is the labor to plant the corn? We shel starve!" "Alas!" sighed the Deeken, shiftin his seat to get so that he cood cock his feet agin the wall. "Alas! the minits is creeping on; day succeeds day, and no corn in yet." "Yes," replied Issaker Gavitt, rollin over onto his belly, and histin hisself up onto his elbows, " this is the froots uv Ablishnism. Ten years ago, when we hed our niggers, wo hed our corn all in by this time, and wuz ready to put cm to plowin on it out. Now that we are dependent onto our labor- " And Issaker groaned, and rolled over onto his back. And so we sot, and sot, and mourned. The result uv wich is, that there ain't an acre uv good corn in the entire bection. Wood tht the Allishnist?, wicl&amp; brot, all this onto us, cood see the rooin they hev wrought. The prevailin topic uv discussion sence yoo left us hez bin the trouble with Pollock and a Ablislin frend uv lhizzen wlio lives in Springfield, Illinoy, the rostin place uv that human goriller, A. Linkin, growin out uv the bond question. Yoo remember three years ago the Corporashen ishood its bonds, bearin 6 per cent, for $2,000, to bild a lock-up; and a yeer later, when it wuz found nessary to gravel the road betwixt the Corners and the stashen at Secessionville, so cz to redoose the freight on the whislkey consumed by us, we ishood bonds bearin eight per cent., to the amount of $4,000, both ishoos runnin twenty-five years. These bonds were taken by Pollock and this fiend uv hizzen. Last yeer we paid the interest on these bonds, but this year the people felt that the burden wuz too heavy. They could not reconcile theirselves to the idea uv sweatin to support in idle luxury the bloated bond-holders, and the populis murmured agin it. Wat to do we didn't know, till finally Elder Penne- backer, who borrows my paper reglerly, remarked, "Eureler -I've got it!" He hed bin readin the Dimocra,tic proposition to tax bonds, and a lite dawned onto him. "We'll tax these bonds of Pollock's!" sed the Elder, " and  &#xD;<pb n="598-599" xml:id="VAC7107-00000323"/> 598        THE BOND QUESTION. thus releeve ourselves uv this thraldom to the money power. Thank Heaven, the people hevn't yet parted with all their power." The segestion wuz acted on to-wunst. The Council wuz assembled, and by a yoonanymous vote an ordinance wuz passed levyin a tax uv eight cents onto the dollar on all bonds ishood  by the corporashun for moneys borrowed uv all sorts.  Pollock wuz away when the ordinance wuz passed, and it so happened that he returned the very day that his interest wuz  due. Immejitly he proceeded to the Trezrer's office, wich is Captin McPelter's, with his coopons. Captin McPelter re-  ceeved him blandly, and, puttin the coopons away, tendered him in loo thereoff a receipt for $320 taxes on them sed bonds.  "Wat is this?" ejackilated the astonished Pollock. "Taxes " returned McPelter, smilingly. "We hev assessed a tax onto our bonds uv eight cents onto the dollar, wich, it happens, is just wat yoor interest is. We skorn repudiation - we shel pay principal and interest - but we hev the rite to tax bonds, and tax em we will." "Is the tax eight cents on the dollar on all bonds uv the corporashen?" asked Pollock. "Troolv it is," sed McPelter.  "I hold also the bonds ishood a year before these for buildin a lock-up, but wich only bear six per cent. The tax pays the interest and two per cent. over; what will you do with that two per cent.?"  "Do with it?" exclaimed McPelter. "Why, we shiel apply it to the payment uv the principal, uv course. The entire revenoo uv the corporation is pledged to the extinguishment uv its debt, and we shel not be recreant to our trust." Pollock went away, but McPelter lied a new idea. He im- mejitly called the Council together, and sejested that the tax on the bonds ought to be twelve instead uv eight per cent., ez that tax would not only pay the interest on the 8 per cent bonds, but would extinguish the bonds theirselves. The six per cent. bonds wood not only be eaten up, but would leave Pollock in debt to the corporashen long before they wuz doo. The way uv escape from our troubles wuz so very plain that    HOW IT WAS MET.         599 the Council to-wunst acceeded to it; and notis wuz given Pol- lock uv the new ackshen.   I Immejetly the craven wretch wantid to sell thb bonds to the city at half ther face, but the proposition wuz rejected with skorn. The Council passed a resolooshn rebooken him for intimatin that the Corners wood not live up to its obliga- tions. "Ez much ez we loathe yoo," remarked Elder Pennibacker, the Municipal President, " we shall pay yoor bonds, dollar for dollar, principal and interest; requiring yoo, however, to bear sich taxation ez may be levied onto yoo." But ez the tax eats up both interest and principal, what do I get for my money?" askt the stiff-neclt man. v "The protection uv our laws!" thundered Pennibacker. The people wuz so indignant at this Ablishnist meddler for his objectin to so ekitable a proceedin that they mobbld his store, and wood hev hung him, but fer the interference uv Joe Bigler, who is alluz where he ain't wantid. Ez it wuz, he wuz arrestid for breedin disturbances, and fined $20. He tendered, in payment uv his fine, a corporashun bond, but the Justis refoozed, very properly, to take it, and held him till he shelled out a greenback from his ill-gotten hoards. Pollock feels sore, but we don't. Releved from these bonds, the Corners will hev no taxes to pay, and we confidently ex- pect a return uv the prosperity to wich we hev bin so long a stranger.

NASBY ATTENDS A CONVOCATION OF THE DEMOCRACY OF NEW    YORK.          ! Noo YonRi, INovember 20, 1869. I ATTENDID, by spesh invitashun, a meetin uv the infloo- ensh workin Democrats uv Noo York, wich wuz called to lay out the work for the incomin Legislacher. The'meetin wuz  held at Hiberny Hall, wich, ez the occasion wuz one relatin to the Government uv the State and city uv Noo York, wuz per- foosely decorated with the green flag uv Ireland, larps, sun- bursts, and other emblems uv a patriotic nacher, while a brass band on the platform enlivened the perceedins by playin, at regler intervals, "The Wearin uv the Green." Dennis Macarthy wuz called to the chair, and Patrick Maloney wuz made secretary. Some one sejested a man named Biggins for secretary, urgin that Biggins cood rite; but his name wuz agin him, and Maloney wuz yoonanimusly chosen. It wuz     I afterwards discovered that Biggins wuz really an Irishman, and they immejitly made him assistant secretary. A committee, consistin nv Messrs. O'Doherty, O'Malley, O'Grady, O'Toole, and O'Shaughnessy, reported ez committee on resolushens, Messrs. McShane, McDonoho, McGragan, McEvy, and McVay, wich reported ez follows: - That, representin the Democrasy 1v Noo York, we demand uv the new Legislacher the immejit repeel uv the Excise Law, all the laws bearin on whiskey, all the laws takin control uv the city uv Noo York out uv the hands uv the Democrisy uv the city, the repeel uv all the Metropolitan poleece laws, and the restorashen uv the appintin uv the poleece to the Mayor, where it ought to be; in short, the repeel uv all the laws passed by the Ablishun Legislachers uv the past ten years. Mr. Patsy O'Brannon urged the passage uv the resolooshens yoonanimusly. He shood, uv course, be a sargent in the new poleece force, and in addishen to that he hed a brother wich landid the day before the eleckshen, wich brother, like a troo Amerikin, votid four times, wich must hev a place on the force. F;      ,   WHAT THEY WANTED.       ' 601 He (1Mr. O'Brannon) felt that he coodent support him much longet, and onless he got his brother a place soon he wood hev to go to work. Mr. O'Shaughnessy wantid to know ef men landid in Novem- ber, and who hed only voted at one eleckshun, wuz to step in and take office over the heads uv vetrans wich bed bin here two and three years? Ef sich things - Mr. Baldwin moved that no man be recognized ez eligible for an offis, or even contrack, wich bed bill in the country less than three months. Mr. McShane shood vote agin that moshen. He bed one brother to whom he bed written to come to-wunst, who wood be cut out for three months if the moshen passed, and he (McShane) coodent afford to board him so long. Mr. McGrath should also oppose it. Anticipatin a repeel uv the ojus laws wich hampered the Dimocrisy uv Noo York, he bed got a frend to write to two brothers and four cousins to sail immejitly, to fill posishens uv polecocmcn and skool direc- tors and sich, and he hed another brother who wood come ez soon ez his time wuz out in the prison at Liverpool, who must be provided for. He wood vote for no sicil moshon. It wuz lost. Mr. O'Shaughnessy wanted a moshen instructin the Lcgisla- cher to not only put the appintin power in the hand uv the Mayor, but to immejitly double the poleece force uv the cities uv the State wich hev Democratic majorities. Mr. McCoole moved to amend, by requirin all sich cities to commence to-wunst the buildinl uv Court Hlouses, in which shape it wuz carried. Mr. McGeoghegan wished to call the attenshen uv the meet- in to the fact that the Mayor uv the city hed appinted two janitors in the City Hall, one uv wicll wuz born in Connecticut, and the other in Noo Jersey. A committee wuz about to be appinted to call upon the Mayor to remonstrate, when it wuz made known that the places hod bin originally given to two brothers named McGrath, who hed sold em to these men, and the subjick wuz dropped. Before the explanashen wuz made there wuz much feelin manifested, but when the facts were made known three hearty cheers wuz given the Mayor.  &#xD;<pb n="602-603" xml:id="VAC7107-00000325"/> 602         A NEW HOME.

Legislacher Led to do with that matter. Ther never hed bin hangin in Noo York for nigger-killin, the Lord be praised, and he hed no fears ther ever wood be. Mr. O'Sullivan wuz pleased to know it. He hed bin in the country but a short time, and did not filly understand the customs. He rentid his house uv a naygur, but lhe shood pay rent no more. It wuz acknowledgin ther superiority. It wuz also resolved that to prevent mistakes and errors,  when the appintments for the different offises in the city come to be made, that each applicant be required to state wich county uv Ireland he comes from. After some other bizness thi meetin adjourned. Wunst on a time a native'uv a Western State, lookin at a Democratic procession in this city, remarked ef he led enuff inflooence at Washinton he wood ask to be appinted Amerikin Consul to Noo York.

THE dove wich Noall sent out come back to the Ark becoz the waters kivered the land; when the dove found a dry spot it come back no more. I  am a dove. I wuz sent out from the Corners, but the prevalence uv water druv me back, time and   THE "HARP .UV ERIN."       603 agen. Now, thank Heaven, I hev found a spot wher ther is no water (at least I've never seen any used here for any purpose), and here I stay. My foot hez found a restin-place. I am the sole proprietor uv the "Harp uv Erin " saloon. The original proprietor uv the "Harp uv Erin" died the evenin uv the last eleckshun, much regretted by his politikle 5asSh'teS, He hed. only voted thirteen times when in aLt argyment techin the merits uv, his candidate, ez compared with his opponent for the nominashen, he wuz hit with a brick- bat, and died with his day's work half done. The man who struck him wuz expelled from the society to wichl he be- longed for killin an able-bodied Democrat before the closin uv the polls. How I got possesshen uv the s'loon I shel not state. Suffice it to say, it became mine, and the stock likewise, and that I shel never hev occashen to leave it. Here I shel live, and' here I shel die. Uv course I've decorated it to soot the tastes uv my patrons. I took down the portrate uv Jackson, and cut off uv the bottom the words, "Tie Yootnyun, it must and shlel be preserved!" and substitootid, " le serves his party best who votes the most," wich I read to those wlho drop in ez thel last words uv the Hero uv Noo Orleens. I hev an Irish flag turned round an Irish Harp over the bar, and portrates uv the Head Centres uv the Fenian Brotherhood, properly wreathed, all about the room. On the end uv the bar, in tleo spot where in other neyborhoods the water-pitchler stands, I hev a box with a hole in the top uv it, inscribed, "Contribu- shens for the benefit uv our suftrin brethren in English Basteels may be dropped in here." That box rpore than pays my rent. Then I hev quite a cabinet uv sakred relics. I hev a piece uv the rope wich hung  John Brown; the identicle club wich killed the first nigger in the riots uv July, 1863; a bullit fired at the Triboon offis at that time, with other sooveneers dear to tlhe Democratic heart, wich attract many. These hang onto thle walls, and underneath them I hev the prices uv drinks in- scribed, with the stern, cold words, "No Trust." I inoggeratid my establishment last Wednesday nite. Re- memberin the terrible endin uv all my other innogerashens, Iy declined at fust to make any formal openin; but my friends in-  &#xD;<pb n="604-605" xml:id="VAC7107-00000326"/> 604       A SUCCESSFUL OPENING. sisted that it wuz the custom uv the ward, and that I must  do it. "Nobody will buy yoor likker," sed one, "ef yoo don't make a regler openin." "Ef I make a regler openin," sed I, "I won't hev a drop to sell em. Stay-- I hev it. I'll go before a Justis uv the Peece i and take a solemn oath not to drink anything myself that nite."  'Twon't do, sed my friend. "Oaths don't count in this   I ward." Various plans were sejestid. One gentleman proposed that  I shood be tied down so that I coodn't git at the likker, and that he shood do the honors. His nose wuz agin him, and I declined his proposishen. Finally I hit upon a plan. I calki-  lated that twenty gallons wood anser, and I put that amount in a barrel. The balance uv the stock I locked in a room, and then put the key away in a drawer. "There," sed I, triumphantly, " afore that twenty gallons is  eggsausted I shel be too far gone to know where the key to the room holdin the balance uv the stock is. Saved! saved "  It resultid ez I anticipatid. At first we bed speeches and toasts. Mr. O'Rafferty replide to the toast, "Our adoptid country." He sed the term, 'Our adoptid country," wuz a happy one, fur so fur ez Noo York wuz conserned, the sons uv Eirin led adoptid it. He hed bin charged with a lack uv love fur this country. He repelled the charge with skorn. Why shoodn't he love this country? In wat other country wuz votes wortl a dollar apeece? Where else cood sich a man ez he hev so high a posishen ez Alderman, and only two yeers on the grounds.  Mr. O'Toole jined in the sentiment. Where else under the canopy cood a man like hisself; who coodn't read, be a skool direcktor? He hed often bin thankful that he hed turned his face toward Ameriky the minit his time wuz out in the prison at Liverpool. Ther wuz less risk in holain offis in Noo York than in burglary in England, and the results wuz shoorer. Ther wuzn't much more speech-makin. The drinkin went on fast and furious tho, and ez I antissipatid, before the twenty gallons wuz eggsaustid I wuz very drunk, and incapable uv any effort, mental or physikle, and the others were in very J   THE NEW ESTABLISHMENT.       605 much the same predicament. Four or five uv em did try to rouse me to git more, but it wuz uv no,use; they mite ez well hev whispered Grey's elegy in the ear uv a dead mule. The most uv em slept, ez I did, on the floor till mornin. I shel be happy here. I hev the steddy patronage uv two Aldermen, three skool direcktors, and four contractors, and when the Mayor gits the appintin uv the poleece there will be twelve poleecemen whose trade I kin count on. There in my back room is where the preliminary caucuses fir the ward is held, and I shel be paid fur wat the managers drink till I git an offis myself. At last my lines is cast in pleasant places. PETROLEUM V. NASBY (wich wuz P. M.). CLXXXIV. MR. NASBY GIVES A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF HS NEW  ESTABLISHMENT. GTH WARD, Noo YonR, 1 December 22, 1869. S I AM perfectly and entirely happy; for I hev formed a num- ber uv deliteful acquaintances in this trooly grate city, wich makes my pathway pleasant and cheerful. I hev added to the decorashuns uv my bar portrates uv Sammlon P. Chase, Fernandy Wood, and Pendleton, one uv wich is shure to be our standard-bearer in the next contest, wich colleckshun I shel keep addin to ez I git the means. I hev a stiddy run uv trade, and I am seldom alone, which soots me exactly. But few men like to be -alone. A man is bad company for hisgelf, for he alone is the only one who knows percisely how cussed mean ho is. The two Aldermen who paternizes me pay ez they drink, wich paternage alone is almost suffishent to support me, ez they are conscienshusly industrious drinkers. They pay, not becoz they hev any particular prejoodis in that direckshun, but becoz money costs em nothin, and becoz, likin my face, they hev a desire to keep me'among em. One of em was pleased w  &#xD;<pb n="606-607" xml:id="VAC7107-00000327"/> 606         MR. O'SULLIVAN.               to compliment me yesterday. "Nasby," sed he, " that node uv yoors indicates more certenly yoor politicks than wat yoo   I say. The heart is deceetfu], and the tongue ofttimes speeks what the heart doth not prompt; the nose kin never lie. It's alluz safe to approach sich a nose with a cash offer to do dooty ez a repeeter. Two more hot whiskeys, and one for yoorself while yoo are at it." Isn't it a pleasure to mix drinks for one who combines shrewd knowledge uv human nacher, whiskey, and ready pay, in sich correct proportions? Uv course it is. But mv buzztmn friend is Terrence O'Sullivan, who is perhaps the most regular customer I hev. Mr. O'Sullivan is one uv the oldest Demom. crats in NToo York, it hevin bin three years sence he left Cork. It is not known wat he wuz before he left Ireland. Ther wuz a pockithook and a tvatcll mixed up in it, the pertickelers uv wich I never got. On his release, Mr. O'Sullivan perceeded to. wunst to Noo York, and commenst life ez a laborer on an excavashun on Broadway.   Forchunitly six weeks after he landed an eleckshun took place, and he immejietly got employ- ment ez a   repeeter. Doorin the war he was engaged in enlistin bisself under varius names fur the bounty, the monot- ony of wich ockkupashun he varied by occasional burglaries and operations in the street on intoxicated Western men. He   hez bin second and bottle-holder in many prize-fights, and hez an interest in two unpretendin faro banks and one lottery shop. Uv course Mr. O'Sullivan holds office. Hevin one hundred and sixty-three votes at his control, lie is skool direcktor, in- speckter uv Boa Constrictors in Central Park, clerk to three boards, and in addishen, hez a sub contract for street cleanin. Ez ther ain't no Boa Constrickters and no Boards, and ez the streets are never cleaned, why, Mr. O'S. hez a tolerable soft thing uv it, or wood hev were it not that he hez to divide his salaries up among so many. But, nevertheless, he lives com- fortably and happy. Mr. O'Sullivan hez a brother who is at this time an inmate uv the State Prison at Sing Sing, for highway robbery, and last Monday we went up to Sing Sing to -see him. We arrived jist ez the cgnvictd was a marchin in to dinner, and took posi.   MR. O'SULLTVAN'S BROTHER.      607 sheil where we cood see em, so that Mr. O'S. cood point out his unforchunit relative to me ez they passed. "There he is - good Hevins!" "Wat agitates you, my friend?"I asked.             "Look I " sed he, " the fourth man in the file." I saw at onct wat agitated him. His brother was the fourth man in the sixth file, and side by side with that brother, a white man, wuz--A NIGGER! both dressed exactly alike.  "u Hevins!" ejackilated O'Sullivan, " is this thing permittedl in the Democratic State uv Noo York? Hev we fought nig-        ger ekality at the polls so many years to hev it practised here,  ] in a Democratic State under Democratic offishss?" "And here, too, where only Democrats i3 degraded by it l" I put in. We sought out the Warden, and demandid that the infamous practis be changed. The Warden sympathized with us, but sed it coodn't be. There wuz no provision in the laws govern- in the prisons uv the State for keepin niggers separate. "Yoe see," he remarked, " it's only now and thenl that any uv thle degradid race git here, and there's no provision made fobr erm. It can't be helped." "Then," sed O'Sullivan, " do I understand that the Democrisy uv Noo York city is to be coxtinyooally threatened with nigger ekality?" "They are till the Legislacher changes it," retorted the Warden. , We left the prison shortly after that, Mr. O'Sullivan in -a most ,melankolly mood. "Nasby," sed he finally, after a silence uv perhaps half an hoor, doorin wich time he wuz plunged in the deepest thought, "Nasby, it's all up withl me. I shel never break into a house, or pick a pocket, or go through a drunken man agin. Wat I have seen to-day hez'determined me. I shel never agin take a chance uv goin to Sing Sing. Why, it mite be my forcloon to be put beside that nigger!" And a shudder uv ill-concealed anguish agitated his framne, and the strong man wept bitter teers. I comforted him ez best I cood. I told him that should he be arrestid fobr, say a murder, be tried and convicted, and sent to the penetenshary, and be forced to march side by side with  &#xD;<pb n="608-609" xml:id="VAC7107-00000328"/> 608         A RAY OF LIGHT.              5 a nigger, "the disgrace," I sed, " won't be yoors, 'twill be the infamous retches who put yoo there. If yoo shood, of your own free will, put yourself on a level with a nigger,- for in- f: stance, ef yoo shood buy of or sell to an Ethiopian, - then the if degredashen wood be yoors, for yoo mite hev asserted yoor  ? sooperiority. But in the case uv State's Prison, I reely think  yoo put too much stress onto it. In that case a sooperior power compels yoo to this, and yoo ain't responsible. Were I in yoor place-- bed I sich promisin prospecks ez yoorn--I don't    . think I shood permit this to stop me."    . But Mr. O'Sullivan wuz inflexible. He shood quit all prac- tices wich pinted in the direckshun uv a penetenshary, for it  would kill him to be compelled for a minit to eat, work, or walk beside a nigger, even tho he wuz compelled to do it. Then an idea struck me I Brilliant idees alluz do come to me precisely the rite time. "Why, yoo cussed jackass!" sed  : I, fallin onto his neck, " why do we talk uv this. Now that the Democracy hez the Legislacher, and will hev the control uv the I city in all its departments, no Democrat who hez a dozen votes i back uv him will go to the penitenshary. But few of em did afore, when the Ablishnists hed the poleece, but now that we hev Judges, poleece, and all-- why, my deer sir, the chances is ez one to a million. Go on with yoor burglary, my sweet Terence; go in and win, with no gaunt fear stalkin like a spectre behind yoo." Mr. O'Sullivan returned to the city with me, comforted, that is ez to hisself. But he is determined that the wrong shel be remedied. He declares it his purpose to    petishn to the Legislacher to pass an act makin seprit prizens for niggers, that Democrats uv the city may not be perpetooally menaced with the possibility that they may be compelled to assoshate with em; or wot wood be still better, they wood hev hangin made tte only punishment for niggers, wich wood finish the cusses to-wunst, and end all anxiety on their account. Sich a petition is now hangin in my bar, and I read it to all who cum in, and in no case hez any one uv em refoosed to make his mark onto it. This will be the first reform the new Legislacher will be called upon to make. PETROLEUM V. NASBY (wich wiz P. M.).    ! !    THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT.     '  609 CLXXXV.  THE FRIENDS OF MR.

THE passige uv the 15th Amendment by the Ohio Legis- lacher created a profound sensashen in this immojit visinity. The news' reached us in the afternoon, and that evenin'a large meetin wuz held in the back room uv my grosery to express our views on the topic, the elect uv the Democrisy uv the ward bein present. I wuz uv course called to the chair, and Tom- my tMick Farland, who wuz wunst a reporter, till an overpowerin   ' fondnis for likker preventid him from dischargirt lis dootie%, vad who, ez he kin write, hez since made a livin by actin ez Seklre 4 tary uv Dimekratic meetins in this ward, wuz made Sekretary. ' Terence O'Grath, who is an under waiter at the Astor House, remarked that his sole wuz filled with woe. The pas- sage uv the Amendment, by the Ohio Legislaclhor, settled tlio question uv nigger suffrage. From this time forward a menial race, only fitted by nacher to do menial offices for others, wood be placed on a ekality with him. It -wuz degradin to tho race uv freemen to wich he belonged, and for one he wood never, no, never submit. Mr. O'Grath wood hev continyood his remarks, but he wuz cut short by the entrance uv the head waiter, who cussed him viggerusly for bein away from Iris place, and ordered him instantly to leeve. "Who's brushin the gentlemen's coats, and pullin off their boots, and sich, while yoor here blatherin?" indignantly ejaclkilated the head man, ez Mr. O'Grath meekly left the room. Timmy Brannon, a drayman, roemarkt that ho wuz entirely discouraged. Only last week he lihoed bin arrestid and fined for beatin his boss over the head with a dray pin, and now kin nothin be dtn to check these outrages?

Mr. Phelim Mallov remarkt that so fir ez Noo York wuz con-' cerned he didn't know ez 'twood make any diffirence. He  wuz entirely shloor that no nigger wood ever vote in the Sixth  Ward, anyhow, ez we don't allow only sich white men to vote  ez ,we want to hev vote. But-- -' "But s'posen they'll all vote the Dimocrathic tikket?" sung  out an Alderman. "That wooden't (do us any good," retorted Mr. Malloy. "So long ez we kin repate ez often ez needs 1e, and stuff into the  boxes ez many votes ez we want, wat do we want uv more voters? What he wuz about to say wuz, tlat while it wooden't affect us in Noo York, his sole run out in pity towards the Dimocrisy in the Ablishen distriks, who wood be compelled to vote with niggers, - compelled to stan by helplis, and see the 'ballot-box tilus degradid."                 , At this pint there wuz a gincral expreshun uv joy, olkkashund r by the entrance uv Mr. Johln Sykes, who lied jist arrived froni Sing Sing, where he lied been incarcerated two years for bur-  glary, which wuz complicatid with shootin; the individjooel whose  house lie wuz burglin. Ilis bein convicted and sentenced wuz owin to the fact that he hed opposed the nominashen ov the Judge afore whom he wnz tried. Mr. Sykes wuz, uv course, indignant at the unfair treetment ihe had experienced, but he  wuz more profoundly affectid at the politikle sitooashen than he wuz at his privit wrongs. "Thunder I To think," sed he, "uv sicl a mass uv ignorence, vishusness, and crime bein ele-  wated up to us. Ef 'twant for some little matters connecti(d Jwith a half dozen hounse-b)reakins in ijunnun, I'd go back on the next steamer ez sails." And Mr. Sykes actilly wept. At this pint an unfortunilit difference occurred. Alderman O'Fallon wuz offerin ua resolooshenprotestin agin the assoshatin ,uv free men with the lower and more vish'us classes ez tendin to corrupt the sanctity uv the ballot, when Mr. Patsey Carney entered. "Pay me the money ye ,promised me for the tell votes I brot ye off the emigrant ship last fall, ye spalpeen!" !h   AN INTERRUPTION.        6" "I've paid it twice, ye blaggard ; and, be gorra, there wuz only nine uv em, and one uv them wuz; a legal voter, fobr wiclL yo lied no right to ask] pay for!" retortid O'Fallon. "To the divil wid yez!" remarlkt Carney, goin for him.  Uv course the entire meetin jined in the scrimage. It lastid twen- ty minits, resultin in the breakin uv every chair in the room, a two-gallonl jug, and twelve or fourteen heads. That relic uv Ablishen misrool, the Metropolitan Poleece, kum iin and stopt    ] the row, takin away ten lmen, nine uv wicll I knowd lied molloy 'in their pockets, wich, hed they stlayed an hour,JI shood liev got. It wuz exasperatin. Two uv my stiddy customers, who lied bin overcome early in the afternoon, and who lied jist got up out uv the straw    I which I keep in a room for the accommodashen uv sich, insistid  ] tliat they'd never consent to givin uv polittickle power to the degradid wretches. They felt that the very proposishen was a outrage. ' Besides," one uv em remarkecd, " waccckt fee ill the makin uv sicli an army luv new voters lhev upon the prico uv votes? Ef they vote at all-in this city they'll llev to voto with us. Will they immejitly dernmand their share uv the offi- ces? Imagine my bein arrestid for vagranc lby a nigger po- leceman!" And the very thought so shocklt him that he ruslit out into the bar-room and took a whisky strate, forgettin, in his excite- ment, to pay for it. Resolooshens were introdoost and passed, denounsin thel ackshen uv Ohio, and exhortin Noo York to stand firm in -her rescindin uv the ratificashn.

But yit I make no doubt I shel git along. My landlord will be a candidate for Alderman next spring, and he can't afford to bother me very much for rent, and I am bizy establishin a credit at half a dozen wholesale lickker stores. I shel worry along. PETROLEUM V. NASB' (wich wuz Postmaster). CLXXXVI. MR. NASBY IN A DESPONDENT FRAME OF MND.  "OOISVILLE (wich is in the State of Kentucky), I  February 9, 1870. 5i I DON'T know that reely there's any more yoose in livin on this earth. The Fifteenth Amendment is adoptid, and a nig-  ger Senator will take the seat in the Senit wunst okkepied by that marter, Jeffson Davis. It's about time for me to go hentz -I hev no desire to remane. I wood like to stay long enough to consoom the contents uv a red-headed barrel in the back-  room uv my blessid grosery in Noo York, into wich I hain't, ez  yet, put no water, and probably I will. I think I shel go horne, shut myself up in tihat back room, drink that partikeler barrel dry, and fall dead across it. Like Sardanapnlus, my kingdom being gone, my funeral pile shel be my throne.   A KENTUCKY CONFERENCE. t      613 I came on to Kentucky to aid by my counsel the Dilnocrisy uv that State in the present crisis. The niggrer Revel hcz a seat in the Senit uv the Yoonited States, and, uv course, no white Kentucky Dimocrat kin so degrade hisself ez to set in that body beside him. I expected, uv course, that Garret Davis and McCreery wood immejitly resine, and ez no native born Kentucky Dimocrat wood take the place, and ez Ken- tucky could not afford to be representid by a Ablishist, it okkurred to me that possibly there mite be a chance for me. I am a Northern Dimocrat by birth, and Northernl Dimocrats have alluz done sich work for the Southerners ez the Soutilh- erners countid too dirty for em. The only thing wicll cood stand in the way wuz the fact tlmat I left Kentucky a year lago, and am now a citizen of Noo York. But wat uv that? I kin swear I am a citizen uv Kentucky--I hev bin in Noo York politics enuff to be able to swear to anytiling. At all events I went on to my old State, and got together a caucus uv the Dimocratic members uv the Legislacher to con. sider this thing. The Chairman uv the caucus remarkt that the signs uv the times indikated trouble. Kentucky, ef that Inigger wuz ad- mitted to the Senit, wuz virclhually disfiranchised, for uv course Davis and McCreery cood not remain in their seats beside him. No Kentucky gentleman wood di:sgrace his proud State by practically takin to his buzzum a male member uv an iniferi- or race - acknollegin his equality), land workin quietly with him. Never! Sooner than see this lie wood bo willin to see the States further South inoggerate another struggle for tlheir rites, in the event uv wich, Kentucky, troo to theo Yoonyun, ez before, wood preserve a strict and dignified nootrality by sellin horses and provender impartially to both armies. He hoped the gentlemen wood express their views freely. A gentleman from the eastern part of the State offered the following preamble and resolushen:- "Wareas, The Senit of the Yoonited States is about to adtinit to a seet in that body a nigger; and, !"Wareas, No Kentucky Dimocrat wood degrade hisself by sittin beside a nigger; therefore, "Resolved, That Hon. Garret Davis be instructed to resino to-wunst."  &#xD;<pb n="614-615" xml:id="VAC7107-00000331"/> "4          TROUBLE. The resolooshuns passed to-wunst, without a dissentin voice,  and were sent by telegraph to the Senators at Washington, after wich I begged permission to offer a remark. I sed that - uv course no Kentuckian cood be fbund to take them places   ; made vacant by the two eminent men who wuz about to leeve the Senit, but nevertheless Kentucky coodent afford to go un- represented. Is there no Northern man uv Kentucky princi- pleS who will rush to the front at this crisis? Twenty gentlemen sprang to their tfet. The one who got    , the eye uv the chairman remarlt that Kentucky shood alluz be represented by Kentuckians. Davis and McCreery cleerly     I ought not to stay. They shood resine to-wunst ez a protest    agin this outrage, but ef Kentuckians cood be found who    . wood accept the places they slould be found. Takin em, ez they wood, ez a necessity, there woodent be the stigma attached to em that there wood be to the present incumbents ef they   - shood remane, and possibly sich mite be found.         . ' The Chairman doubted whether there wuz a Kentuckian     I who hed so little respeck for hisself. Ef a Kentuckian wuz   I selected, it should be from the membership uv the Legislaclher. He felt that it wuz the dooty uv some two uv em to sacrifice theirselves on the altar uv their State. It wood be a bitter degredashun fobr a man, filled with the memories uv the past, to choke down nateral pride, and take a seet by a nigger, but . some one must do it. He wood sojest that the members pro- ceed with system in this matter. Let "S designate, by ballot, our wishes. Let us vote for a man to fill the place to be made vacant by G. Davis, and let the member upon whllom tis dooty  devolves accept the sacrifice in the troo Kentucky sperit. Gentlemen, prepare your ballots for a successor to Davis, and ! get ready to shed a friendly teer over the fate uv the man upon whlom  the dogredashun fialls. This wuz agreed to, each member remarkin that no matter who wuz chosen, there wuz no law to compel him to be electid and set beside a nigger. The members each voted; the votes were counted out, and, horror! EACH MEMBER HED PRECISELY ONE VOTE, and the loosenis uv the hand-writin on the tikkits made it painfully certin that each member hed votid for Ilisself'! Ez-my hopes wuz bustid,   DISAPPOINTMENT.         615 I coodent help singin out that a more self-sacrificin body uv men I never saw! The n commenst the most fearful squabble I ever witncst. Gentlemen got by the ears, and pistols wuz drawd, but jist ez they were gettin ready for a sekkond ballot, a dispatcll wuz  received foiom Davis and McCreery, statin that while tlhey ap- preshiated the degredashen uv their sitooasahen, and felt it lceenly, nevertheless, ez Kentuclky must be represented in the Senit; they rather thought they woodent resine at all! Ef they knowd their own hearts they thought they'd hiold on to their seets. They might as well be sacrificed as anybody. The gentlemen mostly remarked  H-1-!" as this epistle wuz read to em, and disperst without the formality uv an ad- journment. I hevent ez much faith in Dimocrisy ez I yoost to lhev. I sposed that when that nigger wuz finally admitted, that evry Democrat in the Senit wood resine; but wat do I find? Not one hez done it, and -vllole Legislachers uv Democrats aro willin to take seats beside him I Wat kin we expect wlien men are so recreant to their man- hood? Is .it any wonder that I am tired uv life? I shol go home to Noo York to-wunst. PETROLEUM V. NASBY (wich wuz P. M.). CLXXXVII. THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT. HARP UV ERIN S'LOON, GTII WARD, ) 'Noo YORK, April 2, 1870. 1    I THE proclamation uv the President announcin the ratification uv the Fifteenth Amendment prodoosed a profound sensashen in this Ward. It wuz told to our people by a reporter uv a daily paper at "o'clock this mornin, and it got pretty well around among us *  &#xD;<pb n="616-617" xml:id="VAC7107-00000332"/> "6          A MEETING. '              ' by 3 this afternoon, wich wuz tollably rapid, considerin that ^- intelligence in this Ward hez to be conveyed orally. In the afternoon it wuz resolved that a meetin be held in the evenin i to consult ez to wat ackshen the Dimocrisy shood take in the ' matter, wich wuz akkordingly so done. I lied the backl room  : lit up, the barrels moved into a safe place under the strongest - kind uv locks, and the bar closed and draped in mournin in token uv the hoomiliashen wich I felt had fallen onto the peo- pile in conselkence uv this outrage. I hung eratpe onto the door; I put crape around the portraits uv -Jaxon, Chief Justis Chase, Bookannon, and Fcrnandy Wood, and likewise around   nI the bottles and over the red-headed barrel, wich gave the  establishment a highly funereal and mournful look wich wuz entirely satisfactory. In the evenin the Dimocracy assembled, and a more enraged gatherin I never saw. They wuzn't jist clear ez to wat the President hed done; indeed the most uv em wuz labrin under the impreshn that the enfranchisemenrt uv the nigger wuz tlhe work uv the Democratic Legislacher at Albany, and ther wuz indicashens uv a determinashen to go thro some of the houses uv the Dimocratic members in this city, but I stopt em by tellin em the strate uv it. I asoomed the chair, uv course, and hed, in addishen, to do the dooties uv Sekretary, bein the only one then in the meetin who cood write.                        i Teddy McGinnis remarked that he felt a hoomiliashen wich  wuz actooally beyond expreshen. The dirty nagur wuz now his ekal. The only difference between em hed bin removed   ! by this infamus law. Does any one spose that he'd iver consint to vote all clay beside niggers? Niver! HHe called upon the Dimocracy to jine him in a croosade agin em. "Fol- low me," sod Teddy, " and in Noo Yorrick, at least, we won't be bothered with nagur suffrage, be gorra." Pat McLaughn held simlar views. Sooner than vote beside nagurs, he'd relinquish the biznis uv votin altogether, and go to sawin wood. Repeetin is a good enuff biznis, and the small conthract wich he hed, ez a reward thereof, wuz betther, but he coodent stand nagurs, nor woodent. His voice wuz for killin uv em.    ACTION ARgW^TFD,     *   )7 The others made similar speeches, when Sandy McGuire offered a resolooshen that the offerin uv a vote by a nagur be considered ez a declarashen uv war agin the Democracy uv Noo York, and that they then be immegitly exterminated. Sandy wuz for no half-way measures. He remembered the glorious Jooly days in 1863, whl-en the Democracy uv Noo Yorlr assertid itself. He hed assisted in destroyin the nagur orpllhan asylum; witlh this good rite liand he hed beat out the brains uv two nagur-, to say notlina uv the 5wimin and children wichl he didn't consider worth countin. He longed to get at em agin. The meetin bein all so yoonanimus in their feelin, I wrote  the follerin resolooshens:- "Resolved, 'lThat the Dimocrisy uv Noo York, considerin and beleevin the nigger to be a beast, a burlesk on hooomanity, and incapable uv dischargin aLny uv the dooties uv citizenship, 1do hereby protest agin his bein give the ballot on an ckality with white men. "Resolved, That the Dimocrisy uv Noo York, ruthellr t lan submit to this degredashen, pledges itself to the extermin-i shen uv the accussid race." The resolooshens wuz adoptid without a dissentin voice, and the entlioosiastic McGuire, brandishin a sliillrala, rushhed out and attackt a couple uv niggers -wich wurz passin, anl Iklockin em down, stamped onto em vigro-usly with lfis boots, exclaimin tlhe whle, "Want to vote, do ycz!" Tlhe meetin wu2 about to break up, when Tim O'Grtady, a man uv Fernandy Wood's, come rushin in. He lied llcar( luv the meetin, and come immejitly to see about it. I told llim in a breatlh wat hed bin done. "Thunder!" lhe remarkt to me in a whisper, " this won't do. Yoo cggrejis old ass, tho niggers hev votes, and will vote now in spite uv us. Wo must git em, fobr without em, with alt thl relels disfi',nchised, wat kin we do in the Southern States? Call the meetin to order agin." I didn't like the tone uv his alloosion to me, but I called the meetin to order onct more. O'Grady remarked to em that there lied bin a misunderstand- in. He felt ashoored that the Dimocrisy uv Noo York, alluz  &#xD;<pb n="618-619" xml:id="VAC7107-00000333"/> "8 -       A NEW DEPARTURE. the friends uv the oppressed and down trodden, wood now  : genrously extend a helpin hand to our colored brethren jist  :  elevated to full citizenship. The Dimocrisy hed not assisted in their elevashen, but they hed no feelin agin our brethren   i uv color. When our colored brethren come to analyze the     i matter, they wood love the Dimocrisy the more for not doin uv  : it. He wood move the substitooshen uv the follerin resoloo- shen for the one wich hed bin unadvisedly passed: - "Resolved, That the Democrisy uv N00 York hail with a feelin uv pleasure Wrich we hev no words to express, the elevashen uv our colored 'ellow-citizens to full citizenship, and that we pledge ourselves to pertfect em in the enjoyment uv ther newly-fbund rites."                       - The meetin didn't want to pass it. The feelin agin em wuz too deep sot to be rooted out in a minit, but O'Grady wuz determined. O, wat a minit wuz that! Wuz the niggers to be killed by us, or wuz they to be taken to our buzzums. Ther f:te hung tremblin in the balance? Finally it wuz put  ; to vote, and the Riggers wuz safe. By one majority the reso. lushon wuz passed.                      ? At that minit a groan wuz heard outside.           r ' What is that," asked O'Grady.               j "Some nagurs I jist now bate t " remarks AMcGuire.     ? ' Beatin niggers!" sed O'Grady. "Good Lord, bring em in."  : And he rushed out and brought in the two unfortunates. They were badly banged up about the face, and breast, and    r stumick, and legs, but O'Grady wuz ekal to the emergency.    He washed their womnds, and revived em with whiskey, and    J bound up ther sores, and finally sot em on ther feet.     ' "McGuire!" sed he, when he hed the work finished, M' McGuire, embrace em."                    : McGuire hed his shillala in his hand. Never did I see a man  f so torn with contendin emoshens. Nateral instinks compelled him to drop that shillala on their heds ez usual, but the    ; politikle considerashens restraned him. Twict under O'Grady's  eye he lowered it, until at last he dropt it, and fell sobbin with emoshen onto their buzzums. I took the crape off the door, bottles, and picters, and immejitly illoominated in honor uv the event, and the next , I   .  rbl   AFTER THE ETHOPIAN.       G19 mornin I put up a placard at my door, "No distinkshen at this bar on account uv color. Ekal rites!" The ward committee is takin prompt and vigerous ackshen to secoor this vote. They hev adoptid the 5amne means they yoose to control ther othher vote. They hev already starltid ten s'loons, run by colored men, to wich they give all the profits, and are arranging ten more. There will be a nigger or two put onto the police th-wunst. The force will be increased cnul l'to make room for these new ones, ez we darsn't discharge anty nv the Irish. 9 I'm goin for em also.

HARP UV ERIN S'LOON, IN Till' SIXTI WARD,  1Noo Yoltc, April 12, 1870. THE Noo York World, in a recent ishoo, remarkt that tle Nigger-vote must come to us, becoz the Dimocrisy had alluz hed success in managin the ignerant and degradid classes. This determined us to set about sekoorin the vote uv the nig- ger populashen in our ward immejitly. Father McGrath in- sisted that it be done to-wunst, becoz the minit thelc become Dimokrats the way wuz paved for their comin unider tloe spor- itooal direckshen uv the Catholic Church; Timmy McGee in- sisted that it shood be done bocoz the element, ef opposed to us, mite become dangerous; Timmy O'Ryan, becoz we hed either to incorporate em into our ranks or kill em, and heo didn't beleeve it wood pay to raise another riot jist now; and. I wantid em attached to our party becoz I wantid em in front uv mriy bar reglerly. We decided that the shoorest way to git at em wood be to I,  &#xD;<pb n="620-621" xml:id="VAC7107-00000334"/> G60       AN ETHOPIAN SECURED, git one nigger interestid with us, who wood serve ez a decoy : duck to bring in the others. We wantid a nigger to assoshate with; to embrace and sich; to show other niggers that we  , cood and wood affilyate with em. We hed a terrible time a gittin uv it ,tartid, however. We got one uv that race in ray  back room, and attempted to argoo the questions uv the hour -  with him, confident in our ability to crush him by facts into submishen to our doctrines, but the mizable devil pulled out i uv his pockit a copy uv the Constooshn, and askt Teddy the : ? Lifter to read and constroo a sentence therein, which finishlt that pertikler effort. Teddy, and Patsy O'Roulke, and M:icky Doolan, who hed him in hand, startid back at the site uv that book ez tho they hed been shot. THE CUSS COOD READ, and  iiX wat cood any uv em do with sich a manl?  We caught a sick nigger, and hed him in tow three days.  - We nussed him, and fedl him, and hed in a doctor for him,  wich doctor give him medicine and Dimocrisy in ekal doses,  all uv wich lie seeminly gulped down with ease. We got him; on the skore uv gratitood, and he went away, promisin that heo wood jine us, but the second day he came back, and laid down on the bar twenty dollars, with the remark that that sum wood pay for all the cost and trouble we led been to on his  account.                          . "What do yoo mean?" sed I, sternly, sweepin the money into the drawer, however, to make sure uv that. Bustin into a paroxysm uv teers, he remarkt that ez low and I mean a nigger ez he wuz, he coodent reely jine us. It wuz un- : fair in ns, he sed, to take advantage uv his illness to put him under obligashens to us.  "I can't be a Dimokrat," he sobbed, claspin his hands pit- eously, "I can't, reely. I liev a gray-haired mother livin, and [ a youlnger sister! I can't I can't! for I'm spectably con-  nected!" And he rushed out. It wuz forchnit for him that I wuz  z^ alone at that time. All our efforts to sekoor a Ethiopian to our standard seemed to come to naught, and we wuz just on the confines uv despair,  when one mornin Johnny O'Shoughnessy came rushin in, ex-  claimin, "I've got it - I've got it!"           ; 2   AND PREPARED.         621 "Got wat?"I askt. "The nigger we want. In the Polece Court there's a ni-  ger up for drunkenness, vagrancy, steelin, assault and battery, and some other things, and ez lhe liezn't a blasted cent, uv      course he'll be sent tup in short metre. We kin git him shoor, ef we go about it quickly. I got the Judge to hold on a bit till I cood see you." To-wunst 1 seed a lite. Rushin frantically down to the court-room, I gave myself ez bail for his appearance, wich the Judge, wlio is a politikle friend of mine, acceptid, witlout question, and seezin the nigger by the coat collar, I hustled him off to my place in triumph. Tim Doolan spolke ulp. "Will yoo," sez Tim, " ef we get yoor discharge, promise to     alln7z vote the Dim-"       * "Hold!" sez I quickly, for I wuz afeerd Timrn's thoughtless precipitancy mite rooin all. "Ilold! He ain't in condishen to hev that question put to him. Wait a minnit. I understand wat's required to make a convert better than yoo do." And seezin a bottle from behind the bar I put it to his lips. The nigger drank with a eagernis wich gave me hope. Teddy spoke up agin,-        - "Will yoo promise to alluz vote-   '  "Hold!" sed I. "He hain't enough. Drink!" And the nigger emptied the bottle. "Now," sed I, "are yoo willin to promise to alluz vote the Dimocratic tikkit; to labor with your colored brethlren to bring em into the fold uv the Dimocrisy, and to do your level best to promote the interests uv the Dimocratic plarty, now and forever?" The nigger, by this time crazy drun1k (the liklker w-uz from my own private bottle and unwatered), swore that he would promise all this. 'a Gib me some mo' dat whiskey," lie shrickedjl. I gave him another bottle, and in fifteen minits lie wuz sleepin the deep sleep wich the tite man only Iknows. In about four hours he awoke, and I thought it time to ap. proach him on the main question. "( Ceezer," I remarkt, "you must commence yoor work to-      j nite. We shel git up a meetin uv colored men at this place     1j for the purpose uv organizin a Colored Democratic Club, and you must address em."  &#xD;<pb n="622-623" xml:id="VAC7107-00000335"/> 622         THE FAILURE. "Must I indoose em to jine a Dimocratic Club?" he asked. Certinly."  "Did I promise to do it?"  "Certinly," I replied; " and, my buck, yoo'd better keep that promise or I'll hev yoo back in the dock at the Polece Court in a jiffy."  I'll do it," sed he, with the desperate air uv one who hed i determined that life ain't worth livin for, and is, prepared for anything. "I'll do it. but I must hev likker enuff to drown my con-- wich is to say, give me nerve."            - "Certinly," I replied, "all the likker you want, but speek yoo must."                         ? The nite come, and there wuz a decent show uv niggers in =: the back room. But the speeker! Alas! he wuz too far gone to speek, and I hed to dismiss em.     . The next mornin he swore he never -wood do it; and to git him to the pint uv consentin I give him more likker, and he got drunk again, and so on it went, all the week. The fix we wuz in wuz suthin like this: 1. We coodent approach a nigger who hed any standin or inflooense. 2. When we capcherd sich a wun, he woodent hev anything  to do with us when he wuz soler; and to hold him, we hed to keep him drunk. 3. When drunk enuff to stay with us, he wuz too drunk to do wat we wantid. After sqinandrin on this poor wretch at least a half barrel of ez good likker ez ever soothed my shrinkin sole, I wuz corn- pelled to hev him re-arrested and sent up for a year or two. I coodent stand no sich drain on my finances,. nor cood I bear to see so much lilkker wastid on a nigger.           f The cuss took his sentence joyfully. "It's hard," he sed, "but it's better than wat yoo perposed." This nigger question is the problem uv the age. How it    will be solved puzzles me. 'May Heaven send us wisdom.    J; PETROLEUM V.

CONFEDRIT X ROADS  (wich is in the Stait uv Kentuclky ), May 12, 1870. ) POETS hev remarked a great many times, too tejus to enloo- merate, that " farewell " is the saddist word to pronounce wich hez to be pronounst. It may be so among1 poets, wicll lare spozed to be a continyooally carryin about with em a load iuv sadlis, and sensibilities, and sich; but I hev never found it so. Tile fact is, it depends very much on how yoo say it, under wat circumstances, and to whom. ' Wen, ill my ilnfancy, I wuz inkarseratid in the common jail uv tny niative villhge, in N0o Jersey, a victim to the prejudisis uv twelve men, who believed, on the unsupportid testimony uv tlhroe men, and tlio mere accident uv the missin property bein found in ny posscs. sion (notwithstandin the fact tlhat I solemnly asshoored eln that I didn't know nothin about it, and if I did i it, it must hev bin in a somnamboolic state), that I led bin guilty uv bustin open a grosery store, and takin twelve boxes of chc- root cigars, I asshoor yoo that, at the end uv the sentence,-  hevin bin fed oin bread and water,--the sayin of farewell to the inhuman jailer wuzn't at all on pleasant. Likewise, Vlwhen, in the State uv Pennsylvany , in the eggscitin campane luv 1856, I votid twict or four times for that eminent and1 gilelis patriot, Jeems Bookannon, and wuz hauled up therefor, and sentenced by a Ablishn Judge to a year in the Westerin Pell- itentiary, after an elokent speech, in wNich I reviewed tle whlole question at issue between the parties, and ashoored him that my triflin irregularity in the matter uv votin grew out uv an ovcrweenin desire for the salvashen of my beloved country, - that, feelin that rooin wuz alhead uv us, onless that leveler Fremont wuz defeated, I felt that my conslience wood not be easy onless I did all in my power to avert the evil, when I emerged fi'om them gloomy walls, with one soot of  &#xD;<pb n="624-625" xml:id="VAC7107-00000336"/> 624    .

Nary. These two instances, I beleeve, is the only ones in wich I  hev ever hed to say farewell. In the course uv my long and  checkered career (I do not here allood to the style uv clothin in the Penitentiary), I am, when I think uv it, surprised at  : the comparatively few times wich I ever left a place at wich I !!? hed bin stayin, in daylite! I ginerally went in the nite,-  : "Foldin my tent like the Arab, And ez silently steelin away,"  hevin too much sensibility to be an onwillin witnis uv thle agony of landladies, when they diskivered that I cood not  pay. Knowin the softnis uv my heart, I hev alluz led a great i regard fbor my feelins. I bid my readers farewell in a period uv gloom rarely   .  elkalled, and never surpast, for the Democrisy. Never in my  : recollelkshun wuz the party in sich a state uv abject cussi- [ tood. The Northern States have slipt from onr grasp one by  ; one, ontil none remains wich we kin fondly call ourn. The Border States are losin their Dimocrisy, and rallyin under the  black banner uv Ablishinism; and the States which we kin  control lhevent got strength enuff to do any more than to send i a few Senators and Representatives to Congress, wich don't do nIs no good. They are very like the itch, --they- irritate, but don't kill. The Fifteenth Amendment is now a law, and the nigger     ; votes. THE NIGGER VOTES! Ther ain't no doubt about it.  The Dimocrat uv Kentucky, uv Ohio, uv Noo York, and Inje- any must, firom this time hentzforth and forever, go to the poles - beside niggers, and must stand by calmly, and put his ballot into the box beside theirn! Wat degredashen! Lovejoy wuz  I; killed in vain, and the mobbins uv Garrison, and Baily, and  i the other apossels uv Ablishnism goes for naught.

A LECTURE DELIVERED  AT MUSIC HALL, BOSTON, DEC. 22, 1867. WE are all descended from grandtathers. Nearly a century ago the grandfathers of some of us, in convention assembled, uttered as doctrine, which they believed could not be gain. sayed, these words: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." Thomas Jefferson was the particular grandfather who wrote these high-sounding words, and, as a consequence, he has been ever since hailed as the father of the only political party which never believed in them. My particular mission is to show that Jefferson was a most shallow person, which opinion of Jeffer- son is very general in the Soutl. True, the Democracy claim him as its father; but when we remember that the same party claim Jackson, the strangler of secession, as another father, we can easily see how that can be. We have claimed these men as ancestors only since they departed this life. Should they rise from the dead, and be blessed with a view of their reputed  ! sons, particularly the branch of the family that has faken up its residence in the city of New York, they would, I doubt not, hold up their hands in horror, and exclaim, "It's a wise father who knows his own child." It was well enough for Jefferson to assert the equality of  men before there was profit in inequality; but had he been really a prophet, he would have done no such thing. In his 629  &#xD;<pb n="630-631" xml:id="VAC7107-00000339"/> 630     HOW THE DECLARATION SHOULD READ. day Slavery was unprofitable, and, consequently, not the holy ( thing it has been since. The slaves were burdens instead of; I aids, for the planters were compelled to provide fobr them.; The hogs ate the corn, and the negroes ate the hogs, leaving  the poor owners only what they left. But happily there came a change. An ingenious Yankee invented the cotton gin,     :r slave labor became valuable, and, presto! the doctrine of theJ equality of men was consigned to the limbo for worn-out and useless rubbish, and Jefferson went out of fashion. Had he been really desirous of' being held up as the prophet of the people who afterwards claimed him as such, we should not have had the forcible sentences I have read. He would have   p, diluted them into something like this: "We hold these sup- posed truths to be tolerably selfl:evident, that, as a rule, all  white men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with divers and sundry rights, which may be con- sidered inalienable; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of --  niggers!  It will be observed that the two Declarations differ some- what. One is as Jefferson wrote it, and the other is the ver- sion we use at Confedrit X Roads. Jefferson was in fault in his lack of appreciation, and strange omission of the word" white." The same omission is painfully observable in all the literature of the world. I have searched faithfully the realms of poetry and history, and am compelled .  to acknowledge that nowhere outside of the Constitutions of certain States is the word " white'" made a necessary prefix to the word 1 man." And against' this I protest. Literature should conform to law, and to the great Caucasian idea. The. term employed to designate responsible beings in the Constitu- tions of our States being " white male/' I insist that we go through all our books, and substitute " white male" for " man " wherever the word occurs. Thus we shall make Sir Walter Scott say,-S "Breathes there a white male, with soul so dead."  Addison shall say, in Cato,-  "When vice prevails, and impious white males bear sway, 5 The post of lhonor is the private station." ,           g   AND THE BIBLE.           631 In lacheth, the murderers sl[ll saey-- W"We are white males, my liege." And Macheth shall answer,-- '"Aye, in the catalogue ye go for white males." And Othello, before the senators,- Slhe swore, i' faith, 'twas str-an,e - 'twas passing strange; - "I'was pitiful; 'twas wondrous pitiful. Slhe wished she had not lieard it, yet she wislied That Heaven had lalde her such a white miale." But in the Bible the improvement would shine out in a clearer and stronger light. In our Caucasian-our white mell's Bibles--we shall lhave such words as these':- 1 Samuel 13 :141,-  "A white male after his own heart." 2 Samuel 12: 7,- "And Nathan said unto David, Thou art the white male." Psalms 37 : 37, - "M-ark the perfect whkte m\le, tanl behuold the upright for tie end of that white .male is peace."  "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, and thy ,white male fellow-citizen as thyself." And in the mouth of our Saviour we shall put these words: -- "Suffer little white children to come unto ue, and forbid them not, for of sulch is the kingdom of heaven." This passage would be especially grateful to us of Kentucky, showing as it would that the distinction between thh races would be kept up through all eternity. But, unfortunately, the -Books do not so read. The    American people, when slave labor became of value, forsook Jefferson, put the word ' white " into their laws, and painted the word " nigger " on their ban. ners, which word has been a political Shibboleth ever since. It is this Niggor which we shall investigate to-night. I am the more anxious that the people shall understand the nature of this being, and the absurdity of the attempt to elevate him into manhood, for the reason that an effort to that. end is now being made.   The insane agitators, who deny the truth of Kentucky theology, are resisting us in our efforts to put him in his old place. In the face of our desires, they insist upon  &#xD;<pb n="632-633" xml:id="VAC7107-00000340"/> 632        "NIGGER "AND NEGRO.

' Upon the 957th page of the Dictionary you will find thle word " negro " defined as follows: ', One of the black, woolly. headed, thick-lipped, flat-nosed race of men inhabiting Africa."  The Negro of the Dictionary is not the individual of whom I  shall speak. The Negro I know nothing about; the Nigger  I [have spent much time in investigating, and flatter myself I ; understand it thoroughly. I say it of the Nigger, and him of : the Negro, for there is a wide difference between them. The Negro is a man, born in Africa, or descended from natives of' that country; the Nigger is an idea, which exists only in thle imagination of persons of the haughty Caucasian race resi- dent in the United States. It is an idea which sways men, and influences their action, without having being; a myth,i which influences the world, without possessing form or 'shape. It is possessed of many attributes, is many-sided, many-shaped, vastly endowed, and feaffully and wonderfully made. To clear , up as I go, I may as well specify some of the peculiarities of' , the Nigger. For instance, it is firmly believed that he could I' never provide for himself; but those so contending, also de-; clare that the wealth of the country is dependent upon him, and that without him weeds would grow in the streets of our cities. It was asserted that he would not labor; yet the same men undertook the large job of conquering the North, that they might continue to enjoy the fruits of his labor. He was said to be so stupid as to be incapable of receiving even the rudi- ments of an education, and yet we found it necessary, in our States, to pass stringent laws, with fearful penalties attached, to prevent him from doing it! It was held by eloquent speakers that he would invade the North, and, as he was too indolent to work, he would fill our almshouses and jails; and the same speakers would assert a moment later, with equal eloquence, that, accustomed as he always had been to labor, he would work for less pay than white men, and tlroxw them all out of employment. This last assertion, I have noticed, was always made by gentlemen in the vicinity of bar-rooms, whose noses  I were solfbringhued, whose hats were crownless, and whose    THE HATERS OF NIGGER EQUALITY.     633 wives, for amusement probably, took in washing to feed the children. It is an unfortunate fact for us, that men who labor earnest have never been afraid of the competition of the Nigger. Lower down in the scale of creation than the baboon, they were fearful he would, if not restrained by law, teach their schools, sit as judges, and be elected to Congress; so repulsive in appearance had they painted him, with his thick lips, black face, and kinky hair, that the very thought of one would make a white damsel shudder; nevertheless they demanded the enactment of laws in States where women may choose their husbands unrestrained, to prevent these same white damsels from marrying them. Immeasurably beneath them in every particular, they felt called upon to perpetually cry, "Protect us from nigger equality I " - and so on. Jefferson's fault was the result of a lack of knowledge. Ho knew all about the Negro, but nothing about the Nigger, and it was well for him, therefore, that he lived in the year of our Lord 1776. Had he lived ninety years later, and enunciated the same doctrine, we should lhave shot him, as we did Love- joy. Were he alive now, lie could not have been elected to Congress in the district represented by the Hon. John Mor- risey I No, indeed! The gentlemen who'left their native soil because of the scarcity of this equality (and of potatoes), the men who would have been carpet-baggers but for the lack of carpet-bags, --those who have kindly taken charge of tho politics of several of the Atlantic cities,--these men are the sharp sticklers that the distinctions between man and man which drove them from- the land of their birth be kept up here. Their motto is, "One man is as good as another;" but when their eyes rest upon a blacik man, they very properly add, "and better too!" This class have cultivated suchl a delighltful hatred of the Nigger that they won't even drink with one, unless, indeed, the Nigger pays for the fluids. This makes some difference. And that this distinction may be kept up, we have interpolated into Jefferson's Declaration the word "white," and assert, vehemently, that both Scripture and science, of which we know much, justify the interpolation. In Kentucky, we don't take the Declaration of Independence as i we do our whiskey, straight, but we sweeten it to our taste. &#xD;<pb n="634-635" xml:id="VAC7107-00000341"/> 634        THE AFFAIR OF NOAH.  We have all the passages of Scripture relating to it at our tongues' end. At the Corners, you can hear at any time those whose appearance hardly denotes erudition, whose noses    I blossom as the lobster, whose hair asserts impatience of' re- straint by obtruding itself through- the corners of their hats, whose toe* maniftet themselves through their ventilated shoes,  and to whose perpendicularity posts are necessary, exclaim, i unctuously, "And Noer planted a vineyard, and drank of the wine, and was drunken. Cussid be Canaan."  Having dwelt as long as is profitable upon the attributes  : of this interesting being, I pass to an examination of his origin. It is found in the 9th chapter of Genesis. Tile world, sunk in wickedness, was destroyed by a flood. But it was not  the design of the Almighty to exterminate the race. I will' not stop here to argue whether it would have been better to have made clean work of it or not. I was in New York a few  J weeks ago, and thought, perhaps, it would. .Be that as it  . may, one family he preserved in an ark, and when the tempests that had wrought His judgments had subsided, and the puri- fied earth was again fit for the occupancy of man, this fiamily A left their floating home, and went out upon its face. The Book gives a short, though satisfactory account of what fol-A lowed. Noah, six hundred years old at the time, having seeni nothing but water for nearly twelve months, wanted a change. lie planted a vineyard, pressed the grapes, drank the wine therefrom, and was drunken; which was a very indiscreet per- formance for one at his age. Had he been a mere infant of one or two hundred years, it wouldn't have been so singular, but a mature man of six hundred ought to have known better. It  has always been a mystery at the Corners how Noah could become inebriated on so thin a drink as new wine. Deacon  Pogram remarked that Noah wuzn't a seasoned vessel. In  that condition he lay down within his tent' with insufficient clothing upon him. As it was in the beginning, so it is now, and ever shall be. To this day the man who drinks will sooner or later get down with too little clothing upon him. Ham, his youngest son, saw him, and laughingly told his brethren. Shem and Japheth reproved Ham for his levity, and took their garments upon their shoulders, and going back-i I *                 7,   WHO ARE WHTE MEN.        635 ward, laid them upon him. When Noah awoke, he knew what Ham had done, and he cursed him in tlhese words: "Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall lie be unto his brethren." Upon this one act of our common father hung momentous results. That one draughlt of wine set in motion a succession of events that affected the fate of the greatest inationl of tIh world, in all conceivable ways, from the election of constables to the fighting of great battles. For in that cup of winle whas Democracy, - then and there it was born, and that cup of wine gave that party its Nigger--all the capital it ever had. The temperance people tell us thlat in'every cup of wine tlhre is a devil; in this cup you will acknowledge there was a large and particularly lively one. The drinking of this wine, and the drunkenness that it pro- duced upon the inexperienced Noah, was the cause of a divis- ion of the human race into two classes,--wlhite men and niggers. Under the head of white men, we class the red      J marl of' America, with his aquiline nose, coppery complexion,    and straight hair; the Mongolian, with his olive-colored skin,  .I black hair, and flat nose; the Caucasian, with his fair corn- plexion, hair of all colors, and features of all shapes; the Celt, I with his variable features; and - Democrats. A Democrat is     , counted a white man, no matter what his complexion may be;     i no matter what the color of his hair - or nose. All the rest of the human family - and Radicals - we set down as Niggers. To the wlhite race we ascribe all the glory of the Southl--to   : the others nothing. This elevation of the whito race, and consequent degrada- tion of the blackl, i- justified by the felw of us 1wh1o rlead thle Bible, by the sin of Ham; though, by the way, we ihave nlotl- ing to say in particular of the sin of Noah, whichl precedded and led to it, Noal's sin being one that we are compelledl,  for obvious reasons, to look upon with much leniencyv. To be frank, I have never believed that poor Ham was faiirly dealt with, I have always pitied Ham. He was, doubtless, a great, good-natured fellow, with a keen appreciation of the ludicrous, and was vastly amused at the condition of his sire. Drunkenness was not so common in' that day as to excite dis- gust ; and as he saw the old navigator on his back, his face  &#xD;<pb n="636-637" xml:id="VAC7107-00000342"/> 636      THE ORIGIN OF THE NIGGER.,  twisted with inebriety, his snores waking the echoes, and the walls of his tent swaying from his hard breathing; he doubtless thought he had, as the slang-users of this day would say, " a, good thing on the old man."                  : But if it was a laughing matter with the foolish Ham, it was not so with the shrewd Shem and Japheth. They pierced the future. To get into the good graces of their father, they - turned their backs upon his sin and folly (as we do nowadays  upon the sin and folly of those firom whom we want favors),  and, precisely as we do, cast over his sin their garments. The only parallel to this we have in modern times occurred in  Washington a few years ago. Andrew Jo1inson was very      . much in the condition of Noah upon one memorable 22d of    i; February, and a small army of patriots, who had assessorships, post offices, and collectorships in their eyes, made haste to cast their garments over him. But they did not succeed in cover- ing him. Noah awoke, and in the ill-humor which alwjaysk follows excess, cursed poor Ham, and condemned his son Canaan to be the servants of his uncles forever. This was the beginning of Democracy. Drunkenness brought exposure,  exposure shame, shame a curse, and thus cursed, Ham went out a Nigger. Drunkenness made Nigger, Nigger made      rin Democracy, and the two have been running the machine ever since.                           We have now plainly before us the origin of the Nigger, and have, therefore, a starting point for our investigations. Hecre were three brothers, Slhem, Ham, and Japheth, with a  curse upon Ham, condemning his children to serve the others. We, the whites, claim to be the descendants of the other two,  and consequently assert the right to own and work the chil- dren of our unfortunate uncle. The claim is a comfortable  one. Labor is something all men dread; and if it can be  positively fixed that Noah did curse Ham, and that he spoke . : by authority, and that the negro is really the descendant of  Ham, and we are the descendants of Japheth, we have really a good thing of it. We of Kentucky have always desired to fuilfil the great law of labor, as our particular friends at the North served in the army- by substitute. One cup of wine, and a curse after it, made a difference in the history of the world.  ,    k   WHAT MGHT HAVE BEEN.       637 How differently history would have been written had Noah started a temperance society at the beginning, or had thle Maine liquor law been in operation in that country. Or had 1he  taken up any other branch of agriculture! Had lie planted corn instead of grapes, or gone into sheep or poultry; had a  frost blighted his grapes, or a mildew struck them, or had the  i screw of his press broken; had any one of' these things hap- pened, he would not have become inebriated; Ham would not have seen him; there would have been no curse, no Nigger, no Democracy. For who can imagine a Democracy Nwitlout a      B Nigger to be kept in subjection! Or, suppose that all of .famn's children had died of diphtheria! H-Iad any one of these things t happened, the whole course of political events would have been changed. We never should have seen at political nmeetings in   1 the West, wagon-loads of' ancient females, with banners over their venerable heads, and inscribed thereon this agonizingly  ii touching appeal: "Fathers, protect us from negro equality!"  , as though they were not old enough, as a rule, to protect them- i selves. Or, this heroic declaration: "WlIite husbands or    j none!" which, talken in connection with their age and single condition, would indicate tlhat if they had ever had offers they . must have come from black men. In the East, the gentlemen    j who sent the Hon. John Morrisey to Congress from New York,    i i would have been spared the crimes of arson and murder, for   I there would have been no nigger orphan asylums to awaken     i their righteous indignation; no adult male niggers to hang to  j lamp posts. But as any one of these things would I1avo      ' changed the complexion of affairs, and prevented the unfortu-  I nate change in Ham's complexion, and as they did not happDen, we are bound to admit that Providence intended the negro to   i be kept down, and in -the eternal fitness of things, arranged for an organization to keep him down.                \ This curse?is the great pivotal fact upon which American politics has turned for years. But we fbund many diffliculties in it. The first difficulty which occurred to me, is the ftict  that all of Ham's children did not suffer in consequence of their father's little indiscretion. It ought to have fallen upon all alike, but it did not. Nimrod was a descendant of Ham, but lhe was not the servant of anybody/very much.

He was a mighty hunter before  the Lord; and mighty hunters have never been servants. The    : man strong enough to struggle with the lion and to overcome the tiger, and brave enough to dare the dangers of the chase for the fierce delight it affords, is not the man to humbly hump his shoulders, and to a mere man say that most hateful of all words,  "Master." Besides, Nimrod built cities and established king. doms, which is not the work of servants. We were forced to the  conclusion, therefore, that the curse held to Canaan only ; that Nimrod's children mingled with the sons of Shem and Japheth,t ,and that their descendants are to-day whllite men. This troubles  us; for, counting it a truth, we were associating with those HK having the blood of the cursed Ham in their veins; and besides, if one of the descendants of lHam escaped the curse, may not others get out from under it at the same place? Again;   . if the negroes of Africa, from which country we procured the stock we are blessed with, are really the descendants of  Canaan, the son of Itam, the curse which Noah imposed uponi them lost its adhesive power for many centuries. The breth-? ren separated, and each went about his business. I have; spent sleepless nights upon this question, but I must confess that I can find no proof that Canaan, or any of his descendants, were, until a comparatively recent date, the servants of any. body! Can it be that the curse was as temporary in its effects as the wine that produced it? Did it evaporate with the fumes thereof? Did it pass away with Noah's headache the   next morning? Did Noah make over to Shem and Japheth  property for which he had no title?  Unfortunately Sliem's descendants are said to have stayed in  Asia, HTam's went to Africa, and Japheth's peopled Europe. Here is the difficulty that besets me. How could Iamn's de-  scendants serve their brethren, they staying in Africa, while. the brethren were comfortably establisled in Europe and Asia?  It may be answered that they went after them; but, alas!  they had no need of that. The strong Shemites found enough,  weak Shemites to enslave without going after their cousins,  and the same is true of the Japllethites. The Tartars made servants of the Chinese, the Normans of the Saxons, and the  Romans had a cheerful habit of gobbling up all the weaker peo.   MORE DIFFICULTIES.        639 pie within their reach. Among these, I regret to say, were the ancestors of those before me - your fathers and mine. The curse was in existence, and had power, but somehow it was demoralized. When Noah fired it of-, it missed its aim. It scattered like a poor shot-gun, and hit where he did not intend  ; it. For in all ages of the world slavery has existed. There never h1as been a time when strong nmen were not too lazy to work; never a time wlhen there were not brutes and imbeciles    4 - the two classes necessary to the system.  The strong      I enslaved the weak without regard to Noah. They did it in a man ly way, too. Tile enslavers did not ask the person they    wished to enslave for their family record; they did not attempt to ascertain whether or not .le was descended from Canaan. Not they. If they wanted a servant, they sought out a man     i weaker than they; they knocked him down, in the old-fash- ioned way, with a club; they beat him till the original man was pretty much pummelled out of him, and then, reduced to the condition of a beast, he was the individual they desired. History is full of these instances, and Jefferson liad this ]kind of history in hismind when lie wrote the Declaration ;' which would lhave been well enough had lie put the word " white " in its proper place, that there mightt be no doubt as to his meaning. As lie left it, it applies to black as well as white, and strictly construed robs us of our Nigger. We could never find any testimony in the Scriptures tleat the dusky sons of Africa were the descendants of Canaan; and this is another difficulty. To be a servant, as our people understand it, one ought to be an inferior; and we held that the negro was our inferior, and ought to be our servant, be- cause of' the curse. Beliold the snag upon which our boat runs. Our conservative bre thren oppose the cWon{ering of ,nmy rights upon these people, because we dread the su2remacy of the negrol That sweet boon to an oppressed people, Andrew Johnson, in his ,annual messages, always devoted a chapter to the danger of this race taking possession of the government, and conducting it themselves; and I am not certain but that I have seen the same fear expressed in the reports of Secretary Welles, as he said re'gularly whatever the  &#xD;<pb n="640-641" xml:id="VAC7107-00000344"/> "O       THE EXTENT OF THE CURSE, . President has said. Seward once dwelt upon it at length, but I do not like to quote him. The distance from Abraham      i Lincoln to Andrew Johnson was so great, that the leap from, the one to the other broke his moral back. He has never^ stood upright since. The friends of the race jeeringly say that 5 if the negroes should take the government in their own hands, they hope they will conduct it to better advantage than the  : late President has, for if they do not, it would prove to the  satisfaction of everybody that the curse was a reality, and that  they are not fit, as yet, to be intrusted with political rights.  Now we have in the United States four millions of these people, all told, and thirty millions of whites. It is as certain ? as the multiplication table that if laws are necessary to prevent them from governing us, they must be the superior and we the inferior race. If, in a clear field, the four millions can con- I. trol the thirty millions, it must certainly be because of the superiority of the four millions. It troubles us to reconcile this pet fear of ours with our claims of superiority.     r I have never been able, from the Book, to determine just how far that curse extended. Noah's words were, "Cursed be, Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren." I ask especial attention to the wording of this text, as it  l affords a complete justification of the practice of amalgamation, so common in the South under the old system. The Canaanites iwere condemned to be servants unto their brethren. Not unto  the stranger, but their brethren. Hlow, except through thiis, let me ask, could the slaves of the South be brethren unto their masters? But we have full faith that the curse was intended to include not only Canaan, but his descendants. If it was only to cover Canaan, and was- to die with him, of what use would it have been to us? Had it died with Canaan, we   ! of Kentucky would have been doing our own work to-day, and  we might have put on its tombstone the epitaph written for the . kitten which died too young:'  "If I was so soon to be done for,       [ What was I begun for?"  It may be well here to consider briefly the question of color,  which has worried and perplexed all of us. We are white, or   THE QUESTION OF COLOR.       641        copper-colored, and the negroes, such of them as stated at the North, are black. The question is, "Why black?'  Olie theory is, that color is the result of climate, diet, habits of life, and other conditions, whllich, persevered in for many generations, will change the appearance of families of men. The people 0 of my State know better. They ascribe it to the curse of Noah; that Ham, being the brother of Shem and Japlheth, vaxs originally white, even as they were, but tlat he went out fromn the presence of his father witlh this mnark of his displeasure, not only upon his face, but spread all over his body. The very name to us is significant of color. The curse changed at once his physical nature, and the change took place suddenly. When Ham got to his room that morning, and gazed at himself in his  mirror, he called, in astonishment, for Shem and Japhoth, that lie might be introduced to himself. Noah, wlen lie changed Ilam's style and shape, had doubt- less a glimpse of the future, and he made of him precisely tlho kind of' man thllat the future required. As Ihe was to be the menial of lis brethren for all time, he considerately gave himn a cotmplexion suited to his condition ; one that would not show v dirt. To further fit him for the disclarge of the duties that  were to be his, his nose was flattened, that it could never be turned up in scorn at anything his a rm is  were elongated, lis shoulders were broadened, his forehead was driven backward, and his hair, long and straight like ours, was converted into wool, that lie should waste no timo in dressing it, and a1.o thatl; we, his masters, might have a better hold for our fingers. These are the physical characteristics of the race in Amnerica, and we affirm tlhat the negro must and ought to be a slave, because the Almighty, working through Noah, made hn exactly of the shape and style necessary to that condition. There may be a mistake here.. It- is possible, as I once heard a philosophical son of Ham say, that those wlho hold these views have been all along mistaking their own work for the Almighty's. He had the impudence to say that it waas possible that when the first negro was landed uponl our shores he was neither flat-nosed, long-heeled, or large-handed. He' was, however, forthwith set at work grubbing lald in Virgillia; llis nose was being continually flattened by the ficst of hi, "  &#xD;<pb n="642-643" xml:id="VAC7107-00000345"/> "2      THE SHAPE OF THE NIGGEB.  chivalrous master; his shoulders were broadened by the bur- dens piled upon them; his hands were widened by constant holding of the hoe, and his heel was providentially lengthened ;: to enable him to maintain his equilibrium under the loads he was compelled to carry. Had they been shorter, he would, when overloaded, have fallen backward. His receding fore. head he accounted for in this way: "Of what use," said he, "t would a head shaped to hold brains be to one who had no  brains to hold? and why should he have brains who has no occasion to use them?" But I noticed that this particular  nigger, who had learned to read and write, had a head shaped very much like those of ordinary people of intelligence, and  that his chiltlren, who could not only read and write, but cipher, were still more so. He had put out his one talent to usury, and it had become ten in his descendants. We of the  South feared this. We would not fly in the face of the Lord on any account. Zealous to fulfil his word, and determined  that for his glory Canaan should forever be a servant unto hisf brethren; and fearful that if they should gain knowledge they might give the Lord the slip, and be their own men, we with. held knowledge from them. Piously, therefore, we enacted laws making the teaching of these foreordained slaves to read the sacred word of God a penitentiary offence. And in our determination that they should not be unfitted for their destiny, we did hang very many meddlesome Yankees who doubted it all, and proposed to do something towards elevating them above the condition of beasts. In those happy days,f south of the Ohio River, it only required twenty minutes of time to arrest, try, lhang, and divide the clothes of a Northern  school teacher. And when one of these Noah cursed men  demonstrated, by opposing the will of his master, that he had brains, the matter was pleasantly and peremptorily settled by H knocking them out. A great deal of brain has been thus  disposed of in the Southern States. Another trouble that besets us, is the fact that the curse  remained inoperative and in abeyance for centuries after it was  pronounced. The children of Ham, it is supposed, occupied Africa all by themselves. They fell, as did their cousins in Europe and Asia, into vice; their vices being just as much ; I;S   THE MATTER OF HEAT.        643 more detestable than those cultivated by their cousins as the climate of their country is hotter. Vice, like vegetation, attains its greatest perfection in hot climates. The farther south you go, the less orthodox you find mankind. Vermont, where man wrestles with Nature, and wrests a subsistence from an unwilling soil by main strength, has never faltered in her devotion to humanity. Louisiana, on the other hand, where Nature yields her trieasures at the asking, is as true to the Democracy as the needle to the pole, or the Kentuckian to his whskey: two examples of fidelity equalled by nothing else in this world. Where men find a living ready made, they have too much time upon their hands to be good. The T'en Com- mandments have but little chance where labor is unnaecssary. Had South Carolina been blessed with a month of sleighing each year, she never would have passed an ordinance of seces- sion. No climate less hot than that of Mississippi could develop such a man as Jeff Davis; and Salisbury, Ander- sonville, Belle Isle, and General Fwrrest were only possible where the thermometer stands at one hundred for months together. It may be, indeed it has been said by a fbw soldiers who survived Andersonville, that the heat in which the men I have mentioned, exist, was not meant to affect the moral natures, but was intended by a kind Providence, who foreknew their destination, to prepare them, in some slight measure, for the still greater heat to which they are certain to be subjected in the future. The Japhethites harried, murdered, and plundered each other in Europe, and the Shemites fell to a still deeper depth of barbarism, as did our African brother. In Europe the Japhethites built large castles, and rode about upon horses, clad absurdly in cast iron, with inverted pots upon their heads, killing each other with iron spears, and the Africans were doing the same things, on a smaller scale, with spears pointed with fish-bones. But the sons of Canaan had not been as yet introduced to the curse, unfortunately. There were slaves in Africa, but they were slaves not unto Japheth's children, but unto them- selves, precisely as the children of Shem and Japheth en- slaved men of their own race. When Caesar conquered a  &#xD;<pb n="644-645" xml:id="VAC7107-00000346"/> "4          LOCATION. nation at war with Rome, he made slaves of his captives; and  when Gumbo Quashee, prince of Borriaboola Glha,led his hosts of warriors against a neighboring king, -he dragged back captives in his train, who were at once enslaved. If Gumbo  met defeat, the only difference was, he took his turn at the- mill. The enslaved have always been the victims of a curse, not of the drunken Noah, bug of that more terrible .curse, weakness. There is another ugly point in this matter of the curse that , is hardly worth referring to, but it may be as well. The fact is (and this hurts us), the Africans, the woolly-headed, thick.  lipped, dark-skinned, Africans, of whom we have made' slaves : under the curse, are not the descendants of CanDana, upon whom the curse fell, at all. Unfortunately for us, who have risked our all upon this, the Scriptures are explicit upon this point. Canaan begat Sidon and Heth, and their descendants were the :. Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, and - sights of other tribes. The Book tells us precisely where they are located.  Too lazy and shiftless to move any distance, they pre-empted f the ground upon which Jerusalem stands, their territory includ- ing those New Yorks of the old world, Sodom and Gomorrah. They were not a nice people to have for next door neighbors.  They had many disagreeable habits.  They were a comrn- pound of Brigham Young and Kidd the Pirate, and it is sup.-  posed that Salt Lake City and New York were modelled after   their principal towns as near as may be. It will be remem- bered that these two cities, Sodom and Gomorrah, came to a   sudden end.                         - Notwithstanding the love I bear the metropolis, because of ! its politics, the reading of the, account of the destruction of these cities, and knowing tihat what has been may, for the same  cause, occur again, has deterred me from investing very largely in real estate in New York. But these Canaanites did not go to Africa; they stayed in Asia; and as we have been enslaving only Afiricans, it is clear that there haN been a mis- I take somewhere, and that we have been innocently enslaving the wrong race all this time. You all remember the venerable  story of the tub. An old woman brought suit once upon a time    WHY, THE CURSE WAS BELIEVED IN.     6 for the value of a tub which she had loaned, and which had been returned to her piece by piece, the hoops having all      ! dropped off. The defence set up by the borrower was com- prehensive. First, and to begin with, the defendant never borrowed the tub. Secondly, she returned it witrl the hoops all on, and, thirdly, the plaintiff never had a tub. It is about so with this pet curse of ours. It wasn't good for much at best, it didn't stick to the people at whom it was levelled, and the Afiicans, upon whose shoulders we have piled it, are not Canaanites. Our ancestors did not believe this, however. They believed in this curse, with the child- like simplicity of a pawnbroker. It is very easy for us to believe in anything that hiolds out promise of personal benefit. Men whose love for gain cannot be satisfied with six days of labor, very generally question the sanctity of the Sabbath;  and we all insist thlat laws shall be made to fit our desires, rather tlhan to bring our desires to fit laws. These ancestors of ours were a greedy set. They hungered after a life of no      1 labor, and they believed, therefore, that the Lord directed Columbus across the untried waste of waters tlhat rolled between Spain and America solely that tills long retired and     i almost forgotten curse might be revived and put in force. It had been a failure thus flr; but as they looked out upon the new world, and saw how magnificently they could live, if they could only get their labor for nothing, their fitithl in it revived. They found here field and fobrest, gold and water, everything but labor. The emigrant might, it is true, have done the labor himself, but then this cherished curse of ours would have been still floating around the world, like the dove of the eminent naviga- tor who uttered it, with no place to rest the sole of its fiot. Besides, they did not want to do the labor. The first settlers of Virginia, from whom the chivalry of that State claim descent, never labored at home, and wlhy should they here? The settlers of Carolina were men to whom labor was as distasteful as it has ever been to their descendants. The negro was precisely what they wanted. The original decree was, '"In the sweat of thy brow slalt thol eat bread." They were determined that the decree should be fulfilled, but they wanted the dividing of it.  &#xD;<pb n="646-647" xml:id="VAC7107-00000347"/> "6        ITS CONVENIENCE. They were perfectly willing to do the eating, but they wanted the negro to do the sweating; and had he been content with this division of the, decree, all would have been smooth to-day. They prayed, "Give us this day our daily bread;" but  they added to the petition, "and furnish us a nigger to feed it to us."                         V Of course they believe in the curse. The planter on tlhe banks of the James felt the convenience of an arrangement which would obviate the first curse of labor, by a secondllc curse; of having the sin brought into the world through the4 agency of thee apple, done away with by another sin which had its origin in the grape. They found it a blessed thing to have a being rich in mtiscle to perform their share of the penalty of the first curse, giving them wasteful sunmmers at Saratoga, and ample time and means  for the cultivation of the Southern Christian graces - garm- bling, horse-racing. pistol-shooting, and the like. It was a glo- rious life they led! Did the proud Caucasian master have an  ill run of luck at cards? a nigger on the block made- it all right the next morning. Did madam, his wife, mourn, andw -\ refuse to be comforted, because a tlhousand dollar shawl was not? the matter was easily arranged. The tearing apart of a husband and wife, and the sale of one; the condemning of' a quadroon of her own sex to a life of shame, was all that was  necessary. Did they desire to entertain their friends sumptu- ously? Why should they not? There was no sordid counting of cost, as it was farther North; for were there not niggers  j to sweaty? Virginia hospitality was celebrated. Vermont  ; hospitality might have been, had Vermont fostered this curse, : and partaken of its benefits. It's easy enough to be hospitable w with-a hundred negroes, more or less, sweating for you gratis.  We did not invent reapers or sewing machines, for we didn't  need them. Flesh and blood was to be bought in any market, and it was cheaper than iron and steel. We down South were  j happily circumstanced. We had black slaves at home to do   our labor, and white serfs up North, just as humble, to do our voting. Nature kindly filrnished us a race white enough to  vote, and low enough to be owned.    THE ATTEMPT TO KILL TIIE CURSE.    647 Interpreting the curse to include all Africa, our pious fathers set about bringing as many of its inhabitants as possible under its operations. They sent out missionaries, whom a censorious world was wicked enough to stigmatize as pirates and slavers, clad in red shirts, with pistol at belt and cutlass by side, bearded like pards, and full of strong oaths. These evange- lizers, full of zeal and rum, sailed up the rivers of Africa, land surprised village, of these accursed people, killing the accusnred men and women too old to workl, and the accursed children too voung to work, but selecting out carefully the able-hodied ones of both sexes. Packing these in the holds of their vessels like herrings, they turned their prows homeward, throwing overboard, from day to day, the bodies of those who had so little regard for the curse of Noah as to die on the waly to the fulfilment thereof. And so at last the curse was fulfilled. On the cotton plantations, in the rice swamps, in the cane (and tobacco fields, the supposed sons of Ilam toiled on, expiating the stupidity of their supposed fa-ther, who, a great many n centuries before, hadn't any more sense than to look in upon his father when he was drunk. But just as this convenient and comfortable-curse got into good working order it was killed. Abraham Lincoln smote it under the fifth rib, and it died the death. The nation, in deadly peril, called upon our black cousins to aid in its deliverance, and it gave up the ghost. The sons of Ham, inferior as they were in all other respects, were discovered to be able to pull a trigger or push a bayonet with lanybody, and to the astonishment of' those who stood before them, tley had the will to do it. They dared to stand ,in battle array before the chivalry of the South. Wo very soon accounted for the daring. When Lincoln put the musket in the hands of the Southern negroes, it was Greek against Greek, brother against brothecr.   , The blood of the old cavaliers, which gave courage and daring    { to the Beauregards, Lees, Masons, and Hamptons, made cavaliers also of Scipio, Pompey, and Cesar, their half-brothers; and why not.  The Federals turned aga inst the Confederates twenty thousand men having the best blood of theo..South  &#xD;<pb n="648-649" xml:id="VAC7107-00000348"/> "8     THE AUDACITY OF THE CANANITES.  coursing through their veins, and inspiring them to high chivalrous deeds.                      ! Then the struggle became literally fratricidal. Another thing made these fellows fight. They had treasured up that old  saying of Jefferson, and they rejoiced when the firing upon :; Sumter gave them promise of the glad day when it should be  : a reality; When they were satisfied that the nation was reallyi divorced from slavery, they flew to arms to prove themselves worthy of the future they hoped for. We must confiss that they fought bravely and died grandly,.  The swart hero in the death-trap at Petersburg, on the plain at Port Hudson, and in the enclosure at Fort Pillow, showed  an example of heroism that any people might be proud of. The slave who remained on the plantation, who risked life to feed, nurse, and guide the flying fugitive from Andersonville, showed a devotion the like of' which the world never witnessed : befbre. We of the South were whipped, and by their aid. I do not say that we would not have been beaten had they': not thrown, themselves into the breach, but it was done the  easier because of them. They stopped bullets at least. The  bullet that let out the life of the negro soldier at Nashville,  mnight, had 1he not stood in its way, made life-long sadness in your home; and many a son of a Northern mother who came  home laurel crowned, owes his life to the unknown black man who lies in an unhonored grave upon the fields friom which he  plucked honor. These poor deluded Canaanites, as we shall term them, be- lieved that they had earned their promotion to a higher rank, ; and really expected it.  But we knew better. Down in Kentucky we held a con- sPltation on this very question. That blessed saint and keen  observer of' men, Deacon Pogram, remarked sagely, " that men ? and women was the most ungrateful members of the human  family ." Said he further on this head, "The sense of gratitood  the Fedrals feel will die out with the peals of the bells which  celebrate the victrys the nigger allies helped to win. Tlhey endured the nigger because they needed him; blut now, thank  the Lord, they don't need him no more, and, halleloogy, he'll' be the same cussed nigger he alluz wuz. "I use the Deacon's  exact words.    THEIR INGRATITUDE.        649 He was right. The wholesome prejudice against color swallowed up gratituide, and the pride of race swallowed jns- tice. The negro stepped one foot upon the thr6shold of the Tem. ple of Liberty, but we rudely pushed him back. They wanted not only freedom, but the elective franchise, the ungrateftl wretches not being satisfied with what we had given thelm. They liad been provided for generously. We of the South accepted the situation, and acknowledg'ed their freedom, but. we felt that it was necessary that they bo regulated. And so we decreed that they should not leave the plantations on which they were employed willhout passes from their employ- ers, under penalty of being shot at sight. They should have the right of suing any one - of their own color - if they coull give white bail for costs; and lere was a privilege -they were to have the unrestricted riglt; of being sued the same as white men. They should not purcllas or lease real estate outside of any incorporated city or village; and as large bodies of them were considered dangerous, they should not purchase or lease real estate within any incorporated city or village. As we fixed their wages at tour dollars per month, they boarding themselves,thlese laws relating to the purchase of real estate milght seern unnecessary. But we wanted to be on the safe side. And we proposed to give them the ballot, in time. Of other men we required no preparation, but we felt it necessary of' tlhese. We only required them to pass a creditable examination in Greek,      , Latin, embroidery, French, German, and double-entry book-       keeping, and to facilitate their acquiring these branches weo burned all their school-houses. These regulations were made in Mississippi. In my State of Kentucky it was not necessary to do anything in the matter, for Kentucky did not rebel. We preserved a strict neutrality. That estimable pillar in the Church at the Corners, Elder Gavitt, who has since gone to his reward, remarked that no     } one cood be more nootraller than he was." Hle loyally stayed at home all day, and bushwhacked Federal pickets all night, and after battles he robbed the dead and wounded of both sidcs impartially. For thus remaining neutral we liave been per- mitted to manage our niggers in our own way.  &#xD;<pb n="650-651" xml:id="VAC7107-00000349"/> 650        THE CURSE ABANDONED. The curse was by this time abandoned, but the hankering after cheap labor remained. We found at once a new reason fbr degrading this race--a new theory for keeping themn  down. We discovered, just in the nick of time, that they were not men at all. And this suited our friends of the North. They had always objected to the theory that the ne- gro was a man, and that he was enslaved because of his infe- J riority. They murmured to themselves, "If the stronger shall . .. own the weaker, if the intellectually superior shall hold in l slavery the intellectually inferior, God help us I We might as well select our masters at once."  When Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House, we felt that all was gone. We felt as gratefil, as men of our stamp could feel, that our lives were not forfeit, that we had yet our property, save and except our niggers. But this feeling wore  off. Andrew Johnson became suddenly tired of the role of Moses, or rather he changed his Israelites. He led the aston- ishod Africans into the Red Sea, and left them there; andS: putting himself at the head of their Egyptian pursuers, he  pulled them out of the troubled waters they had fallen into.  We were not slow to take advantage of this changed condition  t of affairs, There ia a modesty in the Southern character, but it  does not crop out very much. We began to tallk of our rights; our niggers, and our system. We felt that all was not lost so  much as it had been. True, they were fiee, but had we not  legislatures?  Congress, in its wisdom, left them in our hands  after all. They could vote by law, and by law some of us could not; but what of law, so long as we had the executing of it?  We were admitted to the Georgia legislature, and we, at olnce expelled enough of our black enemies to give us the control of that body. Elsewhere force--the rifle, the pistol,  the knife-gave us the control we wanted, and by a liberal  use of these peculiarly Southern agencies, the doomed sons of  Canaan were practically as far from fireedom as ever. They  were by law competent to vote in Louisiana, but of what avail to them  was that privilege so long as the power was in the hands of our people, who by force controlled one election, that  they might use the power thus gained to disfranchise them forever, and reduce them to the old status? [   THE NEGRO NOT A MAN.        651 It was necessary to satisfy our friends of the North tlmat we were right in this matter. We -had no trouble to do it. Our learned men measured their arms, legs, hands, and skulls, and finding a difference, held it was righlt and proper that all polit- ical rights be denied them. Smelling committees were ap- pointed, who discovered that the nigger was possessed of an odor not perceptible in the white, and forthwith that odor took the etntire conservative part of the people by the nose, and led tlhem at its own sweet will. It was not as agreeable as Night- blooming Cereus, and it was decided that therefore lie ought not to vote. Hii color was next critically considered, and in a  new light. It was not like ours; and should a man presumerno to exercise the rights of freemen whose complexion rivalled ; charcoal? Their heels protruded more than ours, and there-      fore they must be deprived of all privileges save that of liv-   i ing, and tlat only by sufferance. This rule wo find to bo weak in some respects. The first oejection that occurs to me to this method of de. termining a man's qualifications for the exercise of the^ great  i privilege of a freeman is the uncertainty of its application. We vill suppose a white man to have arms, legs, and skull, of the average negro alishape and measurement; does that unfit him for the ballot? We must admit this. if these measure- ments are to be the test. Or, suppose, from inattention to personal cleanliness, he should carry with him an odor unpleas- ant to persons of refined sensibilities, would that unfit him? Tlhe adoption of this rule would require boards of election to smell of each elector who offered a ballot; and that there might be unitormity in the matter, which is necessary in a republic, the gqvernment would be forced to establish a bureau of per- fumery. Ignorance we would urge as a disqualification ; but alas, weo  have a most excellent reason for sailing clear of tlmat. A very   i large per cent.. of those who oppose giving the ballot to the    I negroes, because of their ignorance, put a cross to their names  4 when they sign a promissory note, and accomplish that simple feat with much difficulty and, running out of tongue. Fielding, the great English novelist, gave us a most amus. ing picture of a terror occasioned in a small English village on  - . j!  &#xD;<pb n="652-653" xml:id="VAC7107-00000350"/> 652      THE TROUBLES ENCOUNTERED. the coast, by a rumor that the French had landed at a time n  when the pugnacious Gauls were threatening an invasion of that country. At the grated window of a debtor's prison ap-: pears the face of' a person who had been incarcerated for many ; years for a debt which lie could never hope to pay, and whose , imprisonment was therefore like to be perpetual. With an ex-;.  pression of the most earnest indignation upon his faded face, X he exclaims, from behind the bars, "Zounds! are the French coming to deprive us of our liberties?"            ,' Even so. I must admit that the men who tremble the most  for their country, when they contemplate the ignorant negroX^ possessing the ballot, are those Iho cannot read, and the pat- I riot who sells his vote for a drink of rum, is the identical fell. low who talks the loudest of the danger of giving the ballot  : to a mass of people whose votes can be so easily influenced. Several other reasons prevented us from making all that we ^ loped for out of the ignorance of the negroes, particularly of the South. Did we point to the ignorant field hand, and ask triumphantly if such as he was fit to vote? Forthwith our opponents lield up, as an offset, the degraded brutes of our Northern cities. Did we point to-the vicious negroes? Thley  could and did point to the roughs of' New York, Philadelphia,  and Baltimore. And they rather troubled us when they as-  serted that the ballot in the hands of ignorant white men was5 just as dangerous as in the hands of ignorant black mnen; that; the ballot, ignorantly or viciously cast, is what hurts us, not  the color of the man who casts it. They asserted that lie who: says "Stand off" to the colored mairbecause he cannot reads his ballot, ought to say "Stand off" to the wlhite man equally  ignorant. There is no denying this. Wereintelligence made the? test, it would scarcely be worth while to open polls in half the districts of New York city, and one fourth of our entire strength: would fade out like firost under a May sun. Finally we adopted  as ground upon which we could stand, the theory that there  were many creations instead of one; that Adam was not the   ! Simon pure, original man; that the. nigger is a different being altogether froim us--a beast, a sort of superior baboon; and  L being a beast, that we have the right to own and work him, as we have the horse or ox.   THE BEAST THEORY.        653 This position seemed to many of us impregnable; but it didn't stand a minute. Miscegenation or amalgamation linocked the support out from under us. Up stepped a pert abolition- ist, and asked, "What will you do vith the mulatto- he who is half man and half beast? And here is a difficulty. If we count them as beasts, we do the man that is in them injustice? If we count, them as men, we profatne manhood, by elevating with it the lower creation. And when such a one dies, what then? Does the man halt; for wlIiclh Christ died, claiming its inheritance in his blood, go into the next world on an equality with us, dragging with it the half' that is beast? Or should thlere be ever so slight at preponderance of beast, does the hybrid topple over in a lop- sided way into the limbo for departed animals, dragging with it the half that is man? If so, O, my Kentucky riends, how muchl of Kentucly soul and Kentucky spirit is thllere in that limbo, held in solution by t le animal surroundings into which your gross sensuality has condemned it? That unmitigated wretch, Joe Bigler, it will be remembered, reproached that old saint, Deacon Pogram, for walloping one of these nearly wliite negroes who had the Fogiram noise. "Deacon," said he, " how kin yoo bear to thrash so much Po- gram for the sake of walloping so little nigger?"Another ob- jection to this theory is the fact, that while treating them as beasts in the matter of voting, we treat them very much like men in the matter of tax-payi;ng . I have known men who grew furious at the idea of being jostled at the polls by a negro, do violence to the theory by standing side by side, quietly and without a murmur, with a very black one in the rush to pay taxes at the treasurer's office Anl n lduring tlhe late unpleasantness, what man of all our peoplo olject- ed to having the name of the blackest and most offensive negro in his township or ward written julst beforo Iris own on the draft enrolment? That was what lhurt us, Ior duaring its continuance we heard nothing of this hatred of race. The  nigger of 1861, when we didn't want him, softened down won- drouslv into the " colored man " in 1863, when we did want him.

Apollo in their eyes when they wanted their quotas filled. Ours was a white man's government; but we were all won- drous willing that black men should die for it in our stead. If I remember aright, I have, in the course of these re. marks, referred to the Democracy once or twice. I cannot  avoid making mention of their competitors, the Republican party, and here acknowledging the assistance it has been to us. In 1856 that party got hold of an idea that for many   X years was too large for it. They grasped it by the tail, and  they have been trying to manage it from that end ever since e until this minute. They never dared to look it in the face. The crusade upon slavery, squarely made years ago by Wen-   l dell Phillips, Lovejoy, Garrison, Giddings, and the few terrible agitators who were bent upon turning the world upside down, which they did, was entered into by those who followed them  afar off, only when they were compelled to.- And how feeble  their assent They endeavored not to pierce its centre, its weakest point, but to flank it. They commenced the movement against it by declaring their willingness that it should continue to exist in the States - that the slave-pens, under the shadow of the Capitol at Washington, should continue to show forth the beauties of a republican form of government, and that they themselves, free men, should continue to be used as  bloodhounds, with United States marshals to set them on, to  if hunt down the fugitives from bondage. They made haste to  announce in advance their determination not to interfere with  it where it existed, and they never did till they were corn- polled to. They frittered away the first two years'of the war@ before they were manly enough to tie themselves to whats they believed to be a truth, and permit it to drag them to vic- n tory. Forced by circumstances they could not control, they mustered up courage at last to declare the only friends they had in the South free: but what followed? They started in  affright at the spectre they had raised. The Republican party r was brave enough to face the armies of the rebellion, but it  was not brave enough to face a prejudice. From the close of  the war up to this winter, in the very flush of the victories they had won by the aid of the strong hands of their black allies, they coolly betrayed them. So magnanimous were they, i   A PHlILOSOPHCAL TRUTH.      655 so generous were they to their enemies, that they forgot tleir friends. They gave us, their late masters, the right to dis- franchise them at any time. They gave Southern legislatures    ; the power to reduce them again to serfdom, and even those in the Northern' States were denied their rights. How much th ese foolish people have made by their motion, how muchl they have of safety, how much of the rights they have earned, how much they have of citizenship, let Memphis, New Orleans, and   ! the Georgia legislature answer. The Republican party lacked the .courage, and we knew it would, to follow to its logical conclusion the idea upon which it was based. Too many of its members shuddered at the Nigger as soon as the Nigger was of no use to them. And there is a reason fobr this. It is a soothing thought to too many men that there is somebody lower down in the scale of humanity than themselves. Such men have an uncontrollable desire to look down upon some- body, and hence their desire to keep theenegro down, as that is the only portion of the race they can, with any show of  truth, claim to be above. And feeling the danger of his ris- ing above them if let alone, they seek to keep him down by piling upon his head the dead weight of unfriendly legislation. It is a philosophical truth this. The more despicable the man, the more anxious he is to have it understood that somebody is lower still. The most ardent defenders of slavery eight years ago were those who hadn't a particle of interest in it,-those who, if negrocs had been selling at five cents" apiece, could tiot have raised money enough to have purchased the paring of one's finger nail; and to-day those most bitterly opposed to Nigger suffrage are those whose stolid ignorance and inwrought brutality makes any attempt at further degradation a hopeless task. They can be cgot lower - by digging a hole. How shall we dispose of the negro. He was ever a disturb- ing element in American politics, and ever will be so long as left in the position he has occupied. The curse theory is wrorthless% and the beast theory le,a1k like a sieve. If tDere ever was anything in the curse it has all faded out, and if lie is not a man, he is a most excellent imitation.

Suppose we overhaul the laws of the country, and strike out the word 1" white," leav-  ing standing alone the all-sufficient word man. We are trying now the experiment of being a genuine republic. Suppose that there may be no longer a dispute upon this head, that we insist upon incorporatin g into the Constitution--the supreme ? law of the land- the Jeffersonian Declaration, that all men are .. equal. I want, and insist upon it, that the Declaration of  1 Independence shall be no longer a " glittering generality," as  that meanest of all mean things God ever created, a Massa-  ? chusetts pro-slavery man, once said, but a living, robust truth,  possessed of as much vitality as any other truth which has blessed the world. What stands in the way? Prejudice! Only this, and noth-  ing more, and that may be overcome. New England did it, 7 and New York, years ago, took one step in that direction. In  New York, the negro who owns a mule worth two hundred  and fifty dollars, votes, no matter what his other qualifications  may be, whllile he who lacks tlat, does not, no matter how well . lie is fitted for the exercise of the right in other respects. k This is not well, but it is something. By this rule the mule  votes, not the man; and the late election in that State shows the mules to have been largely in the majority. Until this principle is adopted our republic is no republic, i and our boasted fieedom is a hollow sham. We must have no  ? more of this inequality. We must make all men before the law ? equal. We must not leave the rights of a single citizen in the  hands of timid legislatures, interested oligarchies, and ex-slave- holders. The rights of thel pegro must be secured by law,  above the reach of ex-slavellolders; men who, to live a life of luxurious idleness, wouldl garrote the Goddess of Liberty  for the white robes she wears. We must make him not only    free in name, but in reality, and must give him that potent  g weapon, the ballot, that lie may maintain and defend his free- domn. I want all distinctions based upon color wiped out in all the States. I want all the roots of this bitterness eradi- cated. I want the great principle upon which a republic    NEGROES IN OFFICE.      '  657 should be founded incorporated into the Constitution. If, npow  that it can be done, we do less than this, we are 'cowards and faithless men. I want them to have all privileges enjoyed by other classes. "I Do you want niggers in office?" shudderingly asks the member of Congress, who sees in his mind's eye one sitting beside llim. I answer, "Certainly, if the people desire it, not otherwise ;" and they are a part of the people. I have no particular care ill the matter; I only inlsist that they shall be eligible. Whether they are elected to official position or not, is something that is entirely within your control. If you return a man a horse that is his, it does not follow that you must give him also silver- plated harness and a carriage. If you pay a debt, it does      i not follow that you must likewise marry into the falmily of your creditor. You have in this city an overwhelming majority of whites- it is fobr you to choose. Whlere they have a majority,  I presume they will do as we Ilave done--elect men of their own race; and I should advise them to. But there is no law      j to compel you to elect black men, or men of any other color, to official position. You have a riglit to vote for wholn you please. I am not certain but that the good of the public would be subserved by substituting some nogroes I know of for some white officials. For instance, were I a citizen of' New York,    { I would most gladly excclange Jolln Aorrisey for Frederick  Douglass, and rather than spoil the trade, I would throw in , Fernando Wood and his brother Ben, and esteem the bargain a mnost excellent one at that. But our conservative friends do not so see it. "PMy God l" said one of them, with lorror in his countenance, " think of my being tried afore a nigger jury for hoss-stealin!" The people elect7 or oxnglt to elect, rnent to otcice to sevve them. If you desire whitewashing done, do you look at the  color of the artist to whom you intrust the purifying of your walls and ceilings? No; you select the man who has the most skill. Why not so in official positions? If you Ihave among you negroes who have ability superior to the wlites, if you have those who can better fill the offices, you as tax-ptyers, do yourselves gross injustice by not electing them.

You have, under the Constitution of tile United States, the blessed privilege of choosing your own associations. We do not care to associate with all white men,  but all white men vote nevertheless.  I would not make them superior to the white. I would do : nothing more for them than I would fobr other men. But I   f:' would not prevent them from doing for themselves. I would tear down all bars to their advancement. I would let them make of themselves all that tley may. In a republic there  should be no avenue to honor or well-doitng closed to any man. i ; It tthey outstrip me in. the race, it proves them to be more ; worthy, and they are clearly entitled to the advantages re- ?: sulting. There is no reason for thiis inequality. Knowing   j how deep the prejudice is against the race, knowing how low:: down in our very natures its roots have struck, I demand, in: our renewed and purified republic, the abrogation of all laws  discriminating against them. I demand for them full equality  ,with us before the law. Come what may, let it lead to what * it will, this demand I make. I make it as a worshipper of true Democracy; as one who believes in the divine right of   : man - not white man, red man, or black man, but MAN, to self-  government. I make it as one who will be free himself; and  i that he may be free himnself; would have all others free. I demand it, not as a gracious gift to the colored man of somern- thing we might, if expedient, withhold, not as a right he  has earned by service done, but humbly, and with shame  in my ftce at the wrong we have done, I would give it him   . as returning a rigtht that was always his; a right to which lhe has a patent from God Almighty; a right that we had   l 4taken from him by brute force, and the takipg of which by  us was almost the unpardonable sin. I demand it, for until  it is done our boasted freedom is a sham, and our pretence of republicanism a miserable lie. I demand it, for I would  I have no privileged classes in this government, for fear that 1 some day my clildren may by force be deprived of the rights ! I enjoy by a class arrogating to themselves superiority. I demand it, because I believe governments were instituted  on earth for the protection of the weak against the strong, and that in a republic the ballot is the weak man's only  -    ALL MEN CREATED EQUAL.

Do by him what en- lightened Christianity commands us to do to all. Let us square our action in this, as in all other matters, by that sublime pre- cept, "Do unto others as ye would have others do unto you.." Casting behind us, as unworthy of a moment's serious colln-  sideration, the miserable sophstrics of the false teachers whvo l have well nigh ruined the republic, let us daro to do righ1t. Let us declare and crystalize our Declaration into uncha1nge- able laws, thalt under the flag all men shall be men. Let us 'build an altar, the foundation of' which shall be Reason, tlhe topstone Justice, and laying thereon our prejudices, let them be consumed i'n the steady, pure flame of Humanity. The smell of that sacrifice will be a sweeter savor to the Faltlher of all races than any since Abel's. Let us raise ourselves from the low, dead, flat plane of self-interest, anrd demonstrate our strength, not by trampling upon the defenceless heads of those weaker and lower than ourselves, but by lifting them up to us. And then, when the flag has under its shadow only free men, when all men are recognized as men, we can look tlme worild in the face, and repeat without a blush that grand old Declara- tion, that Magna Charta of human rights, that Evangel of IIumanity: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, tlat all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their' Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, lib- erty, and the pursuit of happiness."  &#xD;<pb n="660-661" xml:id="VAC7107-00000354"/> "THE STRUGGLES OF A CONSERVATIVE WITH             ! THE  WOSAN QUESTION."  A LECTURE  DELIVERED IN MUSIC HALL, BOSTON, DEC. 16, 1868. I AM by nature a Conservative, for I was born one. In my   s infancy I was rocked in an old-fashioned cradle, for my parents ; would have nothing whatever to do with new-fashioned gim- cracks on springs. Whatever they used must be that which had the sanction of years. When my infantile stomach was  agonized, I was soothed with Godfrey's Cordial. At the be-  ginning, paregoric was the favorite anodyne; but my mother  one day happening to discover in a household book that her grandmother used Godfiey's Cordial, that was immediately substituted as being undoubtedly the best. Godfrey's Cordial was counted the most efficacious, because the bottles which  contained it were quaint and old-f:shioned, and the labels were  printed in the characters and upon the paper used a century  3 ago. It was good enough for the stomachs of my ancestors,  and why not for mine? It has been ever since a rule in our falmily that it is better for babies to die witl Godfrey's Cordial  than to live with any other remedy. One brother of mine,  wlose head differed in shape from the others of the family, in  being largest in front of the ears, suggested that the world  i had progressed since Godfrey's day, and that possibly science  had produced a better combination. He was ordered to leave the house instantly. As a rebuke to him, my infant sister was  given a double dose of Godfrey, and my father prayed earnest-  ly against innovators and presumptuous men, and erased his "O    THE ANCIENTS.         661 name from the family Bible. The little sister died before  morning; my brother went away and invented an improve- ment in steam engines, thus fiendishy inflicting a stab at the horse interest. But I cannot dwell upon family matters. I have much to say, and life is short and uncertain. I know that's so, for a life insurance man told me so yesterday. I grew up with reverence for everything old. I am not the man who caught hold of the coat-tail of Progress, and yelled Whoa!"  I do not believe there ever was such a man. Prog- ress does not wear a coat; he rusles by in his shirt sleeves; and, besides, your true Conservative, of whom I am which, never gets awake in time to see Progress whistle by. I never think, for there's no necessity for thinking. All the trouble the world has ever seen has proceeded from pestiferous thinkers. I am content that men who departed this life some centuries ago, and were decently buried, and had their obitu- aries published in the newspapers, and their tombstones erect- ed, withl as many virtues cut upon them as their administrators had money to pay for-- I am content that tlese men, deceased as they are, should do my thinking for me. 1 study these men, and take their action as safe precedent tofollow. With such men as I am, the thing that has been done is the right thing to do; and the thing that has never been done, must therefore never be done. We have a poor opinion of ourselves. We, of the United States, believe that all the wisdoin of the country died with the last member of the Continental Congress, and that our only hope is in following closely in the footsteps of the meibers of that body. Therefore we opposed the abolition of slavery, because tley left us slavery. We opposed all attempts to sup- press intemperance, because intemperance was; and such of us as professed Christianity, opposed Sunday schools, because Paul was not a superintendent of one, and because we could nowhere find it recorded that Luke had a Bible, or Martha an infant class. Irreverent men, it is true, puzzle our Christian Conservatives, by insisting that if all old things are good things, then we must all rush into murder, that cheerful vice being almost con. temporary with creation.  &#xD;<pb n="662-663" xml:id="VAC7107-00000355"/> "2  WHAT COULD WE HAVE DONE WITHOUT WOMAN? But we do not allow that to shake us. Conservatives are not, as a rule, logicians. They have. an anchor in precedent, which holds them fast, while logic is a ship that sails out into unexplored seas. By doing only that which has been done, we hold fast to our ancestors; and if they were not respectable  people, who were? I adore woman. I recognize the importance of the sex, and  lay at its feet my humble tribute. But for woman, where would we have been? Who in our infancy washed our faces, fed us soothing syrup, and taught us "How doth the little busy bee?"Woman! To whom did we give red apples in  our boyhood? for whom did we part our hair behind, and wear No. 7 boots wlien No. 10's would have been more comfortable?  and WITH WHOM did we sit up nights, in the hair-oil period of our existence? And finally, whom did we marry? But for woman what would the novelists have done? What would have become of Sylvanus Cobb, Jr., if he had had no women  A to make heroines of? And without Sylvanus Cobb, Bonner could not have made the Ledger a success; Everett would be  i remembered not as the man who wrote for the Ledger, but merely as an orator and statesman; Beecher never would have written Norwood, and Dexter might to-day have been chafing under the collar in a dray! But for woman George Washing. ton w-ould not have been the father of his country, the Sun. day school teachers would have been short the affecting story i! of the little hatchet and the cherry tree, and half the babies in the country would have been named after some one else. Possibly they might have all been Smiths. But for woman . Andrew Johnson never would have been, and future genera. tions would have lost the most awful example of .depravity the world has ever seen. I adore woman, but I want her to keep her place. I don't want woman to be the coming man I In considering this woman question I occupy the Conserva- tive standpoint. I find that from the most gray-headed times one half of the human race have lived and moved by the grace and favor of the other half. From the beginning woman has occupied a dependent position, and has beeni only what man has made her. The Turks, logical fellows, denied her a soul, and made of her an object of' barter and sale; the American i   A BIBLICAL STATEMENT.       663 Indians made of her a beast of burden. In America, since we extended the area of civilization by butchering the Indianl, we hiave copied both. In the higller walks of lile she is a toy to be played with, and is bought and sold; in the lower strata she bears the burdens and does the drudgery of servants, with- out the ameliorating conditions that make other servitude tolerable and possible to be borne. But I am sure that her present condition is her proper condition, for it always has been so. Adam subjugated Eve at the beginning, and following pre- cedent Cain subjugated his wife. Mrs. Cain, not being an original thinker, imitated her mother-in-law, who probably lived with them, and made it warm for her, as is the custom of mothers-in-law, and the precedent being established, it has been so ever since. I reject with scorn the idea advanced by a schoolmistress, that, Eve was an inferior woman, and therefore submitted; and that Eve's being an inferior woman was no reason for classing all her daughters with her. "Had I been Eve," she remarked, "1 would have made a different prece- dent!" and I rather think she would. The first record we have of man and woman is in the first chapter of Genesis. "So God created man in his own image. And he made man of the dust of the earth." In the second chapter we have a record of the making of woman by takihg a rib from man. Man, it will be observed, was created first, showing conclusively that he was intended to take precedeeuce of woman. This woman, to whom I referred a moment since, denied the correctness of the conclusion. Man was made first, woman afterwards, - isn't it reasonable to suppose that the last creation was the best?"If there is anything in being first," she continued, "man must acknowledge the supremacy of the goose, for the fowl is first mentioned." And she argued further: "Man was made of the dust of the earth, the lowest form of matter; woman was made of man, the highest and most perfect form. It is clear that woman must be the better, for she was made of better material 1 But, of course, I look upon this as mere sophistry. I attempted to trace the relative condition of the sexes from the creation down to the fall of man, but the Bible is silent -  &#xD;<pb n="664-665" xml:id="VAC7107-00000356"/> "4             EVE. upon the subject, and the files of the newspapers of the period : were doubtless all destroyed in the flood. I have not been  i able to find that any have been preserved in the public libra- I ries of the country. But it is to be presumed that they lived  upon precisely the terms that they do now. I shall assume that Eve was merely the domestic servant of Adam--that  she rose in the morning, careful not to disturb his slum-  bers - that she cooked his breakfast, called him affectionately  when it was quite ready, waited upon him at table, arranged his shaving implements ready to his hand, saw him properly  dressed -after which she washed the dishes, and amused her.- self darning his torn fig leaves till the time arrived to prepare: dinner, and so on till nightfall, after which time she improved X her mind, and, before master Cain was born, slept. She did  not even keep a kitchen girl; at least I find no record of any. thing of the kind. Probably at that time the'emigration from Ireland was setting in other directions, and help was hard to get. That she was a good wife and a contented one I do notl, doubt. I find no record in the Scriptures of her throwing. tea-pots, or chairs, or brooms, or anything of the sort at Adam's  head, nor is it put down that at any time she intimated a de- sire for a divorce, which proves conclusively that the Garden  of Eden was not located in the State of Indiana. But I judge that Adam was a good, kind husband. He did not go to his club at night, for, as near as I can learn, he had no club. Hisu ! son Cain had one, however, as his other son, Abel, discovered. I am certain that he did not insist on smoking cigars in the - back parlor, making the curtains smell. I do not know that these things are so; but as mankind does to-day what man- kind did centuries ago, it is reasonable to assume, when we don't know anything about it, that what is done to-day was done centuries ago. The bulk of mankind have learned noth-s ing since Adam's time. Eve's duties were not as trying as those piled upon her daughters. As compared ith the fhshion-  able women of to-day, her lot was less perplexing. Society  was not so exacting in her time. She had no calls to make, or parties to give and attend. Her toilet was much simpler,I and did not require the entire resources of her intellect. If  her situation is compared with that of the wives of poorer    INTELLECTUAL POWER.        665 men, it will be found to be better. They had no meat to dress, flour to knead, or bread to bake. The trees bore fruit, which were to be had for the picking; and as they were strict vegeta- rians, it sufficed. I have wished that her taste in fruit had been more easily satisfied, for her unfortunate. craving after one particular variety brought me into. trouble. But I have forgiven her. I shall never reproach her for this. She is dead, alas! and let her one fault lie undisturbed in the grave with her. It is well that Eve died when she did. It would lave broken her heart had she lived to see how the most of her family turned out. I insist, however, that what labor of a domestic nature was done, she did. She picked the fruit, pared it and stewed it, lilke a dutiful wife. She was no strong-minded female, and never got out of her legitimate sphere. I lave searched the book of Genesis faithfully, and I defy any one to find it re. corded therein that Eve ever made a public speech, or expressed any desire to preach, practise law or medicine, or sit in the legislature of her native State. What a4 crushincg,0 withering, scathing, blasting relluke to the Dickinsons, Stan- tons, Blackwells, and Anthonys of this degenerate day. I find in the Bible many arguments against the cquality of woman with man in point of intellectual power. The serpent tempted Eve, not Adam. Why did lie select Eve? Ah, why, indeed! Whatever else may be said of Satan, nc one will, I think, question his ability! I do not stand here as his cham- pion or even apologist; in fact, I am willing to admit that in many instances his behavior has been ungentlemanly, but- no one will deny that he is a most consummate judge of charhcter, and that he has never failed to felect for lis wor k the mot fit- ting instruments. In this, as in all other respects, save ability, A. Johnson was very like him. When America was to be I)e-.  trayed the first time, Satan selected Arnold; when the second    j betrayal of the Republic was determined upon, lie knew wherle  Jefferson Davis, Floyd, and Buchanan lived ; and when he had other dirty work to do, with unfailing instinct, he clapped lis   ] claw on the shoulders of Chief Justice Chase, as he had before drafted Seward and Doolittle.

Possibly he is not entitled to credit fobr discrimi-  nation in these last-mentioned bodies, for he could not very well go wrong. He could find instruments in either, with both hands tied and blindfolded. But this is a digression.  Why did Satan select Eve? Because he knew that Eve the woman, was weaker than Adam the man, and therefore best   ;i fobr his purpose. This reckless female insisted that Satan ap. proached Eve first, because he knew that woman was not : afraid of the devil; but I reject this explanation as irrelevant, At this point, however, we must stop. Should we go on, we would find that Eve, the weak woman, tempted Adam, the strong man, with distinguished success, which would leave us  in this predicament Satan, stronger than Eve, tempted her to ; indulge in fruit. Eve's weakness was demonstrated by her  f falling a victim to temptation. Eve tempted Adam; Adam   ,j yielded to Eve; therefore, if Eve was weak in yielding to  Satan, how much weaker was Adam in yielding to Eve? If Satan had been considerate of' the feelings of the conserve-;. tives, his best friends, by the way, in all ages, he w ould have tempted Adam first, and caused Adam to tempt Eve. This   ; would have afforded us the edifying spectacle of the strong man  leading the weak woman, which would be in accordance with our idea of the eternal fitness of things. But now that I lookl at it again, this would'nt do; for it is necessary to our argu- : ment that the woman should be tempted first, to prove that she was the weaker of the two. I shall dismiss Adam and Eve withl the remark, that notwithstanding the respect one ought always  to feel for his ancestors, those whose blood is the same as that running in his veins, I cannot but say that Adam's conduct in this transaction was weak. If Adam's spirit is listening to me to-night, I can't help it. I presume he will feel badly to hear : me say it, but truth is truth. Instead of saying boldly, "I  ate!" he attempted to clear his skirts by skulking behind those of his wife's. "The woman thou gavest me tempted me and I did eat," he said, which was paltry. Had Adam been  stronger minded he would have refused the tempting bite, and  then only woman would have been amenable to the death penalty that followed. This would have killed the legal pro- I   INFERIOR.          667 fession in Chicago, for what man who was to live forever would get a divorce from his wife who could live but eighty or ninety years at best? As a conservative, I oppose any advancement of woman, because she is the inferior of man. This fatct is recognized in all civilized countrie, anud in most heatlhen nations. The Hindoos, it is true, in one of their practices, acknowledge a superiority of woman. In Hindostan, wlien a man dies, his widow is immediately burned, that she may follow him,- an acknowledgement that woman is as necessary to himiin in the next world as in this. As men are never burned wlien their wives die, it may be taken as admitting that women are tabun- dantly able to get along alone; or, perchance it may be because men in that oountry, as in this, can get new wives easier than women can get new husbands. The exit from this world by fire was probably chosen, that the wife might in some measure be fitted for the climate in which she might expect to find her husband. The inferiority of the sex is easy of demonstration. It has been said that the mother forms the character of the man so long, that the proposition has become axiomatic. If this be true, we can crush those who prate of the equality of women, by holding up to the gaze of the world the inferior men she has formed. Look at the Congress of the United States. Look at Garret Davis. By their works ye shall know them. It won't do to cite me to the mothers of the good and great men whose names adorn American History. The number is too small. There's George Washington, Wendell Phillips, Abraham Lin. coln, and one other, whose name all the tortures of the Inquisi- tion could not make me reveal. Modesty forbids me. Those who clamor for the extension of the sphlere of woailnn, point to the names of women illustrious in listory, sacled and profane. I find, to my discomfiture, that some of the sex really excelled the sterner. There was Mrs. Jezebel Allab, for instance. Ahab wanted the vineyard of Naboth, hlich Naboth refused to sell, owing to a prejudice he had against disposing of real bsyate which he had inherited. Alhab, who was not an ornament to his sex, went home sick, and took to his bed like a girl, and turned away his face, and would eat no             .  &#xD;<pb n="668-669" xml:id="VAC7107-00000358"/> "8       POCAHONTAS AND DELILAH.           ,! bread. Mrs. Ahab was made of sterner stuff. "Arise," said i  Mrs. A.; " be merry. I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth I the Jezrelite." And she did it. She trapped him as neatly as David did Uriah. She suborned two sons of Belial (by the   j way Belial has had a large family, and the stock has not run! out yet), to bear false witness against him, saying that he had? blasphemed God and the King, and they took him out and stoned him. Ahab got the vineyard. It is true this lady came  to a miserable end, but she accomplished what she desired. Miss Pocaliontas has been held up as a sample of female  strength of mind. I don't deny that she displayed some:. decision of character, but it was fearfully unwomanly. Whene her father raised his club over the head of the astonished  it:, Smith, instead of rushing in so recklessly, she should have said, "Please, pa, don't." Her recklessness was immense. Sup- pose Pocahontas had been unable to stay the blow, where  would our Miss have been then? She never would have married Rolfe; and what would the first families of' Virginia  have done for somebody to descend from? When we remem- ber that all the people of that proud State claim this woman as their mother, we shudder, or ought to, when we contem-r plate the possible consequences of her rashness. Delilah, whose other name is not recorded, overcame Samson, ! the first' and most successful conundrum maker of his age, and Jael, it will be remembered, silenced Sisera forever. Joan of Are conquered the English after the French leaders failed, and Elizabeth of England was the greatest of English rulers. I acknowledge all this, but then these women had opportuni- ties beyond those of women in general. They had as many  opportunities as the men of their respective periods had, and  consequently, if they were mentally as great as men,- no, that isn't what I mean to say, - if the men of the period were no greater mentally than they - no - if the circumstan- ces which surrounded them, gave them opportunities, which, being mentally as great as men - I have this thing mixed up somehow, and it don't result as it ought to- but this is true; Delilah, Elizabeth, Joan of Arc- all and singular, unsexed  ij themselves, and did things unbecoming ladies of refinement  and cultivation. Joan's place was spiuning fiax in her father's   REBEKAH.          669 hut, and not at the head of armies.' Had she followed the natural mode of feminine life she would not have been burned at the stake, and the English would not lhave been interrlupted  in their work of reducing France to the condition of an English province. Had I lived in France, I should lmave said, "Down    i with her! Let us perish under a man ratlher than be savedby  a woman!"Joan should have been ashaled of herself-I blush for her. Had Elizabeth been content to e ntrust I1er  kingdom to the hands of her cabinet, she would have left it in the happy condition of the United States at the close of Buchanan's administration, but she would have been true to our idea of the womanly life. There is, in the feminine cllarecter, a decisive promptness which we must admire. Eve ate the apple without a nmoinent's hesitation, and the characteristic is more beautifully illustrated in the touching and well reported account of the courtship and marriage of Rebekah with Isaac. Abrl'aham's servant was sent, it will be remembered, by such of you as lave read the   I Bible, to negotiate for a wife for young Isaac among his kindred, as he had as intense a prejudice against the Canaan- ites as have' the Democracy of the present day. This servant, whom we will call Smith, as his name unfortun'ately hias not  been preserved, and Laban, the brother of Rebekah, had almost arranged the matter. The servant desired to return with thel young lady at once, but the mother and brother desired lier to remain some days, contrary to modern practice, in tlat tile parents now desire the young lady to get settled in her own house and off their hands as soon as possible. The servant     p insisted, whereupon the mother remarked, L' We will call tleo   ? damsel and inquire at her mouth." They called Rebckah and asked, '"Wilt thou go with this man?"              , It is related of a damsel in Pike county, Missouri, Who was being wedded to the man whose choice she was, when the  minister officiating asked the usual question, "Wilt thou have this man to be thy wedded husband?" that dropping her long eyelashes, she promptly answered, "You bet I Even so with Rebekah.

I don't know  that this proves anything, unless it be that women of that day took as great risks for husbands as they do now. Miss Re.- bekah had scaicely been introduced to her future husband. ! It might be interesting to trace the history of this woman,  but I have hardly the time. I will say, however, that she was a mistress of duplicity. To get the blessing of her husband for her pet son Jacob, she put false hair upon him to deceive  the old gentleman, and did it. From that day to this, women in every place but this, have deceived men, young as well as old, with false hair. The feminine habit of thought is not such as to entitle them to privileges beyond those they now enjoy. No woman was ever a drayman; no woman ever carried a hod; no woman ever drove horses on the canals of the country; and what is. more to the point, no woman ever shovelled a single wheel- barrow of earth on the public works. I triumphantly ask, Did any woman assist in preparing the road bed of the Pacific  ! Railway? did any woman drive a spike in that magnificent structure? No woman is employed in the forging depart.  ment of any shop in which is made the locomotives that climb the Sierra Nevada, whose head-lights beam on the valleys of the Pacific coast -the suns of our commercial system. Just as I had this arranged in my mind, this disturbing female, of whom I have spoken once or twice, asked me whether carrying hods, driving horses on canals, or shovelling dirt on railways, had been, in the past, considered the best training for intelligent participation in political privileges? She remarked, that judging from the character of most of the legislation of which she had knowledge, these had been the  schools in which Legislators had been trained, but she hardly believed that I would acknowledge it. "Make these the qualifications," said she, "and where would you be, my friend, who have neither driven a spike, driven a horse, or shovelled dirt? It would cut out all of my class (she was a teacher) - indeed I know of but two women in America who would be #        JS    FEMALE DISABILITIES.       671 admitted.

I answered, that these classes had always voted, and there-  fore it was right that they should always vote. "Certainly they have," returned she, " and as I have heard them addressed a score of times as the embodied virtue, hon- esty, and intelligence of the country, I have come to the con- clusion that there must be something in the labor 'they do which fits them peculiarly for the duties of law-making." My friend is learned. She has a tolerable knowledge of Greek, is an excellent Latin scholar, and as she has read the Constitution of the United States, she excels in political lore the great majority of' our representatives in Congress. But nevertheless I protest against her voting for several reasons. 1. She cannot sing bass! Her voice, as Dr. Bushnell justly observes in his blessed book, is pitched higher than the male voice, which indicates feminine weakness of mind. 2. Her form is graceful rather than strong. 3. She delights in millinery goods. 4. She can't grow whiskers. In all of these points nature has made a distinction between the sexes which cannot be overlooked. To all of these she plead guilty. She confessed that sho had not the strength necessary to the splitting of' rails; she con- fessed that she could neither grow a beard or sing bass. Sheo wished she could grow a beard, as she knew so manlly men whose only title to intellect was their whiskers. But she said she took courage when she observed that the same disparity was noticeable in men. Within the range of her acquaintance she knew men who had struggled with mustaches with a per- severance worthy of a better cause, and whose existence had been blighted by the consciousness that they could not. Life was to them, in consequence, a failure. Others she knew who had no more strength than a girl, and others whose voices were pitched in a childish treble.

She went on thus:-- "In many respects," she said, " the sexes are alike. Both are encumbered with stomachs and heads, and both have bodies  ; to clothe. So far as physical existence is concerned they are very like. Both are affected by laws made and enacted, and both are popularly supposed to have minds capable of weigh- ! ing the effect of laws. How, thrust into the world as I am, with a stomach to fill and limbs to clothe, with both hands tied, aml I to live, to say nothing of fulfilling any other end?"- "Woman," I replied, " is man's angel."  "Stuff and nonsense," was her impolite reply. "I am no  angel. I am a woman. Angels, according to our idea of     - angels, have no use for clothing. Either their wings are  enough to cover their bodies, or they are so constituted as  not to be affected by heat or cold. Neither do they require food. I cannot imagine a feminine angel with hoop skirts,   I Grecian bend, gaiters and bonnet; or a masculine angel in   i tight pantaloons, with a cane and silk hat. Angels do not   A cook dinners, but women do. Why do you say angels to us? It creates angel tastes, without the possibility of their ever  satisfying those tastes. The bird was made to soar in the upper air, and was therefore provided with hollow bones,  wings, &amp;c.

Could an  elephant, with his physical structure, be possessed with such  a longing, the elephant would be miserable, because he could  not. HJe would be as miserable as James Fisk, Jr., is, with an 1 ungobbled railroad; as Bonner would be if Dexter were the property of another man; and as Salmon P. Chase is withl the  Presidency before him. It would be well enough to make! angels of us, if you could keep us in a semi-angelic state; but  the few thus kept only make the misery of those not so fortunate the more intense. No; treat us rather as' human beings, with all the appetites, wants, and necessities of human i beings, for we are forced to provide for those wants, necessi-  ties and appetites."

All that we lhavo to do is to ma, rry each man to one womtan, afnd demand of each man that he care for and cherish one woman, and the difficulty is got along with. And got along with too, leaving things as we desire them, namely, with the woman dependent upon thle man. We proceed upon the proposition that there are just as many men as there are women in the world; that all men will do their duty in this particular, and at the right time; tliat every Jack will get precisely the right Jill, and tilat every Jill will be not only willing, but anxious, to take the Jack the Lord sends her, asking no questions. If there be one wom-an mIore thln there are men, it's bad . for that woman. I don't know what she can do, unless she makes shirts for the odd man, at twelve and a half cents each, and lives gorgeously on the proceeds of her toil. If one man concludes that he won't marry at all, it's bad for another woman, unless some man's wife dies and he marries again. That might equalize it, but for two reasons: It compels the  woman to wait for a husband till she possibly concludes it isn't worth while; and furthermore, husbands die as iast as wives, which brings a new element into the field - widows; and pray what chance has an inexperienced. man against a widow deter-  mined upon a second husbland?  I admit, that if there were as many men as women, and if     ! they should all marry, and the mattcr be all propelly fixed ulp  at the start, that our present system is still bad for somel of  them. She, whose husband gets to inventing flying machines, or running for office, or any of tliose foolish or discreditable , employments, would be in a bad situation. Or, when the lhus- band neglects his duty, and refuses to care for his wife at all;  or, to state a case whch no one ever witnessed, suppose one not only refuses to care for his wife, but refuses to care for himself! Or, suppose lie contracts the injudicious habit of returning to his home at night in a state of inebriation, and of breaking chairs, and crockery, and his wifB's head, and other 43  &#xD;<pb n="674-675" xml:id="VAC7107-00000361"/> 674      EVERY WOMAN SHOULD MARRY. trifles - in such a case I must admit that her position would be, to say the least, unpleasant, particularly as she couldnI't : help herself. She can't very well take care of herself; for to  make woman purely a domestic creature, to ornament our  homes, we have never permitted them t o think for themselves, :[ act for themselves, or do for themselves. We insist upon her being a tender ivy clinging to the rugged oak -if the oak  she clings to happens to be bass-wood, and rotten at that, it's not our fault. In these cases it's her duty to keep on cling.  ing, and to finally go down with it in pious resignation. The  fault is in the system, and as those who made the system are dead, and as six'thousand brief summers have passed over their tombs, it would be sacrilege in us to disturb it. Cus-k toms, like cheese, grow mitey as they grow old.  Let every woman marry, and marry as soon as possible.!: Then she is provided for. Then the ivy has her oak. Then if her husband is a} good man, a kind man, an honest man, a sober man, a truthful man, a liberal man, an industrious man, a manag- ing man, and if he has a good business and drives it, and meets with no misfortunes, and never yields to temptations, why, then, the maid promoted to be his wife, will be tolerably certain to, at least, have all that she can eat, and all that she can wealr, as long as he continues so.                  . This disturbing woman of whom I have spoken once or  twice, remarked that she did not care for those who were   i married happily, but she wanted something done for those who were not married at all, and those who were married unfortu-  nately. She liked the ivy and the oak-tree idea, but she wanted the ivy - woman - to have a stiffening of intelligence and opportunity, that she might stand alone in case the oak ? was not competent to sustain it. She demanded, in short, em- ployment at anything she was capable of doing, and pay proe- cisely the same that men receive fobr the same labor, provided she does it as well.  This is a clear flying in the face of Providence. It is utterly impossible that any woman can do any work as well as men. Nature decreed it otherwise. Nature did not give them the strength. Ask the clerks at Washington, whose muscular frames, whose hardened sinews, are employed at from twelve   THE QUESTION OF WAR.       675 hundred to three thousand dollars per annum, in the arduous and exhausting labor of writing in books, and counting nmoney, and cutting out extracts from newspapers, and indorsing pa- pers and filing them, what they think of that?

Are women, firail as they are, to fill positions in the -government offices? I asked ler sternly, "Are you willing to go to Mwar? Did you shoulder a musket in the late unpleasantness?" This did not settle her. She merely asked me if I carriedl a musket in the late war. Certainly I did not. I had too much presence of Inind to volunteer. Nor did the majority of those holding official position. Like Job's charger, they snuffed the battle afar off--aomo hundreds of miles--and slew the haughty Southron on the stump, or by substitute. But there is this difference: we could have gone, while womenOll could not. And it is better that it is so. In the event of an. other bloody war,--one so desperate as to require all the pat- riotism of the country to show itself,-I do not want my wife to go to the tented field, even though she have the requisite physical strength. No, indeed 1 I want her to stay at home - with me I In the matter of wages, I do not see how it is to be helped. The woman who teaches a school, receives, if she has thor- oughly mastered the requirements of the position, say six hundred dollars per year, while a man occupying the same position, filling it with equal ability, receives twice that amount, and possibly three times. But what is this to mo? As a man of business, my duty to myself is to get my children educated at the least possible expense. As there are but very few things women are permitted to do, and as for every vacalrt place there are a hundred women eager for it, as a matter of  course, their pay is brought down to a very fine point. As I said sonme minutes ago, if the men born into the world would marry at twenty-one, eachl a maiden of eighteen, and take care of her properly, and never get drunk, or sick, or anything of that inconvenient sort, and both would be taken at precisely the same time with consumption, yellow fever, cholera, or any  &#xD;<pb n="676-677" xml:id="VAC7107-00000362"/> 676      THE QUESTION OF MARRIAGE. one of those cheerful ailments, and employ the same physician, tlhat they might go out of the world at the same moment, and  become angels with wings and long white robes, it would be well enough. The men would then take care of the women,    : except those who marry milliners, in which case the women take care of the men, which amounts to the same thing, as the  one dependent upon somebody else is taken care of. But it   C don't so happen. Men do not marry as they ought at twenty- e one; they put it off to twenty-five, thirty, or forty: and many ? of them are wicked enough not to mlarry at all; and of those^  who do marry there will always be a certain per cent. who   i; will be dissipated or worthless. What then? I can't deny  that there will be women left out in the cold. There are those . who don't marry, and those who cannot. Possibly the number thus situated would be lessened if we permitted women to rush in and seize men, and marry them, niolens volens, but the superior animal will not brook that familiarity. He must do the wooing - he must ask the woman in his lordly way. Comrn- poelled to wait to be asked, and forced to marry that they may have the wherewithal to eat and be clothed, very many of    them take fearful chances. They dare not, as a rule, refuse! to marry. Man must, as the superior being, have the choice  of occupations, and it is a singular fact that, superior as he is ; by virtue of his strength, he rushes invariably to the occupa-^ tions that least require strength, and which woman might fill  to advantage. Thev  monopolize all the occupations--the} married man has his family to take care ofe- the single manl : has his back hair to support; what is to become of these unfor-  tunate single women-- mtids and widows? Live they mnlt.    . Thev have all the necessities of life to supply, and nothing to  supply them with. What shall they do? Why, work of course. But say they, "We are willing to work, btut -we must have wages." Granted. But how shall we get at the wages-- what shall be the 'standard? I miust get my work done as cheaply as possible. Now if three women--a widow, we will, say, with five children to support; a girl who has to work org do worse; and a wife with an invalid husband to feed, clothe, and find medicine for--if these three come to my door, clam- oring for the love of God for something to do, wlhat shall I, as   "ABOR.           6" a prudent man, do in the matter? There are immutab'le laws governing all these things--tthe law of supply and demand. Christ, whose mission was with the poor, made other laws, but Christ is not allowed to have anything to do, with business. Selfishness is older than Christ, and we Conservatives stick close to the oldest. What do I do? Why, as a man of busi- ness, I naturally ascertain which of the tlhree is burdened withl tlhe most crushing responsibilities and necessities. I ascertain to a mouthful the amount of food necessary to keep each, and tlhen the one who will do my work for the plice nearest star- vation rates gets it to do. If the poor girl prefers the pit- tance I offer her to a life of shame, she gets it. If the wife is willing to work her fingers nearer the bone than the others, rather thlan abandon her lhusband, she gets it; and speculating on the love the mother bears her children, I see how mucli of her life the widow will give to save theirs, and decide accord- ingly. I know very well that tlhese poor creatures cannot saw wood, wield the hammer, or roll barrels on the docks. I Jknow tliat custom bars them out of malay employments, and that tleo more manly vocations  of handling ribbons, maniptulating tele  graphic instruments, &amp;c., are monopolized by men.  Confined as they are to a few vocations, and there being so many hiun- dreds of thousands of men who will not each provide for ono(, there are necessarily ten applicants for every vacancy; and there being more virtue in the sex than the world has ever given thlem credit for, of course they accept, not what tleir labor), is worth to me and the world, but what I teand theo world choose to give for it. It is bad, I grant, but it is the fault of the system. It is a misfortune, we think, thlt there are  so many wtomen, and we weep -over it. I am willing to shed any amount of tears over this mistake of nature. But women are themselves to blameo for a great part of tire distress they experience. Tlhere is work for more of them, if they would only do it. The kitchens of the country are n(ot,      i hlalf supplied with intelligent labor, and therein is - refuge fbor all women in distress. I assert that nothing but foolish pride keeps the daughters  of insolvent wealth out of kitclhens, where they mnay have happy underground homes and three dollars per week, by  &#xD;<pb n="678-679" xml:id="VAC7107-00000363"/> 678      TRE EXAMPLE OF YOUNG 3IEN. merely doing six hours per day more labor than hod-carriers  average. Thllis is what they would do were it not for pride, which is sinful. They should strip the jewels off their fingers, the laces off their shoulders; they should make a holocaust of theiri music and drawings, and, accepting the inevitable, sink with dignity to the washing of dishes, the scrubbing of floors, and the wash-tub. This their brothers do, and why haven't they  . their strength of mind? Young men delicately nurtured and reared in the lap of luxury, never refuse the sacrifice when  their papas fail in business. They always throw to the windsj their cigars; they abjure canes and gloves, and mount drays, ". and shoulder saw-bucks - anything for an honest living. I  never saw one of these degenerate into a sponge upon society  rather than labor with his hands! Did you? I never saw one of this class get to be a faro dealer, a billiard marker, a J borrower of small sums of money, a lunch-fiend, a confidence- man, or anything of the sort. Not they 1 . Giving the go-by , to everything in the shape of luxuries, they invariably descend! to the lowest grades of manual labor rather than degenerate! into vicious and immoral courses. Failing the kitchen, women  may canvass for boolks, though that occupation, like a few : others equally profitable, and which also brings them into con- tinual contact with the lords of creation, has a drawhack in b the fact that some men leer into the f:ace of every woman who strives to do business for herself;, as though she were a moral  leper; and failing all these, she may at least take to the needle. ? At this last occupation she is certain of meeting no competition, save from her own sex. In all my experience, and it has been  extensive, I never yet saw a man making pantaloons at twelve and one half cents per pair. But they will not all submit. : Refusing to acknowledge the position in life nature fixed for  them they rebel, and unpleasantnesses take place' An inci- i dent which fell under my observation recently illustrates this  beautifully. A young lady, named Jane Evans, 1 believe, had sustained the loss of both her parents. The elder Evanses had been convinced by typhoid fever that this was a cold world, and, piloted by two doctors, had sailed out in search of a better one. Jane had a brother, a manly lad of twenty, who, rather   A BIT OF EXPERIENCE.      . 679 than disgrace the ancient lineage of the Evanses by manual labor, took up the profession of bar-tender. Jane was less proud, and as her brother did nothing for her, she purchased some needles, and renting a room in the uppermost part of a building in a secluded part of the city of New York, com- menced a playful effort to live by making shirts at eighteen cents each, for a gentleman named Isaacs. She was situated, I need not say, pleasantly for one of her class. Her room was not large, it is true, but as she had no cooking-stove or bed- stead, what did she want of a large room? She had a win- dow wlhich didn't open, but as there was no gla ss in it, she had no occasion to open it. This building commanded a beautiful view of the back parts of other buildings similar in appear- ance, and the sash kept out a portion of the smell. Had that sash not been in thlcG window-frame, I do not suppose that she could have staid on account of the smell; at least I heard her say that she got just' as much of it as she could endure. And in this delightful retreat she sat and sat, and sewed and sewed. Sometimes in her zeal she would sew till late in the night, and she always was at her work very early in the morn- ing. She paid rent promptly, for the genial old gentlematn of whom she leased her room had a sportive habit of kicking girls into the street who did not pay promptly, and she mnan- aged every now and then, did this economical girl, to purchase a loaf of bread, which she ate. One Saturday night she took her bundle of work to the de- lightfil Mr. Isaacs.

They were not properly sewed, he said, and lie could not in consequence pay her the eighteen cents each for making, which was the regular price. Jane then injudi- ciously cried about it. Now, Mr. Isaacs was, and is, possessed of a tender heart. He has a great regard for his feelings, and as he could not bear to see a woman cry, he forthwith kicked her out of his store into the snow.

On the contrary she clenched her hands, and passing )by a baker's shop, stole a loaf of bread, and, brazen thing that slie was, in pure bravado, she ate it in front of the shop. She said she was. hungry, when it was subsequently proven that she had eaten within forty hours. Justice was swift upon the heels of the desperate wretch- it always is, by the way, close  behind the friendless. She was arrested by a policeman, wlho was opportunely there, as there was a riot in progress' in the I next street at the time. which was providential, for had there  been no riot in the next street, the policeman would have been in that street, and Jane Evans might lave got away with her plunder. She was conveyed to the city prison; was herded in a cell in which were other women who had progressed far- ther than she had; was afterwards arraigned for petty larceny, and sent to prison for sixty days. Now see how surely evil- doers come to bad ends. The wretched Jane, - this fearfully depraved Jane, - unable after such a manifestation of deprav- ity to hold up her head, fell into bad ways. Remorse for the stealing of that loaf of bread so preyed upon her that she wandered about the streets of the city five days, asking for work, and finally tlirew herself off a wharf. O, how her brother, the bar-tender, was shocked at this act! Had she con- tinued working cheerily for Mr. Isaacs, accepting the situation like a Christian, taking life, as she found it, would she have thrown herself off a dock? Never! So you see women who do not want to steal bread, and be arrested, and go off wharves, must take Mr. Isaacs' pay as he offers it, and must wo'rk cheerily sixteen hours a day, whether they get anything to eat or not. Had this wretched girl gone back contentedly to her room, and starved to death cheerfully, she would not have stolen bread, she would not have lacerated the feelings of her brother the bar-tender, and would have saved the city of New York the expense and trouble of fishing her out of the dock. Such women always make trouble. The women who fancy they are oppressed, demand, first, the ballot, that they may have power to better themselves;  and, second, the change of custom and education, tlat they may have free access to whatever employment they have   A PONDEROUS PROTEST.       C 1 the strength and capacity to fill, and to which their inclination leads them. Most emphatically I object to the giving of them the ballot. It would overturn the whole social fabric. The social fabric has been overturned a great many times, it is true - -o na\ny times, indeed, that it seems rather to like it; but 1 doubt whether it would be strong enough to endure this. I liave too great, too high, too exalted an opinion of woman. I insist that she shall not dabble in the dirty pool of politics; that she shall keep herself sacred to her fimily, whether she lias one or not; and under no consideration shall she go beyond the domestic circle of which she is the centre and ornament. There are those who have an insane yearning to do sometling beyond the drudgery necessary to supply the commonest wants of life, and others who have all of' tlese, who would like to round up their lives with something beyond dress and the un. satisfactory trifles of fItshionable lifb. There may be women turning night into day over the needle, for bread tlhat keeps then just this side of potter's field, wlio are unreasonable enough to repine at the system that compels them to this; and they may, possibly, in secret wishi that they had the power in their hands that would make men court their influence, as the hod-carrier's is courted, for the voto he casts. The seamstress, toiling for a pittance that would starve a dog, no doubt prays for the power that would compel lawmakers to be as careful of her interests as they are of the interests of the well-paid male laborers in the dock-yards, who, finding ten hours a day too much for them, were permitted by act of Congress to draw ten hours' pay for eight hours' work. The starved colorer of lithographs, the pale, emaciated tailoress, balancing deatt iand virtue; drawing stitches with the picture of the lllxurious brothel held up by the devil before her, where there is light, and warmth, and food, and clothing, and where deatl is, at least, farther off; no doubt this girl wislies at times that she could have that potent bit of paper between her fingers tliat would compel blatant demagogues to talk of the rights of workingwomen as well as of workingmen. But woman would lose her self1respect if she mixed with politicians. Most men do; and how could woman lope to  &#xD;<pb n="682-683" xml:id="VAC7107-00000365"/> 682       DR. BUSHNELL'S REASONS.  escape. Think you that any pure woman could be a member of the New York, New Jersey, or Pennsylvania legislatures, and remain pure? For the sake of the generations to come, I desire  that one sex, at least, shall remain uncontaminated. Imagine your wife or your sister accepting a bribe from a lobby member! Imagine your wife or your sister working a corrupt measure  through the legislature, and becoming gloriously elevated upon champaign in exultation over the result I No! I insist  that these things shall-be confined to man, and man alone.  The mixing of' women in politics, as all the writers on the  subject have justly remarked, would lower the character of the womnan without elevating that of the man. Imagine, O,  :- my hearers, a woman aspiring for office, as men do! Imagine  her button-holing voters, as men do I Imagine her lying gliby and witlhout scruple, as men do I Imagine her drinking with  the lower classes, as men do! of succeeding by the grossest  fraud, as men do! of stealing public money when elected, as men do! and finally of sinking into the lowestmhabits, the vilest practices, as Dr. Bushnell, in several places in his blessed book on the subject, asserts that men do! You-see that to make the argument good, that women would immediately fall to a very deep depth of degradation the moment they- vote, we   as must show that the act of voting compels men to this evil; at least that is what Dr. Bushnell proves, if he proves anything. . We must show that the holding of an office by man is proof positive that he has committed crime enough to entitle him to  a cell in a penitentiary, and that he who votes is in a fair wayf thereto. Before reading the doctor's book, I was weak enough to suppose that there were in the United States some bun- dreds of thousands of very excellent men, whose long service in church and state was sufficient guarantee of their excellence;  whose characters were above suspicion, and who had lived,  and would die, honest, reputable citizens. But as all male citizens above the age of twenty-one vote, and as voting neces-. sarily produces these results, why, then we are all drunkards, tricksters, thieves, and plunderers. This disturbing woman, to  whom I read Dr. Bushnell's book, remarked that if' voting  tended to so demoralize men, and as they had always voted, it would be well enough for all the women to vote just once,g i   PEACE.           683 that they might all go to perdition together. I am compelled to the opinion that the doctor is mistaken. I know of quite a number of men who go to the polls unmolested, who vote their principles quietly, and go home the better for having exercised the right. I believe that, before and since Johnson's adminis. tration, there have been honest men in office. But no wo- man could-do these things in this way. It would unsex her, just as it does when a woman labors for herself alone. Again. I object to giving the ballot to woman, because we Want peace. We don't want divided opinion in our faimilies. As it is, we must have a most delightful unanimity. An individual- cannot possibly quarrel with himself: As it is now arranged, man and wife are one, and the man is that one. In all matters outside the house the wife has no voice, and consequently there can be no differences. O, what a blessed thing it would be if the same rule could obtain among men l Had the Radicals had no votes or voices, there would have been no war, fobr the Democracy, having it all their own way,  i there would have been nothing to quarrel about. It was opposition that forced Jefferson Davis to appeal to arms.  True, the following of this idea would dwarf the Republicans into pygmies, and exalt the Democracy into giants. My mis- guided friend, Wendell Pihillips, would shrink into a common- place man, possibly he would lose all manhood, had he been compelled to agree'with Franklin Pierce or hold his tongue. It would be bad for Wendell, but there would have been a calm as profound as stagnation itself. Our present system   i may be bad for women, but we, the men, have our own way - and peace. Our wives and daughters are, I know, driven, from sheer lack of something greater, to take refuge in dis. jointed gabble of bonnets, cloaks, and dresses, and things of that nature, their souls are dwarfed as well as their bodies,  i( their minds are diluted-but we have peace. Once more. It would unbalance society. Starting upon      ; the assumption that women h1ave no minds of their own, and    j would always be controlled by men, we can show wherein the privilege would work incalculable mischief.

Put  Brigham and his family in a close congressional district and he would swamp it. Then, again, if they should think for r themselves, and vote as they pleased, they would overthrow  Ii Brigham. Ill either case the effect would be terrible.     I. What shall we do with the woman question? It is upon us, and must be met. I have tried for an hour to be a conserva. tive, but it won't do. Like poor calico, it won't wash. There are in the United States some millions of women who desire something better than the lives they and their mothers have  been living. There are millions of women who have minds and souls, and who yearn for something to develop their minds and souls. There are millions of women who desire to have something to think about, to assume responsibilities, that they may strengthen their moral natures, as the gymnast lifts weights to strengthen his physical nature. There are hun-. dreds of thousands of women who have suffered in silence    ;I worse evils by far than the slaves of the South, who, like the slaves of the South, have no power to redress their wrongs, no voice so potent that the public must hear. In the parlor, inanity and friivolity; in the cottage, hopeless servitude, unceasing toil; a dark life, with a darker ending. This is the condition of woman in the world to-day. Thousands starv. ing physically fobr want of something to do, with a world call- ing for labor; thousands starving mentally, with an uneox- plored world before them. One half of humanity is a burden on the other half. I know, O, ye daughters of luxury, that you do not desire a  change. There is no need of' it fior you. Your silks coxlldl not be more costly, your jewels could not flash more brightly, nor your surroundings be more luxurious. Your life is pleas- ant enough. But I would compel you to think, and tlhinlk- ing, act. I would put upon your shouldelrs responsibilities that would make rational beings of you. I would make you lusefl to humanity and to yourselves. I would give the daughters of the poor, as I have helped to give the sons   .  of the poor, the power in their hands to right their own wxro  inrs.  There is nothing unreasonable in this demand. The change    WHAT STOULD BE DONE WITH IT.      685 is not so great as those the world has endured time and argain without damage. To give the ballot to the women of America to-day, would not be so fearful a thing as it was ten years ago to give it to the ncgro, or as it was a hundred years ago to give it to the people. I would give it, and take the clhances. THe theory of' Republicanism is, that the governing power must rest in tlic hands ot' the governetd. There is no danger iin truth. If thie  woman is governed, she lias a right to a voice in the making of laws. To withhold it is to dwarf her, and to dwarf woman is to dwarf the race. I would give the ballot to woman for her own sake, for I would enlarge the borders of her mind. I would give it to her fob the slake of humlanity. I woukll make her of more use  to hulmanity by inmking her more fit to mould humanity. I would strengthen lher, and thrllloug her the race. The ballot of itself would be of direct use to but few, but indirectly its effects would reach through all eternity. It would compel a different life. It would compel woman to an interest in lifb, would fit her to struggle successfllly against its mischlances,   ! and prepare her for a keelner, higlelr, brighter appreciation of its blessings. Humanity is now onc-sided. There is strongth  on the one side and weaklness on the other. I would have both sides strong.  I would lave the two sides equal in      strength, equally symmetrical; differing only as nature mllade  them, not as man and custom have distorted them.  In tlhis do we  outrage custom? Why, we  have been overturning customs six thousand years, and there are yet enougll hideous enormities oencumbering the earth to take six tlousand yeaIs more to kill. In the beginning, when force was the law, thleroe  were kings. The world tired of Ikings. There were fillso      i religions. Jesus  of Nazareth overturned them. Luther      : wrecked a venerable system  when he struck the churcll of     i Rome with his iron hand; your fathers and mine stabbed a       i loary iniquity when they overturned kingcraft on this conti. nent, and Lovejoy, Garrison, and Phillips struck an institution which ages had sanctioned when they assaulted slavery. The old is not always the best.

I would make them none the less women, but stronger women, better women. Let   v us take this one step for the sake of, humanity. Let us  do this much towards making humanity what the Creator      ' intended it to be,--like Himself.                i   "IN SEARCH  OF THE XMAN OF SIN."            i A LECTURE DELIVERED  IN MUSIC  HALL, BOSTON, DEC. 29, 1870. I DO not wish to be considered egotistic, for of all junior blemishes in human nature egotism is to my mind the most objectionable. He who stands perpetually and perpelndicularly as the capital letter I, with an exclamation point after it (tho latter calling attention to the fobrmer), is an unmixed nuisanilce to society at large, and a particular and especial nuisance to all with whom he may come into more immediate contact. The honesty that needs self-proclamation will bear watching; the man who blows his owln trumpet generally plays a solo; and besides, he adds falsehoocd to egotism, for lihe seldom lias the virtues he proclaims. Honest merit is always retiring and shrinking, - which explains the cause of nmy being so little lknown. Yet a man may at times properly speak of himself; and this is one of the times. That you may start fairly with me I must refer to myself; but I shall do it with that modesty for which I- and George Francis Train - are so celebrated, and touch it as lightly, briefly, and delicately as possible. I am a most excellent man -indeed, I know of no one who has more qualities to be commended, and fiwer to be con- demned. I commenced being good at a very early age, and built myself up on the best models. I was yet an infant when I read the affecting story of the hacking down of the cherry tree by George Washington, and his manly statement to his 'C87  &#xD;<pb n="688-689" xml:id="VAC7107-00000368"/> 688      THE IMTATION OF WASHNGTON. father that he could not tell a lie. I read the story, and it filled me with a desire to surpass him. I was not going to  allow any such boy as George Washington, if he did after-  wards get to be a President, to excel me in the moralities. Imme- ; diately I seized an axe and cut down the most valuable cherry 5 tree my fathler had; and more, I dug up the roots, and burned  the branches, so that by no means could the variety be pro-  served; and I went a skating one Sunday, that I might con-. fess the two faults, and be wept over and forgiven on account of my extreme truthfulness. The experiments were, I regret  to say, partial failures. I was very much like George Wash.  i ington; but the trouble was, my father didn't resemble George  Washinglton's father to any alarming extent, which was essen-  tial to the success of the schenme.              : "Did you cut down that cherry tree?" asked he. "Father, I cannot tell a lie. I did it with my little hatchet," I answered, striking the proper attitude for the old gentleman  to shed tears on. me. But he didn't shed. He remarked that  he had rather I had told a thousand lies than to have cut down that particular tree, and lie whipped me till I was in a state of exasperatingl rawness. As he gave me the last cut, he re- marked that the next time I wanted to give my virtues an airing I had better select a less valuable tree. My skating  idea was no less a failure. I broke through the ice that Sun- day and was pulled out witlh difficulty --and a boat-hook. As  I lay sick for a month with a fever, I didn't get a chance to  get off the Washingtonian remark that time. In addition to my excellence -I might say, absolute per. fection -of character (I put it, you see, as mildly as possible, for modesty prevents me from saying all that I might of my-  self) to these qualities of the heart, I have wisdom-snatural and acquired. Natural iwisdom, for I was born in Maine, which is proof positive, for dothl not the Scriptures say the wise men came from the East? (Their leaving the East was then, as now, the great proof of their wisdom.) Acquired wisdom, in proof of which I cite the fact that I went to Indi- . ana a married man, and after a residence of two years returned with the same wife. I also went to the far West, and came back without investing in a single corner lot. And that, too,   AN EXCELLENT MAN.     '   89 in towns where the speculative proprietors have the thing brought down to so fine a point that they ship the bodies of those who die in them to the East, that the reputation of their embryo cities for health may not be- called in question. I might also say that I am able to put those champion nuisances of the age, life insurance agents, to route, but I will not, for you wouldn't believe it. I am a friend of humanity. I weep with such ease, and so continuously, at the sight of distress, that I am known among my intimate friends as that " benevolent old hydraulic ram." No man living has shed more tears over the woes of humanity, and no man has collected more money - of his neighbors - to relieve those woes. That I am a patriot, I showed by not volunteering in the lato war after I was drafted, but by sending a substitute. So much did I desire the success of the national cause, that I wanted only good men at the front. Th'lle company that I was to have gone in thougilt as I did, as the resolution they passed, tihanking me fervently for sending a man, instead of going my. self, sufficiently attests. I have lived fobr many years in an obscure village in Ver- mont, in which I am a man of some note. It don't take mucll of a man to be of some note in a village of six hundred peo- ple. I have a house there, in which I dwell all alone with my books and ny virtues - studying the one with profit, ;nd contenim- plating the other with delight. I have a farm and a stone quarry there, though it puzzles visitors to determine just whiere tleo fairm ends and the stone quarry begins; and though I don't raise much, I manage to eke out a cornfbrtable existence by selling one thousand-dollar sheep and Early Rose potat6es to westertln farmers, and acting as solicitor for a theological seminary, lec- turing on temperance, and organizing Sunday schools, sand. wicllin in between the two the selling of washing-machines. I was entirely satisfied that I was devoid of sin, and be- lieved (not going out much) that there was none to speak of in my neighbors. But I was aware tlmat outside of' our little world wickedness had a vigorous existence and was rampant' "There are," I said to myself, " 1,000,000,000 of people in the world, my village included, of whom 999,999,400 are morally "              '  &#xD;<pb n="690-691" xml:id="VAC7107-00000369"/> 690      THE BEGINNING OF THE SEARCH. bound to share the fate of the wicked; five hundred and nine- ty-nine may possibly get through by a close shave, and one will be certain of' a blissful future. I had no doubt of the trium- phant escape of one from all the evils which follow wicked- ness, nor need I say that that one, that perfectly pure man -was myself!  But the existence of sin, even at a distance, worried me. I desired to have the whole world as pure, as good, at least, as my neighbors; nay, I would, were such a thing possible, have the whole worlld as pure and asgood as myself, though I dared not to hope for so much. I determined to reform the world, or at least do something towards it. Knowledge of what one is to do is essential to   success, and that I might get that knowledge I deliberately left my home and wandered out in search of the man of sin. Where should I go? To the islands of' the sea, where the rude islanders disport themselves on the burning sands, in  wretched ignorance of' pantaloons, and die cheerful fact that there is a lake of fire and brimstone in which they will event- ually be plunged? No! The missionaries convey to them the catechism,.and teach them to make themselves uncomfort- able in pantaloons; the merchant follows quickly witlh that other civilizing' agent, rum, which to their untutored stomachs is lightning, and those not converted by the one are killed by the other. The islanders are provided for. To Rome? To Paris? To Boston? To the Indians of the West? No! The Italians don't know any better, ko they are not responsible; the Parisians may plead temptations too great to be resisted, for they have the plucking of all the rich idiots in the world. I asked a Boston man, and he indignantly denied that there had been any sin in Boston since Fulton's time; and, as the Indians of the West generally confine their tonsorial operations to government agents, their love of murder becomes a virtue. I went to none of these. Hel who goes in search of sin purchases a ticket for New York - that is, if he desires to see the article in all its native fierceness. Some one said to me that New York was the place to find original sin; but I do not so believe. I found there none but the improved article. When boys of experience go swimming, they plunge into the   THE FIRST VENTURE.        691  water all over, that they may take the shock at once and be done with it. With the same idea, I wanted to see first the hugest and largest specimen of wickedness I could find- the    j Ichthyosaurus of iniquity'---before taking the whales, the por- poises, and the smaller fry.  "Show me the largest thing you have in wickedness," said I to my friend, who immediately tossed up a copper to deter- mine whether he should introduce me to a Wall Street gold speculator, a railroad manager, a ward politician, or a burglar. It was, he said, an even thing between them. The railroad manager was indicated by the fall of coin, and I was intro- duced to one. I found him at ten in the morning managing a road to which he had not the ghost of a title; at eleven, lullch. ing with the ballet girls and their hangers on, wlho found em- ployment at his theatre, which, by-the way, was purchased with money earned by the railroad whcll the stockholders did not get; at twelve, remorselessly ruining a score (of brokers who trusted his word; in the afternoon, dilling with his corps of ballet girls, and his own professional bullies; and going to his bed in the morning, not for sleep, but for the quiet it af- forded him, to devise new and more3 startling ralscalities. This man was a rascal born. He was possessed of' not a particle of principle; there wasn't about him the slightest odor of lion- esty- he would have said " taint " in place of odor; lihe was rotten from top to bottom, and all through. He wallowed in infaimy, not from any necessity, but because lie preferred and liked it. He owned courts of justice, and controlled them; lie had judges in his hands and sheriffs at his beck, and with these as his instruments he committed outrages, the lightest of which, in a decently governed community, would have con- signed him to a cell in a penitentiary, and on the firontier would have made him ornament a limb of a tree. Yet this man was, and is, courted, and flattered, and feasted ; statesmen sit at his table; judges lunch with him, and New York feels hon- ored by his being a citizen. I visited Vanderbilt, and inspected the leaky steamers he sent to California, and from which, passage always being exacted in advance, he made so much money. I gazed with wonder at a brass statue of' himself he erected over the Harlem depot.  &#xD;<pb n="692-693" xml:id="VAC7107-00000370"/> 692      THE MEN OF SIN IN NEW YORK. I should have been pleased with the statu., and thanked the Lord f)r it, had it been the work of his administrators. I interviewed James Gordon Bennett, and spent two days- in Wall Street. Determined to know by actual experiment how far' brazen-faced imposition, deliberate insolence, and l swindling could go, I took rooms at a first-class hotel, where I the clerks wear diamond pins, and where, if you address them as " clerk," you will get no answer, as they insist upon being recognized, not as "clerks," but -as "gentlemen connected with the hotel." That I might know how deep politicians dive, I attended a Democratic caucus in the Sixth Ward, and a few days after stood around the polls and saw the repeaters vote. Following along in this channel, I was presented to Fernando Wood and his brother Ben; and right here I desire to pay a tribute to these men. It requires an intellectual man to be a very bad man. The stupid bad man who merely drifts, will strike occasionally some rich nuggets of sin; the quickl intellect knows where to go for them and how to unearth them. The great bad man must have sense enough to distin- guish between right and wrong, cussedness enough to choose the latter, and brains enough to do something startling in that way. The brothers Wood possess all these qualities in an eminent degree. There may be some sins that they lhave not committed, but if there are, it is only because they could not reach them, and they doubtless experience the pangs of re- morse as they are made aware of their inability. I saw the Hon. John Morrisey, and made the acquaintance of a dozen street contractors. My friend, who knew the ob- ject of my coming, invited me to visit Water Street, and see men of the John Alien stripe, and also to explore the Peter Fullnk auction shops, but I declined. Why go from the greater to the smaller? Why investigate small scoundrels after going through the big ones? I made the acquaintance of a distinguished pugilist who was in training for a congressional nomination. He had comrn mitted a magnificent. burglary, which was complicated some- what with murder, had ]killed a man in a bar-room fight, and was about to appear in the prize ring. It was a blessed thing for me that I got out of Ne w York as /.V   INY WASHNGTON.        693 I did. I hadn't been there three days before I felt an almost irresistible desire to steal something; the fourth dy I could lie like a telegraph despatch, and I suppose in a week I should have got to be as bad as the rest of them. It was also a blessed thing tlat I did not go to Washington during the administrations of Johnson or Buchanan. Going when I did I saw enough. In that virtuous city my investi- gations were confined to the three classes which make up its resident population--namely, those who have been in ofilice, those who are in office, and those who want to be in offioe. They may be distinguished by the paper collars tlhey wear: tle first and last classes always wear dirty ones. Tle first class spends its whole time in devising means to get away; tlho seco nd, in getting their salaries raised that thley may live on  them, and in making tlheir stay perpetual; the third, in getting sometlhing to eat till they get into the second class. AMy in- vestigations were principally among the office-holders, and the highest of them e  I saw cadetships sold for dollars; in fact, I was present at one transaction of the kind where the buyer and the represen- tative who had the place for sale disagreed abolut twenty-five dollars, the difference being almost enough to split the trade. The man who wanted the cadetship swore roundly that he could get one cheaper. The representative swore with equal vehemence that it was impossible, as the vacancies had been mostly sold, and there were but few inl the mtarlket. The scone reminded me so much of an encounter, between two keon horse-jockeys in my beloved Vermont, that, like the Swiss solb dier who hears the music of lIns native mountains, I wept. The buyer insisted that he had been offered them for-less, whereupon  the representative let hm into a congrcssional trade-trick.  He revealed the fact that members who were in arrears for board were in the habit of selling cadetships which they didn't have. 4"Go," said the virtuous member, "go and buy a cadetship of one of them, but demand proof that your son will be appointed, before you pay your money. You'll come back to me quick enough, and be glad to deal with an honest man." The difference was finally compromised. The buyer was one of the aristocracy of America, a manufacturer  &#xD;<pb n="694-695" xml:id="VAC7107-00000371"/> 694        THE SOBER MEMBER. of patent nhedicines, and he had some millions of circulars which he desired to send through the mails. He paid the twenty-five dollars, and in consideration thereof had the use of the member's frank fobr twenty days. I met judges of courts in the Southern States, who, ten years ago, were hostlers in livery stables in the North, and \ I whose knowledge of criminal law they had gained from stand- ing in the prisoner's dock. I met other carpet-baggers, equally meritorious, who overrun the conquered South like locustxs, and who were just as voracious. Here the simile ends. They did not devour the green things they came upon - they pre. served them carefully for the sake of their votes. I was mistaken twice for a correspondent, and was offered a hundred dollars each time to write a speech for a member who was never sober enough to do it for himself. The wife  of the member loved to live int Washington, and she felt that her husband must deliver a speech for effect at home. She assured me that, while that efficient lawmaker was never sober enough to write a speech, she had sufficient confidence in her strategic powers to believe she could keep him sober long enoughbto deliver a short one. This woman was too devoted to her husband, and was wonderful in the ingeniousness of her apologies for his shortcomings. She insisted to his con- stituents that he would never do anything wrong, but for liquor. "He was in liquor when he did it," was her excuse for all his sins. When a temperance man reproached him {br breaking the pledge of' total abstinence, which he took to se- cure his renomination, she exclaimed, with touching pathos, O O, sir, forgive him; he was in liquor when he broke that pledge!" I saw men who had the reputation of being tolerably honest at home, voting away millions of acres of public lands to swindling corporations; but I did not see the transfer to them of their slice of the plunder. If I had seen this part of the play, I would not have exclaimed against their stupidity and carelessness, as I did at the time. In characterizing them as stupid and careless I did them great injustice. Every man of them knew what he was about; in fact, no one but a man who knows what he is about can live in a gorgeous mansion, drink   THE EXTREME RADICALS.       695 champagne, and maintain such luxuries as carriages and servants, in a high-priced city like Washington, on a salary of five thousand dollars per year. It is true they have mileage in addition', andit is true also that melmbers from Now York go to Washington by way of New Orleans, and members from Kentucky by way of Bangor, Alaine, but that will not account for their ability to meet such enormous expenditures. It is a cruel injustice to stigmatize a man as stupid wlio goes to Wasiugstoa poor aLnd returnt rich on that salary. I was particularly interested in men who had managed to maintain their seats in Congress twelve years by riding one hobby, and howling all those terrible years one cry. They were political hand-organs, who could grind out only the tune to which they were originally set, and, disprivacied or un- disprivacied, they ground out that tune with damnable salnme- nes, asdI ftendish contiuoasity. These men were i;capable of voting intelligently on any question, and had not sense enough to know that, when the institution, the denullciation of which had made them, was dead, thlatthey were dead, also. They were political corpses; but instead of being content to rest quietly in their graves, as gentlemanly and well-regtulated corpses do, they insisted upon walkiing up and down the earth with their cerements clinging to them. They insisted uplon re-nominations and re-elections, shrieling that thcir fidclity to principle, as they termed their extreme fidelity to thellselves, entitled th'em to a life-lease of a position in which they might rattle around, but could never fill. (One man, who had represented an advanced anti-slavery district, every voter in which was way beyond Wenldell Phillips in his abolitionism, claimed the admiration of thol world for having never wavered in his devotion to firedom, and the people yielded their praise, forgetting that had ho ever wavered as much as a hair's breadth it would have been. his political death. Because he had always voted with!his, party on the slavery question, which any man who can dis- tinguish between right and wrong may comprehend, he asked to be allowed to continue in Congress and vote upon such questions as banks, tariffs, and other nice points in govern- mental matters, upon which men of ability have spent years  &#xD;<pb n="696-697" xml:id="VAC7107-00000372"/> 696       THE TROUBLED THOMPSON. of earnest thought. One of this class, who was on the Comrn. mittee of Ways and Means, knowing me to be a man of       i business, asked me to tell him something about the National Debt. This legislator explained to me his method of doing the business of the public. He said that it was easy enough in    1866 to vote on the nigger question, even if it did get compli- cated sometimes, for all he had to do was to vote as Thad  v Stevens and Shellabarger did. The roll is called alphlabeti- cally, R S T, &amp;c. His name was fortunately Thompson, and could only be called after Stevens. Had it been Adams, or Albright, or Banning, or Brown, or Curtis, or Channing, lihe would have been compelled to resign. But being Thompson, and T coming in the alphabet after S, it was easy enough.  Stevens, yea; Shellabarger, yea; Thompson, yea; and vice versa. But the poor man was now in a bad way. Stevens is dead, and gone where all good men go. After a stormy life he is at last in heaven and at peace.  In heaven, for he always fiught for the right; at peace, for there are no pro-slavery Democrats there for him to fight. Stevens is dead, and Shellabarger is out of Congress, and the two Republican Representatives in the House whoso names begins with S, are on different sides on all the questions of the day. Puzzled which side to take, he turned to the platforms of the party, but found, to his disgust, that they covered both sides, as all plat. forms do. He had observed that the platforms were always made by Federal office-holders, and singularly enough, that whatever else they might contain, they invariably indorsed the administration of' President Grant, and he went to that great man to find out, if possible, what the principles of the party were. "With which wing do you hold' " asked the perplexed Thompson.       ' "With which wing do I hold? I believe that Dexter is the fastest trotting horse in America," was the clear and satisfac- tory response of this master of statecraft. Thompson was an orator of the florid order, which oratory was the cause of his being inflicted upon a long-suffering and   MANAGEMENT IN POLITICS.    6' 97  patient country. His speaking was corruscativo. It was lurid, loud, and fizzy, as though his parents, just before Iis birti, had sold small beer at, torc'bliglt process:ois and camp- meetings. By-virture of lungs alone, he had managed to pa)ss for something in this easily deceived world. He had main- tained his position all these yearb on the slavery qiesition) alone. When the righteous Fifteonth Amendment was likely to become law, lie played that the Democracy migclt 1be aible to defeat it, for what could he do without that juicy old sill to batter at? He was a reformer; and what is a rebformer with- out something to reform? One might as well be a corn-doctor in a country where the women care nothing fobr small ftet, and the men all wear large and easy boots. I met another class of politicians, who, to some extent, deceived me. I observed a baker's dozen wrll damned, with a vehemence that was edifyting, Slavery and all its outgrowtils. They denounced it as vile, unholy, and uncltristian, and the least of its consequences as. ruinoius and destructive. Tlhey stood a long way in advance of Garrison and Fhilips, and elbowed ont of the way the oldest and most consistent anti- slavery men, on the score of their lack -of Radicalism. I was lost in admiration, but I recovered myself when 1 learned the fact that these men were, as late as March, 1861, dieeudlin, slavery from the Bible, and damnitng, witl equal i'crvcncy, every one who doubted its divinity, its righteousness, or its expediency. Men who were ferocious, fire-eating, pro-slavery men as late as March, 1861, by a sudden shift a month later, won the opportunity of making- sad failures as MAM;jor-Gellels , and afterwards by out-Heroding Herod in thir devotion to liberty and equality, managed to occupy high scats in tho Republican synagogue, from which sublirne heighlts they l(ooked down compassionately upon the old time Liberty-palrty en of 1836, and with contempt upon the Free-soilers of 1848, and til Republicans of 1856. From this I gathered a valuable lesson, namely, that in politics it is v\el to do t\he righlt thing and t e a good man, provided you don't commence doing riglit and being good too soon. It is a good thing in the United States to be an anti-slavery man, provided you were a fierce and bitter pro-slavery man so-late as 1861.  &#xD;<pb n="698-699" xml:id="VAC7107-00000373"/> 698        JENCKS AND REFORM l I was in Washington in the time of alunatic named Jencks, of Rhode Island, who, notwithstanding Ihis experience in the House, fancied lie could get a bill through it that had common sense in it. Laboring under that delusion, he introduced a bill requiring persons aspiring to positions under the govern- ment to appear before a Board of Examiners, and show that they had fitness therefor. He called it a Civil Service bill. The principle of the bill waa to clearly right - so necessary indeed--that I supposed, in my innocence, that it would become law at once. I supposed that members would chafe at the delay in pushing it through committees, and would worry at the time necessary to be sacrificed to red tape before they could get at it. I was the more certain that it would go through, for I knew of persons occupying responsible posi- tions, who never would have been trusted by the men who procured their appointments with any business of their own. I knew of common gamblers and common swindlers in places where they had the handling of government money, and as theyxwrere buying farms in their native counties, on salaries of eighteen hundred dollars per year, it was evident that they handled to advantage. I found, in all the departments, mediocres, imbeciles, incompetents, nothings, rakes, gamblers, peculators, plunderer's, scoundrels; and as this bill of Mr. Jencks was intended to cure all this, I supposed, of course, that it would pass - indeed, I wondered that it had not been made law before. But it did not pass. One Representative was shocked that any one could be so heartless as to propose it. When I intimated that the interests of the people de- manded it, he promptly replied, with a show of much indigna- tion, that take away his patronage, which this bill did, and he couldn't hold his position at all - indeed, without it he couldn't be renominated. "But," said I, "I know of a Revenue Officer of your appointing who is as complete a scoundrel as ever went unhung." "True," was the reply. "I know it, too; but he can carry the delegates of the third ward of my city at any time, and without him at my back I stand no chance whatever." I did not tell him, as perhaps I should have done, that while   THE FRANKING PRIVILEGE.     ' 699 a failure to secure a renomination might work badly for the Representative himself, and possibly for his wife and eldest daughter, and the ring of followers the possession of the offices . gave him, nevertheless the rest of the world would manage to get along in some wav if he were not renominated. I did not intimuate, which I might have done, that the very flct that he could not be renominated but for the influence given hiim by the offices he controlled, was a good reason why he should not be renominated indeed, a sufficient one. But this Repre- sentative was laboring under the delusion that he was in Washington solely for his own benefit, and I discovered that perhaps half his associates cherished the salme idea. I did suggest to him that he might go out of Congress and go home. "But what could I do at homo?" he asked. The conundrum was too heavy for me, and I gave it up. I couldn't really see what such a man could do at home. And as I saw so many like him, it occurred to me that in half the diatricts, at least, whenever they foundl a man absolutely good for nothing that they knew of, they sent him to Congress, on the principle that there must be some use for all men. And in filling other official positions, the rule, adopted was precisely opposite that which governed men in the selection of men to do their own, business. The question of fitness was never raised, and the st-rongest thing th:to conld be stid ftor 'a man. was, that he couldn't get a living at anytlhing else. The offlices of the country were made into so many lhospitals for genteel imbecility. I staid in Washington long enough to witness an effort to repeal the fianking privilege. I saw it stated-- nay, proven --that members had sold the use of their franks to lottery dealers, to bogus publishers, to patent medicine mten -to all, in short, who desired the free use of the mails. I waded through columns of figures, showing the cost of delivery of thousands of tons of that delightful and improving literature -Patent Office Reports and Statistics of Commerce - to thle people (the statistics of commerce going invariably to farmers, and the agricultural reports to merchlants), the printing anld carryingr of which was to be charged directly to this privilege.  &#xD;<pb n="700-701" xml:id="VAC7107-00000374"/> 700        THE WAY TO REPEAL. I saw tons of public documents, in their original wrappers, piled up in the shops of the dealers in old paper, all of which the government paid a dozen prices for, as it does for every. thing else. I lnew one young man in my native town, born   I of poor but lhonest parents, who had ambition to rise. He  supposed that a careful reading and study of the reports was I necessary to his being well informed, and with a heroism that would have made him great, had it been properly directed, lhe did read all that his Congressman sent him. In one year that hapless youth was in a lunatic asylum, and his Represen- tative wasn't much of a man for sending documents either. I saw the poor fellow a week ago sitting by a table in a state of  hopeless Iunacy, muttering to himself something about the imn- ports of hides from Brazil. As in the case of the Civil Service bill, I supposed thoe repeal would pass at once, but I was un- deceived one night. I was present at a caucus called to stran- gle it by the loudest-mouthed advocates of the measure. I   I was made aware that the proposition to repeal was merely a tub thrown  to that stupid whale, the public, with which it should amuse itself till the throwers got safely away with the plunder they had previously grabbed. I saw the same thing -done with other measures in other ways. I knew one member who had been elected by pledging himself to the repeal of a law obnoxious to tho people of his district, who called a meeting of members to insure its defeat as soon as he should introduce it. He secured enough votes to derbat it certainly, and then brought in his bantling a,d made a sham figlt over it, in which there was much beating of rllhetorical gongs, and much blowing of oratorical trumpets, and he pretended to weep  with "age when it was strangled. The ingenious man was, of course, applauded by his constituency for his manly struggle in defence of the right, and triumplhantly elected. His constituents denounced bitterly, by resolution, the mem- bers who voted against the measure, but as they represented other districts it didn't hurt them much. "Why," I  exclaimed in wonder, ", doesn't some honest mem- ber expose these scoundrelly practices?" "Where will you find the honest member?" was the perti- nent interrogatory in answer.   IN NEW JERSEY.         701 I saw offices created for the sole purpose of making places for the adherents of members. I attended caucuses, and boundl that, in the discussion of pending measures, the only question was, How will this affect the party '? "  I saw measures, the success of which seemed to me to be of the highest and grav- est importance, slaughtered mercilessly, that the re-election of one member might be assured; and I saw the nation mado ab- surd in thle eyes of the world, because one member had a thlousand Irish votes in his district whlich he was trying to catch by baiting them with thin buncombe.  I saw members friom one State agree to vote for swindles proposed by mem. bers from other States, upon condition that the favor slhould bo returned on demand.  I saw women of' doubtful character- no, there was nothing doubtful about that--carrying swindles through Congress by force of their blandishments, and I saw gamblers and pugilists wielding an influence that Clay and Adam- never possessed. When I went to Washington I leaned towards the idea of universal salvation - I left as rigidly orthodox as the most rigid could desire. I was convinced that if there was no lake of fire and brimstone, and a very hot one, in the future, there had been a gross error made. Afterwards I returned to my original belief; but in view of the fhct that even Congressmen were to be eventually saved with otlhers, I had to recall the other fact that the thieves on the cross were pardoned, lbforo I could comprehend the deptlis and breadth of infinite mercy. 3Iy soul was debilitated with the quantity and quality of tlie depravity I had taken in, and I wanted a moral tonic. I lef't Washington  and went to Trenton, the ctapital of New Jersey, to recuperate.   I tarried in Trenton, believing that members of the State legislature, being chosen from the rural popula- tion, in coming to a State capital I had struck the right shop for virtue. I was undeceived- indeed, I was in tlhe business of being undeceived. Before I had been about the State House a day I saw enough stupidity, peculation, and corruption to make me almost despair of popular government. "l  Thank God!"  I exclaimed, "thfat Japanese customs tdo not prewvail in New Jersey." "To what particular customs do you allude? "  asked a New &#xD;<pb n="702-703" xml:id="VAC7107-00000375"/> 702          A MONOPOLY. Jersey man, who had spent a whole winter in a vain attempt to restrain a monopoly which was devouring his substance. "I allude to that one which compels a Japanese official to rip his bowels the moment he commits a blunder or a crime. I thanked the Lord that it did not obtain here, for if' it did,  there never would be a quorum in the New Jersey legis- lature." Never shall I forget the look of indignation that venerable man fixed upon me. "You are a man," said he, "and doubtless had a mother. Can you cherish such a hatred of the people of New Jersey as to thank God that the lack of a custom so wholesomne as the one you mention entails upon them' such a legislature?" } And he lifted up his hands in horror. I saw a bill introduced contracting the privilege of a monop. oly. I saw the attorney of that monopoly meet the members who had introduced and advocated the bill, and ask in plain, unvarnished English, without circumlocution or attempt at dis- guise, how many dollars paid in hand they would take to kil' it. One new member--he was in his first session, and was therefore virtuous--opposed the sale vigorously. He was offered one hundred dollars, but he refused, denouncing the monopoly as odious. At two hundred and fifty dollars, lihe was n't quite certain that it was a monopoly; at five hundred dollars, lie knew it wasn't a monopoly, but he thought that the interests of the people demanded a curtailment of privilege, at least in part; at seven hundred and fifty dollars, lie really did not know what to do about it-it was a puzzling thing, and required thought; at one thousand dollars he swore that the company was a blessing to the State, and that the attempt to injure it by imposing legislative restrictions was an outrage, and he voted against the bill with thundering emphasis. This man's sense of right, like an old musket, was honeycombed, and not strong enough at the breech to bear a severe trial without bursting. One thousand dollars was too much pres- sure on the square inch, and it exploded. The money was paid, the bill was defeated by the men who introduced it, and that night the hotels swam in champagne.   AN ANECDOTE.       '  703 "If there is no virtue in rural legislators," I asked myself, "where will you look for it?" I pondered on this conundrum, and finally got an answer. Less should be expected of a ruralist than of the more wealtlhy  dweller in cities. Human nature is the same in city and coun- try. It takes less to make a yeoman rich than it does a bank- ll er or merchant, and consequeutly it takes less to buy him. "( But don't the perpetrators of all this iniquity get fearful  sometimes of being brought to account?"I asked. "4No," was the answer. "Firm in the belief that mankind  is divided into two classes, rascals and ninnies, thley march on confident and secure. They fleece the ninnies, and divide with the rascals, which is the sum total of New Jersey logis- lation." "But reputation?"I said, inquiringly. My friend replied. with an anecdote after the manner of' Lin- coln. Two fellows were in a lock-up one night, a policelman having picked them up forl being drunk -tand disorderly. One of them was in that peculiar stage of drunklenness in which the victim feels lie is abused. "This is infamous," lhe said. "My reputation is lost " "Lost! - your reputation's lost!" exclaimed the otilier with a thick voice, as he clung swaying to the bars. 'Your repu- tation's lost! There ain't nothing mean about me, Harry; tako mine!" "There isn't," said the cynic, "a member of t}he body who wouldn't be glad to trade his reputation {ov a nyb!,ody else's.' I went sadly on. Sadly, fobr in my investigations I I1ad( found a thousand times more of inliquity thlan I lad any idea could have existed. I had not calculated on the certaillty of the crop or the enormity of the yield. Iistarted out, like thle naturalist, in search of what I supposed to be a rare plant, and I found myself in a wilderness of it. I expected to browse about the world, taking here a nip and there a nip of iniquity, but I found myself, whichever way I turned, in broad meadows of it, like a horse in clover. I had founld the mran of sin 11on- ored in business circles in New Yorl, honored and applauded at the National capital, and in the State capitals. He had been  &#xD;<pb n="704-705" xml:id="VAC7107-00000376"/> 704        THE REFORMERS.         ,  introduced to me as a merchant, as a railroad manager, as a banker, as a representative; I found him in the senate, in the cabinet, and on the supreme bench; I saw him sitting in force in both branches of a State legislature; I, found him every- where.  On my way home I stumbled into a convocation of reformers, who had gathered to organize for the promotion of an object in which I could see great good. I seated myself as gladly in their midst as a traveller in the great desert sits down by the side of running water and under the grateful shade of trees. Here, I thought, there can be neither enmty, malice, ambition, or self-seeking, for these labor for humanity; each will insist not upon his own good, but the preferment of others. I ex- pected to find so much of self-abnegation that I was troubled when I thought how much valuable time would be wasted in vain attempts to organize, as each would be determined to   , force the honor of the movement upon others. There were seventy present, and it was agreed to elect the officers of the association by ballot. Alas! for my belief. When the ballots were counted out it was found that sixty. nine of the seventy had each just one vote for president, and the handwriting on the ballots betrayed the awkward fact that each had voted for himself. One had two votes, - his own and mine,--which elected himin; whereupon the meeting broke up in disorder, and each of the sixty-nine started a society of his own, of which he could be the head. All my life I hadc occupiped what, might be called a neutral  position on the Woman question. I had been what might be called a Conservative-Radical; or, to state my position more definitely, for I like to be accurate, a Radical-Conservative. I had not so highll  an opinion of the sex as some of my friends, or so low as others. There are those who are so crazy in their adoration of the sex, as to assert that no man ever met a woman without being the better for it. These I always crushed, by asking them if Adam was the better for having met Eve? On the other hand, when a railer at the weaknesses of the sex would assert that no woman ever kept a secret, I crushed them, by demanding the name and post-office address of any unmar- ried woman above twenty-five who had ever divulged her age,   WOMAN.         '  705 or any woman, married, single, or divorced, wlio ever confided to any one the fact that lher hair, teeth, or complexion were artificial. I held, and had alwayvs, that the virtues were inhe- rent in woman, and so believing, felt it unnecessary to look for sin among them, that is, to any alarmincg extent. My experience in New York, Washington, and Trenton shook my taith} in woman somewhat. 1 discovered that women can be wicked, and when they are wicked they are very wick- ed. I found that they are not all truthlful; and that when they set out to lie, they do it with an ease, a grace, a smoothness that sugar-coats the most audacious falsification, and makes it go down as easily as the sweetest truth. I founc(, thlem horri- bly insincere in everything relating to the stronger sex. They would flirt and trifle with them, and I never lhear(d but ono wlho even condemned the practice, and her conddennationa se- vere as it was, did not count whe'n I cited it, for she was thirty-nine, and had had small-pox, and cross-eyes, and wore a wig, and was thin and angular, and( had freckles, and very sandy hair, and her nose turned up, and her teeth were bad, and she didn't know how to dress, and had large feet, and very large, bony hands, and a stoop in her shoulders, and some other defects in her person unnecessary to enumerate, as fromin what I have said regarding her you may intfer that she was not the belle of her native village. She protested vellemently against this thing of ensnaring young men, and when thley had lost all control of themselves in their adoration, of casting them off he nrtlely. She had never done it, nor never would - she had always -lasted their budding hopes at the begin- ning. When I repeated this noble resolution to a bevy of girls, dressed artlessly in ringlets and wlhito muslin, they winked at each other and tittered. The noble exasmple I fet before them did not produce the effect I hoped. I found them vain. I knew Nwomen between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four whlo habitually consumed four hours each day in adorning their persons, thiat they might enjoy tho ecstasy of a half hour's promenade .to show their feathers. They never returned in good humor -they were invariably disappointed. If there should be no crowd to gaze upnon tlhem, they lost the object of their going; if there was a crowd, they 45  &#xD;<pb n="706-707" xml:id="VAC7107-00000377"/> 706        ANOTHER ANECDOTE. always encountered some woman arrayed still more gorgeously, which was poison. Then, again, they lack judgment as to the men upon whom to lavish their admiration. They esteem ap- pearance and pretension more than they do real manly beauty and intellect. I have known them to pass ME by with the merest and coldest nod, and blossom out all over with smiles at the approach of a fop, whose mustache was like a base ball  club, nine on a side, and whose other points were as weak as his mustache.        1 But these were the lightest of the sins I found I would have to charge to them. I found that they were sometimes avari- cious, and that when avaricious, for absolute dawnright stingi- ness and closeness the most intense miser was an infant be- side them. As their capacity for good was greater and higher than man's, so was their capacity for evil, which made me thank the Lord that physically they are weaker, and that home influences set the most of their heads in the right direction, and the lack of opportunity keeps them following their noses. But I saw fearful evidences of their capacity for making trouble. I met one beautiful girl, so modest in appear- ance as to disarm suspicion that she could do anything that savored of worldliness, who sued a rich widower for breach of promise. This modest, shrinking, delicate girl was at that very time engaged to a penniless young man whom she really loved. To make sure that the damages to be wrested from the rich widower would be large enough to set her affianced up in business, she got judge and jurymen crazy in love with her, and engaged herself to every one of them. Each one now had a direct interest in the verdict, for each one expected to marry the plaintiff, and a verdict would be her dowry. Tile judge annihilated the gay old Lothario in his charge, and the jury, without leaving the box, decided that her heart had been broken, and that twenty thousand dollars was the least salve that could be applied to the breach. The jurymen were heart- broken when they found her married to her young man; the extent of the chagrin of the judge may be inferred from the fact that he resigned his office - a thing never done save when a lacerating necessity exists. The widower was heart-broken when the amount of the verdict was announced, and at' the   FEMNINE EXTRAVAGANCE.      707 loss of reputation; the girl and her new husband, who had in- vested largely in furniture and things on the strength of fho verdict, were heart-broken when they discovered that the de- fendant, against whom they had judgment, had been speculat- ing in gold, and had taken Jim Fisk's word, and consequently was not worth a dollar in the world. An4 \th this misery re. sulted from the duplicity of one woman. My attention was, however, directed more particularly to their intolerable extravagance and recklessness in expenditure, at which my soul groaned. I observed women whose chignons were larger than them- selves, whose ordinary dress cost more thhn an ordinary farm, and whose habits had become so luxurious as to make the sup- port of one a matter of grave consideration. Particularly was I shocked to notice in all cases tlat trimming -the mere orna- mentation-cost twice or thrice as mnuch as the dress itself; and that the labor of making and attaching this ornamentation was more than either. I saw genius employed, not in perma- nently beautifying the world, but in decking a weak woman for an afternoon walk or drive. I wept bitter tears as 1 saw on their heads false hair, on their cheeks artificial color, and over all dress, the primary object of which was appelarance. I cast up in my mind the cost of apparel whch would serve all the real uses of clothing, namely, the protection of the body from the elements, and sighed as I compared it with the bills of the dressmaker. And all this extravagant expenditure in a world in which there are thousands in darkness for want of means to enlighten them, and thousainds starving for want of food. When I reached home I thanked the Lord that I brought with me a moral constitution sound and unimpaired. As I neared my village, and saw the spire of the church rising[ above the grove in which it nestled, I involuntarily thanked Heaven that I could lay me down that night where there was no sin. During my absence I had acquired a habit of observation which' I could not help indulging, and I commenced making notes of what few trifling departures came under my notice. I did observe that Seth Robinson, - D6acon Robinson,- ono of our two merchants, was given to covetousness, and nour- XI  &#xD;<pb n="708-709" xml:id="VAC7107-00000378"/> 708         HOME EXAMPLES. ished too strong a desire for worldly goods. To get gain he would rise every morning at the unchristian hour of' four to set his store in order, and the hours between fourl and seven he passed in nervous misery, waiting for customers who were yet taking that last delicious nap before rising which all prop- erly constituted and evenly-balanced men and women so highly appreciate. Tihen he pursued his business all day so eagerly, was so careful that in every transaction the odd penny should be turned in his favor, held open his place of business so late in the night to catch the last late buyer, and finally closed so regretfully to think that eight long hours would elapse before there could be more money-getting. Of all this I could hardly approve. It is well for the new beginner to have all this .care, and be at all these pains for dollars, for he hath his fortune to make. It would be well for one advanced in years, who was accumulating money for some great charity, to be thus eager in pursuit of coppers; but the Deacon is not only rich, but he is sixty. He can't enjoy the money he has on this earth; lie cant't take it with him; and if he could it would do him no good - it would melt! He will hold to every dollar he can make so long as there is strength in his fingers. Money-getting, in his case, is simply avarice,- the desire to get money for the sake of money,- which is about the lowest and the meanest of the vices. What better is the Deacon tlan Fisk or Vanderbilt, save in the ex- tent of their operations? The one grasps dollars, the other pennies; but they both grasp, and therein is the sin. The Deacon is a small Vanderbilt; but unfortunately sins are esti- mated as are eggs--by count, not weight. The sin is as heinous if it does not produce such great results. I turned from Robinson, and contemplated his rival in busi- ness - Bibney. Bibney was the opposite of Robinson, and to me a more pleasing picture to look upon. He was noted for his charity, and was regarded by his neighbors as one whose soul melted with love to all mankind. I saw him give five dollars to a poor man who had fallen on the street, and I warmed towards him, for the man was needy, and I was exercised in Iny mind for fear that some of my neighbors would not relieve him. I would have liked it better had he slipped the money z   BIBNEY AND MRS. SWAN.       709 quietly in his hand and passed on. I thought at the time that he was rather loud-mouthed in his pity, and that he brandisled his bank-note in the faces of the crowd that had gathered twice or thrice too many times, but lie gave the five dollars. I was astonished, and confess grieved, on tracking this charity to its hole, - for it ended in a hole, - to find that le paid the vil- lage editor twice the amount of the gift to have a circunmstan- tial account of the transaction published to the world. I was more astonished and more grieved at unearthing the fact that he had arranged with the mendicant to fhll where lie did, that a crowd might be gathered to witness his generosity. I no- ticed also that the fifteen dollars had been well expended, for his store was crowded for a week. Bibney's wife belonged to the Presbyterian churcl, but ho attended them all. He had the reputation of giving liberally to all, but the acute man managed to nmaintain a reputation bor liberality without giving to any. Tle Presbyterians tnever got anything, " for you know," hto would say, "I have to give to all of tlem, and really it is too much of a tax." To the others lie would plead his wife's membership with tl I'Presbyterians, and the fact that it took all that lie could afford friom other cllali- ties to keep " our own church going." I saw him onc walk a square out of his way for a week'to avoid the necessity of dropping at small coin into the box of a disableo soldier, who was grinding a livelihood out of an exasperating hand-organ. I found an admirable contrast to Bibney in Mrs. Virginia Swan, the gifted writer of spiritual hymns. "Tllere," said I to myself; " must be a perfect character. These outgushilgs of love for her kind, these verses'swelling with love7 geu- tleness, and goodness, can only flow from a pure soul. Thlo fountain must be pure if the stream is." I found tlhat tlis theory will do better in the matter of streams thlan in souls- that very barren souls are full of sentiment, and gush, and gush, and do nothing else. Wilen I got to the bottom of it, I found that Mrs. Swan wrote ler beautiful spiritual hymns in the coldest-blooded business way imaginable. She panted for fime, and lhad the knack of writing hymns. Determined to make a name, she commenced writing conic songs, and would have continued had she made a success. But she did not;  &#xD;<pb n="710-711" xml:id="VAC7107-00000379"/> 710      MESSRS. BLACK AND KITT.    .  and she attempted blood-and-thunder novels, till Sylvanus Cobb drove her from that field, when she struck the spiritual vein, and worked it to great advantage. She would have writ- ten bacchanalian odes just as soon if it would have given her the same notoriety. The soul of the poetess would shed the sweetest charity, and pity, and love, and so forth, but the hand of the poetess never shed bread and meat and potatoes enough to 'keep her servant girl plump in her clothes. I was com- pelled to give her up. Spiritual hymns can't be offset against starving servant girls, until the reading of spiritual hymns, will make them as plump as will the meat and potatoes they ought to have. The Reverend Elnathan Black, I thought, would help me out of my trouble, for he had always been to me the chief among ten thousand, and the one altogether lovely. I supposed him to be a perfect man, if such there could be on the face of tile earth. But, alas! I was mistaken in this as in everything else. A close examination - a little stripping off of veneering here, and a little digging out of putty there, showed me the ugliest and most ungainly piece of moral furniture I had ever seen. He had plastered pretence over meanness, and his protests. 'tions of goodness covered his daily violation of everything  good. He wore his piety on the same principle that governed the Quaker when he said to his son, "John, if thee has a par. ticularly bad horse to trade off, put on thy broadest hat." Tile Elder always had a bad horse to trade off, and he wore, habit- ually, a broad hat, and an ugly looking sinner he was with- out it. Deacon Kitt served to prolong my investigation just a min- ute. Professing temperance in all things, he was a glutton, and carried a red nose. He took his rations rergularly, but not honestly. He did not confess to himself that he really loved stimulants, but he was perpetually persuading himself that he had the dyspepsia, and needed it. He wasn't ingenious even in his excuses for drinking, for when reproached with taking liquor raw, he stammeringly replied that le didn't dare to put water in it for fear of dropsy. His entire devotion to drink I noticed the first time the unsophisticated man was given a mint julep, which he said he took for dyspepsia. With the   POLITICAL SIN AT HOME.      7 " taste of the delicious compound titillating his palate,--the coolness of the ice 'struggling with the genial warmth of tl\e liquor, - the fragrance of the miSnt assailing one sense, while the other ingredients held mastery over the others, the poor man dropped his glass and burst into tears. "And there ain't none of this in the next world," gasped lie. "I neverC dreaded death as mutch as now." He was trying to deceive the world, and succeeded, as is always the case, in deceiving himself. His neighbors were certain of his being a confirmed drunkard, long before he began to suspect it. I was by this time in a state of disgust. I had gone abroad for sin, and had found it; and I had found under my very nose almost every sin that had startled me abroad. But one thought gave me comfort - there could be no political iniquity in our community. Walking out one afternoon, I found myself in a crowd, who. were listening to an orator, who proved to be none otlherl tlian Cicero Leatlerlungs, my cousin, who had served one term in Congress, and was a candidate for re-election. I llad never given Cicero credit for being mnuch of a patriot, and was therefore delighted at the amount of' it lie exlhibited, as well as with the eloquence with which lie adorned it. He de- nounced, in burning words, the corruptinu of which l\is op- ponent had been guilty -the said denunciation illcluding not only the particular species of corruption his opponent was charged with practising, but all other kinds. Particularly was the use of money in elections denounced as anti republican, and calculated to sap the very foundations of the government. I was so delighted at this, that the very moment he had finished I rushed up to congratulate him. "Your nobllo sentiments," I said,- but I never finished the sentenice. iHo hurried away to a tavern hard by to meet his committee. I followed and got inside just in time to see tloat pure patriot- that incorruptible man - pull filom lhis breast pocket a plethoric pocket-book, and distribute money to the most villanous and brutish men I had ever seen, and of whose existence I l1ad been ignorant up to this moment. , He gave this one one hun- dred dollars to be offered Jones for the use of his doggery on election day; that one fifty dollars to keep the Irish laborers  &#xD;<pb n="712-713" xml:id="VAC7107-00000380"/> 712         THE PURE CICERO. in Johnson's stone-quarry drunk till after they had voted; another one hundred dollars for carriages and men to bring to the polls the idiots and lunatics from such of the county poor- houses as were under the control of his friends; winding up with the remark, as he put up his pocket-book, that by the time he got the other four counties fixed, he would have spent every last cent of the money he got for his vote in favor of the Aurora Borealis Railroad Land Grant. These things had all been charged upon Cicero, and I dis- covered that the best and most intelligent of his supporters knew the charges to be true; but they were supporting him nevertheless, for he was " our candidate,." "But how came so bad a man to be our candidate? I asked; the answer to which was, that when he was nominated the first time his worthlessness was not known; that when his had qualities were discovered, he declined to be dropped. He had the appointing of all the Federal officers in the Dis- trict; -these officials were strong and active enough to con- trol the conventions that nominate candidates for the elective offices, and these two classes of officials control the Congres- sional nominating convention. In short, I ascertained the important fact that, let a bad man once get into Congress, he can, if he is shrewd, stay there a' long time, for the government kindly furnishes him the means to perpetuato 'his stay. By this time I had determined in my own mind that there wasn't a particle more of sin abroad than at home. Every sin that I discovered abroad, I found duplicated at home, and its grbwth wfas just as rank and vigorous. The plant was native to all soils: the only difference was in size, resulting from the strength or weakness of the soil in which it was planted. Grieved as I was, I took comfort in the thought that I, at least, was free from it. That thought gave me unspeakable happiness, and I determined that my household should be as free from it as myself. My wife was a woman; and I noticed that she nourished all the follies of the sex. She was as extravagant in dress as any of her friends, and I took her to task for it. I told her that there were thousands of suffering poor in the world whose   A WIFE'S FAULTS.        713 necessities could be relieved by a tithe of what she wore that was unnecessary. I reminded her of the fact thlat flounces, furbelows, jewelry, flse hatir, &amp;c., were totally useless, and could be dispensed with as well as not, and how mellch better would it be to use the money they cost in chLaritable workls. And I showered over her nmuch wisdom of this kind. Slio was an obedient wife, and bowing her head submissively, retired to her room, from which she emerged in a few minutes. She had carried out my wishes to the letter. Slhe was without loops, and her dress hung limp about lher person. Her chignon, which was her crowning glory, was gone, and her natural lhair was twisted into a sn'xll nal in^sgnificant knot at the back of her head. Slhe had no collar, no cufls, no rings, pins, in sIhort she was divested of all those helps to figure and fonrm which the sex know so well how to employ. Ordinarily she was counted a handsome woman;- as she stood before me in that shape, I confess I was :astounded at her superlative ugliness. "Come," said she, meekly. "It is time we were on our way to the concert." I did not go to the concert with my wife in that guise. On the contrary, with much hernmming and h:awing,- for no Ian likes to go back on himself; - I meekly asked her to resume lier natural garb. My experiment at reform with the female part of my houise- hold had the appearance of a failure. I was compelled to col- fess that, after all, we, the stronger s3ex, who rail at the extrava- gance of women, are in the main responsible' for it; that tlhe average woman dresses herself more to please the average man than to please herself; and further, that the Caverage mant likes her a thousand times better for the additional bcinty and  grace that dress gives lher, all of which she perfectly understands. Still I felt that the wants of the poor must be relieved, and that the relief ought to come out of our superfluities. I there- fore nerved myself to make a sacrifice. I sold my gold watch' and purchased a silver one in its stead, and the difference- I invested in government bonds, which were at that time at a discount, with a certainty of a rise.  &#xD;<pb n="714-715" xml:id="VAC7107-00000381"/> 714       A CLOSER INVESTIGATION. My habit of investigation had got possession of me. While I was congratulating myself on my righteousness, and deploring every one else's sin, it so happened thatl1 was bargaining for a piece of real estate acdjoining my own. In the course of the making of the bargain, I caught myself deliberately underrat- ing the property, and most zealously endeavoring to get it for less than I knew it to be worth. My late experience had given me a sharp scent for sin, and I had learned to detect it at sight. I was astonished at the richllness of the vein I struck, even in myself. I found that in my own case I had mistaken dys- Fepsia for humility, obstinacy for devotion to principle, and conceit for righteousness generally. I found, for instance, that rmy sternness in withstanding public opinion was not so much the willingness to be sacrificed for the sake of right, as it was a mule-like disposition to stay where I had planted my hoofs, from sheer stubbornness in refusing to admit that I had ever been or ever could bein the wrong. I recalled the con- versation I had with my neighbor on the subject of the land, and, to my horror, I found that within twenty-four hours I had told sixty lies direct; one hundred and thirty by implication, and had made two hundred misrepresentations, which the recording angel doubtless counted as lies, though iln this world of gigantic illsification- they hardly rise to that dignity. I lied because I coveted my neighbor's land- two sins in one. In what am I better than Robinson. The very next day I found myself paying too close attention to the wife of my neighbor Ames-Ames being in California, and Mrs. Ames being a beautiful woman ; and one more of the pillars of my self:righteousness was knocked out from under me. That same afternoon, in paying a note, 1 permitted a mistake made by the holder thereof in computing interest to go uncorrected, and I was compelled to confess myself a thief. The next day I tarried two hours and a half at dinner, which stamped me as much of a glutton as Kitt. When the blessing was asked, reference was made therein to Providence for llis good gifts. I only thoughllt how good Providence was that gave us asparagus in the spring, then in succession green peas, strawherries, grapes, oysters, spareribs, hot whiskey, and   THE MAN OF SIN FOUND.       715 so on, an unending round of something good to eat and drink. I was no better in this than Kitt--not a particle. That very evening  I colored the statement of the trouble of a neighbor, whom I did not like, to his great disatvalll- tage, and brought myself in guilty of bearing false witness against my neighbor; I caught myself in church estimating thle probable profits of a business operation I had just concluded; which satisfied me that I had other gods than the one Living One; in short, I discovered the alarming fact, that every day of my life I commlitted all the sins in the Decalogue. I had been horrified at the sin I had seen away; more so at learning that all I had seen abroad was going on regullarly at home; and still more so to find that all I had found away ,lld at home existed in f'ull force and vigor in myself; tlat I cherished and practised in one form or another every sin that I had seen in anybody else. And what hun  bledl meo was the fact, that the knowledge that I liad all these moral blemishes was not confined to myself. My discovery of tho fact was recent - my neigllhbors lad always lknoll it. 1 at last found the man of sin. I was tie man.  I am now busily engaged in reforming, -- not the world, but myself, -and I hope I am succeeding,   I succeeded in clhecking myself in time to save lies only yesterday; I am now correct- ing 'all errors in accounts that are in my favor; in short, by dint of hard work and careful watching, 1 have'got to a point of excellence where it is perfectly safe to say tlhat I am no longer distinctively " the man of' sin." My hearers, all of you wlho try hard enough and watch closely enough, may, in tlio course of a great many years, if you are gifted and have patience, get to be as good as I am. I know you will shrink from a task so apparently hopeless, but I assure you the re- ward is great enough to justify the trial.  &#xD;<pb n="716-717" xml:id="VAC7107-00000382"/> APPENDIX. Our  apology for inserting, just befdre the title in this volume, the page (if torn out by interested parties, as possibly it may be, we will supply it upon application) contaniing a caution to persons wishing to procure the work, and also for calling your attention to some matters peltaining to the business of publimshing and intro- ducing books, is, that we can devise ,lo other melanls which we deem so effectual to protect our businIess from the aggressions of' dishonest parties; and although this method may seem in bad taste, yet we feel warranted in using it, lolping hereby to aid in correctingl certain existing evils pertaining to the business. In this country there are two ways in which books are introduced to the public: one is, where they are sold through boolkstoles, which is known as the trlade method; the other is, whlere they are sold only (or intended to be) by canvassing agents, wlhich is called the subscriDtion system. We are engaged in the latter; and what we complllin of, not only in our own interest, but in the interest of others who have exhausted every exDedient they could devise to keeD thleir publications from being sold in bookstores, is this: That some booksellers (there are many honorable exceptions), in collusion with dishonest general and sub-agents, or professed agent%, for suthseription books, are per- sistently and maliciously warring upon it by unfaiir and friaudulent means, with, the avowed purpose of injuring the business of the sub- scription publishers as ntmuch as possilble, and at the game time mak- ing a profit in the transaction. They recognize the fclt that for introducing certain classes of books it possesses great adviantages over the other method, and hence should be strangled lest it takes too large a p)ortion of the loaf they desire to monopolize; and to do this they resort to various means that will not render them amenable to the law, without regard to fairness or honesty. That it does possess such advantages is best evidenced by the fact that almost every extensive trade publishing house in America has brought out and introduced more or less books in this manner. As booksellers are able to procure most subscription works only through a dishonest channel, except possibly occasional second-hand ones, a few of them make tools of some, general and sub-agents, or 716   APPENDIX.            717 professed agents, and thus obtain this class of works with which to supply the trade. These agents are usually the most culplable parties to the transaction, as they know the publishers of nmost, if not all, of such works intend them to be sold only by subscription, and generally these pairties who betray subscription publislefrs, are either under bonds, or bound by a written or verbal agreement, to finrnish the books only to bona fide subscribers, and not directly or indirectly to booksellers; and the latter usually know the fact, but notwithstand- ing all this they have practised for years past this method of obtain- ing subscription publications to sell from their counters. We have known them, when unable to find an agent sufficiently plif:ble for their purposes, to induce a party engaged in another pursuit, and who had no intention of canvassing, to take the agency, under an assumed name, and though under agrieenment to sell the books only to bona fide subscribers, which they well knew, to represent to the publishers that he had secured many gellnuine orders, procure of them a large nunlber of books, and inmediately turn them over to the instigators of this fraudulent transaction. We have .lrso known them to induce a clerk, emlpiloyed in their store, to take lan agency, under a like agreement, for a subscription work published at some place remote fi'om them (if too near home the danger of detection is so great as to check this practice), and to obtain the books and dis- pose of themni in the same way. We have likewise knlown of a bookseller, Who, under a fictitious name, secured an agency by representinig thalt lie wisIled to canvass, and then in due time pretending that lie liadl many subscribers, to obtain the books and dispose of' them in }part at retail in his stove, and the balance to other booksellers. In fact, these and similrlli dis- honest expedients for obtaining this class of works to be sold in this manner, are continually practised, alnd mlost of thenm so sold aire thus obtained. We have known instances where' agents were en- gaged in selling new and popular subscription books at the regulabr retail prices, and the same works at the same time and place were being conspicuously exposed for sale in bookstores, with labels on them offering them at a price fifty cents a volume less. We apprehend the profit in such cases was not the object the booksellers liad in view, for they might just as readily have obtained the legular price, as the books were in great demand. This and other facts induce us to believe and affirm, that some booksellers are deliberately doing all they can to work injury to the subscription business. The chief reasons why we, and others likewise engaged, object to our1 publications being sold in bookstores, are, first, it negatives the theory on which the business is based; second, it seriously  &#xD;<pb n="718-719" xml:id="VAC7107-00000383"/> 718            APPENDIX. interferes with the success of canvassers by greatly diminishing their sales, and otherwise ; and third, many of the best agents in the coun- try will only introduce a book while it is kept out of bookstores, and as soon as it gets to be generally on sale there, they decline longer to solicit for it. When this condition of affairs arises, the sub. scription publisher not only loses many of his best agents, but is otherwise materially damaged. The public are also unfavorably affected in several ways. Aside from our own interests, we particularly desire, in the interest of our best agents, to keep our publications from being sold in book- stores. This class of canvassers never annoy people, but in all respects conduct their business as they should. It is the least efficient class- only those who do not understand their business- that render themselves offensive; and the condition of things of which we complain tends to make such agents, and to sustain them. We protest against these unfair, disreputable, and dishonest prac- tices. If we expend thousands of dollars in making stereotype or electrotype plates of a book, we claim the right to introduce the book printed from them in the manner which the best interests of our business require, without interference firom booksellers, who can only obtain them (unless they be second hand) through some one of these channels; not otherwise. Were it possible for ourt books to reach them through any honest channel, then they would of course be justified in selling them. As possibly the reader may infer from the position here taken by us, that we desire to deprive people of books they may wish to obtain, we will state that so far from that being the case, on the con- trary, we would gladly puit our publications into every household in the country, but wish to do it in our own way, that the true interests of the public, as well as our own, may be subserved. Any person wishihing, a book has only to inform us, and we will request an agent to call and deliver it, and we have no doubt all subscription publish- ers will do the same. It was not our intention to press this matter falther; but lest any should get the impression that subscription books are sold at a higher price than trade books, and that on this account we are un- willing to compete with the trade in open market, we offer the fol- lowing fiacts, leaving the readers to form their conclusions. Books are printed from stereotype or electrotype plates. The type is first set up, and fron it solid castings, called plates, are made of type-metal, one to every page. The illustrations are designed by one class of artists, engraved by another, and castings from them also made. This is a very expensive process, the castiUgs from which !   APPENDIX.            719 to print a well-illustrated subscription book, of ordinary size, costing several thousand dollars. These casttigs, ats-ie fromn their value for this purpose, are worth only their Weighat as old metal. Those cost- ing five thousand dollars are worth about a ]lundrled dollars as metal; hence, speaking in a general way, thel cost of these castings is money absolutely lost, if the book does not sell; if it does, thern tile publisher must put sutch a price on it as will repay tlhis outl ay in ad- dition to making a lecgitimate profit. Now, stupplose the castings for a book to cost five thousand dollars, and ten thousand voliumles to be sold through bookstores; each book must p)ay a plrofit of fifty cents, to repay the original outlay. The salme book, prolperly managed and sold by subscription, if of the class suited to thl t lbusiness, ;Tan be given a sale five times as large (we speak much witlin bouinds), and thlerefore the profit requisite to repay this outlay is but ten cents a volume, which makes a saving of forty cents on cacli book. Again, authors iare paid a copyriglit, generally  ofa coertiain sum on every volume sold. They know tlf'e immense sale usfually given a subscription book, and that they can better afford to receive : small copyright per volume, on a book so sold, than a largc one were it introduced through bookstores. Iowever, as the coylyright is usun!lly the subject of a special bagalin, varying, p1erIhaps, nwithl evelry book, we have no sufficient basis finom which to draw alsolutely correct conclusions; but we think it fiir to assume that an author whose book can be given by subscription a sale of fifty thousand volumes, when tthrolghl bookstores it Awould only be ten tho1sand, will take a coDyright of ten cents a volume, if sold in the formler, as readily as he will tilrty, were it sold in the latter way; for even then his receipts will be nearly double. Here is a saving of twelnty cents, making in all a saving of sixty cents a volume in fivor of thle subscription publisher. Further, a book introduced through book- stores usually has to pay the following profits; First, that, of the publisher'; second, that of the jobber; thir ththat of the retailer; and often the publisher is compelled, at great cost, to advertise it ,ex- tensively, or it does not sell. Moreovelr, these parties generally oc- cupy fine stores, on popular thoroughfares, in expensive localities, besides employing high-salaried clerks. All these exlenses the book has to bear before it reaches the public. Now, contrast it with our subscription books. We make our profit, and so does the canvasser. Usually, the agent is the only party between the producer and consumer. Thle canvassers (advetise our books by showing and explaining them, thereby saving us thle expense of advertising in newspapers, which we do to a very limited extent, and then only for agents, and not to create a demancl for our  &#xD;<pb n="720-721 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC7107-00000384"/> 720           APPENDIX. books. The agent has no rent to pay for a place of business, and we occupy unostentatious wareroorns, in comparatively inexpensive localities; our business requires no better, for our dealings are most- ly with canvassers through the nlails; and, finally, we do not have to keep, to wait upon customers, a corps of clerks receiving good salaries, who are idle a part of the time. Besides all this, the sale of subscription books being so large, they can safely be manufactured in large editions, and a saving thus be made. We trust the reader can now understand how we can at least afford to give the public books as good in every respect, and at as low a price, as publishers who sell their works only through bookstores. We believe subscription publishers, if the works they issue are suited to that business, can afford to give the conmmunity a better book for the same price, or one equally good for a lower price, than other pullishers. To sum up, we will state our conviction that for introducing many classes of books the subscriptioti system has numerous advantages over the othler method. It is best for the author, )because le knows that if he produces a valuable book, it will not only be published, but will be given a large sale, and his copyright will yield lim a large sum; hence, it acts as an incentive for hint to produce the best work possible; the better the book, the larger his returns. Best for the publisher, because he knows that if lie lias a good book, lie cal afford to illustrate it well, and bring it before the public in the most attrac- tive and desirable form, all of which will tend to increase its sale and his profits. Best for the agent, because it affords him a lucrative, honorable, and pleasant calling, that may be followed for lifi in a chosen territory, protected from intrusion by others. He not only gets the profit that would otherwise go to the retail bookseller, but also a portion of the large sums that would be expended in advecr- tising to bring it to the attention of the public. And finally, best for the buyer, for 'he gets many excellent books whose authors could not affordl the time to write them, were they dependent on the sale thlrough boolkstoes to be repnid for their labor--many first-class books, that otherwise would not be published, for no'trade publisher wouldl risk the necessary outlay of many thousands of dollars, and trust to the sale through bookstores to reimburse him; and, more- over, usually they are works of a better class, better written, more profusely and elegantly illustrated, and better gotten up generally, than many "trade books " that are sold for the sane price. Besides, they are brought to the door of the purchaser, which is a great con- venience to persons living in the rural districts. I . N. RICHARDSON   &amp; CO.   SOON READY.

NE of the freshest, most original, and piquant of writers, as well as one of the keenest observers of men and nature in America. Critics, who have read the manuscript or proof-pages of this new book, pronounce it superior to any thing the author has written, or any work of its kind produced by an American writer. The culture, knowledge of men and books and nature, evinced therein, will commend it to the refined and educated classes, and agents will find great advantages in presenting it. Its high purpose, moral tone, and intense interest will commend it to all. Mr. Murray has given to this volume his best thoughts; and in some respects it may be considered his life work. His book, "Among the Adirondacks," though not published by subscription, had a remarkable sale. The present work is incomparably better, and should i have an immense circulation.

Crown Octavo. THS work is of intense interest, and well calculated to give the general reader the characteristic phases of prison-life, and a full understanding of the subject. It possesses all the charm of the best works of fiction; and the reader has the satisfaction of knowing it to be true, as the Appendix contains not only certificates of parties, well known in the community, to the veracity of Mr. Goss, but certificates to the truthfulness of the book from twenty of the author's compan- ions in prison.

THS is the first attempt of any American publishers to put the works of OLIVER OPTIC at a price within the reach of all; and we affirm that no recent copyright book, sold for the same price, from the pen of an author so well known, published in this country, contains the same amount of reading-matter, with so many and good illustrations, and so well gotten up in every respect as this. OLIVER OPTIC'S popularity is attested by the fact that his books reach an annual sale of about one hundred and fifty thousand copies; and no writer in America is better known or more widely popular, The fact that those of greater experience and more mature years than those for whom the books were originally written, seek for and read them as attentively as the juveniles, attests to the wide-spread popularity of the works of the great author.

BY THE BROTHERS COBB, MEMBERS OF POST 30, G A.R., DEPARTMENT OF MASSACHUSETTS. A  THRILLING LIFE-STORY, designed to set forth the true and lofty character of the GRAND ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC, an organization in many respects without a parallel in the history of the world, - and more particularly for the sublime purpose of binding those who went to the rescue of their country, in her hour of peril, more closely in one great brother- hood; of inculcating and perpetuating sentiments of FRATERNITY, CHARITY, AND LOYALTY among its members, that they may not neglect their solemn obligationsl to each other; and of forcibly impressing upon the minds, and carrying conviction to the hearts, of all its members, that their duly and mission are not fulfilled until the families of their fallen comrades, as well as their unfortunate surviving compan- ions in arms who are disabled, have been cared for. Embellished with a beautiful allegorical presentation-page, from the pencil of THOMAS NAST, the eminent American artist, and a full-page frontispiece by the authors, whose artistic culture is best evidenced by the magnificent soldiers' mon- ument at Cambridge, Mass., which was both designed and sculptured by them, and is universally pronounced the finest in conception and execution in America. The book is written with rare fidelity to truth, and possesses that vigor and charm which only works founded on fact ever combine. We deem it ( exagger- ation to say that no work has yet been produced on this subject so well calculated to further the ends above set forth. The manner in which it has been treated evinces a thorough knowledge of the holy aims of, and spirit actuating, that Order, and a keen insight into its workings. The style in which it is written gives it all the vividness, strength, and exciting interest of some of the finest works by the best writers of fiction; and it also possesses that quality which incites in the heart of the reader who belongs to that noble band of. brothers in peace -- late in arms - the firm resolve to do all and more than a strict observance of his pledge can require. An Elegant 13mo Volume of 384 pages. The authors have so presented in this work the practical benefit of the Grand Army, that soldiers who have not joined its ranks, after perusing it, cannot lay it down without feeling it to be their duty and interest to become members.
