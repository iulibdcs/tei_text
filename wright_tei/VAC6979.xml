ROSA, THE INDIAN CAPTIVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
The Captve and their L dian Cef.&#xD;
UPON the road which windM from the&#xD;
village of Coosa, in the former territory&#xD;
of the Creeks, towards the capital of&#xD;
Georgia, there stood, about twenty years&#xD;
ago, under a projecting shelf of rocks,&#xD;
on which some dozen of red cedar and&#xD;
pine trees were scattered, the humble&#xD;
log cabin of John Copeland; or, as he&#xD;
was generally styled, Captain John.&#xD;
Before it was two huge posts, connect-&#xD;
ed by two large cross-beams; between&#xD;
which was swinging in the blast a large&#xD;
sign daubed with a gaudy copper figure,&#xD;
intending to represent an Indian king,&#xD;
with his diadem of plumes, tomahawk,&#xD;
scalping knife, girdle of wampum, and&#xD;
so forth; Beneath this figure, in words&#xD;
not unlike Egyptian hieroglyphics, was&#xD;
scrawled, "Entertainment for Man and&#xD;
east."&#xD;
it was on a stormy December night-&#xD;
the wind moaned wildly through the&#xD;
black pine forest, on the verge of which&#xD;
the cabin was.situated-rain, mingled&#xD;
with hail, dashed against the window&#xD;
shutters, threatening the inmates every&#xD;
moment with a deluge ; while the crush-&#xD;
ing of trees, broken down by the storm,&#xD;
sounded like peals of thunder through&#xD;
the dark abode of Captain John-when,&#xD;
something like the tapping of a hand on&#xD;
the weatherboard of the door was soon&#xD;
succeeded by a knocking that shook the&#xD;
very logs of which the cabin was con-&#xD;
structed.&#xD;
Immediately upon this summons the&#xD;
door opened, and a head peered out into&#xD;
the dark night, as if to reconnoitre the&#xD;
ground around the door, just where the&#xD;
&#xD;
butt-end of a rifle was advanced-doubt-&#xD;
less with the benevolent intention of&#xD;
saving the inmate the trouble of open-&#xD;
ing it.&#xD;
The foremost of a group of beings,&#xD;
whose characters could not be ascer-&#xD;
tained in the dark, came forward, threw&#xD;
the door wide open, entered, and, strid-&#xD;
ing towards the chimney with a haughty&#xD;
step, there sat down.&#xD;
A considerable time elapsed before&#xD;
about twenty of his followers stalked&#xD;
into the room, in the same silent and&#xD;
haughty manner.&#xD;
When the hat had entered, the per-&#xD;
son who had opened the door shut it&#xD;
again; and, stepping towards the fire-&#xD;
place, where a large log was still glim-&#xD;
mering, threw a couple of dry faggots&#xD;
over it, kindled one of the pine torches&#xD;
lying near, and moving deliberately to-&#xD;
wards the bar, placed a lighted candle&#xD;
upon it.&#xD;
The rude objects of the room appear-&#xD;
ed now more distinctly ie the livid glare&#xD;
of the torch and the wavering light of&#xD;
the candle.&#xD;
On a chair, before the fireplace, sat&#xD;
the personage who had first entered-&#xD;
his blood-stained blanket was thrown&#xD;
over his whole body, so as entirely to&#xD;
conceal his form.&#xD;
Behind him, on the fioor, a group of&#xD;
about twenty-Live Indians sat on their&#xD;
haunches, with their legs crossed, their&#xD;
fees shrouded in their wet blankets;&#xD;
while large blood-stains,. with which&#xD;
these were tinged, betrayed the charac-&#xD;
ter of the expedition they came from.&#xD;
In the corner opposite the fireplace&#xD;
stood the bar, behind whose railings a&#xD;
dozen dirty bottles, and still dirtier&#xD;
tumblers and mugs, were ranged.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
ROSA, THEINDIAN CAPTIVE            9&#xD;
&#xD;
The landlord now seated himself by&#xD;
the side of him who seemed the chief of&#xD;
the band.&#xD;
Another minute elapsed before this&#xD;
personage roused his head, two-thirds&#xD;
of which were concealed by a piece of&#xD;
cotton tied round it, on which, like&#xD;
fringes, little clots of gore hung.&#xD;
The backwoodsman cast a side glance&#xD;
at the Indian, but withdrew his eye at&#xD;
the next moment, and looked again into&#xD;
the crackling fire.&#xD;
"Has my white brother no tongue'?"&#xD;
now said the Indian, in a low, guttural&#xD;
tone.&#xD;
"He will listen to the talk of the brave&#xD;
chief," returned the backwoodsman,&#xD;
sullenly.&#xD;
"Go call your woman," said the In-&#xD;
di in, in the same low tone, without&#xD;
raising his head.&#xD;
rTie backwoodsman arose, and turned&#xD;
towards a large bed, behind whose cur-&#xD;
tains the woman was sitting.&#xD;
After a few words she emerged from&#xD;
her resting place, and advanced by the&#xD;
side of her husband towards the Indian&#xD;
chief.&#xD;
She was a stout, resolute-looking wo-&#xD;
man; yet there was something so very&#xD;
alarming in the blood-stained visitors,&#xD;
illumined as they were by occasional&#xD;
flashes from the glaring flame, ahd their&#xD;
deadly silence was so ominous, that the&#xD;
woman stood speechless with terror.&#xD;
Stepping to the .ide of her husband,&#xD;
she stood in silent expectation.&#xD;
The Indian now raised his head very&#xD;
slowly, and said-&#xD;
"Listen, woman, to the talk of a great&#xD;
warrior. Hig hinds are open, and he&#xD;
will fill the wigwam of his white brother&#xD;
with deer skins ; he will ask but little&#xD;
from her, and what she may give easily.&#xD;
Has my sister," continued he, turning&#xD;
his head to wards the woman, "milk for&#xD;
a little sister ?"&#xD;
The woman looked astonished at the&#xD;
question, without comprehending his&#xD;
meaning.&#xD;
"Will she," continued the Indian,&#xD;
raising his voice a tone higher, "give of&#xD;
her milk to a little sister, that she may&#xD;
not die for want of food ?"&#xD;
The woman looked bolder, as she now&#xD;
began to comprehend the demand, and&#xD;
she moved from her husband to theside&#xD;
of the Indian.&#xD;
As she did so, the Indian opened the&#xD;
folds of his blanket, and produced a&#xD;
beautiful child, dressed in a rich emine&#xD;
pelisse, and cap of the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
For a moment the woman gazed In&#xD;
astonishment, but in the next her fe-&#xD;
male tenderness prevailed. Stretching&#xD;
out her hand to receive the child, she&#xD;
exclaimed---&#xD;
"Body o' me ! a baby! Where have&#xD;
you got that there poor little thing? It&#xD;
ain't a red child-surely I will-"&#xD;
The woman would probably have&#xD;
given further vent to her feelings, but&#xD;
for a significant glance from her hus--&#xD;
band.&#xD;
The Indian seemed not to pay the&#xD;
least attention to what she said, but,&#xD;
unbuttoning the ermine pelisse, he slip&#xD;
ped the garment off. A robe of gros de&#xD;
Naples presented itself. The Indian&#xD;
untied it in the same manner, knot after&#xD;
knot, and had succeeded in extracting&#xD;
the child from a second robe, when a&#xD;
third, fourth and fifth of the finest cam-&#xD;
bric, trimmed with Brussels lace, ap-&#xD;
peared, within which the child was&#xD;
buried.&#xD;
The Indian seemed now to lose pa-&#xD;
tience, seizing his scalping-knife, and&#xD;
cutting the three remaining garments&#xD;
asunder, he presented the naked child&#xD;
to the terrified hostess.&#xD;
"You wretch !" shrieked the frighten-&#xD;
ed woman, snatching the child from&#xD;
him.                 -&#xD;
"Stay," said the Indian, pointing to&#xD;
the neck of the child, from which hMng&#xD;
a gold chain with a little medal.&#xD;
'rhe woman slipped the chain overits&#xD;
head, and throwing it into' the face of&#xD;
the Indian, she hurried towards her bed.&#xD;
"The deuce is in that woman," mut-&#xD;
tered the backwoodsman, not without&#xD;
uneasiness, at the sadden outbroaking&#xD;
of his wife's feelings.&#xD;
"The red warrior," said the Indian,&#xD;
with unmovable calmness, "will give&#xD;
beavers' skins for the milk of his sister;&#xD;
but he will keep what he has picked up,&#xD;
and the door must be open when he calls&#xD;
for the child !"&#xD;
"But," said the backwoodsman, who&#xD;
seemed to feel it incumbent on him to&#xD;
be more explicit; " to speak plainly, I&#xD;
don't care to keep the child, though I&#xD;
have plenty of my own. Eut should&#xD;
the parents come, or the white father&#xD;
hear of it, what then? the chief knows&#xD;
that his hands reach far."&#xD;
The Indian paused a moment, and&#xD;
then said, in a significant tone-&#xD;
'"The child's mother will not come,&#xD;
The night is very dark, the storm blows&#xD;
very hard, the trail of the red warrior&#xD;
will not be seen to-morrow. it is far to&#xD;
&#xD;
the wigwam of the white father. If-h&#xD;
hears of ,the child, the my white bro&#xD;
her~ told him of it. If he takes it, tht&#xD;
red warrior will take the scalps off hi&#xD;
children."&#xD;
"There, take bick your child-I will&#xD;
not have anything to do with it !" said&#xD;
the backwoodsman, in a firm and reso-&#xD;
Ante tone-.        .    ..&#xD;
The Indian drew his knife in calm,&#xD;
concentrated rage, and looked in the&#xD;
direction of the child.&#xD;
"We'll take care of it-nobody shall&#xD;
know of it!" shrieked the woman in a&#xD;
voice alhnost of frenzy.,    ;&#xD;
The Indian put his knife calmly in his&#xD;
belt, "The red nen are dry," said he,'&#xD;
in the same tone.&#xD;
The woman muttered something like&#xD;
pomson.&#xD;
The husband, however, now strode&#xD;
somewhat more rapidly towards the bar&#xD;
-took down one of the bottles and fill-&#xD;
ed a tumbler, which the chief drank as&#xD;
he sat. It then passed round to every&#xD;
Indian'&#xD;
When the third bottle was emptied,&#xD;
the chief rose abruptly, threw a Spanish&#xD;
gold piece on the table, and, taking&#xD;
from his girdle of wampum a neckcloth&#xD;
of beads, hung it round the neck of the&#xD;
child, which the woman had in the&#xD;
meanwhile dressed in a homespun flan-&#xD;
nel frock.&#xD;
"The Creeks will know the child of&#xD;
one of their warriors," said he- and,&#xD;
turning round, he stalked with great&#xD;
dignity towards the door, followed in&#xD;
the same manner by his ien, and dis-&#xD;
aippeared in the dark night.&#xD;
"The squall is over," said the back-&#xD;
woodsman, who had looked after the&#xD;
Indians, as they stole towards their&#xD;
birchen canoe.&#xD;
"Who's that red demon ?" his wife&#xD;
broke forth, when the last had disap-&#xD;
peared, fetching at the same time a deep&#xD;
breath,.and shuddering involuntarily.&#xD;
"Hush, woman! There's foul play, I&#xD;
warrant ye!" said he, shutting the door&#xD;
and stepping with the lighted candle&#xD;
towards the bed, where his wife was&#xD;
nursing her new charge. "That there&#xD;
poor thing might tell a story, maybe,&#xD;
that we should not like to listen to !&#xD;
Ay, and she may cost us our scalps, too.&#xD;
There's something wrong -- they have&#xD;
been, on a scalping expedition; that's&#xD;
certain; but where, the deuce knows.&#xD;
Well, if they've been down at the Span-&#xD;
iard's," continued he, looking alter-&#xD;
nately at the child and at the gold coin;&#xD;
&#xD;
e "I shouldn't care a curse ; but things&#xD;
- must be looked to."&#xD;
e So saying, he threw himself upon the&#xD;
bed.&#xD;
But it was long before the sturdy old&#xD;
l backwoodsman sank again asleep. The&#xD;
terrible night scene seemed to have de-&#xD;
stroyed his repose.&#xD;
Captain John was one of those li-&#xD;
censed traders who had settled two&#xD;
years before this'nightly visit among&#xD;
the Creeks, under the patronage of the&#xD;
general government, and the protection&#xD;
of its agent.&#xD;
He was a man half way between&#xD;
thirty and forty, as stout and square&#xD;
built "as any one who ever trod in his&#xD;
own shoes," and with just as much of&#xD;
tavern-keeper jollity as corresponded&#xD;
with his grave customers and his own&#xD;
bargaining, shrewd hawk-eye.&#xD;
The Creeks had been for many years&#xD;
on good terms witg the white people.&#xD;
Yet there were among them the germs&#xD;
of a rising discontent; which, perhaps,&#xD;
none was able to observe more closely&#xD;
than our tavern keeper.&#xD;
Numberless squatters settled down on&#xD;
the richest tracts.  Dissensions had&#xD;
broken out respecting the occupation of&#xD;
the lands on the head of the Oconee&#xD;
river.&#xD;
The difference had been settled by a&#xD;
treaty, in which the chief of the Oco-&#xD;
nees, the son of a white, ceded the fer-&#xD;
tile lands.&#xD;
The greater part of the tribe, with&#xD;
the descendants of the Ahikos or heirs&#xD;
of the Oconees, were thus cast on the&#xD;
mercy of their red brethren.&#xD;
He was said to be of a haughty, stern&#xD;
and treacherous character -his influ-&#xD;
ence with his tribe to be unlimited, and&#xD;
even great with the rest of the Creeks,&#xD;
who began to be alarmed for their re-&#xD;
ainaing land.&#xD;
The backwoodsman, then, knowing&#xD;
the dangerous character of the Indians&#xD;
among whom he lived, not to distrust&#xD;
them, he determined on visiting M'Lel-&#xD;
lan, the deputy agent, in the ippeir.&#xD;
Creeks' territory, the next morning.&#xD;
This purpose firmly settled, he soon fell&#xD;
asleep.&#xD;
Accordingly, with the break of day,&#xD;
the backwoodsman was ready to start&#xD;
for the agent's.&#xD;
"Send Tomba with the skins up to&#xD;
the Cherokees, and keep yourself quite&#xD;
ready, if I shouldn't come back to-mor-&#xD;
row night," said he.&#xD;

" When shall I look for ye, man 7"  With an air of apparent indifference&#xD;
demanded his wite.                  he said-&#xD;

ROBA, THE INDIAN CAPTIVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
12             ROSA, THE INDIAN CAPTIVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Indian looked for a moment very&#xD;
attentively ; and then crying "Hue !"&#xD;
and raising his hands with every mark&#xD;
of fear and astonishment, darted over&#xD;
the fence, and was soon lost to the eye.&#xD;
The missionary and the backwoods-&#xD;
man returned silently into the room.&#xD;
"Well," said the latter, with a sharp&#xD;
glance, "have you still a mind to the&#xD;
child ?"&#xD;
"Certainly," said the preacher, "if&#xD;
you allow me to speak with the agent."&#xD;
"Not as long as I stay with these red&#xD;
skins," said the tavern keeper. "But&#xD;
my time will be short. They are again&#xD;
stirring; and there are things going on&#xD;
with that red skin beyond the Ohio.&#xD;
They say it is the chief of the Oconees,&#xD;
or moiko, as they call him."&#xD;
"That's a dangerous fellow," said the&#xD;
clergyman.&#xD;
"When I am down the Misdssippi,"&#xD;
resumed the backwoodsman, "you may&#xD;
do what you please."&#xD;
"Sure enough," interjected mine host-&#xD;
ess; "poor thing, she'll never be fit for&#xD;
a job, and you nouglit as well take her.&#xD;
She bought do for teaching them girls ;&#xD;
but we must think of ourselves."&#xD;
The strain of the woman was inter-.&#xD;
rupted by a piercing cry, which came&#xD;
from the garden.&#xD;
The next moment the object of their&#xD;
conversation rushed in, pale and trem-&#xD;
bling.&#xD;
Before they could ask the cause of her&#xD;
strange emotion, a tall, gaunt and co-&#xD;
lossal Indian steipped into the room,&#xD;
dressed in the attire of an Indian chief&#xD;
of the first rank. His frame was very&#xD;
powerful. On his naked arms and an-&#xD;
covered temples arose seams almost&#xD;
finger thick.&#xD;
His whole attitude was imposing in a&#xD;
high degree, and resembled more of a&#xD;
bronze statue than a living creature.&#xD;
The most striking part, however, of the&#xD;
Indian was his countenance. His fore-&#xD;
head,erowned with a diadem of plumes,&#xD;
was highly intellige it.&#xD;
The dress of this remarkable person&#xD;
consisted of a sort of waistcoat of deer&#xD;
skin, that covered his broad chest, and&#xD;
an open hunting shirt of cotton, which&#xD;
was thrown over it. To a girdle of wam-&#xD;
paim was attached his breech-cloth. His&#xD;
moccasins and leggings were exquisitely&#xD;
worked. Ie held in his right hand a&#xD;
ride ,and on his side stuck a scalping-&#xD;
kuite, richly inlaid with silver.&#xD;
"Tokeam !" exclaimed the missionary.&#xD;
The backwoodsman was just going to&#xD;
&#xD;
raise his tumbler to his lips; but his&#xD;
appetite seemed gone at the mention of&#xD;
a name which was known to be synony-&#xD;
mous to a deadly enemy of the whites.&#xD;
He surveyed the chief from head to&#xD;
foot.&#xD;
"Six summers," said the Indian, after&#xD;
a long pause, during which he had seat-&#xD;
ed himself, "are gone and returned&#xD;
since the miko of the Oconees left his&#xD;
daughter with his white brother. Ho&#xD;
is come to take her now into his own&#xD;
wigwam."&#xD;
"Then it is you," said the captain,&#xD;
"who that night left us poor Rose, as&#xD;
that there' gentleman calls her. But&#xD;
why have you never shown yourself, or&#xD;
called for the child ? What if she had&#xD;
been lost?"&#xD;
" The white man want only the skies&#xD;
and the land of the red men-they enre&#xD;
not for a chief," returned the Indian,&#xD;
with a bitter smile. "If the child had&#xD;
beer taken away, the scalps of your&#xD;
children would have paid for it. He&#xD;
will now take what is his own:"&#xD;
"You don't call Rose, whose parents&#xD;
you have murdered, your own ?" said&#xD;
the minister.&#xD;
The Indian cast a glance of inexpres-&#xD;
sihle contempt at the speaker as he rc-&#xD;
ph-.&#xD;
"Where would the White Rose, as&#xD;
you call her, be, if the hand of Tokeahk&#xD;
had not arrested the arm which was&#xD;
going to dash out her bra~imis? Who has&#xD;
hunted for her when she crawled on her&#xD;
hands and feet ? Who has sent the&#xD;
be vers' skins and drink water?  Oa&#xD;
added he, with contempt, "you are dogs&#xD;
-your tongue talks of what your heart&#xD;
does not know."&#xD;
''The miko of the Oconees," said the&#xD;
missionary, undaunted by the cold ve-&#xD;
hemence of the Indian, "will not tear a&#xD;
poor Christian child from iher kindred ?&#xD;
The whi e father would be angry-ho&#xD;
will pay back the skins."&#xD;
"No need of that," cried the woman ;&#xD;
"I'll give back all what the red skin&#xD;
clief has sent."&#xD;
"The chief of the Oconees," said the&#xD;
Indian, in a stern tone, "will not talk&#xD;
more with the white father. His path&#xD;
is long-his heart yearns after freedom.&#xD;
He will seek it where no white maa,has&#xD;
trodden the ground. He wants his white&#xD;
daughter to pook his venison." lie then&#xD;
wha-tled, and a party of Indians enter-&#xD;
ed, followed by two girls.&#xD;
"Canondah !" exclaimed the mission-&#xD;
Sry.&#xD;
&#xD;
One of the girls stepped forward, and&#xD;
crossing her hands on  er bosom, she&#xD;
inclined her head towards the mission-&#xD;
ary.&#xD;
"And you will leave us?" he said.&#xD;
The girl was silent.&#xD;
The chief made another sign ; and&#xD;
the second girl seized the shrieking child&#xD;
and lifted her itito a blanket, which was&#xD;
thrown over the shoulder of the first.&#xD;
the then passed a string round the hips&#xD;
of the child, and tied it, raised her to&#xD;
the shoulders of the girl, and wound&#xD;
her arms round her neck. The Indian&#xD;
girl took now the upper corners of the&#xD;
blanket, and drawing them together in&#xD;
Mher hand, she was ready to depart.&#xD;
The missionary, with the family of the&#xD;
trader, had looked at these sudden pre-&#xD;
parations in anxious suspense.&#xD;
When they were finished, the mission-&#xD;
ary advanced to the Indian and said, in&#xD;
a mild voice-&#xD;
"Then to your love and sisterly care&#xD;
I must leave the tender plant!"&#xD;
The Indian girl on whose back the&#xD;
poor child hung, bowed her head.&#xD;
The girls left the room with the rest&#xD;
of the Indians-the chief only remained&#xD;
behind. Then rising, he said -&#xD;
"The miko of the Oconees has paid&#xD;
for the milk of the white woman. His&#xD;
path is long-his heart is sick of the&#xD;
whites - may he never more behold&#xD;
them!"&#xD;
When ho had spoken these words, he&#xD;
rose, stalked out of the room, leaving&#xD;
the missionary and the trader in silent&#xD;
Surprise.&#xD;
We now leave Georgia, and the home&#xD;
of the backwoodsman, to resume the&#xD;
thread of our narrative in a far distant&#xD;
country, and after .the lapse of several&#xD;
years.&#xD;
.           cHAPTER IL&#xD;
The Two Maidens.&#xD;
On the northern extremity of the lake&#xD;
Sabine, there rises from the dreary cane&#xD;
and cypress swamps, and between the&#xD;
rival rivers, Sabine and Natchez, a rich&#xD;
bottom that swells gradually, as the two&#xD;
rivers diverge into the hills.&#xD;
From the narrow lane which nature&#xD;
has left between the forest and the cane&#xD;
brake, two female forms were seen glid-&#xD;
ing towards an open place.&#xD;
The complexion of the foremost maid-&#xD;
,an showed the copper hue of the Indiga&#xD;
&#xD;
race. She had now reached a bend of&#xD;
the lane, where a prostrate cotton tree&#xD;
crossed the opening, and leaned herself&#xD;
against the trunk, apparently to catch&#xD;
breath.&#xD;
By her side hung a pocket knife of&#xD;
considerable size.&#xD;
"Rosa," she said, bounding towards&#xD;
the second female who had now issued&#xD;
from beneath a cotton tree, and sinking&#xD;
on her legs, and crossing them with a&#xD;
quickness and pliancy which resembled&#xD;
the windings of a serpent. "Thte White&#xD;
Rose is no more the same-look how the (&#xD;
grass grows on the path her foot has&#xD;
trod so often. Why is the White Rose&#xD;
sad?"&#xD;
There was something so touching 'in&#xD;
the voice of the Indian-her attitude,&#xD;
as she cast her arms round the form of&#xD;
the second female; was so beseeching,&#xD;
as made it doubtful whether her interest&#xD;
was relationship on her part, or the ex-&#xD;
quisite beauty of the object before whom&#xD;
she was seated.&#xD;
The soft black eye, rolling languidly&#xD;
under its long silken lashes, and repos-&#xD;
ing oi the Indian, gave her the air of&#xD;
an ethereal being.&#xD;
This beautiful female was, in fact,&#xD;
Rosa, whom we have seen,' seven years&#xD;
ago, carried away by the Indian chief.&#xD;
She looked on her red friend'with an&#xD;
air of the gentlest tenderness-a tear&#xD;
stole into her eyes-and, bending her&#xD;
head, she' pressed a kiss on' the lips of&#xD;
the Indian maiden.&#xD;
"Why has the White15tlsgo tongue?"&#xD;
resumed the Indian in the same touch-&#xD;
ing tone. "Look! Canondah's bosom&#xD;
is now open for the woes of the White&#xD;
Rose."&#xD;
"Dear Canondah," lisped the fair&#xD;
being, throwing her arms round the&#xD;
neck of the Indian.&#xD;
"0. tell Canondah," prayed the In-&#xD;
dian, "what it is that afflicts your ten-&#xD;
der. heart?" then changing on a sudden&#xD;
into a plaintive tone-"Look," she ex-&#xD;
claimed, "these arms have carried the&#xD;
White Rose when ohe was very little-&#xD;
on these shoulders she hung when we&#xD;
crossed the big river. On this bosom she&#xD;
nestled like a water fowl. And now she&#xD;
is grown big, and has become the White&#xD;
Rose of the Oconees, she will shut her&#xD;
heart. 0, tell Canondah, what it is that&#xD;
heaves your bosom, and makes you pale&#xD;
and trembling ?"&#xD;
Rosa-for by this name we shall now&#xD;
call her-looked at her friend for a mo-&#xD;
mnt; she then whispered, as if afraid&#xD;

ROSA, TIE INDIAN CAPTiVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
il           IOSA, TIIE IDIAN CAPTIVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
of being overheard-"'There is," point-&#xD;
ing at her breast, "one thing, that I&#xD;
cannot tell, which fills my heart with&#xD;
paii and woe."&#xD;
"Is it the great chief of theSalt Lake,&#xD;
Ro-a, Wih lt)causes 011r sorrow'&#xD;
Rsa grew pile, she stepped back,&#xD;
and covered her face with her hands.&#xD;
The Indian sprang from the ground,&#xD;
and throwing her arm round her friend,&#xD;
borh walked on in silence.&#xD;
Theystood now on the verge of the&#xD;
cane brake.&#xD;
"Saud is the path of an Oconee girl !"&#xD;
broke out the Indian after a long pause&#xD;
-but li-ten !" exclaimed she, turning&#xD;
her cear towards the stream, from whence&#xD;
a f sint, distant, rustling noise was now&#xD;
heard-' iWhat is that t"&#xD;
",, nothing," returned Rosa.&#xD;
The noise, though faint, was now- dis-&#xD;
ime° ly heard.&#xD;
'"Canondah !" exclaimed Rosa, " you&#xD;
will not hunt the great water serpent?"&#xD;
But her words were in vain.&#xD;
The Indian darted, with the swiftness&#xD;
of a deer, through the dense canebrake,&#xD;
and nothing remained for her compan-&#xD;
ion bun to follow the crashing sounds&#xD;
that pointed out to her the direction in&#xD;
which she had broken through.&#xD;
While she wound herself through the&#xD;
mazes of the reeds, a piercing shriek&#xD;
was heard; but it was not the voice of&#xD;
Canoundah. A plunge succeeded, f 4-&#xD;
lowed by a short, violent struggle; then&#xD;
a deep silence ensued.&#xD;
Rosa now followed, breathless, to-&#xD;
wards the stream.   After a toilsome&#xD;
march, she at last reached the edge of&#xD;
the bank, and her eye soughther Indian&#xD;
friend.&#xD;
"Rosa !" exclaimed the Indian, who&#xD;
stood in tihe shallow water.&#xD;
"Cauoudah !" said Rosa ; but the In-&#xD;
dian pointed towards a cypress tree that&#xD;
StOoi below the bank.&#xD;
"The white youth I" demanded Rosa,&#xD;
inqut ingly.r&#xD;
'fTe Indian laid -her finger signifi-&#xD;
cantly on her-mouth, washed the blood&#xD;
from her hands, wiped the knife, and&#xD;
ste ypd towards the tre. Bending the&#xD;

.she eend cu1(lItthe pabt of her right in&#xD;

'the foliage of the cypress now opened&#xD;
suit-ny, and a young white man ap-&#xD;
pea I, aovig slowly towards the&#xD;
water's edge.&#xD;
&#xD;
"how came he here ?" asked Rosa, in&#xD;
a low whisper, with her eyes riveted on&#xD;
the stranger.&#xD;
The Indiam punted to a yawl in-the&#xD;
palmettos, and which the younrg-man&#xD;
had evidently tried to toree through the,&#xD;
reeds.&#xD;
He had now nearly reached-the shore,&#xD;
when he became exhausted. He stag-&#xD;
gered, the reed yielded to the weight,&#xD;
and he was on the point of sinking,&#xD;
when he was caught by the Indian and&#xD;
drawn towards the bank, against which&#xD;
she leaned him.&#xD;
The cause of the stranger's weakness&#xD;
now appeared. The jaws of an alligator&#xD;
had seized the might leg, and the blood&#xD;
gushed froan a fearful wound.&#xD;
Tie Indian had no sooner remarked&#xD;
it, than she hastened to the side of&#xD;
Rosa, and untying the silk handkerchief&#xD;
from Roa's neck, with the words -&#xD;
"Your white brother is bitten, and you&#xD;
see Canondah has but her gown," ran&#xD;
with it in her mouth towards a patina-&#xD;
christi. She broke the -tem across her&#xD;
knee, and loosened the soft rind that lay&#xD;
under the bark. She then got down by&#xD;
the side of the stranger, staunched the&#xD;
blood with the soft. fibres, and tied the&#xD;
silk handkerchief round it.&#xD;
rley now laid him on the ground.&#xD;
His eyes were closed, and his hands&#xD;
hung down on both sides.&#xD;
lIe seemed on the point of dissolu-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
Rosa had stood:gazing in silence--&#xD;
then lifting up her hand in a supplicat-&#xD;
ing manner, she looked at the Indian.&#xD;
11cr friend seemed to comprehend the&#xD;
silent language; for, casting a tong and&#xD;
anxious glance at the stranger, she cx-&#xD;
claimed-&#xD;
"Your white brother is come in the&#xD;
canoe of the great chief, but he is none&#xD;
of his warriors!"&#xD;
"He is, perhaps, a sailor."&#xD;
"No," said the Indian-"look at his&#xD;
hands--they look like a girl's."&#xD;
"Perhaps a runner ?" said Rosa.&#xD;
The Indian shook her head. "Look!&#xD;
he came from the salt lake through the&#xD;
big lake that dinuks the water of our&#xD;
stream ; bat he does not know how to&#xD;
paddle a canoe through the high grass.&#xD;
He thought the serpent was a rotten&#xD;
log, and he trod on it, aid it has buiied&#xD;
its teeth in his flesh. Your white brother&#xD;
has fled Iroim the great chief." She said&#xD;
these words with great decision and&#xD;
tinmness, as though she had been the&#xD;
stranger's companion.&#xD;
&#xD;
"And, will Canondab cause the blood&#xD;
of a brother to be shed, who has never&#xD;
done any harm to her ?" said Rosa, in&#xD;
a beseeching tone.&#xD;
The Indian looked at her friend, and&#xD;
paused a moment.&#xD;
At length she said-&#xD;
"Well, Canondah will listen to the&#xD;
voice of her sister that speaks for the&#xD;
white youth.".&#xD;
So saying, both girls tripped away,&#xD;
-and penetrated farther into the forest,&#xD;
towards the trunk of an immense holy&#xD;
low cotton tree that stood *on the slop-&#xD;
ing ground.&#xD;
rfbe interior of the hollow tree was&#xD;
wide enough to admit of six men. The&#xD;
care which had been taken to clear it&#xD;
from the rubbish, and a neighboring&#xD;
salt lick, showed that it was used by the&#xD;
Indians for their nightly walks -&#xD;
Canondahi approached the tree with a&#xD;
wary step, and entered it in the same&#xD;
cautions manner.&#xD;
"It is empty," said she, "and the&#xD;
bears won't come !"&#xD;
. Both girls now ran towards a couple&#xD;
of cypresses that stood farther towards&#xD;
the bottom, found the salt-lick, and&#xD;
tearing the long floating mazes of Span-&#xD;
ish muss from the trees, collected a load&#xD;
that promised a soft couch, with which&#xD;
they hastened towards the cave.&#xD;
While Rosa was spreading the horse-&#xD;
hair like plant on the ground,the Iudian&#xD;
moved two logs near to the entrance, to&#xD;
secure the passage against unwelcome&#xD;
intruders.&#xD;
"Good!" said she, when these prepa-&#xD;
ratories 'were fiished; and poth girls&#xD;
returned to the stranger.&#xD;
"But he is very weak," said Rosa,&#xD;
"and cannot walk."&#xD;
"We must carry him !" replied the'&#xD;
Indian.&#xD;
Rosa blushed deeply.&#xD;
But the Indian, without paying any&#xD;
further attention to her delicate feelings,&#xD;
bowed down, and putting her right&#xD;
hand between the turf and his limbs,&#xD;
made her companion a sign.&#xD;
"Is Rosa afraid of touching her white&#xD;
brother, when the walk will cause him&#xD;
so much pain ' she said, with mild re-&#xD;
proach.&#xD;
The maiden now dropped her arm;.&#xD;
and both raised him on their clasped&#xD;
hands, supporting his back in the same&#xD;
manner, Thus they carried him to his&#xD;
couch. When they had laid him down,&#xD;
the indian whispered-&#xD;
"Canondah will be here when all is&#xD;
&#xD;
dark, and pour balsam into the wound&#xD;
of her white brother !"&#xD;
But her wOrdsvere lost; for, except&#xD;
a heavy breatlh,the stranger gave hardly&#xD;
a sign of life.&#xD;
The last rays of the setting sun had&#xD;
just touched the hills, when the girls&#xD;
arrived again on the spot where they&#xD;
had gathered the grapes ; and theyre-&#xD;
turned the same way which they came,&#xD;
towards their wigwams, to which we&#xD;
shall introduce our readers, anticipat-&#xD;
ing, however, their arrival by a few&#xD;
hours.&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
The iivdhli E'awint.&#xD;
Notfar from the scene of our adven-&#xD;
trie there was a considerable clearing,&#xD;
which ran for two miles along the river,&#xD;
stretching half a mile from its margin&#xD;
towards the forest, 'when the level plain&#xD;
sloped gently into the cypress bottom.&#xD;
On a near approach, gray blue smoke&#xD;
might be seen curling through the mel-&#xD;
low foliage ; and here and there a single&#xD;
cabin, nestling beneath a broad syca-&#xD;
more, and surrounded by patches of&#xD;
Indian corn and tobacco; and a dusky&#xD;
form stealing through the shrubs in that&#xD;
wary manner which long habit renders&#xD;
natural to tie red race, indicated an&#xD;
Indian village. These outposts passed,&#xD;
the number of dwellings increased, and&#xD;
might amount to about fifty.&#xD;
Mo-t of the cabins were without win-&#xD;
dows. In lieu of the door hung a buffalo&#xD;
hide, fastened on the door beams, and&#xD;
flung, during day time, on the low roof&#xD;
of the cabin.&#xD;
There were, however; two cabins, or&#xD;
rather cottages, of a lar-ger size. Both&#xD;
nestledhlik the rest, under a cotton&#xD;
tree.&#xD;
In front of one of those larger cabins,&#xD;
under a grove of palm trees and man-&#xD;
gtoves, sat a knot of about fifty men,&#xD;
enveloped in a column of dense smoke,&#xD;
that proceeded from pipes two or three&#xD;
feet in length.&#xD;
They were almost all of them dressed&#xD;
iii hunting shirts of cotton, their chests&#xD;
bare, with their girdles of wampum, to&#xD;
which their breech-cloth was attached&#xD;
by a thong around their shoulders, and&#xD;
their tobacco pouches hung. They wore&#xD;
their hair, and none had a scalping,&#xD;
tuft.&#xD;

such a change. His head was sunk on emphasis, after a pause, "Tokeah want-&#xD;

thought.                            has not tied, but fettered, the red men&#xD;

guttural tone, and with a dignity which his back on the land of his fathers, that&#xD;
seemed to exclude every doubt-      he might not be given up to the enemies&#xD;
"Au elk may run three times over of his race. The Great Spirit has made&#xD;

&#xD;
ROSA, THE INDIAN CAPTIVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"The woods, where Tokeah has once&#xD;
hunted as a chief, as a mighty miko, he&#xD;
has beheld again like a thief, when the.&#xD;
sun was down-he' has seen his people,&#xD;
which was the flower of the red men,&#xD;
weltering in the mud."&#xD;
When he had spoken these last words,&#xD;
his head sank again into his hands.&#xD;
A deep pause ensued.&#xD;
"And has the great mike riot talked&#xD;
to his brethren ?" demanded now the&#xD;
same old man.&#xD;
The chief raised his head, and looked&#xD;
at the speaker with a calm dignity.&#xD;
"Has gay brother forgotten that the&#xD;
red men of his people have cut asunder&#xD;
the link which tied him to them, that&#xD;
he had to fly from the land of his fa-&#xD;
thers. A fool will talk twice. His&#xD;
brethren have shut their ears seven sum-&#xD;
mers ago, when it was time to strike the&#xD;
blow; but his tongue was tied fast,&#xD;
when he saw his father's grave the last&#xD;
time-his heart was with his true men."&#xD;
"Before long," continued he, "the&#xD;
Creeks will be turned out of their own&#xD;
lands; they will drive them after the&#xD;
elks and deer that have sought the&#xD;
woods beyond the big river, and the&#xD;
Creeks will seek a police .for their wig-&#xD;
wams on this side of the big river. Then&#xD;
will Tokeah extend his hands to receive&#xD;
them-he will open his wigwam. His&#xD;
men have plenty of venison and corn,&#xD;
and his girls know how to weave hunt-&#xD;
ing shirts-he will divide with his men&#xD;
what he has, and join the link which is&#xD;
now broken."&#xD;
A loud, but respectful burst of ap-&#xD;
plause followed the last words of the&#xD;
chief, who again laid his head between&#xD;
his hands.&#xD;
The sun now sank amidst a flood of&#xD;
glory, mantling the hill, which was sur-&#xD;
rounded on every side by a thousand&#xD;
glorious dyes, reflected from the various&#xD;
tints of the foliage.&#xD;
The miko cast a last, long glance at&#xD;
 theligesug rays as they laded away ;&#xD;
and then moving his feetforwads, rose&#xD;
en the ground, slowly and 'maaj "tieally,&#xD;
with  the assistance of his hands.&#xD;
His rising vas a signal for the rest,&#xD;
who, reaming themselves up in the same&#xD;
nanner, seemed for a moment as if they.&#xD;
were growing out of the earth.&#xD;
The elief now, stalked towards the&#xD;
large cabin, and alter having entered it,&#xD;
there sae duOAe-&#xD;
The interior of the cottage was very&#xD;
simple, but extremely inviting. It con-&#xD;
sisted of two apartments - separated&#xD;
&#xD;
"from each by two folds of carpet. Both&#xD;
had glazed windows, and the floor and&#xD;
walls were matted.&#xD;
A long table stood near one end of the&#xD;
apartment, and the nicety of the ar-&#xD;
rangement of the simple furniture, be.&#xD;
trayed the tasteful hand of a female. On&#xD;
one side of the wall hung a costly rifle of&#xD;
American manufacture, next to a fowl-&#xD;
ing piece, and then a beautiful double-&#xD;
barrelled gun from Versailles. On the&#xD;
opposite side were placed the various&#xD;
implements of Indian warfare-quivers&#xD;
of deer and alligator skin, bows, scalp-&#xD;
ing knives and tomahawks.&#xD;
In the midst of these weapons, hung&#xD;
a bag curiously worked in wampum,&#xD;
containing probably the arcana of mys-&#xD;
tic medicine,which the descendant of the&#xD;
inikos had inherited from his ancestors;&#xD;
and to which, perhaps, he owed his au-&#xD;
thority over his tribe, as much as to his&#xD;
distinguished qualities as a warrior and&#xD;
hunter.&#xD;
. The twilight, so short in these regions,&#xD;
had settled into obscure darkness, when&#xD;
two female forms entered $the apart-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
"My children have stayed long," said&#xD;
the old man, without looking up.&#xD;
"They have gathered the grape, which&#xD;
my father likes so well," returned one&#xD;
of the females.&#xD;
"Good !'' was the answer.&#xD;
Canondah-for it was she who had re-&#xD;
turned with Rosa-now took an earthen&#xD;
vase, and put some of the grapes in it;&#xD;
then placing a dish with dried venison&#xD;
and parched maize on the table, she&#xD;
filled an earthen mug and handed it to&#xD;
her father. C&#xD;
The Indian drank, and put it on the&#xD;
table, then cut a few thin slices from&#xD;
the dried haunch, and took a handful of&#xD;
parched corn.&#xD;
Hi repast vas as short as the prepa-&#xD;
parat ons were, and scarcely a minute&#xD;
had elapsed, ' when the dishes were're-&#xD;
moved.&#xD;
"Are not, my children hungry ?" de'&#xD;
manded he, after he had fiuished his&#xD;
repast.&#xD;
"They have eaten of the grape."&#xD;
"Godt'!" said the old man, reclining&#xD;
again his head upon his hands.&#xD;
The girlihad no sooner observed this&#xD;
movement, than she glided forward and&#xD;
si'iking down before the chief, she fold-&#xD;
ed her arms on.lher bosom. He laid his&#xD;
hands on both her shoulders, as if oless-&#xD;

filed with water. But the great chief&#xD;
of the Salt Lake will dry it."&#xD;
An involuntary sigh escaped the fair&#xD;
maiden - she began to weep and sob:&#xD;
aloud._&#xD;
'The White Rose," said the chief, in&#xD;
the same told and steady toie' "will&#xD;
be the wife of a great warrior, who will&#xD;
fill her wigwam with the spoils taken&#xD;
from her enemies. Her hands will never&#xD;
do work, and will be envied by all the&#xD;
squaws."&#xD;
When he had spoken these words, he&#xD;
raised his legs on the low couch, and,&#xD;
shrouding himself in, his blanket, and&#xD;
lying down, soon fell asleep.&#xD;
Canondah seized th~e hand of the fair&#xD;
girl, and drawing .her into their room,&#xD;
laid her inger on her mouth ; then lead-&#xD;
ing her to her couch, she pressed her&#xD;
gently down.&#xD;
Rosa seemed to understand the mean-&#xD;
ing of the Judian girl, and was silent,&#xD;
But it was in vain she closed her eyes-&#xD;
the pale, sufbring form of the stranger&#xD;
stood before it. There was a storm ris-&#xD;
ing inher guileless heart that seemed to&#xD;
banish all rest.&#xD;
Minute after minute passed, hour after'&#xD;
hour, and still, she could not sleep. At&#xD;
last a stir in te front room announce&#xD;
that their chief was awake.&#xD;
Canondah sprang up from .her couch,&#xD;
and, as if aware of Rosa's restlessness,&#xD;
she stepped lose up to her, once more&#xD;
laid her finger on her lips, and then has-&#xD;
tened into her father's room.&#xD;
The chief's preparations for the en-&#xD;
suing hunt were soon finished, He east&#xD;
a pouch full of tobacco and shot, and a&#xD;
large powder-horn round his shoulders;&#xD;
and putting his long knife in his girdle,&#xD;
took up his double -barrelled gun. One&#xD;
of the young men cameto.carry the'bow&#xD;
and quiver with a bag filled with pro-&#xD;
visions.&#xD;
When the old man stepped out-into&#xD;
the avenue, he found the whole band of&#xD;
his warriors and hunters alreadyassem-&#xD;
bled.&#xD;
They had assembled from their cabins&#xD;
in the same silent manner, and they&#xD;
glided now behind their chief towards&#xD;
the bank of the river, and into their&#xD;
canoes, with a stealth which had some-&#xD;
thing appalling-startling.&#xD;
They have gone,"' said Canondah,&#xD;
who had accompanied the train to the&#xD;
water's edge, and again returned.&#xD;
"Then let us hasten to the youth I"&#xD;
said Rosa-&#xD;
"The White Rose," said the Indian,&#xD;
&#xD;
19&#xD;
&#xD;
'in a mild but serious tone, "must sleep,&#xD;
or her pale tiae° will betray, when the&#xD;
sun rises, what is buried in her bosom.&#xD;
My red sisters are yery subtle, and their&#xD;
eyes are wide open. They would find&#xD;
the trail of their sister. A girl could&#xD;
now run after the.miko. Canondah will&#xD;
look to the 'stranger, but her sister must&#xD;
sleep!"&#xD;
So saying, Canondah pressed the fair&#xD;
maiden gently on her couch, and disap-&#xD;
peared behind the folds.&#xD;
Whether the tender language of her&#xD;
friend, whose faithfulness and sisterly&#xD;
love she knew, or her weariness con-&#xD;
tributed more to enforce this command,&#xD;
we are not able to determine. Sh,'how-&#xD;
ever, soon sank into a profound repose.&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
TVhw o mded Yo©u17 _&#xD;
The morning scarcely began to dawn,&#xD;
when 'the, dusky forms of the squaws&#xD;
and of their :daughters were seen hob-&#xD;
bling and gliding towards the spot where&#xD;
their men and fathers. had embarked a&#xD;
few hours before.&#xD;
Canondah tripped towards herfather's&#xD;
cottage. She found Rosa still sleeping.&#xD;
A tender smile played round the beau-&#xD;
tiful mouth --her finely modelled lips&#xD;
moved and whispered.&#xD;
Canondah 'ent - over the enchanting&#xD;
form, and could nOt resist pressing a kiss&#xD;
on her lips..&#xD;
The maiden opened her eyes, and see-&#xD;
ing her friend,.she whispered-&#xD;
"Canondah, I had a dream. I saw&#xD;
him. gHe stood in a deep, deep valley,&#xD;
and he stretched his hand out for me,&#xD;
and I raised hii. Have you soon him?&#xD;
And is he not more sick? And does he&#xD;
not look pale and tremble with cold ?&#xD;
And has he catch of the fruits and drunk&#xD;
of the wine t"&#xD;
"Rosa," returned the Indian' with an&#xD;
arch smile, "has not talked so much&#xD;
these twenty suns. The youth is under&#xD;
the big tree."&#xD;
"But how came be there'? You did&#xD;
nps let him walk o"&#xD;
"The, shoulders of Canondah have&#xD;
borne him."&#xD;
"And the trail that we have left, and&#xD;
the big serpent, and the broken cane,"&#xD;
said the charming maiden, blushing in&#xD;
girlish confusion at the innocent cheat&#xD;
which she was playing upon her Indian&#xD;
friends.&#xD;

ROSA, Ti 9 1 IA APTPTR&#xD;
&#xD;
SOSA, THE INDIAN CAPTIVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Indian,whose additional six years&#xD;
had doubtless rendered her more. expe-,&#xD;
rienced in those little stratagems, one of&#xD;
which her friend seemed willing to prac-&#xD;
tise, broke out into a loud fit of merry&#xD;
laugh hter.&#xD;
"B t, Canondah," said she, "how you&#xD;
delight to torment poor Rosa !"&#xD;
"Look there," said the Indian, "how&#xD;
the White Rose has turned a cheat in,&#xD;
onenight-sre will tell her sister of the&#xD;
trail and broken cane.,Sie cares no&#xD;
mote about them than the mike for his&#xD;
beads, while her heart thinks on he&#xD;
-white youth.  ,anondi will whip her&#xD;
White Rose for it. But come," added&#xD;
she, handing her a dress of somewhat&#xD;
coarser materials than that she wsre&#xD;
the day pre vious--"Rosa must take this,&#xD;
and cheat the squaws too !"&#xD;
T he maiden slipped, with a sigh, into&#xD;
the caieo gown, flung a silk handker-&#xD;
chief over her bosom, and tripped be-&#xD;
fohe tie cabin, where a clear spring was&#xD;
bubbling. In a few moments she was&#xD;
again at the side of the Indian, who&#xD;
pointed to the table where their break-&#xD;
fast was standing- two baskets with&#xD;
grapes and cakes of Indian corn, and a&#xD;
cup filled with milk.&#xD;
Rousa waited in silence for the moment&#xD;
when the Indian would open the con-&#xD;
versation, casting only now and then a&#xD;
shy glance at her; but the dogged girl&#xD;
remained obstinate, and she glided si-&#xD;
lently through the door as soon as she&#xD;
had done eating.&#xD;
Rosa sat down to her little work-table&#xD;
with a sigh, to busy herself over a gown&#xD;
which she intended for Canondah's bri-&#xD;
dal dress,&#xD;
Perhaps three hours might have&#xD;
elapsed, when the Indian returned, a&#xD;
smile of satisfaction played over her&#xD;
countenance, 'and, taking Rosa's liondi,&#xD;
she drew the maiden afterer towards&#xD;
the bank of the stream, and the harbor&#xD;
where the women and girls were assem-&#xD;
'led around the canoe, waiting only for&#xD;
the daughter of their chief.&#xD;
"Rosa is very timid," said, she, turn-&#xD;
ing towards the woman -" she cannot&#xD;
go along ." and the three girls bounded&#xD;
with a single leap into the bark that&#xD;
floated as light as afeather on the beau-&#xD;
tiful stream. A shout of joy burst tromn&#xD;
the lips of the multitude.&#xD;
Canondah waved her hand gracefully,&#xD;
and szed the paddle. The canoe dart-&#xD;
ed a short distance up the stream, turn-&#xD;
ed sulhienil down, again they lew up,&#xD;
nal ageim glided down the treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
All at once a sudden, piercing cry was&#xD;
beard from the direction in which the&#xD;
canoe had shot along.&#xD;
For a moment, the women, girls and&#xD;
boys stood still, aund the next tlbey scam&#xD;
pered and hobbled away on the path&#xD;
along time cane-brake, and in the direc-&#xD;
tion where woleft the stranger.&#xD;
Rosa grew pale, and she turned, with&#xD;
a faltering step, towards the well-known&#xD;
path, following the multitude with a&#xD;
pamiting.heart.&#xD;
She had a guess of the device of her&#xD;
friend, but dawning love is anxious, and.&#xD;
Rosa began to feel its symptoms.&#xD;
When sh 'arrived near the cotton&#xD;
tree, the last of the train, she found&#xD;
squaws, girls and boys collected round&#xD;
the stranger, a sullen and wondering&#xD;
group.-&#xD;
A hollow murmur rolled ,round the&#xD;
dark circle-in the midst of, and only -a&#xD;
few paces from, the 'youth, :Canondah&#xD;
was standing.&#xD;
The youth leaned on the trunk of the&#xD;
tree with his eyes closed, insensible to&#xD;
what passed around humn.&#xD;
"Look !" said the Indian, waving her&#xD;
hand to the squaws,'who now upend&#xD;
the ring, and speaking with that asst-&#xD;
rance which marked all her doings and&#xD;
sayings-" Look,! the'great chief of the&#xD;
Salt Lake hassent a ruuner' in his ca-&#xD;
nes, anti he has been bitten by the ser-&#xD;
pent of the water."&#xD;
She spo'ke these words with so- much&#xD;
unconcern, that the .assembled crowd of&#xD;
squaws and girls had not the least sus-&#xD;
picion of any deception practised upon&#xD;
them.&#xD;
Sene of the old squaws were seen&#xD;
creeping towards the cane-brake ; but&#xD;
Canondab left them no furthei- scrutiny.&#xD;
Waving her hand, she directed some of&#xD;
the girls to prepare a litter.&#xD;
They obeyed instantly-cut two sap-&#xD;
lings down, laid stems of cane across,&#xD;
and covered them'with'tallimndsea. To&#xD;
this couch the youth could be safely&#xD;
trusted, and the female commander once&#xD;
more waved her hand, and, putting the&#xD;
train under the superintendence of Rosa,&#xD;
she darted with her two companions&#xD;
again through the cane-brake.&#xD;
The group moved slowly afd in si-&#xD;
lence towards the village, where they&#xD;
found Canondah, who had returned in&#xD;
the birchen canoe, already waiting. She&#xD;
preceded them to the cottageof her fa-&#xD;
tier. She opened the door, and point-&#xD;
inig to th bench, the bearrs laid the&#xD;
&#xD;
ounded stranger down. The crowd&#xD;
remained outside&#xD;
"Rosa past stay here, while Canon-&#xD;
dahis tal ing with the squaws." And.&#xD;
so saving she slided out into the aye-&#xD;
nue, with an air which seemed to soften&#xD;
a little her father's austerity.&#xD;
The maiden sat down on the bench,&#xD;
anxiously looking at the youth, who lay&#xD;
deadly pale,. and shaking badly with the.&#xD;
symptoms .of a wound fever, that had&#xD;
increased-during his. exposure to the&#xD;
damp night air.&#xD;
Canoudoh again entered at the door,&#xD;
through which, after some minutes, she&#xD;
was followed by an old squaw, who cat-&#xD;
nid a bundle of dry herbs in her hand.&#xD;
Thehidepusarepresentative o scula-&#xD;
plus,-for such was her capaci y, hobbled&#xD;
towards the youth, made a deep examni-'&#xD;
nation, and again trotted off.&#xD;
"To-morrow the cold will be' gone,"&#xD;
said Canondaih; "hut we must not pour&#xD;
more balsam into his wound."&#xD;
The old squaw came again with aket-&#xD;
tie that contained a decoetion of herbs.&#xD;
She poured part of it into a mug; and,&#xD;
while Canondah raised the patient, she&#xD;
presented it to him...&#xD;
He opened his. dim, almost sunken&#xD;
eyes, but shut them again, and suffered&#xD;
the old squaw to pour the drug into his&#xD;
mouth.&#xD;
Soon after he had taken the draught,&#xD;
drops of perspiration began to appear&#xD;
on his forehead.&#xD;
Making a significant gesture with her&#xD;
hand, the old squaw shrunk out of the&#xD;
room.&#xD;
The female council seemed to have&#xD;
left on the countenance of Canondah a&#xD;
sternness that caused poor Rosa a slight&#xD;
tremor, when the Indian girl seized her&#xD;
hand and led her into the inner apart-&#xD;
ment.       -&#xD;
"Rosa," said the Indian, when they&#xD;
were seated on the couch in their little&#xD;
room, "Canonlah lhan cheated the eyes&#xD;
of the squaws of her people, that she&#xD;
may lighten the smile of joy on the fair&#xD;
cheeks of her sister."&#xD;
She paused.&#xD;
After a little, the Indian girl again&#xD;
epoke-.&#xD;
"She has taken the enemy of her peo-&#xD;
ple and of the chief of the Salt Lake&#xD;
into the wigwam of her. father - the&#xD;
spy!"&#xD;
"0, no, Canondah I" exclaimed Rosa ;&#xD;
"look only into the face of my brother.&#xD;
Does he look as if his tongue was false0&#xD;
&#xD;
Does he look like an enemy of his own&#xD;
people l"&#xD;
"My sister is very young, and does&#xD;
not know the enemy of the white peo-&#xD;
pie. They send their young men into&#xD;
the villages of the red people to count&#xD;
their cattle, and. their corn fields, and&#xD;
their skins;-and when they return, they&#xD;
show their brethi-eu the path that leads&#xD;
to the red villages, and they come and&#xD;
take all from them, and drive them into&#xD;
the woods."&#xD;
"And does mysister think," returned&#xD;
Rosa, timidly, "that the youth is one of&#xD;
the spies'!".&#xD;
Th1eiesIndian shook her head doubt-&#xD;
fuly.&#xD;
"Does he not speak with their tongue?&#xD;
Look, my sister," added1)sheafter a mo&#xD;
ment's reflection, "Canondak has ex-&#xD;
tended her hand in- friendship. towards&#xD;
the stranger, when she saw that the&#xD;
heart of the White Rose yearned 'after&#xD;
him; but she has not acted like the&#xD;
daughter of the- great miko-she has&#xD;
put the night-between him and tJi miko&#xD;
--and now she takes Jhim into her fa-&#xD;
ther's wigwam when he has left it !"&#xD;
"But he would have died of his fear-&#xD;
ful wounds in the woods. Look 'how&#xD;
he trembles with cold ! rIfhe fever, too,&#xD;
shakes his limbs ! The morning and the&#xD;
night air is very cold, and the fogs are&#xD;
wet P"&#xD;
"And the miko," said the Indian, "he&#xD;
will not clenchbbis fistagainst a brot her,&#xD;
to whom his daughter has extended her&#xD;
hand ; but when his daughter has-been&#xD;
a fool, and has'extended her hand to an&#xD;
enemy of her people, will the face of the&#xD;
iikd not darken on the girls ?"&#xD;
"Must he kndw of the stranger?&#xD;
whispered Rosa, hesitatingly, as'if afraid&#xD;
of giving utterance to her words.&#xD;
A light smile of scorn. passed across&#xD;
the countenance of theIndian girl.,-&#xD;
"The miko of the Oconees;" said she,&#xD;
with a touch of pride, "will scent the&#xD;
air of a white man ton suns after, hehas&#xD;
breathed it; and he wiU see theprint&#xD;
of his feet twenty suns after hehias left&#xD;
it in the grass. Canondah may cheat&#xD;
the squaws, but she cannot cheat the&#xD;
mike. , And will the squaws not tell this&#xD;
to the warriors and hunters what their&#xD;
eyes have seen ? And will the warriors&#xD;
- ot whisper into the ears of the mike&#xD;
And shall the daughter of Tokeah stand&#xD;
before her father like 'a liart NO," said&#xD;
she, "Canondah loves the White Rose&#xD;
j very mnch, but she would not cheat her&#xD;

father. If the youth be a scout of the&#xD;
white men, her father will see.'&#xD;
"And m.' brother 1" said Rosa, trem-&#xD;
bling.&#xD;
"Will learn to die," said the girl, with&#xD;
a firm, decided tone. "But the youth is&#xD;
hungry, and Canondah must cook for&#xD;
him."&#xD;
Rosa now followed the Indian with a&#xD;
trembling heart.&#xD;
Five hours had passed, and the moon&#xD;
stood high, when a light stir from the&#xD;
patient told that he was waking.&#xD;
The girls hastened now, to put those&#xD;
refreshments before their guest which&#xD;
the skilful hand of Canondah had pre-&#xD;
pared during his sleep.&#xD;
When he had finished his light repast,&#xD;
Canondali laid him again softly on his&#xD;
cushion.&#xD;
And, casting her arm around Rosa,&#xD;
drew her towards their little room.&#xD;
But Rosa,as soon as she perceived the&#xD;
first symptom's of Canondah's sleep,&#xD;
rose softly from her couch, and stole&#xD;
through the curtain to the feet-of her&#xD;
white brother.&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
The Indian Maiden and the Stranger.&#xD;
The extraordinary skill which the&#xD;
Indians possess in curing flesh wounds&#xD;
and fevers, appeared strikingly in our&#xD;
youth when he awoke next morning.&#xD;
He felt himself sufficiently strong to.rise&#xD;
into a sitting posture. While doing so,&#xD;
the two girls entered.&#xD;
'Good morning, my sister," said he,&#xD;
with a voice still faint.&#xD;
The compliment was returned in si-&#xD;
lence.&#xD;
The Indian glanced at him, as if to&#xD;
inquire into the state of his health, and&#xD;
stepped close before him.&#xD;
"My white brother," said she, after a&#xD;
pause. "is come in the canoe of the great&#xD;
chief of the Salt Lake-has he lived in&#xD;
bis wigwam, and smoked the pipe of&#xD;
peace with him'&#xD;
The meaning of the Indian, though&#xD;
expressed in her figurative style, and&#xD;
broken, guttural English, could not be&#xD;
mistaken.&#xD;
"Chief of the Salt Lake! You do not&#xD;
mean the pirate of Barataria ?"&#xD;
He did not pronounce the last word,&#xD;
but looked at the Indian, whose eye was&#xD;
rivetted on him with a calm, scrutinising&#xD;
expression. .&#xD;
&#xD;
"Where am I?" exclaimed he now, in&#xD;
a tone whose hollow sound betrayed the&#xD;
fearful agitation of his mind.&#xD;
"Fear nothing, my brother," lisped&#xD;
Rosa, whose tender heart could not bear&#xD;
the struggle fhat manifested itself on&#xD;
the face of the youth. "The daughter&#xD;
of the miko has extended her hand in&#xD;
friendship-my brother is safe !"&#xD;
There was a tenderness in the tone of&#xD;
her voice,.a delicacy in her movements&#xD;
as she crossed her beautiful hands be-&#xD;
fore her bosom, that chased away the&#xD;
clouds from his brow.&#xD;
As the youth looked up to the lovely&#xD;
beig who thus encouraged him, the ex-&#xD;
pressioi of his countenance changed into&#xD;
that of surprise-till' his eye became,&#xD;
to use an Indian term, "wide open with&#xD;
wonder and admiration."&#xD;
But the fierce little Indian left him no&#xD;
time'for admiration-she seemed to have&#xD;
laid aside all her softer feelings.&#xD;
"My brother is very young,"-resumed&#xD;
she, "to go on the war-path against the&#xD;
great chief of the Salt Lake. He must&#xD;
first learn to hunt the deer and buffalo,&#xD;
and to strike the big water-serpent, be-&#xD;
fore he fights his enemies, or the girls of&#xD;
of his people will weep over their fallen&#xD;
brother."&#xD;
There was an air of pity, mingled&#xD;
with contempt, that raised a transient&#xD;
blush on his cheek. He glanced at the&#xD;
speaker, as if to inquire into the rela-&#xD;
tion in which she stood with the dread-&#xD;
ed pirate ; but her calm, immovable&#xD;
features 'gave no clue to any conclu--&#xD;
sion.&#xD;
"And why do you suppose your bro-&#xD;
ther," said he, adopting the saine ap-&#xD;
pellation, "has been on the war-path&#xD;
against the great chief, as you call the&#xD;
pirate P"&#xD;
"Look !" returned the Indian ; "when&#xD;
the red men go on the war-path against&#xD;
their enemies, they strike the warriors&#xD;
and chiefs of their foes-'either dead on&#xD;
the spot, or they catch them, to show&#xD;
them to their young men and their girls;&#xD;
but then they watch them, that, they&#xD;
may not run away from them. But my&#xD;
young white brother is none of the war-&#xD;
riors or chiefs-his hands are very ten-&#xD;
der, and have never raised a tomahawk.&#xD;
The great chief has caught him with&#xD;
the boys and girls of his people, and&#xD;
sent him to his village. The chief of&#xD;
the Salt Lake is very great, and strikes&#xD;
men, but he cares not for women or&#xD;
girls !"&#xD;
When she had uttered this tauntim&#xD;
&#xD;
ROSA, THE INDIAN CAPTIVE, -&#xD;
&#xD;
speech, she watched his face keetily, as&#xD;
if to read the impression. her words had&#xD;
made.&#xD;
Rose's eyes were rivetted on the stran-&#xD;
er, and her countenance betrayed in-&#xD;
tense anxiety.&#xD;
The youth, seeming to find gradually&#xD;
the key to the heart of his fierce little&#xD;
antagonist, replied-&#xD;
"Does a great chief strike, people who&#xD;
have no arms, or does' he rob women,&#xD;
when.they are' on their 'way to see their&#xD;
mother?   Only cowards do that -the&#xD;
brave warriors strike only men 1"&#xD;
The manner'in which he uttered' these&#xD;
words raised the interest of the Indian&#xD;
girl.&#xD;
"And has my white brother then been&#xD;
among tQose who went on the war-path&#xD;
against the chief of the Salt Lake? Ias&#xD;
he not been caught with his weapons ?&#xD;
Then he has been caught as a spy,.as, a&#xD;
scout, for he-speaks with the tongue of&#xD;
the enemies of the red people, and of the&#xD;
great chief-or does my brother talk&#xD;
with a double tongue?"&#xD;
"You do your -brother injustice," said&#xD;
the youth, with some embarrassment ;&#xD;
"he is neither a spy, nor is he on the&#xD;
wara-path against the great chief. He&#xD;
was on his way to see his mother. Has&#xD;
my sister never heard of a great people&#xD;
beyond the Salt Lakes whose big canoes&#xD;
cover the sea? See ! your brother is&#xD;
one of these , people -i he came many&#xD;
thousand miles across the big lake-he is&#xD;
from England."&#xD;
"England !" muttered the Indian girl&#xD;
whose geographical'knowledge was.rather&#xD;
limited, as may be supposed-"then my&#xD;
brother. is none of the people who are&#xD;
the eneaftes of the red men; and not on&#xD;
the war-path against the chief- he did&#xD;
not cone as a'spy ?"&#xD;
"Certainly not."&#xD;
The Indian paused thoughtfully.&#xD;
"My way," continued he, ."lies far ofi&#xD;
frort that of the pirate, but he crossed&#xD;
my path, and took us, the friendsof'your&#xD;
people, prisoners. See, my sister," added&#xD;
he, after a short pause, "I have escaped&#xD;
from the strong hold of the pirate, bu&#xD;
it was not my intention to conic to your&#xD;
village. A strong wind drove my boa&#xD;
into the mouth of the lake, from which&#xD;
ascended the river on which your village~&#xD;
&#xD;
is situated, not knowing whither I was&#xD;
going. My waylay towards the mouth&#xD;
of the Iississippi, to the white people-&#xD;
I sought them, though they are atwar'&#xD;
with my own people-yet they -would&#xD;
have given me a big canoe to return to&#xD;
my home!".&#xD;
"The white people," said the Indian,&#xD;
with fiercenss- "they would have killed&#xD;
you !"&#xD;
"No, my sister."&#xD;
The Indian shook her head incredu-&#xD;
lously.&#xD;
"My brother makes a fool of Canon-&#xD;
dah," she said.&#xD;
Rosa had stood a silent and attentive&#xD;
listener.' She -now touched the indian&#xD;
lightly,.and whispered to her.&#xD;
"My brother speaks true," said she.;&#xD;
"he is welcome."&#xD;
"Where is your father r" demanded&#xD;
the Englishman-"you are not yet mar-&#xD;
ried ?"&#xD;
"The miko is gone with-the warriors to&#xD;
the hunting grounds, and will not return&#xD;
these twelve suns," replied the Indian.&#xD;
The youth's countenance lit up with a&#xD;
beam of hope"&#xD;
"And my sister," said he, "will show&#xD;
her brother the path that leads to the&#xD;
village of the white people."&#xD;
"My brother," said the Indian, "is&#xD;
welcome to the wigwam's of the red peo-&#xD;
ple, but he must stay till the miko comes&#xD;
back."&#xD;
"Till the miko comes back !" repeated&#xD;
he, crest-fallen.&#xD;
,   A  pause ensued for some moments.&#xD;
At last the youth said-&#xD;
"Has my child ever known a sister of&#xD;
hers to whom 'she was attached with all&#xD;
her heart ?"&#xD;
The Indian glanced at him, and then&#xD;
threw  both her arms round the neck of&#xD;
Rosa, and pressed half a dozen kisses on&#xD;
her lips.&#xD;
f "How would' she like to lose her sis-&#xD;
ter?" said the youth, touched by the deep&#xD;
affection of the Indian girl.&#xD;
"Canondah could not live wi'.hout the&#xD;
l White Rose.'&#xD;
t   "And if the White Rose should be&#xD;
r torn from her side, would she not try&#xD;
t every means to save her V'&#xD;
I "Canondah would give her life for the&#xD;
eWhite Rose !"&#xD;

ROSA, THE INDIAN CAPTIVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Look !" said the youth-"in the ves-&#xD;
sel in which I came, was my sister with&#xD;
four of our servants. She is as kind as&#xD;
you are, and almost as fair as your sis-&#xD;
ter.  We were going to she our mother,&#xD;
when the pirate took our vessel and led&#xD;
us into captivity. I escaped 'to save my&#xD;
sister, either with the assistance of the&#xD;

t the e   try of my own people, and&#xD;
to re iz v th a big armed canoe to res-&#xD;

So, 'my good sister," added he, "I have&#xD;
not a day to lose--every moment brings&#xD;
dangers."&#xD;
"Your sister," demanded the Indian,&#xD;
with a gleam of joy in her countenance,&#xD;
"is in tie hands of the chief of the Salt&#xD;
Lake, and he keeps her in his wigwam V"&#xD;
"You may believe me."&#xD;
"And how many suns is it since the&#xD;
sister of my brother has been in the wig-&#xD;
wam of the chief of the Salt Lake?"&#xD;
"Twenty-one days."&#xD;
"The presents which the chief has sent&#xD;
here," said she, turning to Rosa," are butch&#xD;
'uurteen suns old 1"&#xD;
Rosa replied in the aflirmativo.&#xD;
"And does the chief of the Salt Lake&#xD;
want two women, when the great miko&#xD;
of the Oconees had never more than&#xD;
one ." said she with an air of hero and&#xD;
deep scorn; which, however, changed&#xD;
suddenly, as she clasped Rosa in her&#xD;
arms; "the White Rose,' exclaimed she,&#xD;
"must weep r.o more-the miko will re-&#xD;
turn the presents-he will not suffer the&#xD;
White Rose to be carried away by the&#xD;
chief of the Salt Lake."&#xD;
"And my good sister," resumed the&#xD;
youth, "will not clear the path of her&#xD;
brother, whom she had received so gene-&#xD;
rously into her wigwam ?"&#xD;
"My brother is welcome," returned&#xD;
the Indian, and he shall have, plenty of&#xD;
everything, but he must stay till the&#xD;
miko returns. If the great chief has&#xD;
taken his sister, and keeps. her in his wig-&#xD;
wam, he will make her his wife, and she&#xD;
will be the wife of a great warrior." -&#xD;
iHaving thus, as she conceived, given&#xD;
to her guest the last consolation, she wasI&#xD;
going to leave the room, whea Rosa ar-&#xD;
rested her once more.                1&#xD;
"And does my sister think, that whom&#xD;
Rosa abhors, the sister of my white brk-t&#xD;
&#xD;
ther will love? Aii will she not help&#xD;
a sister ?"'&#xD;
"And the miko, when he returns from&#xD;
the hunting 4 grounds, and finds that the&#xD;
young man is gone ?"&#xD;
"Canondah must tell that Rosa has&#xD;
cleared his path," whispered she, with a&#xD;
downcast look.&#xD;
"And Rosa ?" interrupted the Indian,&#xD;
darting an impatient glance at her, "Go!&#xD;
Canondah would rather die !",&#xD;
The youth looked after the girls, as&#xD;
they now glided through the door, like&#xD;
one spell-bound.     -,&#xD;
At the well-meant consolation of Ca--&#xD;
nondah, indeed, a sneer passed over his&#xD;
countenance; but remembering how very&#xD;
different the ideas of an Indian must-ne-&#xD;
cessarily be from his own, he composed&#xD;
himself.&#xD;
Though they had uttered the latter&#xD;
words in the Indian language, yet the&#xD;
attitude of resignation,'the humble mien&#xD;
with which Rosa folded her hands upon&#xD;
her bosom, and the horror of the Indian,.&#xD;
gave him partly a clue to what had just&#xD;
passed between them.&#xD;
"But who is this being, so strange, so&#xD;
tender, and yet so beautiful, who is step-&#xD;
ping like a mediating angel between me&#xD;
and this haughty savage ?" demanded he&#xD;
of himself. "11,w came she among these&#xD;
Indians? Surely she has been carried&#xD;
off by the pirate ? And how eano she&#xD;
by her dress? the latest fashion !"&#xD;
But then she spoke the Indian language&#xD;
fluently.:&#xD;
The more these mysteries weighed on&#xD;
his mind, the more confused his ideas-&#xD;
became; but he was still more embar-&#xD;
iasied by the novelty of his situation,&#xD;
and the persons by whom  he was sur-&#xD;
rounded.        -&#xD;
There was in the situation of the youth,&#xD;
helpless and melancholy as it Was, somr-&#xD;
thi g extremely roman tic.&#xD;
Captured,-as we have seen hin to be,&#xD;
by the Pirate-of Barataria, on his passage&#xD;
to one of the Western Islands, h found&#xD;
himself, after a solitary confluement, and&#xD;
a still drearier exposure on' the Gulf of&#xD;
Mexico, suddenly thrown among Indians,&#xD;
and near one of the most beautiful beings&#xD;
his eyes had ever beheld.&#xD;
The very romantic and daring impulse&#xD;
that prompted him to escape in a stormy&#xD;
&#xD;
night from the strong hold of the pirate,&#xD;
. in hope of reaching thy month of the&#xD;
ississippi, and thus perhaps liberating_&#xD;
a dear sister, wrought within him a ten-&#xD;
der interest in the beautiful andsinnocent,&#xD;
Rosa,.&#xD;
Asolitary confinement in a cottage,&#xD;
with no other object before his eyes than&#xD;
a fascinating maiden, placed in strong&#xD;
relief by a fine little Indian figure, could&#xD;
not but excite those romantic sentiments&#xD;
which slumber in the heart of every&#xD;
warm feeling youth.&#xD;
But there was also something which.&#xD;
y eened to contend powerful against&#xD;
the soft sentiments which began to creep&#xD;
into his bosom.&#xD;
Rosa's surpassing beauty had excited&#xD;
his deep interest, but prudence seemed&#xD;
to repress his feelings. His heart lay in&#xD;
his eye, but his tongue was governed b&#xD;
cooler reason. And a reserve began to&#xD;
come over him, that tended to make the&#xD;
life of the three inhabitants of the cottage&#xD;
painful.&#xD;
The two gils seemed to grow more&#xD;
reserved in the same proportion. They&#xD;
had not since the first interview spoken_&#xD;
a single word,. They were stillatten.tive&#xD;
to him, and even more so than before,.&#xD;
but preserved:an unbroken silence in his.&#xD;
presence.&#xD;
The Indian girl, regularly performed;&#xD;
the task of a rsurgeon; while Rosa gave&#xD;
him his meals. On these occasions her&#xD;
hand vWould tremble-indeed, a shy and&#xD;
furtive glance would steal on him, as he&#xD;
took the cup, and her eye would sink on&#xD;
the , floor with a timid expression-her&#xD;
bosem would heave, and a crimson blush&#xD;
would mantle over her cheek and neck-&#xD;
but just when he was going to break the&#xD;
silence with a soft, condescending case,,&#xD;
to which he had schooled and -studied&#xD;
himself through hours before, the name-&#xD;
less grace which pervaded "her move-&#xD;
ments, and .her mild dignity tied his&#xD;
tongue, and made him look with a deep&#xD;
confusion which did not escape the fair&#xD;
maiden.&#xD;
There was something singular in this.&#xD;
It seemed as if the delicate being looked&#xD;
up to himewith awe, but still with a true&#xD;
' nobleness, which inspired him with a&#xD;
entitment not unlike that with which a&#xD;
&#xD;
pious-catholic looks upon his favorite&#xD;
saint,&#xD;
It was the visible power which pure,&#xD;
uncontaminated innoence exercises, with&#xD;
undisputed sway, over those who come&#xD;
within its enchanting influence,&#xD;
HAP TER      V.&#xD;
The Night Dance.&#xD;
nIt ewas the night of the fourth day&#xD;
sihce the  n man had become an in-&#xD;
mate of the cottage. ie felt his strength&#xD;
almost returned. 'he healing balsam&#xD;
had effected wonders, and already cica-&#xD;
trized the wound, so as to make -banda-&#xD;
ges superfluous.&#xD;
He had slept for a couple of hQurs,&#xD;
when a light rushing noise on the mat&#xD;
awakened him.&#xD;
lHe looked around, and caught the dim&#xD;
shadow  of . a figure that disappeared&#xD;
through the door. At the same time&#xD;
long, and loud flashes of a glaring light&#xD;
itlumimed the room.&#xD;
The young man sprang up.  ,&#xD;
"The village is on fire !" exclaimed he,&#xD;
rushing towards th door.&#xD;
"D p't be alarmed, said the soft voice&#xD;
of Rosa, who opened the door, and stood&#xD;
on the threshold-"our girls and women.&#xD;
are performing the night dance!"&#xD;
SThe mournful tones of musical instru-&#xD;
ments were now heard.&#xD;
"N ight-dance !" repeated th youtb-&#xD;
"Am I allowed to see it ?"&#xD;
. "The night is very cold and damp; my&#xD;
brothermust not walk in the dark night,&#xD;
or he will catch the fever again; but,"&#xD;
added she, after a pause, "'my brother&#xD;
may see the girls dancing from the avin-&#xD;
dow of ,Ross's 1-dom."&#xD;
So saying, she tendered him h r hand,&#xD;
and led ,hi!n through the partition-cur-&#xD;
tains into her apartment,.&#xD;
'This, room' was lighted with. a: small&#xD;
window,that looked out On the bank of&#xD;
the stream.&#xD;

ROSA, THE INDIAN CAPTIVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
assembled in a wide circle, each of 'them&#xD;
holding in one hand a burning pine torch,&#xD;
in the other a bell.&#xD;
Four of the company occupied a sepa-&#xD;
rate place in the circle, and played on&#xD;
Indian drums and Indian flutes.&#xD;
The sounds elicited from these instru-&#xD;
ments were at first very faint, slow and&#xD;
deadened-but they rose by degrees, and&#xD;
quickened, as if to rouse the passions of&#xD;
the dancers.&#xD;
When they had changed into a double&#xD;
strophe, the light and graceful form of&#xD;
Canondah was seen rising and entering&#xD;
the circle.&#xD;
Her dance was singular. At first she&#xD;
glided, orrather wound, itself round the&#xD;
sitting copper figures with serpentine&#xD;
quickness-then she assumed a perpen-&#xD;
dicular attitude, her feet moved close&#xD;
together, and she scarcely lifted them,&#xD;
but kept time to the thumping of the&#xD;
drum by raising her heels, and turning&#xD;
her feet in the same direction. Her&#xD;
gestures were strong, chaste and very&#xD;
graceful. When she had danced for some&#xD;
minutes, she at length wheeled round,&#xD;
and took her seat.&#xD;
The blaze of more that a hundred&#xD;
torches glared in all directions, and were&#xD;
reflected from the wide mirror of the&#xD;
stream-the copper figures, resembling,&#xD;
vith their blazing brands, so many fierce&#xD;
demons-the old squaws, with their dis-.&#xD;
hevelled, glossy hair floating round their&#xD;
withered necks and shoulders -their&#xD;
ungainly, threatening gambols-and the&#xD;
sombre, melancholy sound of the Indian&#xD;
flute, that sounded like a death-knell,&#xD;
gave to the sight an inexpressible look&#xD;
of fierce and demoniacal revelry.&#xD;
On a sudden the torches were blown&#xD;
out, and the whole scene was involved&#xD;
in darkness.&#xD;
The stranger felt a cold shudder now&#xD;
creep over him as he stood at the little&#xD;
window. He involuntarily drew nearer&#xD;
the maiden, and seized her hand.&#xD;
"It is a frightful sight indeed," said&#xD;
he ; "and, Rosa, how could she live with&#xD;
such beingsV"&#xD;
"0, they have been very kind to Rosa&#xD;
indeed, but-"&#xD;
" But, " resumed he, " you have been&#xD;
carried oft by the pirate --"&#xD;
&#xD;
"0, he will do it !" was her reply,&#xD;
covering her face with her other hand,&#xD;
and weeping.&#xD;
There is nothing more calculated to&#xD;
awaken sympathy than to see a tender&#xD;
and innocent being in danger-it aroused&#xD;
all our energies.&#xD;
"Never !" exclaimed he, forgetting his&#xD;
own helpless situation in the danger of&#xD;
the beautiful being-"Arthur will protect&#xD;
you!"&#xD;
"Arthur !" she repeated, musing.&#xD;
It was as if his name had brought him&#xD;
still nearer to her heart !&#xD;
She drew  nearer to him-her )hand'&#xD;
trembled in his-its soft 'palpitation now&#xD;
thrilled, like electricity, through his very&#xD;
veins ! The moon shed its silvery light&#xD;
through the window.&#xD;
"My brother," said a voice behind&#xD;
them,- "must whisper softly into the ear&#xD;
of the White Rose, for she is very tender&#xD;
-look! she has brought him wine and&#xD;
a blanket into the hollow tree, and she&#xD;
watched by him when he was sleeping,&#xD;
-the roses have almost gone from her&#xD;
face!"&#xD;
"Rose !" exclaimed the youth, who&#xD;
remembered now the light noise which&#xD;
he had sometimes heard in his broken&#xD;
slumbers, "you did not do that ? Ho&#xD;
do I deserve so much kindness and favor&#xD;
- from you ?"&#xD;
"But, Canondah ." said the maiden,&#xD;
with reproach.,&#xD;
Canondah, however, was gone-she&#xD;
had stolen through the folds as silently&#xD;
as she had.glided in'&#xD;
"My sweet, beautiful Rosa!" exclaimed&#xD;
the youth, overpowered, clasping her to&#xD;
his bosom.&#xD;
She suffered the embrace with yielding&#xD;
tenderness.&#xD;
His lips sought hers-they touched-&#xD;
their breath mingled-it was a delicious&#xD;
moment!&#xD;
"My brother," lisped Rosa, with a&#xD;
tremulous voice, and still clasped it -his&#xD;
embrace, "see, the cheek of your sister&#xD;
burns  very   much, and   her bosom&#xD;
threatens to burst ; and"-her soft voice&#xD;
fell into a mild, beseeching tone-" ny&#xD;
brother must not stay longer where Rosa&#xD;
sleeps-nor must ha come when his sister&#xD;
sleeps. Ah I" added she, and her voice&#xD;
&#xD;
melted almost in silver tones, "the wise&#xD;
man, and he who died on the cross for&#xD;
,our' sin's, would be, very angry at his&#xD;
sister."&#xD;
"And' who is' the wise man t" inquired&#xD;
the youth.&#xD;
"He who has taught Rosa, in the cabin&#xD;
of the trader,"1&#xD;
The youth paused a moment, ,i a&#xD;
paroxysm of love and admiration-then,&#xD;
as i seized by holy awe, he caught her&#xD;
once more in his arms, raised her, and&#xD;
laying her softly down on the couch, he&#xD;
pressed a long kiss on her Izpsb&#xD;
"No, dear one! Fear npt! None&#xD;
but a wretch, could beguile so heavenly a&#xD;
being into sin! Sleep sweetly, and in&#xD;
peace. Another will watch for you;"&#xD;
So saying, he agakJ pressed a kiss on&#xD;
her lips, and fled from the room.&#xD;
"Arthur !" repeated she-"good night,&#xD;
Arthur"&#xD;
He caught the sounds a he hastened&#xD;
towards his rooms His bosom burned&#xD;
with inexpressible passion.' A' storm&#xD;
had risen in his heart that threatened to&#xD;
consume him.&#xD;
"If ever," prayed he, "my fate shall&#xD;
be linked with that of a human being,&#xD;
&#xD;
let it be Rosa !"&#xD;
When Arthur awoke the next morning&#xD;
the scenes of the last night floated before&#xD;
his imagination like so many.dteams.&#xD;
It was a bright and lovely morning. In&#xD;
a field, a group of Indian girls' were ga-&#xD;
thering corn,               -   ,.&#xD;
Arthur proceeded through the avenue,&#xD;
-looking to the right, he beheld Rosa&#xD;
in a garden.&#xD;
She had already espied him, and now&#xD;
dame tripping and blushing towards him.&#xD;
"And will my brother not see the fme&#xD;
flowers of his sister'?" said she, raising&#xD;
her eyes with a tiid' expression  anid,&#xD;
taking his hand,and drawing him towards&#xD;
the hedge, his eye rivetted .on her, as if&#xD;
to satiate himself.&#xD;
Arthur took the flower, and stood&#xD;
gazing and 'admiring deeply the'living&#xD;
. Rose.&#xD;
Arthur now took her hand-it was the&#xD;
loveliest little hand 'ever touched by; a&#xD;
love-sick youth.    /&#xD;

&#xD;
"We are seven summers on the banks&#xD;
of this waters"&#xD;
"4nd where has Rosa been previous&#xD;
to this time '"&#xD;
"In the cabin of the white trader many&#xD;
days from here--beyond the big river!:&#xD;
"The Mississippi ?"&#xD;
"Yes)'&#xD;
"And does Rosa know how she 9amn&#xD;
to the ti~ader 2"&#xD;
"see'' said she, in a mysterious tone,&#xD;
"th people with whe; Rosa lived when&#xD;
she was very young, told her thatponee,&#xD;
in  stormy night,,an Indian chief came&#xD;
into their cabin; and brought them your.&#xD;
sister, in clothes that werefvery pretty,;&#xD;
and that she had been found on the road&#xD;
that lefd4 to the great village on the big&#xD;
river. That chief was the miko.!"&#xD;
"Will Rosa show me these clothes "&#xD;
said he, with an eagerness that betrayed&#xD;
his deep interest.&#xD;
"They are now old," said she, "and&#xD;
very little. , Rosa wore them when she&#xD;
was not yet a summer old---but she will&#xD;
show them to you?5&#xD;
$he tripped now towards the cabins&#xD;
followed by Arthur, in anxious expecta-&#xD;
tion.                             a&#xD;
She opened a drawer in the wall below&#xD;
the Indian weapons, and took a pack&#xD;
caref'ully laid by-unfolding it, she then&#xD;
handed every piece to: the youth. The&#xD;
ermine pelisse and bonnet were well&#xD;
preserved. The Brussels lace had beeome&#xD;
yellow with age-.the cambric and gros&#xD;
de Naples 'were faded.&#xD;
Arthur exAmined each piece with great&#xD;
attention. Near the seam of one of the&#xD;
little dresses he discovered a cipher, with&#xD;
the initials " J. d'A.,' and a coronet over&#xD;
the letters. "Rosa;' said he, and his&#xD;
mien became : earnest, "these clothes&#xD;
show that you at e of a .dLittinguishid&#xD;
family How you fell into the hamds of&#xD;
the Indian, heaven only knows ; but-."&#xD;
He paused a moment; for having looked&#xD;
at the last piece, he noticed a sealed&#xD;
parcel, with something heavy in it..&#xD;
"It is the gold chain,"  said Rosa-"but&#xD;
we must not open it-the .chief has put&#xD;
it up himself from me. '&#xD;
She took now the dresses, laid them&#xD;
again ear  fully by, and put the package&#xD;

ROSA, TUE INDIAN CAPTIVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"Rosa, " said the youth, after a pause,&#xD;
"Arthur loves you very much    more&#xD;
than he loves himself. Willyou listen&#xD;
to hin?"&#xD;
The full glance of love and tenderness&#xD;
met his eye.&#xD;
He continued-&#xD;
"Arthur has a mother, who lives many&#xD;
days' sail from  the mouth of the big&#xD;
river. To her Rosa will be welcome.&#xD;
Arthur is rich, and his friends are very&#xD;
powerful-they will find out her father&#xD;
and mother. Will Rosa follow her own&#xD;
Arthur?''&#xD;
She listened attentively, but she did&#xD;
tot enter into his meaning. "But the&#xD;
miko," said she, timidly, "would not let&#xD;
Rosa go."&#xD;
"We must fly !" said the youth.&#xD;
"Fly !" said she, "and leave Canon-&#xD;
dab, who has been a sister, a mother to&#xD;
Rosa?   And. the miko, who has paid&#xD;
beaver skins for the milk that she drank&#xD;
in the cabin of the trader ?"&#xD;
"Ros'," said the youth, in the rnst&#xD;
touching tones, "do not mistrust me-&#xD;
have confidence. Arthur will return ten,&#xD;
fold what the chief has paid to the white&#xD;
"rthur," said she, "no-- Rosa loves&#xD;
her brother very much-more than the&#xD;
light of her eyes-and his voice is much&#xD;
sweeter than the song of the birds ; but&#xD;
she-cannot leave those who have been&#xD;
kind to her "&#xD;
"Will Rosa stay with Indians; when a&#xD;
father, a mother, are weeping for her l"&#xD;
he asked.&#xD;
"See !" said she, 'the Fathet in hea-&#xD;
ven has given her the miko a' a father-&#xD;
lie will not forget His child !"&#xD;
She now got up to go to her sleeping&#xD;
room, and he arose to follow her.&#xD;
The arrangement of the room was&#xD;
simple. Near the window was a trunk-&#xD;
the youth cast a glance at him..&#xD;
"For heaven's sake ! how came this&#xD;
trunk here ? It is my sister's !" said he&#xD;
with vehemence.&#xD;
"Your sister's !' returned she, with&#xD;
astonishment; "the chief of the Salt&#xD;
Lake hassentrit to the miko. It contains&#xD;
the presents which he has sent to your&#xD;
sister. 0, would I had never seen him!"&#xD;
She covered her face and grew pale,.&#xD;
&#xD;
ROiA, THE INDIAN CAPTIVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Poor Maria !" said he, as he opened&#xD;
the trunk; which was filled with a variety,&#xD;
of fashionable female dresses; "and how&#xD;
long is it since the pirate* has-sent you&#xD;
these presents ?" demanded he.&#xD;
"Seventeen days."&#xD;
"Then he has only robbed her, and she&#xD;
is still safe !"&#xD;
But the sight of his sister's wardrobe&#xD;
cast a glooin over his countenance -his&#xD;
face darkened, as his eye fell upon Rosa,&#xD;
who was dressed in one of her robes.&#xD;
"And, Rosa," said he, bitterly, "wears&#xD;
the spoils taken from 'my poor sister ?"&#xD;
His look, his voice, startled the poor -&#xD;
maiden-it wrung her heart.&#xD;
She threw a timid glance at him, and&#xD;
crossing her hands before her bosom, she&#xD;
said-&#xD;
"The arrow stics deep in the bosom&#xD;
of poor Rosa - my brother must not&#xD;
drive it deeper ! She must wear the&#xD;
presents of the chief of, the Salt Lake-&#xD;
the miko has bidden her to do so."&#xD;
A blush suffused his cheek-he was&#xD;
ashamed, and reproached himself for hia&#xD;
rudeness.&#xD;
"Forgive me, Rosa," said he, throwing&#xD;
his arm around her-"but my poor sister&#xD;
is very unhappy !"5&#xD;
She looked at him  with a tear trem-&#xD;
bling in her eyes, if to read his counte-&#xD;
nance.&#xD;
Canondah entered, and glancing at&#xD;
them, her countenance seemed to darken&#xD;
a little, and taking her hand, she led her&#xD;
towards the trunk.            . .&#xD;
"Look ! the presents which the chief&#xD;
has sent are his sister's-he has stolen&#xD;
them from her."&#xD;
"His sister's -!" exclaimed the Indian.&#xD;
"Yes," said the Englishman ; "see!&#xD;
here are her diamonds !" pointing to a&#xD;
casket, to which hung a small key. He&#xD;
opened it.&#xD;
The girls looked with astonishment at&#xD;
the glittering beads, as they called them&#xD;
"They are worth beaver skins.! said&#xD;
Canondah, with a childish stare.&#xD;
"Many thousands of beaver skins !"&#xD;
The girls started back in astonishment&#xD;
and wonder.&#xD;
From this moment, the fierce little&#xD;
Indian seemed to have banished every&#xD;
suspicion, and to have become all tender.&#xD;
ness and confidence,&#xD;
&#xD;
Arthur's lova to the darling of her&#xD;
heart, and the discovery of his wealth,&#xD;
had, little as it was'understood.or valued&#xD;
on her part, removed every doubt as to&#xD;
his being a scout of the white men.  °&#xD;
"The white youth who .is worth so&#xD;
many beaver skins," reasoned sbe, "will&#xD;
not come as a spy into the poor village&#xD;
of the red men."&#xD;
Though her demeanor previous to the&#xD;
discovery had been generous, she seemed&#xD;
now anxious in the-extreme to show him&#xD;
attention in a thousand wafs :  .&#xD;
,,        "My brother must eat," said she-"he&#xD;
S is hungry, and then will go with Canon-&#xD;
dah i"&#xD;
And, 'without waiting for his reply, she&#xD;
led the way to the breakfast. When they&#xD;
had finished the repast, the. Indian girl,&#xD;
beckoned to him with a knowing smile.&#xD;
"My brother," said she, when they had&#xD;
stood on the green before, the. cottage-&#xD;
"listen to your sister -she wilt he very&#xD;
kind to her brother, it he.wil love Rosa&#xD;
very much, fbr the chief of the Salt&#xD;
Lake has made her heart very sad,&#xD;
Look !' continued she, pointing to his&#xD;
soiled cravat, "me chief has taken his&#xD;
sister's clothes, and those of my brother&#xD;
are very dirty. She will give him what&#xD;
he has left in nthe-council wigwam."r&#xD;
Arthurcould not help laughing at the&#xD;
manner in which the Indian compromised&#xD;
with her conscience; and following his&#xD;
generous guide, vho tripped before him&#xD;
towards the second larger cabin.&#xD;
"Look here !" said she, with the same&#xD;
knowing nod; pointing as they entered&#xD;
the open door, to several boxesthat stood&#xD;
on the floor -a dressing case among&#xD;
them. "The pirate has stolen them too&#xD;
-my brother may take what he wants,1&#xD;
When the young red men," whispered&#xD;
she, with an arch smile, go to see their&#xD;
girls, they hang beads round their arms&#xD;
and necks-my brother will look very&#xD;
handsome !"&#xD;
"And does the pirate stay here V" said&#xD;
the young.man.&#xD;
The Indian nodded.&#xD;
"le stays sometimes ten suns with&#xD;
the mike, and then he lives in the council&#xD;
wigwama"&#xD;
She now tripped out of the room, an&#xD;
left the youth to make his toilet.&#xD;
&#xD;
C0[APTER        V I I&#xD;
Farewell!&#xD;
"The White Rose must take another&#xD;
gown, too,".said, Canondah  "and the&#xD;
beads," pointing to'the casket.&#xD;
Like many of her more refined sisters,&#xD;
she took a particular interest in fanning&#xD;
the flame that burnt but too bright ia the&#xD;
bosoms of the lovers:&#xD;
"They are his sister's," returned Rosa,&#xD;
shaking her head-'Ley do riot belong&#xD;
to Rosa 1'&#xD;
"But the chief has sent them  to the&#xD;
miko for Rosa.&#xD;
"Can the chief gve what does not be&#xD;
long to him?"&#xD;
'The Indiai became silent and 'thought-&#xD;
fil.&#xD;
"Rosa is right," said she, clapping her&#xD;
hands joyfully, when her eye  fl on&#xD;
Arthur, who had entered. "My brother&#xD;
looks handsome," said she,;casting a very&#xD;
roguish look, at Rosa,sand then stole out&#xD;
of .the room.&#xD;
The maiden blushed deeply-the gen-&#xD;
tie heaving of the bosom betrayed the&#xD;
emotion that the improved, appearance&#xD;
of Arthur had doubtless prpduced,&#xD;
The hours that Arthur passed near this&#xD;
beautiful being, were the most delightful&#xD;
of his lite.&#xD;
Arthur seemed at intervals to become&#xD;
more daring--his lips would hang longer&#xD;
on hers-his -embraces would becomeO&#xD;
more impassioned.. But there was -inher&#xD;
something ir'definable,  that always re-&#xD;
called him to his senses.&#xD;
"See," said he, "dear Arthur, "when&#xD;
he urged her again to follow him, "Rosa&#xD;
loves you more than 'her words can tell&#xD;
you-she will be sad, very sad, when&#xD;
you are gone, and go you must-you&#xD;

with a voice choked-by her deep emotion.&#xD;
"Without you?   Never !"&#xD;
Shall the mother and sister of Arthur&#xD;
weep over a fallen brother?  In four days&#xD;
the chief of the Saltlake will be here; he&#xD;
will follow the trail of my brother, and take&#xD;
him, if the path be not very wide that lies&#xD;
between him and the village.&#xD;
Arthur looked after the maiden as sh.e&#xD;
drew tow ards the other apartment, and ran&#xD;
through the room in the wildest agitation.&#xD;
"Listen, my brother," said the Indian,&#xD;
with a solemnity which. recalled the young&#xD;
man somewhat from his trance. "Conon-&#xD;
dah will do for her brother what will darken&#xD;
the face of her father and her people, for'&#xD;
she loves the White Rose very much. She&#xD;
will show her brother the path that leads&#xD;
across the swamp, and she will paddle him&#xD;
over the second river. Will my brother&#xD;
promise by the Great Spirit, whom his and&#xD;
yher people call upon, 'that he will not tell&#xD;

what his eyes have beheld ?  Will he pro-&#xD;

" I will," said the youth, with a firm&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
"Then tako these clothes,". said she,&#xD;
handing him a suit of Indian apparel.&#xD;
"Those," said she, pointing to his dress,&#xD;

will, perhaps, find it no more. Here is red&#xD;
paint," added she; "or men will follow&#xD;
you, and it may throw them on a false scent.&#xD;
Be quick."&#xD;
The youth slipped mechanically into the&#xD;
waistcoat of tanned deer-skin, iud even'suf-&#xD;
fered the maiden to assist him. She tied&#xD;
the moccasins on his feet, and slung, the&#xD;
girdle of wampum over him with natural&#xD;
unconcern, as if she was assisting one of her&#xD;
own sex. "Here is a blanket," said she,&#xD;
throwing it round fun. "Here a pouch&#xD;
with powder and shot; here another, with&#xD;
wine, cakes, and venison. That gun will&#xD;
kill water-fowl and deer, and with this my&#xD;
&#xD;
brother will make fire to roast what he has&#xD;
killed." She hnng every article upon him&#xD;
with a cafe that showed how fully she was&#xD;
conscious of his-helplessness.&#xD;
When alLthe preparations were finished,&#xD;
shy slipped again through the curtains, and&#xD;
Rosa came out once more with a faltering&#xD;
step.&#xD;
Arthur cast his arms sound the lovely&#xD;
maiden. For a long while they were clasp-&#xD;
ed together in silent, speechlss ariguish.&#xD;
"Rosa," sa'd he at last, '"I shallleave you,&#xD;
if youdesire it. I owe you mine,  my sis-&#xD;
ter's, perhaps my mother's life, and the&#xD;
happiest hours I ever enjoyed. I1eave you;&#xD;

She shook heir head.&#xD;
"Do not doubt it my dear Rosa ; let it&#xD;
be the hope that lightens your path. Ar-&#xD;
thur will come and lead you to a place where&#xD;
the sun shines on-happier beings."&#xD;
A minute longer they hung on each oth-&#xD;
er's lips, when the torch-light was extin-&#xD;
guished. It was the signal for, their sepa-&#xD;
ration. Arthur took the lovely helpless&#xD;
being that lay speechless in his arms, bore&#xD;
her to her couch, pressed a' last kiss on her&#xD;
lips, and bade her farewell&#xD;
The Indian todk his hanad, and led him&#xD;
from the door. They glided through 'the&#xD;
avenue, stealing far from the cabins, along&#xD;
'the hedges and shrubs towards the forest,&#xD;
with a step so light, as scarcely to touch th&#xD;
ground. The faint star-light was obscured&#xD;
by the night-mists, that hung a broad veil&#xD;
over the village. They now had reached&#xD;
the sombre forest, illumined only by millions&#xD;
of fire-fies fluttering about in every direction.&#xD;
A noise not unlike the murmur of an&#xD;
approaching multitude struck the English-&#xD;
man's ear., He hesitated. "We are dis-&#xD;
covered," whispered he.&#xD;
"No," said the Indian, "it is the cry of&#xD;
the. tree-frog and crickets.7&#xD;
The noise increased fearfully  as they&#xD;
approached the swamp, where the roaring&#xD;
of the bullfrog, with the piercing, hollow&#xD;
bellowing'of an alligator, that was not cuite&#xD;
torpid, resounded.&#xD;

OSA, TEl INDIAN CAPTIVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
had walked nearly an hour. "we are near&#xD;
the swamp."   Her step now became very&#xD;
careful; she put her foot forward to try the&#xD;
ground, retreated again, and tried on another&#xD;
direction. She then cowered down; and&#xD;
crawling with her hands on the ground, she&#xD;
lifted pieces of turf and mud. "We are on&#xD;
the logs that our men have laid across the&#xD;
swamps. Hold the'skirt of my gown."&#xD;
He seized the dress, and they advanced&#xD;
along the narrow passage.&#xD;
"Take care," whispered she; "a wrong&#xD;
step would bury you for ever in the mud."&#xD;
They passed the dangerous passage in&#xD;
safety.&#xD;
"Throw your blanket over your head,"&#xD;
said the Indian, when they had arrived at&#xD;
the end of the logs. "The woods on this&#xD;
side of the swamp are full of briers. Keep&#xD;
close on my track,' the serpents are very&#xD;
many, and their sting is deadly. Bow down&#xD;
you: head, or the thorns will tear your&#xD;
blanket from you."&#xD;
"What is that ?" cried the youth, from&#xD;
whom, as he glided after the Indian, his&#xD;
blanket was torn vith irresistible force.&#xD;
His guile stepped back. "It is the big-&#xD;
brier-my brother hust bow his head,"&#xD;
disentangling his blanket at the same time&#xD;
from a-4mge branch studded with thorns of&#xD;
a hand's length. They arr ived at last on&#xD;
the banks of the Sabine. Without losing a&#xD;
moment the Indian sprang to a hollow oak.&#xD;
"My brother must assist Canondah to shove&#xD;
the canoeinto the water."&#xD;
They'carried the light vessel with ease&#xD;
to the water's edge. A push brought it into&#xD;
the river; she took the paddles and bade&#xD;
Arthur sit still.&#xD;
The sound of the paddles raised thousands&#xD;
of pelicans, ducks, and wild geese, who,&#xD;
fluttered about in every direction, striking&#xD;
our travelers' heads in rather an uncere-&#xD;
monious manner. The canoe shot across&#xD;
the river like one Qf its finny inhabitants.&#xD;
In a few minutes they had reached the&#xD;
eastern bank.&#xD;
They landed, and Canondah took the&#xD;
hand of Arthur.'&#xD;
" My brother must now open his ears ; he&#xD;
&#xD;
must not let a word of his sister's talk fall to&#xD;
the ground. Look, the prairies, on this&#xD;
side of the water are empty, and the trees&#xD;
are very few. My brotheri must go up the&#xD;
bank of this water, till the sun has sunk&#xD;
behind the trees that grow on the other side,&#xD;
then he must turn towards where the sun&#xD;
rises and the wind blows cold. Does my&#xD;
brother know from whence the cold wind&#xD;
blovs ?  The trees will show it to him.&#xD;
The swamps are not so many there. When&#xD;
my brother copies to a swamp, he will know&#xD;
how to cheat those who follow his trail."&#xD;
She paused, as if she expected a question,&#xD;
but the youth seemed too absorbed in other&#xD;
thoughts.&#xD;
"My brother's course," said she, "must&#xD;
be crooked."&#xD;
Again she paused, and then said, with a&#xD;
voice whose soft melodious tone was touch-&#xD;
ing in the highest degree-&#xD;
"My brother is now free, and his path&#xD;
lies open before him. When he comes into&#xD;
the village of his own people, he may tell&#xD;
the girls that the daughters of the red men&#xD;
are not less generous than those of the&#xD;
white. Let my brother not forget what the&#xD;
White Rose and t red girl have done to&#xD;
clear his path. It will perhaps--bury the&#xD;
tomahawk of their father in their brains,"&#xD;
whispered she, with a scarcely audible&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
" Canondah !" exclaimed the youth, hor-&#xD;
ror-struck, "'how is this?  What do you&#xD;
meaxu by it?  Will my flight bring you in&#xD;
danger ? Never !  [ will return; I will&#xD;
wait for your father, and face the pirate."&#xD;
The girl had relinquished his hand, and&#xD;
glided doen the bank. He ran after her; but&#xD;
she was already in the canoe, that shot now&#xD;
swiftly and lightly through the water. A&#xD;
farewell sounded from the boat as it darted&#xD;
away under the veiling mist, and soon en -&#xD;
tirely disappeared. Arthur called her by&#xD;
her name ; but she gave no answer, He&#xD;
conjured her to take him into the canoe;&#xD;
but the light stroke of the paddles was&#xD;
heard no more-nothing but the shrill notes&#xD;
of the alarmed water4owls resounded on the&#xD;
air.&#xD;

ROSA, TJE INDIAN CAPTIVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
RQ1,TUE .IDI1ANAPTIVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
tered and reeled along the street. The words&#xD;
outgoing, outfight, outrun, were distinctly&#xD;
beard.  fIalf a doken Goliahs detached&#xD;
'themselves from the knot, "just to take a&#xD;
peep at what them there noisy fools whoop-&#xD;
ed at sp devilishly."&#xD;
From the dark express swamps which&#xD;
begin about half a mile from the margin of&#xD;
the Atchafalaga, a figure had emerged,-&#xD;
which, from its dress, belonged to the In-&#xD;
dian race. As the individual advanced with&#xD;
a wary step wards the town, he had at-&#xD;
tracted the attention of the two topers, who,&#xD;
though their hands were giddy with the be-&#xD;
witching flavor of their' favorite Mononga-&#xD;
Bela whisky, had no sooner espied the lurk-&#xD;
.  ing Indian, as they presumed him to-be,&#xD;
than they gave chase. Swift of foot, the sons&#xD;
of the west had soon outstripped the Indian,&#xD;
who seemed in fact too much 'spent long to&#xD;
escape his nimble pursuers.&#xD;
Before they had repeated their "Stop l"&#xD;
the 'Indian was within the grasp of a power-&#xD;
ful fellow, when a voice, not unlike that of a&#xD;
roaring bull, bawled'out to him "either to&#xD;
stop. or he would set his jaw bones aright&#xD;
in a style."&#xD;
The poor Indian seemed to comprehend&#xD;
the language, or the meaning of his pursuers,&#xD;
and halted; not, however, without putting&#xD;
himself into an attitude, that indicated his&#xD;
firm determination to resist to the utmost.&#xD;
His gunlock ticked, and unsheathing his&#xD;
knife, he stepped back, facing his antagonist.&#xD;
The foremost of the two pursuers had left&#xD;
his pint glass behind the rail fence, that&#xD;
formed the lane, to have a cordial after his&#xD;
return, and he was unarmed, if we except.&#xD;
the dirk that stuck in his girdle: He now&#xD;
stood before the Indian, whom he exam-&#xD;
ined with the shrewd glance with- which a&#xD;
new and rather suspicious object is sure to&#xD;
he scrutinized, by such as claim the right of&#xD;
looking into every one's business.&#xD;
The appearance of an Indian in this quar-&#xD;
ter was in itself nothing extraordinary, as&#xD;
scarcely a hundred  miles' further to the&#xD;
northwest their villages were established,&#xD;
and their excursions were known frequently&#xD;
to extend many hundred miles. Their di-&#xD;
&#xD;
minished number, and above all,. their in-&#xD;
creasing want, edged by the taste they had&#xD;
acquired for the irresistible' firewater, had&#xD;
made them in fact the hunting slaves of the&#xD;
settlers, who bought for the tenth part of its&#xD;
real value, whatever game the insatiable&#xD;
thirst of these wretched victims led them to&#xD;
procure. There was certainly no other in-&#xD;
tention en the part of the pursuers than to&#xD;
have a little fun, and to drink half a pint&#xD;
of "genuine Monongahela" with the red&#xD;
skin. At last the man who stood within&#xD;
the grasp of the Indian, announced his n- -&#xD;
tention, by swearing he should drink half a&#xD;
int with him, or he would "put him into&#xD;
his breeches' pocket."&#xD;
By this time the second pursuer, on:whom,&#xD;
repeated draughts lay heavier, had :ap-&#xD;
proached the Indian, when they took him&#xD;
between them with that regardless familiar-&#xD;
ity and assurance-which either.knows of no&#xD;
resistance, or cares not for it, andconsiders&#xD;
it a right tp meddle, with undisputed au-&#xD;
thority,  everything in their own country ;&#xD;
both advanced:from:the dark shade of the&#xD;
cypress t ad a the lane, that ran from the&#xD;
morass owards the river.&#xD;
"Come, red boy," shouted the second&#xD;
companion, who, occasionally missing the&#xD;
narrow trodden path, staggered knee deep&#xD;
into the mire, while the 'other,' to use his&#xD;
own expression, "could still stand in his&#xD;
own shoes." "If ye shan't fight thexa&#xD;
British, and drink, ay, and drink too;"&#xD;
By this tithe the rest of the party had&#xD;
come up, with various degrees of 'swiftness.&#xD;
There was a sort of jeering curiosity observ-&#xD;
able in the crowd. Without asking leave,&#xD;
as may be supposed, they approached the&#xD;
apparent Indian, examined the. fowling&#xD;
piece, took a peep at his' scalping knife,&#xD;
and at his shattered sword, and one even&#xD;
went so far as to lift the big cap, to get a&#xD;
deeper insight into the character of theif new,&#xD;
and as it seemed involuntary visitor. ' There&#xD;
was something strange in his appearance, it'&#xD;
must be confessed. A light cap covered&#xD;
his head to the ears, and carefully concealed&#xD;
the flaxen curls, but the soft down: of his&#xD;
youthful beard rendered the conecalnent&#xD;
&#xD;
:nsles,. his openfur waistcoat showed th&#xD;
{dress of thy naies, bta'pair of antalodi&#xD;
contrasted strangely vith the girdle of'vam&#xD;
*pum   His leggings, with ne nioecasin&#xD;
were of Indiau make.; hi hands and face&#xD;
were painted, but Gs countenauce  as&#xD;
finely fofjned, its features so regular, so no'&#xD;
ble, that' the crowdgazed with that sorhap&#xD;
perplexity which anany of them had perhaps&#xD;
experienced, whenthey approached a thicket&#xD;
expecting to neet a growling bear and found&#xD;
in its place a furious panther.&#xD;
" Stand off,'-said4the trangeat last, with&#xD;
a voice iuwhich scorn and iidigdation weore&#xD;
closely blended, aslthe audacity of one of&#xD;
the knot, g1ho,-with hands whose warty'ex-&#xD;
ereseonces seemed, to belong rather to the&#xD;
pay's of an alligator, than to a hunian being,&#xD;

to the4path of the Coshattees, lid at last&#xD;
found his way throughthe almost inextricable&#xD;
ranges of forests, and swamps, and lakes,&#xD;
and rivers, with which these 'regions are so&#xD;
' overnabundantly blessed-though not with-&#xD;
out the losa of one of his moccasins.'&#xD;

&#xD;
And, so saying, he whistled to a negr&#xD;
and called for his grey. Taking the saddi&#xD;
from his hands, he adjusted it himself, an&#xD;
then said :---&#xD;
"Well, lad, just mount, and' show on&#xD;
Senator what fellows both of you are."&#xD;
"Many thank for your kind assistance,'&#xD;
said the Englishman, smiling.  ,&#xD;
S Mr. Graham is perhaps tired ?"said th&#xD;
senator, who felt that the display of horse&#xD;
inanship, under present circumstances, was&#xD;
something like abuse.    -    -    '&#xD;
The Englishman, however, mounted the&#xD;
horse to satisfy honest Squire Copeland ;&#xD;
and, alter some light and easy turns, rode&#xD;
in full gallop towards the double-barred&#xD;
fence, and cleared it in the finest style.-.&#xD;
"Well," said the delighted and 'as-&#xD;
tonished creole, "I take him. Fix your own&#xD;
price."&#xD;
"Well, senator, that there lad," casting a&#xD;
knowing glance at the'Englishman, "un-&#xD;
derstands more about horses than you and I&#xD;
taken together, I warrant ye."&#xD;
"I beg your pardon, said the Englishman,&#xD;
who perceived the drift, the rough, but&#xD;
knowing old man, was going to take. "I&#xD;
amp only a trifler ; besides, my notions are&#xD;
genuine English, and would scarcely apply&#xD;
to this country."&#xD;
"Well, and what would ineh a slick nag&#xD;
as that there fetch in England ?"&#xD;
The senator threw an encouraging glance&#xD;
at Arthur.{&#xD;
"A hundred pounds sterling." -&#xD;
"That is, four hundred and fifty dollars,&#xD;
ar thereabouts.  Well,;that is too much ;&#xD;
but half will do."&#xD;
"A bargain !" exclaimed the enraptured&#xD;
squire-" five dollars more than I expected,&#xD;
they'll just do for a morning treat to my&#xD;
company. But I want money to appear&#xD;
somewhat decently down the river, at the&#xD;
heid of my riflemen. And 'now, lad," added.&#xD;
he, in the same tone-":walk, just up&#xD;
through that there gate; I know you won't&#xD;
run away, end if you do--you won'tjrun&#xD;
"But, squire; you must not speak in this&#xD;
mnner to the gentleman,"said the senator,&#xD;
&#xD;
o, when the young. man had disappeared be-&#xD;
e hind the fig trees. "He is of one of the best&#xD;
d families, and connected with one of the&#xD;
commanders of the British forces." '&#xD;
r    "A fig for their good and best families,"&#xD;
returned the old inan, whose head.began to&#xD;
" turt a little from:his copious libations at&#xD;
dinner. ; "Them best families are the very&#xD;
e nobility'and the aristocracy. Ain't we free?&#xD;
Ain't our principles free,? Ain't we sprung&#xD;
from as genewine a stock of old continenta-&#xD;
lers as the best o  em?  What do we care&#xD;
about them Eng sh ?"&#xD;
"But you w   ld not insult a guest of 1y&#xD;
house, and a stressed young man."&#xD;
"Certainly not," said the squire, whose&#xD;
heat was only momentary. # "And I am&#xD;
just come to talk about that there lad."&#xD;
" Well, to tell you my opinion plainly,&#xD;
you have done a foolish thing that may&#xD;
cost the noble youth his life.",&#xD;
"Ay, ay, I was afraid of that."&#xD;
"Well, and why did you dismiss the ac-&#xD;
tion?  A man of your round nmus might&#xD;
have seen that the British would not send&#xD;
youths as emissaries, with scarcely a beard&#xD;
on their chin."&#xD;
"Ay, ay, true-I mought have done so,&#xD;
but for that babe of mischief Dick Gloom.&#xD;
He stuck and hung about me like a wasp.&#xD;
At any rate, senator, you must not let F'&#xD;
go down ; he would make u trouble-you&#xD;
understand me ."&#xD;
"I  do-there you have brought a fellow&#xD;
into my house who rages, like the yellow&#xD;
fever, over my peaceful dominion ' But the&#xD;
day before yesterday ho beat one of nlyne-&#xD;
groes, that I almost despair'of his:.being&#xD;
again good for anything-you may count&#xD;
each of the-thirty-nins lashes on his back."&#xD;
"But them negroes are such beastly cre-&#xD;
turs," said the squire, wh&amp;amp; again=thought it&#xD;
his duty to take the part of-his countryman&#xD;
against a negro. "And the lad is honest."&#xD;
"Yes," said the senator, drily, "for-the&#xD;
last Tennessee which he ordered, I had to&#xD;
pay just twice as much as for that which I&#xD;
brought from the city."&#xD;
~"Now look, the lad has bought a parcel&#xD;
&#xD;
)&#xD;
&#xD;
of land in our county, and you know he&#xD;
wants to pay for it."&#xD;
"Yes, with my money-the sooner he&#xD;
better. I will gladly contribute my share&#xD;
to get rid o'f him."&#xD;
And I hope you'll part friends, though&#xD;
few like him; yet he has many ma'dcaps on&#xD;
his side, and I don't trust him at all."'&#xD;
"And still you will give him your daugh-&#xD;
ter? You Georgians are strange people.&#xD;
Youhang together like a nest of hornets;&#xD;
touch one and all the rest are on your heels.&#xD;
And the poor Frenchers, as you call them,&#xD;
have to pay f'or it. But come," added he,&#xD;
good-humoredly, "I presume you retired,&#xD;
and have slept but little last night-we will&#xD;
y a       take supper, and then both of you may take&#xD;
your rest."&#xD;
The party assembled again in the dining-&#xD;
room for sapper.' The family drank Bur-&#xD;
gundy diluted with water ; the squire and&#xD;
Dick Gloom took tea ; but little was spoken:&#xD;
and the company soon broke up. Arthur&#xD;
retired to his room. When the servant left&#xD;
him, he paced for an 'hour up and down his&#xD;
apartment, and was just going to lie down,&#xD;
when a heavy, slow step, that .shook 'the&#xD;
very staircase that led to his apartment,&#xD;
made him pause. The door opened, and a&#xD;
tall, large man entered without further cer-&#xD;
emony. It was the overseer, Mr. Richard&#xD;
Gloom.&#xD;
"Sir," said the young man, and the fire&#xD;
of indignation flashed from  his eye, "I&#xD;
presume there will be sufficient time to-&#xD;
morrow to choose your visiting hours."  '&#xD;
"Ay, boy," returned the visitor, with a&#xD;
fw taunting laugh, "still afloat? I thought&#xD;
thee hushed!"-&#xD;
"What is your demand ?" asked the&#xD;
youth, half choked with rage.&#xD;
.: "I reckon.a prisoner and a spy hasn't nq&#xD;
right to ask after honest men's business,"&#xD;
replied he, with. a dry. malignity, turning&#xD;
his back on him at the same time, and&#xD;
throwing his linsey coat on the chair.,&#xD;
"What does that mean, sir? Aie you&#xD;
sent by Mr. Gentillor? ' exclaimed he, with&#xD;
a voice of rage. The thought struck him&#xD;
perhaps unnecessary precaution on the&#xD;
&#xD;
aI&#xD;
"I&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;

intrusion.Y                        ?&#xD;
"Vr. Gentillon'!" said the fello~wwitlr a&#xD;
sneer, hanging at the same time hiswaist-&#xD;
coat quietly on the 'chair.  "He is a&#xD;
Frencher, and cuss" ie, if I''trist these&#xD;
Frenchers; they are  'rascally slyaset,{and&#xD;
rust be attended to. No, it are myself&#xD;
who wishes so much to see'thee hanged.&#xD;
Worm thee just a bit further, as thou hast&#xD;
formed thyself through the Indians. It&#xD;
are sheer foresight."&#xD;
"You shall not, sleep here !" thundered&#xD;
the youth.'&#xD;
" Thinkest thou so, boy 7" retorted his&#xD;
enemy, with the same wild taunting laugh.&#xD;
"Dick Gloom 'never turns his back to a&#xD;
fight ; but take care of thy jaW-bones, ay,&#xD;
and *f thy eyes, too."&#xD;
So saying, he threw his 'huge form 'down&#xD;
with a forcethat hook these whole manSion.&#xD;
Arthur sprang up and ran through theroofm&#xD;
half distracted with rage. The cold malig-&#xD;
nity of the 'fellow had so exasperated him&#xD;
that he trembled ; he was no longer master&#xD;
of himself. He looked round the room for&#xD;
some weapon. But the felw lay  uietly&#xD;
grinning ou the bed, without uttering a sin-&#xD;
gle word. Gradually the young man re-&#xD;
turned 'to his senses. Throwing himself into&#xD;
a chair, he laid .his head on the table, try-&#xD;
ing to take his rest in 'this uncomfortablM&#xD;
posture. le fellow lay for about a 4tlater&#xD;
of an hour motionless.&#xD;
"Now, boy, choosest thou the cool chair,&#xD;
instead of the soft warm bed ?-maybe tho&#xD;
wouldst lik  a better beddellow -!-mayhap&#xD;
thou'lt soon sleep alone, as the gallows has&#xD;

the fellow, rising at theile'tinie, 'and' ak-&#xD;

glance from her father, "I am really not&#xD;
over-anxious to behold any more specimens&#xD;
of these people; but we are so lonesome&#xD;
here--ah! so lonesome," added she, nearly&#xD;
yawning, "that I would give something to&#xD;
know how they look. A female, you say,&#xD;
papa, was among them?   Probably, one of&#xD;
them-how do you call them ?"&#xD;
"Squaws," replied the senator.&#xD;
" Squ-squaws !" repeated she, opening&#xD;
her pretty lips with a grimace, as-if she was&#xD;
afraid the uncouth word would hurt them,&#xD;
and showing a row of ivory teeth in so droll&#xD;
a manner, that the company could not help&#xD;
laughing aloud, and even Arthur,who seemed&#xD;
to be buried in thought, woke from his&#xD;
reverie.&#xD;
Melisante thing !" said the father,&#xD;
threat uing her with his finger.&#xD;
"Now, papa," said the sprightly girl, in&#xD;
a half-laughing. half-whining tone, " how&#xD;
unjust you are ! Here we are sitting and&#xD;
sighing, not unlike the two princes of the&#xD;
Arabian Tales, surrotuded by black vis-&#xD;
ages, and watched by the agreeable Mr.&#xD;
Dick Gloom-nd Charles is away, and you&#xD;
are going."&#xD;
"And Mr. Hugh M'Leaven," added the&#xD;
father. in the same mocking tone.&#xD;
" P pa !" said the blushing girl, putting&#xD;
her pL'y finger to her mouth. ' But do&#xD;
you rally intend leaving us here aloue, in&#xD;
the cu'. pany of Mr. Dick Gloom,.youi wor-1&#xD;
thy ou :seer"r&#xD;
C.   inly, my fair Eleanor," replied the&#xD;
father. imitating her tone, " unless you&#xD;
choose :o work on' the lines."&#xD;
" Ta, I will !" exclaimed she ; "the&#xD;
north uaa ladies shall not say that they aret&#xD;
more   :triotic and republican than we are&#xD;
--I u.1 at least carry provisions for the&#xD;
worki eu."&#xD;
" A Irast for one of their commanders,"&#xD;
&amp;amp;aid ti~e father.&#xD;
&#xD;
' But, papa, how you delight to torment&#xD;
us ! Pray, shall we really have no balls&#xD;
this year ?"&#xD;
"I am afraid but too many !"&#xD;
"And why leave us at home?"      She&#xD;
now caught the meaning of her father.&#xD;
"Oh! those terrible--" but, recollecting&#xD;
herself, she changed them into "the terrible&#xD;
war!"&#xD;
" Eleanor!" exclaimed both father and&#xD;
mother, with a mild reproach.&#xD;
"But why so deep in thought, Mr. Gra-&#xD;
haq ?" demanded the former-&#xD;
"I was just thinking how many a one-&#xD;
some mother and sister will count every&#xD;
minute with an aching. heart, that may&#xD;
bring them dreadful tidings. Miss Eleanor&#xD;
is quite right in calling the war and its au-&#xD;
thors terrible."'&#xD;
The gay volubility of Eleanor had now&#xD;
received a sort of indirect check. She gazed&#xD;
for a moment; with a tender and full glance,&#xD;
at the youth, and then said, " Mr. Graham,.&#xD;
we too ljave a brother down the river-&#xD;
But reall , papa," resumed she, turning&#xD;
again to h r father, though with quite an-&#xD;
other air, " if Charles, now -''&#xD;
"Or M'Leaven," added the senator.' The&#xD;
girl again blushed deeply.&#xD;
"If you do not cease tormenting me,&#xD;
papa, I shall not open my mouth again for&#xD;
the whole eveiing."&#xD;
"For which silence, perhaps, we shall feel&#xD;
very much obliged," returned the father.&#xD;
I am free to protest," subjoined Arthur,&#xD;
"it would be a loss indeed."&#xD;
" WEll, now, if Charles should receive&#xD;
any iLjury," resumed Eleanor, her eye&#xD;
hanging with an interesting and droll e:&#xD;
rs 'ion on her father, " then ho would be&#xD;
loft to the mi roy of an old snuffy house-&#xD;
keeper, and you know', papa, he would not&#xD;
even take a cup of.coffee from her hands."&#xD;
"But how can we help that, dear Elea.-&#xD;
n'or ?" said the father.&#xD;
" Oh ! take us with you, papa. Come,&#xD;
Gabriella ."&#xD;
Both girls now tripped before their father,&#xD;
and raising their delicate hands, they begged&#xD;
- Oh!I take us with you!'&#xD;
&#xD;
,OSA, THE INDIAN CAPTIVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
The delighted father looked for a while&#xD;
at the blooming girls. "It cannot be,"&#xD;
said he. "In case now the enemy should&#xD;
take the city ?"&#xD;
"Then they would certainly respect the&#xD;
fair se' as they have dose everywhere else-&#xD;
I pledge my honor for that," said the Eng-&#xD;
lishman, who felt himself called upon to&#xD;
protect the gallantry of his .countrymen.&#xD;
fA grateful glance from the charming pe-&#xD;
titioners was his reward.&#xD;
"And what do you say, madam ?" de-&#xD;
manded the planter, now turning towards&#xD;
Mrs. Gentillon, who at all the while a si-&#xD;
lent and passive auditor.&#xD;
"Whatever you decide upon, dear Gen-&#xD;
tillon, will be agreeable to me."&#xD;
"Well !" said the yielding father-"-I&#xD;
am myself of opinion, it will be the best..&#xD;
We will go down together, that is, if I can&#xD;
bring Mr. lick to stay here."&#xD;
But the latter words were not heard by&#xD;
the delighted girls. Both fell upon the&#xD;
neck of their father ; kissed himand mamma&#xD;
a dozen times; and Eleanor ran out of the&#xD;
room to make preparations for the journey.j&#xD;
Gabriella lingered in the room-from time&#xD;
to time her glance stole from behind the&#xD;
silken lashes of her. beautiful languishing&#xD;
eye, upon the youth&#xD;
" I am afraid," said he, "I have spoken&#xD;
against the interest of my country. The&#xD;
Americans will be invincible, if they know&#xD;
_what treasures they are going to defend, and&#xD;
what soothing hands they have to expect."&#xD;
"Really, my country will' want such a&#xD;
stimulus," said the representative, " and&#xD;
with all that, I an afraid our resistance may'&#xD;
prove ineffectual. The odds are too great,"&#xD;
said the senator, stepping at the same time&#xD;
between his guest and his daughter. The1&#xD;
latter left the room. Arthur paused, and&#xD;
seemed lost in rev'rie. Yes,". repeated the&#xD;
senator ; the odds are too great-fourteen&#xD;
thousand against three."&#xD;
"Only three thousand soldiers !" said&#xD;
the astonished youth.&#xD;
"Oh ! no," subjoined the planter, who&#xD;
began to be aware that he had spoken,&#xD;
rather too freely respecting the state of de'-&#xD;
&#xD;
fence. "There will be some thousands&#xD;
more, but still I am afraid we shall have to&#xD;
relyon the generosity of our enemies."&#xD;
"Mr. Gentillon and his countrymen will&#xD;
certainly not be disappointed; and my coun-&#xD;
trymen ought to feel proud to become the&#xD;
protectors of so generous a people."&#xD;
"Oh. as for that, I have every hope.&#xD;
Our commanding general is a man of energy&#xD;
and military e perience."&#xD;
"Has'he fought in any battles ?"&#xD;
"Chiefly against the Indians-he in the&#xD;
terror of the'savages."&#xD;
"'Indians-?" repeated the Englishman, in&#xD;
a tone that, notwithstanding his efforts,&#xD;
could not entirely suppress a slight sneer.&#xD;
."Yes,"' said the senator, a little dryly-&#xD;
" the-Indian wars are the school of our of-&#xD;
ficers and soldiers, as the East:Indian wars&#xD;
are the preparatory exercises for your coin-&#xD;
manders, and even of your hero of Vittoria."&#xD;
Their conversation was interrupted by the&#xD;
heavy steps of the overseer, which were&#xD;
heard in- the corridor.  Both gentlemen&#xD;
went into'the saloon ; where they found Mr.&#xD;
Dick Gloom, 'just filling a tumbler with&#xD;
rum, and diluting it with a few drops of&#xD;
water-he swallowed the draught compos-&#xD;
edly, without paying any attention to the&#xD;
gentlemen.&#xD;
"I thought you would not return to din.&#xD;
ncr," said the creole, "arid had given orders&#xD;
to send it up to you."&#xD;
'  We took twenty Bands more, and so&#xD;
have got done,"' returned he, in a sullen&#xD;
tone, without looking ups /&#xD;
Arthur had stepped up to the window.&#xD;
"Have you seen the Indians ?" demanded&#xD;
the planter.&#xD;
"Have I? ay, so I have, and so plainly&#xD;
that I could. fiad theta out among thous-&#xD;
ands."&#xD;
Arthur became' more attentive.&#xD;
"Can't sry, not I, what sort of red skins&#xD;
them are! Have never seen the likes of&#xD;
them-gold and silver plenty, and a girl,"&#xD;
added he, smnacking his lips, "Oh geminiQ&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
"During our morning walk, anofficial ac-&#xD;
count arrived, which will tend to heighten&#xD;
the exasperation against your countrymen ;&#xD;
. mean the destruction of our boats.&#xD;
The countenance of the Englishman&#xD;
brightened ; 'the senator had touched a&#xD;
point which struck his English nerves too&#xD;
powerfully.&#xD;
The desire of hearing something more of&#xD;
the affair was clearly legible inthis eounte~&#xD;
nafee.&#xD;
"It could not be otherwise. expected,"&#xD;
conthmued the senator; "your superiority in&#xD;
numbers was too great."&#xD;
"Mr. Gentillon will allow me to think,&#xD;
that even had it been less, the result would&#xD;
have been the same."&#xD;
"And Mr. Graham will allow me," re-&#xD;
&#xD;
turned the senator, "to doubs his patriotic'&#xD;
assertion-and with good ground. The ac-&#xD;
tions on Lakes Erie and Champlain, and&#xD;
the repeated captures of your frigates, are&#xD;
 sufficient proofs that my fellow citizens&#xD;
know how to fight, and to conquer, where&#xD;
the odds are not too great."&#xD;
"But Mr. Genfillon willgnot adduce those&#xD;
trifles as proofs of your naval superiority.&#xD;
s6'We must leave naval superiority for the&#xD;
present to those who enjoy it; at least, it&#xD;
would be ridiculous to enter the lists with&#xD;
our f evfrigates and sloops, against the&#xD;
greatest maritiine power of the present times ;&#xD;
but even from these defeats, which you call&#xD;
trifles, but which I consider in quite'another-&#xD;
light, and really as preludes to future great&#xD;
battles, you may see what the Americans&#xD;
can do, and'what they will do, when they&#xD;
have a maritime power-and this they must&#xD;
have in less than twenty years."~&#xD;
"6My countrymen will feel very much&#xD;
obliged to Mr. Gentillon," returned the Eng-&#xD;
lishman,- "if he allows them  fifty years.&#xD;
Butin this time the United States may per-&#xD;
haps have ceased to exist. The elements of&#xD;
which they are composed are of too discord-&#xD;
ant a nature to promise a long and a firm&#xD;
continuance."&#xD;
&#xD;
pie in the world. With a sound understand-.&#xD;
'ng, you give yourself the worst airs. A&#xD;
Frenchman pillages the country, and plun-&#xD;
ders the inhabitants ; but he does it with&#xD;
something like grape, and though his rapa-&#xD;
ciousness'is execrated, it is soon forgotten,&#xD;
from his politeness. You Englishmen are&#xD;
too proud to take where. you can give; and&#xD;
if you spend your money in the conquered&#xD;
province, yet you do it with .a sneer ; and&#xD;
while you, in fact,, benefit the country, you&#xD;
destroy-the favorable impression by the air&#xD;
of contempt which accompanies your gen-&#xD;
erosity. You are the fathers and the found-&#xD;
ers of this country, and yet speak of an&#xD;
enemy, and the idea of aft Englishman is&#xD;
connected with it.  Mr. Telemaque will&#xD;
think his mentor a little inclined to be tire-i&#xD;
some, bnt Mr. Graham may be assured that&#xD;
it is only sincere regard that prompts its&#xD;
conversation. I hoped to chase away-the&#xD;
melancholy cloud from the brow of my young&#xD;
friend, that might otherwise have settled&#xD;
there, and rendered his stay at my house&#xD;
still more disagreeable. If I have'trespass-&#xD;
ed, I beg Mr. Graham's pardon."&#xD;
The Englishman pressed the hand of the&#xD;
Creole warmly. "I feel," said he, "what&#xD;
I owe to Mr. Gentillon, and I can pnly give&#xD;
the assurance that I shall not think, even&#xD;
the hard trials which I am going to encoun-9&#xD;
ter, too dearly bought by the interesting&#xD;
light which he has thrown on many sub-&#xD;
jects entirely strange to me."&#xD;
He was going to say more, but the over-&#xD;
-seer strode in, announcing that the steam-&#xD;
boat which was to take them: to the city&#xD;
would be down in a few hours.&#xD;
The man scratched his head once or&#xD;
twice, and was again slowly retreating to-&#xD;
wards the door, when the senator suddenly&#xD;
demanded, "How many bales may be in&#xD;
the cotton gin 7"&#xD;
"About fifty."&#xD;
"And on the boards ?"&#xD;
"Fifty more ; and in the field perhaps a&#xD;
hundred ; about a hundred more are expect-&#xD;

&#xD;
"A hundred," was the short reply..&#xD;
"The rest," said the planter, "will be&#xD;
sent to you-it must be pressed before my&#xD;
return."&#xD;
"Well, senator," said the overseer, "I&#xD;
haven't no notion of staying here, when my&#xD;
people are going down to fight the British-&#xD;
ers; I mean to go down myself."&#xD;
"As you please," returned the senator.&#xD;
"Make out your accounts, and deliver them,&#xD;
and you are ffee to go-I dispense even with&#xD;
the usual warning, though it was stipulated.&#xD;
If you choose to go down with the steam-&#xD;
boat, you can do so ; and the accounts will&#xD;
be settled by my lawyer."&#xD;
The determined, cool tone of the planter&#xD;
seemed to make a deep impression on Mr.&#xD;
Dick Gloom. He stood for a moment,&#xD;
struggling between his desire of going down&#xD;
and fighting the Britishers, and seeing per-&#xD;
haps his malignant hatred gratified against&#xD;
one of them ; and the loss which he, must&#xD;
sustain, if dismissed from his service. The&#xD;
mention, however, of the lawyer was deci-&#xD;
sive. Scratching his head once more, lie&#xD;
marched off, muttering, "I'll stay."&#xD;
"One thing we have gained. We are&#xD;
rid of that fellow, who might have made our&#xD;
passage very disagreeable, and caused us&#xD;
even some trouble in the 9ity. We must&#xD;
now prepare for the joyrney. Your par-&#xD;
don," said he, bowing slightly, and leaving&#xD;
the saloon.&#xD;
Arthur went up into his room. He had,&#xD;
notwithstanding the extreme politeness of&#xD;
the planter, and his anxiety to conceal em-&#xD;
erything, observed that his efforts had be-&#xD;
come rather studied. He had remarked the&#xD;
solicitude with whigh.he had cut short his&#xD;
conversation with Gabriella. There was a&#xD;
polite but obvious repulse in the manner of&#xD;
the senator. His situation began to grow&#xD;
painful to him; his heart almost sickened&#xD;
with suspense, fear and dreadful anticipa-&#xD;
tion. He opened the window. The ser-&#xD;
vants were gaily bustling up and down stairs&#xD;
-4heir merriness fell heavily on him. He&#xD;
shut the window. The sun was setting,&#xD;
and his broad streaks on the Mississippi&#xD;
announced the close of the day. At last the&#xD;
&#xD;
ROSA, THE INDIAN CAPTIVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
hissing sounds of the steam-boat were heard&#xD;
-a few minutes more, and the vast machine'&#xD;
rolled before his eyes,Tand turned, and moved&#xD;
slowly towards the bank. The deck of the&#xD;
vessel was filled with a medley of armed&#xD;
men, whose tremendous 4houts announced&#xD;
the riflemen of Opelousas. She had now&#xD;
come to-and Squire Copeland, with four&#xD;
men, armed with rifles, marched towards&#xD;
the mansion. -They halted on the piazza,&#xD;
and squire Copeland entered. There is&#xD;
something appalling in a military display of&#xD;
this character. Arthur grew pale-and a&#xD;
slight shudder flew over him. But a mo-&#xD;
ment's reflection gave him firmness, and he&#xD;
descended with a quick step.-   .&#xD;
"Au, lad !" exclaimed tie new  captain,&#xD;
shaking him heartily by the hand, "there&#xD;
you are, all's right-I hope it may end well&#xD;
-shouldn't like to see thee hanged."  And&#xD;
so sayingrhe stepped, with all the military&#xD;
pride he could muster, into the parlor,&#xD;
where the planter and his family were just&#xD;
entering from the side door.&#xD;
"A good evening to all ofdye-i see you&#xD;
are in your gears. You h tin't no notion,&#xD;
senator, to take them tender creatures down&#xD;
with ye-do ye? Hang me, it ain't no joke,&#xD;
nor a husking frolic neither. How now,&#xD;
young folks, d'ye really mean to run your&#xD;
chances with us? Ay, and all ready from&#xD;
top to bottom ! No, I warrant ye, there will&#xD;
be fine doings."&#xD;
He would -have probably continued for&#xD;
half an hour longer, if the senator, who had&#xD;
been unusually serious all this time, had not&#xD;
interrupted him. by saying, "They will go&#xD;
down with me."&#xD;
"Well, well, all's right ; I hain't no ob-&#xD;
jection. But," and he turned now with a-.&#xD;
military air towards the senator, "I have to&#xD;
thank you, senator, for the care you have&#xD;
taken of the prisoner-your trouble-shall be&#xD;
duly paid in country bills; one dollar and&#xD;
seventy-five cents for one day and a half,&#xD;
maybe a few hours more--according to law.&#xD;
But, I am now to reclaim the prisoner, at&#xD;
your hands, that he may pass into military&#xD;
jurisdiction, according to law."&#xD;
"Well, as I am going down myself, cap-&#xD;
&#xD;
tin,.you will have no objection, if I take&#xD;
care of the proper lodging of Mr. Graham.&#xD;
Where is the captain of the steamboat"&#xD;
lHe had just entered the house. The sen-&#xD;
ator spoke a few words with him apart, arnd&#xD;
the boat's new company having taken theF&#xD;
customary refreshments, they proceeded on&#xD;
board the steam-boat.&#xD;
CHAPITE XXV,&#xD;
'a Fellow citizen !" said the senator, when&#xD;
.the party had entered the cabin of the&#xD;
steamboat. "I hope you will pay proper re-&#xD;
spect to misfortune, even in the person of&#xD;
an enemy of our country ; from all appear-&#xD;
ance, we have a gentleman before us-as&#xD;
such, I wish him to be tre ted ; as senator&#xD;
of the state which we are all going to de-&#xD;
fend, I wish him to be so treated. Sir,"&#xD;
added he, turning to Arthur, "here'is your&#xD;
state-room."&#xD;
The sort address hid the desired effect;&#xD;
the multitude whoeame gazing and peeping&#xD;
through the cabin door drew off in silence,:&#xD;
and _the company was soon left alone. It&#xD;
consisted of the senator and his family, and&#xD;
about twenty landed proprietors from the&#xD;
banks of the Mississippi. The senator pre-&#xD;
served his usual gentleness, and the open&#xD;
"manner in which he treated the prisoner,&#xD;
bespoke that he was a 4nan of 'that firm&#xD;
'character, which neither feared suspicion,&#xD;
nor shrunk from it. But Arthur himself&#xD;
felt the necessity of greater reserve, and it&#xD;
was but seldom that they exchanged words.&#xD;
After a short supper, the females retiredI&#xD;
into the ladies' cabin, the gentlemnen in their&#xD;
small but elegant state-rooms, of six feet&#xD;
eight, inches in length, and four feet in9&#xD;
width.  Arthur soon followed their ex-3&#xD;
ample.&#xD;
The lamps shed a dim lustre through the&#xD;
cabin, above which the heavy footsteps ofi&#xD;
the trampling multitude were heard mingled&#xD;
' with the regular strokes of the steam engine.'&#xD;
Arthur, in his berth, felt his hand softly&#xD;
touched, and a voice 'whispered into his&#xD;
&#xD;
" To-morrow, at three o'clock, mama&#xD;
leave dinner, and be in the ladies' cabin."&#xD;
The mysterious speaker stole through the&#xD;
silk curtains that 'hung ,down from the&#xD;
ceiling of the little room, and left Arthur to&#xD;
his thoughts.&#xD;
The passage was a dreary one to Arthur;&#xD;
wherever he turned he beheld cold, scrutiniz-&#xD;
ing, or desponding glances.  The senator&#xD;
had become more pensive and dejected every&#xD;
passing hour; his eyes hung long and de-&#xD;
spairingly on Arthur. Eleanor had not .&#xD;
spoken a single word, Gabriella had not left&#xD;
the ladies' cabin, and betrayed her presence&#xD;
only by a loud sobbing. There is something&#xD;
extremely discouraging in these mute work-&#xD;
ings of pity and sympathy.&#xD;
The dinner bell rang, and the family sat&#xD;
down with the rest of the company ; but&#xD;
none of them tasted the dishes. Gabriella&#xD;
looked up, from time to time, from her un-&#xD;
touched plate, and at last, unable longer to&#xD;
suppress her feelings, she burst into tears,&#xD;
and left the table. Arthur felt' his right&#xD;
foot touched, hestarted, and after a moment-&#xD;
ary recollection, stole behind the curtains of&#xD;
the sanator's state-foom; a door opened&#xD;
from the small apartment into the ladies'&#xD;
cabin--Arthur passed through it, and Barn-&#xD;
ho stood before him,&#xD;
"Move towards the curtain,' whispered&#xD;
the black, "or they'll see the English massa&#xD;
through the window, It is well, massa has&#xD;
understood Bambo; but not .yet time. 'Does&#xD;
massa see yon smoke ?"&#xD;
Arthur looked in the direction indicated,&#xD;
"It is the camp of General Coffee, with&#xD;
his militia men. We must pass them before&#xD;
massa can leave the boat."&#xD;
A few minutes brought them in sight of&#xD;
the eucamped troops, who, however, were&#xD;
manoeuvring quite differently from the speci-.&#xD;
mens of soldiers which we have sketched on&#xD;
a former occasion. The Englishman stood&#xD;
in silent expectation.&#xD;
"What does that mean ?" demanded he,&#xD;
at last.&#xD;
The negro laid his fingers on his mouth,&#xD;
and looked at the men. The steam-boat&#xD;
was now on the point of the great bend that&#xD;

ROSA, THE INDIAN CAPTIVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Back ." repeated the soldier.&#xD;
"The chiefs must see their white brother,"&#xD;
said the old Indian.&#xD;
The soldier gave no answer, but booked&#xD;
towards the approaching prisoner.     +&#xD;
" Tokeah!" said the Englishman, who&#xD;
stood now before the old Indian, only sepa-&#xD;
rated by the sentinel. "I have kept my&#xD;
word of honor ; but I must request you to&#xD;
release me from it."&#xD;
At this moment the band opened, and&#xD;
Rosa flew into the arms of Arthur, the mus-&#xD;
kets sank from the hands of the iron-hearted&#xD;
veterans, and they stepped involuntarily&#xD;
back at the sight of the transcendant and&#xD;
almost unearthly beauty of the maiden. For&#xD;
a moment she hung in his arms, speechless,&#xD;
unconscious of everything around. The com-&#xD;
manding officer made a sign.&#xD;
"Sir," said he, "the time is pressing."&#xD;
"Rosa, I must leave you," whispered&#xD;
Arthur.&#xD;
"Leave Rosa!" exclaimed shQ, and the&#xD;
crimson of her face changed to a deadly&#xD;
pale.'&#xD;
"I must go with these gentlemen."&#xD;
She hung on his arm like a drooping&#xD;
vine.&#xD;
" Tokeak !'\ said the youth, still support-&#xD;
ing the maiden  ith hisarmn, "I have prom-&#xD;
ised not to tell where I found you and your&#xD;
tribe. Your Indian dress is near bringing&#xD;
me to an ignominious death-may I tell how&#xD;
I caine ito your village, and in possession&#xD;
of this dress ?"&#xD;
The Indian listened attentively.&#xD;
"Sir," interrupted the officer, "that is&#xD;
against military rules."&#xD;
"Certainly not," replied the youth, loft-&#xD;
ily ; "I gave my word of honor ; I reclaim&#xD;
it only."&#xD;
"I wish you may give this gentleman&#xD;
time to explain himself," said the, senator,&#xD;
who stood with his family behind the offi-&#xD;
cer.&#xD;
"Even the high respect'I bear to Mr.&#xD;
Gentillon would not permit that," returned&#xD;
the officer. "'What the gentleman has toc&#xD;
say will be heard by his judges."&#xD;
"May I speak ?" demanded the English-&#xD;
&#xD;
man, once more, of the silent and provok-&#xD;
ingly calm Indian.&#xD;
The Indian was about to open his lips,&#xD;
when the soldiers raised their muskets, and&#xD;
pushing both the chiefs aside, they marched&#xD;
their prisoner on shore, and soon disappear-&#xD;
ed among the gaping crowd.&#xD;
Rosa looked after the youth, who, like a&#xD;
meteor, had vanished from her sight ; she&#xD;
drooped her head- then gazing wildly&#xD;
round, she was going to rush after the be-&#xD;
loved object, when she felt herself suddenly&#xD;
withheld. It was the senator, who led her&#xD;
gently into the cabin,'and made the Indians&#xD;
a sign to follow him. He had scarcely de-&#xD;
livered Rosa into the hands of his daughter,&#xD;
when he addressed himself, trembling with&#xD;
anxiety, to the old Indian, who stood before&#xD;
him in all his shrunken grandeur, un-&#xD;
moved, to every appearance, by what he had&#xD;
seen.&#xD;
" Was It you, from whom the young man&#xD;
obtained the dress and the weapons ?" de-&#xD;
manded he, with an impatience which was&#xD;
the surest means of obtaining no reply at&#xD;
all.&#xD;
The old chief gazed at the interrogator,&#xD;
but he gave no answer.&#xD;
"Perhaps you know something about&#xD;
it?" demanded the senator, turning to the&#xD;
young chief.&#xD;
The same silence.&#xD;
"Men !" cried the senator, who knew lit-&#xD;
tle of Indian manners, or of their circuitous&#xD;
and sententious phraseology, "I must re-&#xD;
quest you, in all earnestness, to speak plainly;&#xD;
the life of the young man in whom you seem&#xD;
to take so deep an interest, depends on your&#xD;
promptly revealing the manner in which ho&#xD;
came by his disguised"&#xD;
He might have spoken an hour without&#xD;
coming to the point.&#xD;
" Why has Arthur left Rosa'?" demanded&#xD;
the latter of her neighbor, the tender Ga-&#xD;
briella.&#xD;
"He is led to prison," said Gabriella.&#xD;
"T Io prison-and why? Has my brother&#xD;
done wrong ?"&#xD;
"They suppose so-they think him a spy,&#xD;
a British emissary, who instigated the In-&#xD;
&#xD;
dians against the white [people," replied&#xD;
Gabriella.&#xD;
The words spy and emissary had attracted&#xD;
the attention of Tokeab.&#xD;
 "Is the old man," said he, "to whom the&#xD;
miko of tho Oconees talks, one of the chiefs&#xD;
of the white men ?"&#xD;
The senator nodded.&#xD;
"Has he fought in many battle ?"&#xD;
" No-I am not a military chief, but one&#xD;
of peace," returned the senator, who, when"&#xD;
he found that his abstract expressions were&#xD;
riot in the vocabulary of the Indians, en-&#xD;
deavoredconsequently, though with difficulty,1&#xD;
to adopt a simpler mode of conveying his&#xD;
deas to the minds of his auditors.&#xD;
"Then," said the old Indian, after a pause,&#xD;
"he is one of the wise nien,-who hold their&#xD;
talk in the council house."&#xD;
The senator replied in the affirmative.&#xD;
" And the wise man cannot deliver my&#xD;
ypng white brother from the white warriors,&#xD;
and from the prison ?"&#xD;
! "No," said the senator, painfully embar-.&#xD;
rassed at the tedious questioning.&#xD;
"But the old man," continued the miko,&#xD;
is wise, and he can clear the path of the&#xD;
chiefs of the red men, that they may talk&#xD;
to the great chief of the white warriors."&#xD;
"Do you wish to speak to the general"&#xD;
den anded the senator.&#xD;
"We do," was the brief answer.&#xD;
"I doubt very much whether the red men&#xD;
will be admitted. The necessary precautions&#xD;
do not allow strangers to go down to the&#xD;
lines, where he is at present; and even if&#xD;
they go down, they will scarcely find oppor-&#xD;
tunity of talking with the chief. He is very&#xD;
busy."&#xD;
" Tell the great chief and father that the&#xD;
chiefs of the Oconees and of the Cuman-&#xD;
chees are come with their hands extended, as&#xD;
&#xD;
be effected with such men ; and yet the mo-&#xD;
ments were precious. As the intercourse of&#xD;
the young Englishman, beyond doubt, had&#xD;
been with one of the most dangerous ene-&#xD;
mies of the white population, it wa to be&#xD;
feared that his case would not even be&#xD;
thought? worthy of a strict inquiry or tfe&#xD;
decision of a court martial. According to&#xD;
the customs of war and'the rules of martial&#xD;
law, the fate of the worthless adventurer&#xD;
might be sealed in less than one hour, under&#xD;
the pending pressure, and where the English&#xD;
camp was scarcely three miles from the&#xD;
American lines. Great as his influence was,&#xD;
he had himself witnessed an example of the&#xD;
stern justice of the commanding general,&#xD;
that filled his republican mind with involun-&#xD;
tagy apprehension. He ran through the&#xD;
cabin to Rosa. "Will my fair child go with&#xD;
us ?" demanded he.&#xD;
She inclined her head.&#xD;
" Then'come," said he. "I will try my&#xD;
utmost to bring you before the general.&#xD;
Come, red men," added he, turning towards&#xD;
the Indians.&#xD;
"The wise man," said the miko, "may&#xD;
show the chiefs the path-they will follow&#xD;
him."&#xD;
The party now left the cabin. A carriage&#xD;
was waiting at some distance from the mar-&#xD;
gin of the river. The senator made a sign,&#xD;
and it drew up as the party approached.&#xD;
"The red rnen will follow- my carriage,".&#xD;
said he turning once more to the In-&#xD;
dians.&#xD;
They nodded their acquiescence. Afoot-&#xD;
man opened the door, let down the steps, and&#xD;
the senator handed Rosa in, and took him-&#xD;
self the back seat. The carriage whirled&#xD;
along through oyster and orange - shops,&#xD;
mountains of Pernambuco logs and bales,&#xD;
bales.of cotton, and sugar and tobacco-hogs-&#xD;

"The miko of the Oconees never talks the road, leading along the Mississippi to&#xD;

conversation.                           tachments pf regulars marched at intervals,&#xD;

ROSA, THE INDJAN CAPTIVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Negroes with spades, gohg to work on th&#xD;
lhies, picked their way carefully through th&#xD;
long ranges of wagons and horses which ob&#xD;
structed their passage.&#xD;
"It will take up too much time to gi&#xD;
down ia the carriage," said the senator&#xD;
" Has my child any objection to a walk ?'&#xD;
A mild, consenting glance was the an&#xD;
swer. They alighted, and found the Indians&#xD;
close at the wheels of the carriage. Beck-&#xD;
oning them to follow, they now crept in&#xD;
their turn through the crowd, often in im-&#xD;
minent danger of being'caught by the wheels,&#xD;
or trodden under the feet qf the horses. A&#xD;
weary hour passed before they saw the&#xD;
mansion of the general. 'Ihe house stood&#xD;
back from the road, and separated from the&#xD;
long range of summer mansions of the&#xD;
weal: lier creoles by a pleasure-ground, the&#xD;
projecting railing of which enclosed 'iron&#xD;
every side. A small picquet of regulars,&#xD;
stanotued before the entrance, with a crowd&#xD;
of officers of the regulars and militia, im-&#xD;
pedel their further progress. The silent,&#xD;
&amp;amp;light bow of the senator was returned by&#xD;
all the officers, with every mark of respect.&#xD;
e spoke a few words with one of the chief&#xD;
ofhcers; and leadingR osa towards him,&#xD;
made the Indians a sign to wait for him.&#xD;
He was then s n lost behind the shrubs and&#xD;
trees of the avenue. After a few minutes&#xD;

satisfketion.&#xD;

Thou1 seriously engimged, yet he will re-&#xD;
receive  ic chiefs. The rest of the red men&#xD;
must re min here. Come, then."     And,&#xD;
with a -ecipitancy which showed his anxi-&#xD;
ety, he led the way through the avenue to-&#xD;
wards the mansion, ascended the steps that&#xD;
led to the piazza, passed the corridor of the&#xD;
maus.u, and entered a wide s loon.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
They found the general; surrounded by&#xD;
his staff and other leading officers, whom&#xD;
he was dispatching on various routes, ac-&#xD;
celerating the business of defence, in which&#xD;
&#xD;
e he was for the moment busily engaged, with&#xD;
e a gravity and coolness only to be found in&#xD;
- a master mind. He was a tall, swarthy, large&#xD;
boned man, whose weather-beaten 'counte-&#xD;
o nance bore an appearance of severity by no&#xD;
means prepossessing to a stranger ; and yet,&#xD;
when for a moment his iron features relaxed,&#xD;
- and he turned his bright brown hazel eye&#xD;
with a calm smile of recognition- on the&#xD;
senator and his party, as they entered, thpre&#xD;
was a good humor and benevolent that&#xD;
immediately radiated those stern features,&#xD;
which had a happy effect in restoring the&#xD;
confidence of his visitors. The compliments&#xD;
of courteous salutation being over, the sen-&#xD;
ator introduced the two Indian chiefs to the&#xD;
general, who received them with every de-&#xD;
mionstration of regard.&#xD;
"The red men," said Tokeah, throwing&#xD;
himself into his usual oratorical position,&#xD;
have brought the great father of the white&#xD;
people tokens of their friendship. They&#xD;
have brought him the great chief of the&#xD;
Saltlake, that he may hang him on a tree."&#xD;
"Chief of the Saltlake !--what, you do&#xD;
not mean the pirate !"&#xD;
"The pirate of Barataria," said the old&#xD;
man.&#xD;
"Indeed! well I am  glad of it, though&#xD;
it is no affair of mine; it belongs rather to&#xD;
the government of the tate whose territory&#xD;
he has violated, yet I amn glad, both for the&#xD;
governor and for the state. How did this&#xD;
desperate character come into your hands?"&#xD;
"The great chief of the Cumanchees,"&#xD;

the Oconces."&#xD;
"It is well," said the general.&#xD;
lIe rang the bell, and an orderly appeared.&#xD;
Seating himself in his arm-chair, he wrote&#xD;
a few lines, gave them to the soldier, and&#xD;
stepped forward, addressing the party in&#xD;
general, but more particularly the senator.&#xD;
"The manner in which our enemies have&#xD;
treated us. instigating and exciting our mis-&#xD;
guided 'red brethren against the poor settlers&#xD;
and helpless families in the west of the&#xD;
Union, certainly justifies severe 'measures&#xD;
on our -1'rt, against persons suspected of&#xD;
being cot earned in those dastardly under-&#xD;
takings. From what I understand, the&#xD;
Englishman in question does not belong to&#xD;
this class of wretel es. I hate the enemies&#xD;
of my co'itry ; but far be it from inc to shed&#xD;
the blood f an innocent and peaceful travel-&#xD;
er, whom  toward accident seems to have&#xD;
thrown on our shores.'&#xD;
"He is a young man of high standing&#xD;
and conned Ions, and has been captured by&#xD;
the pirate, with his sister. Even the man-&#xD;
ner in wL h he kept his word of honor may&#xD;
convince you, general, that he is a gentle-&#xD;
man."&#xD;
The ge1ral again bowed slightly, and&#xD;
turned toe ds the young chief, whom he&#xD;
seemed to  ad through.&#xD;
"It is I l A, tbn," said he after a while,&#xD;
"of whom our western newspapers speak&#xD;
with so n'h admiration, and who saved&#xD;
the last pa:- sent by our government to&#xD;
explore t    stern country from a cruel,&#xD;
treaeherou death. and relieved the young&#xD;
woman fr,. a rrible death. You see how&#xD;
aecuratel; a ore informed of your doings."&#xD;
The y a    Lief bowed, and inclined his&#xD;
head.&#xD;
"I sha  ih -py," continued the gene-&#xD;
ral, " to     i   1tr mine and my country's&#xD;
guest so a   ,uaished and humane a war-&#xD;
rior as tih  u If of the Cumanchees-the&#xD;

Mexico's,  aiedi he, turning towards the&#xD;
senator ; a o, if I am not mistaken, the&#xD;
only one, yo the Maquis in Senora and&#xD;
Senowha: , ho are still independent of the&#xD;

&#xD;
Spaniards. 'Their cavalry is a' fine corps.&#xD;
and they are, I am sure, the best irregular&#xD;
lancers in the world."&#xD;
"The Cumanchees know no master ex-&#xD;
cept the Great Spirit," said the young war-&#xD;
rior loftily.  "If the heart of the great fa-&#xD;
ther and warrior of the white people ap-&#xD;
proves of what the chief of the Cumnanchecs&#xD;
has done, let him do the same, and give the&#xD;
white young man to his friends, whose&#xD;
hearts are very sad."&#xD;
"Be assured, my brother," returned the&#xD;
general, "that I shall do what my duty and&#xD;
humanity demand. If the youth is innocent,&#xD;
and I have no doubt he is, then he shall be&#xD;
free. For the present I am pressed with&#xD;
affairs of importance ; but in one hour -I&#xD;
hope I shall have done, and then I shall&#xD;
expect you in the city."&#xD;
Waving his hand to the Indian, he shook&#xD;
that of the senator, and the party withdrew.&#xD;
A sergeant informed them that he was to&#xD;
conduct the Indians to the lodgiug-assigned&#xD;
to them by the general, and to take the pi,&#xD;
rate into safe custody. They now passed&#xD;
through the pleasure-ground under quite&#xD;
different feelings. 'The re-echoed roaring&#xD;
of a twenty-four pounder, from the camp,&#xD;
struck their ears, just as they arrived at the&#xD;
gate ; but the Indians passed on. seemingly&#xD;
without noticing the heavy peal.&#xD;
"That's from one of them guns," said&#xD;
the sergeant, pointing to a heavy pieco of&#xD;
ordnance that stood behind the lines.&#xD;
They approached them, and looked at-&#xD;
tentively at the new objects that presented&#xD;
themselves to their eyes. The lines were&#xD;
not yet quite finished, but in a state of rapid&#xD;
progress that promised a speedy termination,&#xD;
They consisted of a long range of cotton&#xD;
bales, extending from the margin of the&#xD;
Mississippi across the bottom towards the&#xD;
cypress swi np. These were covered with&#xD;
earth, exhibiting thus an impenetrable&#xD;
breastwork, behind which the assailants&#xD;
could be received with the sure and dreadful&#xD;
fire of the western back-woods riflemen.&#xD;
Several batteries, parly finished, showed,&#xD;
heavy pieces of ordnance that were to do&#xD;
fend the principal points of the line. The&#xD;

A coach was heard rolling through the&#xD;

ran towards the door.  "It is Arthur!"&#xD;
shouted the boyant'and tender-hearted gii-.&#xD;
The news was received with an exclama-&#xD;
tion of joy by the company, and even the&#xD;
passive Madame Gentillon could not sup-&#xD;
press her emotion. The Englishman alight-&#xD;
ed, bowed to a military gentleman who re-&#xD;
mained in the carriage, and entered the&#xD;
house. There was on his countenance, when&#xD;
he entered the parlor, a slight, melancholy&#xD;
seriousness visible, which, with the natural&#xD;
dignity and loftiness of his demeanor,, ren-&#xD;
dered his appearance extremely interesting.&#xD;
It was the consciousness of having acted a&#xD;
noble part; tempered,, however, by some-&#xD;
thing like an unpleasant feeling. He paid&#xD;
his respects to the ladies of 'the house, and&#xD;
after grasping the hand of the senator in&#xD;

her face began to brighten, her eyes&#xD;

which seemed to anticipate that joys of&#xD;
higher description, and pleasures of a noble&#xD;
taste, would brighten her thorny path. S1&#xD;
rose, and glided with a light airy step t(&#xD;
wards the piano-forte, as if afraid of disturl&#xD;
ing the fairy sound, and with a native woe&#xD;
during gaze, she looked both at the sing&#xD;
nud the instrument, that uttered such ha&#xD;
meonious'concord. Again she retired, ande&#xD;
down deeply musing. A tear stole from ur&#xD;
derneath her silken lashes, another follow&#xD;
ed ; they were tears of inexpressible joy&#xD;
that she had never shed before, and the,&#xD;
produced that corresponding feeling of in&#xD;

" My dear Rosa," said he, in a tone thrill-&#xD;
t ing with emotion, "nothing shall ever more&#xD;
, separate us."&#xD;
Every one stepped back, and the family&#xD;
- looked in silence at the noble couple.&#xD;
S"ILet us now, dea- friends, forget the past&#xD;
and live in the present, and acknowledge&#xD;
thankfully the ways of Providence," said&#xD;
Madame Gentillon.&#xD;
"Not a hair shall fall from  our heads'&#xD;
without He wills it," said Rosa.&#xD;
iertearful eyes were turned towards heav-&#xD;
en, and again upon Arthur. The mother&#xD;
crossed her hands, and a general silence be-&#xD;
spoke the deep feeling of all.&#xD;
"I commit," said Arthur, after a pause,&#xD;
"my Rosa to the hands of the tender Gabri-&#xD;
ella ; she will not reject so lovely a sister."&#xD;
.The girl blushed, and received Rosa in&#xD;
her arms. The senator understood the&#xD;
meaning of his gueit, and seizing his arm,&#xD;
both gentlemen walked into the next'room.&#xD;
"I am so unfortunate," began the Bng-&#xD;
lishman, "as to give my friends more un-&#xD;
easiness than even the rules of politeness&#xD;
will allow."&#xD;
"Sir," replied the senator, with a hearty&#xD;
shake of the hand, "do not speak here of&#xD;
rules, where k an extraordinary .ec4 se super-&#xD;
cedes every rule. Pray speak Sri hout the&#xD;

the Englishman, "to leave the city to-mor-&#xD;

"Why to-morrow 7" interrupted the sen-&#xD;

eumstance has occurred which calls me im-&#xD;

"I hope the general has not contributed&#xD;
to make Mr. Graham's stay so unpleasing,"&#xD;
returned the senator.&#xD;
"Certainly not," replied the Englishman.&#xD;

The senator paced up and down the room.&#xD;
"I will mlke you, sir, a proposal. Leave&#xD;

her."&#xD;
"It is impossible !" said the Englishmtan&#xD;
passing his hand over his forehead, on which&#xD;

Arthur rblowed slowly and thoughtfully.&#xD;
Theg found the circle of the family greatly&#xD;
increased . Elanor stood at the side of a&#xD;
wel-formed young man with a rosy counte-&#xD;
nance. She tripped up to Arthur, and draw-&#xD;
ing herself a little up, assumed as grave an&#xD;
attitude a' I tform,inclining somewhat to-&#xD;
wards faness, would admit. The new&#xD;
guests seemed to be intimate friends of the&#xD;
house.&#xD;
"rAlr me to introduce to your acquaint-&#xD;

"Here is a Yankee," said she, with a&#xD;

a voice that tre mbled a little, poiniing.at the&#xD;
same time to the young man at whose side&#xD;
she had been standing, when the two gen-&#xD;
tleinen entered.  "I hate ahese Yankees,"&#xD;
added she, in a sly whisper to the young&#xD;
rnan; the sound, however was caught by&#xD;
our Captain Copeland, who had unceremo-&#xD;
niously entered'and stolen behind her.&#xD;
" I believe her," said he; "-she will give&#xD;

"That man," exclaimed the merry girl,&#xD;
to the infinite satisfaction of the party, "is&#xD;

county town of Opelousas, at present cape&#xD;

Shtkiug hands with him, she turned away.&#xD;
Well,.lad," said the worthy old man,&#xD;
with a hearty laugh "I am'glad to see thee&#xD;
again; thou art as honest, ay, and as true a&#xD;
lad, as ever trod in his own shoes, and hast&#xD;
more real- blood in thy little finger than&#xD;

'Arthur seized the hand of the old man and&#xD;
Asak it heartily.&#xD;
The buoyaut vivacity of the little mistress&#xD;
of ceremonies was somewhat disconcerted&#xD;
in her flow of spirits, by the bluntness of the&#xD;
old man; but after a moment, she regained&#xD;
her former gaiety.&#xD;
"That f iendof ors," continued she, "is,&#xD;

turning the polite bow of the Englishm:m.&#xD;

"Philileluphia," said the other.&#xD;
She was agnia interrupted by Squire&#xD;
Copland, who had now taken a stare round&#xD;

&#xD;
pointing to the canoe with a great mien, he&#xD;
made the Indian a sign to follow him. The&#xD;
savage looked at the officer without chaug-&#xD;
ing his posture. The Spaniard, who seem-&#xD;
ed all the while absorbed in the grosser&#xD;
affairs of his' kitchen, turned towards the&#xD;
new comer, and had no sooner observed hin,&#xD;
than lie lifted his cap and bowed profound-&#xD;
ly. The officer nodded complacently, and&#xD;
stepped up to the boatmen, and taking from&#xD;
his cocked hat a printed paper, he unfolded&#xD;
it, explaining in a few broken English words&#xD;
the nat ure of his errand, which related, as&#xD;
he said. to custom-house regulations. He&#xD;
wout back again to the Indians, and beck-&#xD;

accompanying their gestures with a sign&#xD;
that showed their own displeasure at the&#xD;
contempt of their public affairs, and their&#xD;
disposition to force him into compliance.&#xD;
The Pa\vneo' looked for a moment at the&#xD;
sturdy backwoodsmen, whom he had seen&#xD;
coining from  afar, again at the officer who&#xD;
was already at some distance, and proceed-&#xD;
ed without looking further behind, as if his&#xD;
Ecrupls were overcome. Making to the,&#xD;

he went after the officer, and the three per-&#xD;

S&#xD;
&#xD;
some minutes, however, they seemed to feel&#xD;
the importance of their trust, and they turn-&#xD;
da away, as if afraid of looking at.the se-&#xD;
ductig bottle. The second boatman now&#xD;
came, and after having taken the same li-&#xD;
bationm, both threw themselves again on t .-&#xD;
ground."&#xD;
The effect of the bad example was slow.&#xD;
but irresistible. One of the Oconees rose,&#xD;
and casting a doubtful glance round, as if&#xD;
afraid of being seen by the dreaded Pawnee,&#xD;
he stole towards the kettles, and seizing the&#xD;
offered tumbler, swallowed its contents with&#xD;
an avidity that extorted a low contemptuous&#xD;
laugh from the backwoodsman. Another&#xD;
of his brethren followed, looking round in&#xD;
the same wary manner; a third and a fourth&#xD;
succeeded; still no Pawnee appeared, and&#xD;
their thirst got the upper hand of their fear,&#xD;
Again the fi-st of the Geonees advanced&#xD;
with somewhat tmre assurance, and again&#xD;
the rest followed, till their draughts became&#xD;
so frequent, that timy stretched themselves&#xD;
on the ground. in a state of insensibility.&#xD;
The obliging Frenchman cane now saun-&#xD;
tering towards the Indians, and casting an&#xD;
indifferent glance at the besotted savages,&#xD;
stepped hastily down towards the canoe,&#xD;
gaud lifted the mat.&#xD;
" Monsieur Lafitte," whispered he.&#xD;
The head rose again.&#xD;
Putting his hand cautiously under the,&#xD;
mat, he severed the thongs with which the&#xD;
arms of the pirates. were p3imiioned, with a&#xD;
single effort, and dropping his knife and a&#xD;
small bottle into the canoe, he again step-&#xD;
ped back on the bank.&#xD;
For some time there was no sign of any&#xD;
movement, but, after a few minutes, a light&#xD;
&#xD;
stir betrayed that the prisoners were en-&#xD;
deavoring to restore the circulation of blood&#xD;
in their limbs. As they had been only par-&#xD;
tially bound during their passage down the&#xD;
Red river and the Mississippi, having alter-&#xD;
nately the free use of either of their hands,I&#xD;
and of their feet, they regained their mo-&#xD;
tion sooner than was even expected aby the&#xD;
Frenehman,&#xD;
" These savages," said he to the boat-1&#xD;
men, apparently with much concern, "are&#xD;
as drunk as beasts: they will lose their&#xD;
guns; we must put them into the canoe."&#xD;
The boatmen remained in their listless atti-&#xD;
tude, without giving a reply. The solici-&#xD;
tous Frenchman stepped down with the&#xD;
guns.&#xD;
"Sir," said he in French, "it is time."&#xD;
Very well-your name, Sir," said the&#xD;
lshy voice of Lafitte.&#xD;
rLouis Marseille."&#xD;
"You have my word of honor for a thous-&#xD;
and Napoleons."&#xD;
"Good !-make haste !"&#xD;
The Frenchman had scarcely ascended&#xD;
.the bank, before the mat slided into the&#xD;
stream with a light rushing sound. The&#xD;
noise of the mat made the boatmen'run to-&#xD;
wards the canoe. tha now darted across the&#xD;
stream like an animat d being, impelled by&#xD;
the powerful hands of 'he skilful oarsmen,&#xD;
who regained with every stroke more of their&#xD;
former strength. For a moment they looked&#xD;
at the swift canoe that became suddenly peo-&#xD;
pled with a swarthy, weather-beaten, and&#xD;
suspicious-looking race ; then recollecting&#xD;
the custom-house officers, and the manou-&#xD;
vres of the Frenehman,they began to suspect&#xD;
foul play ; they reared their double-jointed&#xD;
masses with morequickness than might have&#xD;
been expected from 'their sluggish nature,&#xD;
and jumping into their skiff off the flat boat,&#xD;
gave the fugitives full chase, without being&#xD;
in the least disconcerted by their numbers-&#xD;

that darted already fifty yards before them.&#xD;
At the ame time pointing a rifle towards&#xD;

&#xD;
woodsman, not in the least daunted by , the&#xD;
sight."&#xD;
But the canoe was too lightly built and&#xD;
too well manned, not to gain with every&#xD;
stroke of the oar on their pursuers; and af-&#xD;
ter a few minutes of fruitless struggle, the&#xD;
two men returned to their former station.&#xD;
the sun was now setting. A crowd corn-&#xD;
ing from the city, was fast thronging towards&#xD;
the upper quay. Amidst the glittering arms&#xD;
of the regulars, the lofty forms of El Sol and&#xD;
Tokeah could be distinctly seen. A fierce,&#xD;
terrible yell burst from the throats of the&#xD;
Indians. The flat boat that lay below the=&#xD;
canoe, had for a considerable time concealed&#xD;
the escape of the pirate, and it was not un-&#xD;
til they had gained the current of the stream,&#xD;
that it became visible to the keen eyes of&#xD;
the Indians. Leaving the regulars behind,&#xD;
they darted 'ith immense leaps towards the&#xD;
spot where their drunken men lay, and ar-&#xD;
rivet just w'hen the boatirmen had again Idn'd-&#xD;
ed. A glance at their brethren betrayed the&#xD;
ole-without hesitating a moment they&#xD;
tI ew themselves into the skiff.&#xD;
But the pirates had too great an advan-&#xD;
tage over their pursuers, and notwithstand-&#xD;
ing the extraordinary skill of the Indians in&#xD;
handling their pars, and their still greater&#xD;
exertions, yet such was the superior and al-&#xD;
most flying swiftness of the birchen canoe,&#xD;
that the pirates were approaching the right&#xD;
bank before the Indians had even passed a&#xD;
third of the stream.&#xD;
There was, - however, another point to-&#xD;
wards which the pirates turned their eyes&#xD;
with anxiety. Three ships lay at anchot&#xD;
near the shore, where they were to land.&#xD;
There was evidently a short consultation,&#xD;
and 'even indecision among them, of which:&#xD;
their pursuers availed themselves, by ie-&#xD;
doubling their efforts. The fierce yell that&#xD;
resounded nearer and nearer, cut short the&#xD;
consultations&#xD;
They pushed with renewed vigor towards&#xD;
the bank. As not the slightest stir on board&#xD;
these vessels was to be observed, the spirit&#xD;
of' the fugitives seemed to revive. They&#xD;
were within gun-shot distance, when they&#xD;
found the ships entirely deserted. The sal-&#xD;

A sullen silence betrayed that none were&#xD;
willihg to go on so dangerous an expedition.&#xD;
It is too late," said the old chief, in a&#xD;
voice in which shame and ire were fearfully&#xD;
mingled.&#xD;
"And will the mike let his enemies es-&#xD;
cape ?" demanded El Sol, with surprise, in&#xD;
the Indian language.&#xD;
"Shall the red men become the hunting"&#xD;
dogs of the whites? Enough of blood has&#xD;
been shed for them. Not a drop more shall&#xD;
flow. Does El Sol know the path of these&#xD;
woods? Can his eye see the.trail when all&#xD;
is dark?  Does he want to see his braves&#xD;
killed by robbers ?"&#xD;
The old chief spoke these words with a&#xD;
decision that sprung perhaps as much from&#xD;
hatred to his enemies, as some, not entirely&#xD;
subdued, predilection foir the pirate, who,&#xD;
notwithstanding the dark treachery that had&#xD;
cost him his only child, kept still his hold&#xD;
on a mind, that in hatred ks well as love,&#xD;
was impelled more by instinctive tenacity&#xD;
than reason. , El Sol listened in silence to&#xD;
the talk of his father-in-law-making now&#xD;
a sign to his men, they' returned to their&#xD;
canoe, which, in the meanwhile, had been&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
After having traversed an immense tract&#xD;
of country under difficulties which only In-&#xD;
dians couli overcome in so short a time,&#xD;
and in parts seldom or never trodden by hu-&#xD;
man foot-the mike with his son-in-law&#xD;
had at last arrived at the place of their des-&#xD;
tination, as we have seen.&#xD;
Their diffeulties had begun as soon as&#xD;
they had issued from the Red river. The&#xD;
numerous mansions on the banks of the&#xD;
Mississippi, the scattered villages, the threat-&#xD;
ening mien of the black and white people,&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
and the suspicious glances with which they&#xD;
'vere measured on theih passage, had augur-&#xD;
ed to theri an evil reception, These diffi-&#xD;
culties were by no means diminished, when&#xD;
they at'last beheld the city, with its bustle&#xD;
and warlik preparations, and the thousands&#xD;
of br ick jnd stone buildings, every one of&#xD;
which was considered by them as an im-&#xD;
pregnable fortress.&#xD;
It was, therefore, with no-little''satisfac-&#xD;
tion that the miko heard the well-known&#xD;
voice of his young white brother, the Eng-&#xD;
lishmnan ; and the desire 'of joining him who&#xD;
might direct them in this civilized wilder-&#xD;
ness, contributed greatly to the'haste with&#xD;
which they darted ~after the steanmboat.&#xD;
They were driven off the bank with a con-&#xD;
temptuous roar that stung the proud chiefs&#xD;
to the quick. It was the first shock that&#xD;
their pride had received, and they land-&#xD;
ed under gloomy forebodings.- They neg-&#xD;
lected none of those precautions which they&#xD;
would have taken in their own;villages ;&#xD;
but, unacquainted with the mixed;character&#xD;
of 'the population of the big village,- as&#xD;
they called the city, they considered the&#xD;
prisoners as secure in'the canoe as if they&#xD;
had been in their owin town. They doubt-&#xD;
ed, not in the least, that the pirates had es-&#xD;
caped with the assistance of the whitest as&#xD;
they called the Americans, and that even&#xD;
the chief himself had connived at it. - The&#xD;
coolness with which he had 'received' the&#xD;
news, and the manner in whichthey had&#xD;
been arrested in, their pursuit, confined&#xD;
them greatly in their suspicion.&#xD;
When they had again landed on the left&#xD;
shore, they were 'received with a low' taunt-&#xD;
ing laugh that resounded from the'idlers&#xD;
who had gathered round the drunken Indi-&#xD;
ans. The two chiefs exchanged significant&#xD;
glances, but their countenances betrayed&#xD;
not the least symptom of what was passing&#xD;
in their minds. Calm and proud, they dis-&#xD;
posed of the Oconees by leading them, with&#xD;
therest'of the men, to the lodging which&#xD;
had been assigned to them, while' they&#xD;
themselves went, accompanied by the ser-&#xD;

&#xD;
cers of the staff and his adjutants. His&#xD;
countenance had assumed an expression of&#xD;
condescension that, equally far from super-&#xD;
cilious haughtiness and forward familiarity,&#xD;
seemed calculated to inspire them with a&#xD;
salutary respect.&#xD;
The Indians stood a considerable while&#xD;
before the general, who was alternatively&#xD;
eyeing his visitors, in whose tirien something&#xD;
like a calm sullenness was clearly legible ;&#xD;
lie opened the couverstltion by saying, "'Ihe&#xD;
pirate has cheated the men of the two chiefs&#xD;
-I am sorry for it."&#xD;
The Indians gave no answer; they kept&#xD;
their eyes fixed on the floor.&#xD;
"But," demanded the *eneral, "how has&#xD;
the pirate found out the path that leads to&#xD;
the wigwams of my red brethren ?"&#xD;
The thief wanted to kill the buffalo&#xD;
and the deer," replied the old niko,&#xD;
The general seemed satisfied.&#xD;
"The chief of the whites," resumed lie,&#xD;
after a pause, "has weighed the words of&#xD;
his young brother, the chief of the Cuman-&#xD;
d1ees, and has found them good. He has&#xD;
set his white brother free."&#xD;
The   countenance of the  Cumanchee&#xD;
brightened with satisfaction. Tokeah, how-&#xD;
ever, was unmoved to all appearance.&#xD;
"And why did the miko of the Oconees&#xD;
take the promise from the youth that he&#xD;
would not tell to the white men where he&#xD;
has his villages ? Are the Oconees rapa-&#xD;
cious wolves, that they hide themselves in&#xD;
their holes, afraid of being seen by day-&#xD;
time ?"&#xD;
"Does my great father like to show&#xD;
what is dear to him to thieves ?" replied&#xD;
the old Indian. "The Oeonees do not&#xD;
hide their wigwams from the white men,&#xD;
but from the white thieves who come to&#xD;
steal their cattle and their corn, and to burn&#xD;
their wigwamns. They want to live in peace&#xD;
with them, and far from them."&#xD;
"And the old chi ef has quitted the good&#xD;
lands of his fathers, and gone into a bad&#xD;
country on the Saltlake, where the shells&#xD;
cut his moccasins."&#xD;
"If the red man has a handsome woman&#xD;
who will not cook for him, and make his&#xD;
&#xD;
s hunting shirt and his mneasins, he sends&#xD;
f her back to her father's wigwam, and takes&#xD;
an uglier wo nan, who will do for him what&#xD;
he wants, and will not run after the young&#xD;
men.   "Tokeah," continued he, "has&#xD;
lived in the land of his fathers, and among&#xD;
the white men, with his people. If their&#xD;
horses or their cattle went across the line,&#xD;
they durst not go and catch them, and if&#xD;
they did,.the whites took their lives as if&#xD;
they were buffaloes. If the cattle of the&#xD;
white men came over our lines they came&#xD;
and took them, and those of the red ien&#xD;
too. Tokeah cannot live with such men."&#xD;
"But," said the general, "have the red&#xD;
men no bad brethren among themselves?&#xD;
There are bad men among every people."&#xD;
"The red men," replied the Indian,&#xD;
"punish their bad men, and they drive&#xD;
them from their villages ; but the white&#xD;
men," shaking his head, "take the part of&#xD;
their had brethren. It is far to the Great&#xD;
Father, and he does not hear the cries of&#xD;
his red children; and Tokeah is therefore&#xD;
going where he will never see their trail."&#xD;
"And so the chief of the Oconees isn&#xD;
going to the Cumanchees, and has bright-&#xD;
ened the link with them ?" demanded the&#xD;
general, as if willing to elicit something&#xD;
more from the reserved old han.&#xD;
"The chief of the Cumanehes," said the&#xD;
old man, in a melancholy tone, "is the son&#xD;
of the miko; he took into his wigwamn her&#xD;
whom he had delivered from the fire-death."&#xD;
Where is the woman ?" demanded the&#xD;
general.&#xD;
"She is now laid low," replied the In.-&#xD;
dian.&#xD;
"And how came this about ?"&#xD;
"The balls _of the pirate have pierced&#xD;
her heart."&#xD;
A long pause ensued. The general had&#xD;
probably caught a glimpse of the further&#xD;
views of the old chief,,whose inveterate en-&#xD;
mity towards the whites was so clearly legi-&#xD;
tie in his mien; and perhaps wit the in-&#xD;
tention 'of impressing El Sol with  ,ter&#xD;
opinion, he said-&#xD;
" There is no doubt that the red men&#xD;
have suffered in some points from the whites,&#xD;
&#xD;
ROSA, THEID&#xD;
ht they have. certainly done as much&#xD;
wrong to us as we dil to them. They&#xD;
should remember that we are as lawful pos-&#xD;
lessors of the land as they are, and certain-&#xD;
ly the strongest. We could havo made&#xD;
them slaves, and sent them into our mines,&#xD;
as the Spaniards did. We have left them&#xD;
their lands; and treated them as brethren."&#xD;
"The Great Spirit," returned the old&#xD;
chief, "has made the big river run from&#xD;
where the snow  falls, towards the land&#xD;
where the sun shies very warm and, burns&#xD;
the face of man. He has given to the red&#xD;
nmen end to the white men, plenty of lands.&#xD;
Why are the white men never satisfied, and&#xD;
stretch out their hands for what belongs to&#xD;
their red brethren, and take, with every&#xD;
summer, more of the lands where their fa-&#xD;
thers are buried ?"&#xD;
"The whites have bought their land&#xD;
rom the red men; and it is, therefore, their&#xD;
jest property."&#xD;
"They have made thered men drunk&#xD;
with their fire-water, and then cheated&#xD;
them out of their lands," replied the old In-&#xD;
dian.&#xD;
"Chief," said the general, not without&#xD;
vehemence, "the Great Spirit has made&#xD;
the lands for the white men, and for the.&#xD;
red men, that they may live on the fruits&#xD;
which grow on the earth, and dig the soil,&#xD;
and plough the ground, but not for hunting&#xD;
grounds, that some thousands of red nen&#xD;
may find deer, where millions of happy&#xD;
people aught live peacefully. If you keep&#xD;
those lands which are left to you, and&#xD;
plough aid hoe the ground, you may live as&#xD;
well as we do, and as independently as we&#xD;
live. You will have the same right as we&#xD;
have. But if you choose a roaming hunt-&#xD;
ing life, you nu  abide the consequences,&#xD;
and look for the desert.&#xD;
"The Great Spirit has made very big&#xD;
spiders in the pountry where Tokeah lived,"&#xD;
raid the old Indian, "and many of them&#xD;
will kill a bird, Thes'e spiders said to the&#xD;
red bird, 'Look, we will let you alone, and&#xD;
ee will not break the peace with you; but&#xD;
you must not tear our nests.' The poor&#xD;
red birds kept in their nests, and waited&#xD;

there fore a long time. Hunger P ove them&#xD;
out of them.   When they stirred, they&#xD;
found all the woods overrun with the nets&#xD;
of the big spiders, and. the poor red birds&#xD;
fell into them; and the big 'spiders sucked'&#xD;
out their blood, and made them (ie a slow&#xD;
death. The whites are the spiders, the red&#xD;
men are the red birds. Their tribes were&#xD;
many; but they are swept from the face of&#xD;
the earth. They died by the-bre-water and&#xD;
the cunning of the whites. Tokeah will go&#xD;
far from them."&#xD;
"That you may do, as I told you," said&#xD;
the general, whose' ire began to increase. f&#xD;
"(The white men will not sow bricrs in your&#xD;
path, whatever your designs may be; but I&#xD;
want you to know that we are both gener-&#xD;
ous in rewarding our friends and have suf-&#xD;
ficient power to punish our enem:es." When&#xD;
he had spoken these words he turned from&#xD;
the old man towards the young chief; and&#xD;
having paused awhile, he said, " y young&#xD;
brother is again going to join his people.&#xD;
He will tell them-how much the chief of'&#xD;
the Whites honors the young warrior who&#xD;
has been just towards his white brethren,&#xD;
and he will brighten the link between:the&#xD;
white and the red men."  He stepped to-&#xD;
wards the table, took a golia meal sus-&#xD;
pended by It silken band, and hung it round&#xD;
the neck :of the young warriors "Take&#xD;
this," said he, "as a token of friendship&#xD;
from the white-chief; and be in future, as&#xD;
you have been hitherto, the friend of the&#xD;
wh4te people; and if you again see a vic-&#xD;
tim oppres ed, then remember the donor,&#xD;
and hasten to his relief."&#xD;
The Indian suered the medal to be hung&#xD;
round his neck; and then laying his left&#xD;
hand on his breast, h'e took witu ls right&#xD;
the hand of the general; and putting it on&#xD;
his forehead, he bowed. He then stepped&#xD;
back. "The chief of the Cumanchees goes&#xD;
on a long path ; and' he will nut see the&#xD;
great white chief any more, of whom the&#xD;
tongue 'of the red man talks as of one of the&#xD;
greatest warriors.  But he will tell his&#xD;

that startled even the tried veterans, " imy&#xD;

must never cross the waters which Waem&#xD;
dalh has made to separate the red from the&#xD;

the Cunmanchees could not save the brethren&#xD;
of the great chief.&#xD;
"Farewell, noble youth !" said the gen-&#xD;
eral, stretching out his hand, which was&#xD;
taken by the young man with marked def-&#xD;
erence.&#xD;
All the officers shook hands with him-&#xD;
and the general, waving his hand to the mi-&#xD;
ko, both chiefs again left the saloon, fol-&#xD;

to their lodgings.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXX.&#xD;
The night passed to both our parties in a&#xD;
state of mind little different from that of a&#xD;
prisoner of war who is on the eve of setting&#xD;
out fur his hoame. The 'Indians looked at&#xD;
the splendid dwelling and entertainment&#xD;
wien the liberality of their white lather&#xD;
had provided for them with a momentary&#xD;
.uriosity, again relapimg into that state of&#xD;
excitement that might he compared to the&#xD;
inquietude with which the king of the Af-&#xD;
ricau deert-is seen pacing up and down his&#xD;
iron cage warily glancing at every opening&#xD;
that could give him a chance to break&#xD;
fourth.&#xD;
Arthur -Graam and Rosa were scarcely&#xD;
less auimted. rherd were many causes&#xD;
that e mitributed to banish sleep from the&#xD;
ecs of theu Englishman. His interview&#xD;
with the general had left a deep impression&#xD;
on his m ud, mixed with a feeling of hum-&#xD;
aleim 1lie. He had no doubt been treated&#xD;
Sin a just and lawful manner ; but at the&#xD;
same tine, it seemed with a coldness, the&#xD;
reumembmance of which still caused a chill-&#xD;
ing sensation in the heart of time chivalrous&#xD;
Eugi;siaan. To this humiliating, at least&#xD;
not very pleasing thought, came the idea o&#xD;
a da ar mather, whose heart might be broken&#xD;
at the loss of her two only children, of his&#xD;
&#xD;
sister, an d then of Gabriella, whose tearful&#xD;
eye betra" d the pang which tore her bosom&#xD;
-R-Ilosa  ,rself, too, of whose ulterior des-&#xD;
tination he was still uncertain. "Will they&#xD;
give her up ?" did he repeatedly ask him-&#xD;
self.  "Will they not force her ba'ek ? And&#xD;
if they dol  " Ilis heart shrank, from fur-&#xD;
ther thoughts.&#xD;
Similar were the fears of Rosa, though&#xD;
her agitation sprung from another source.&#xD;
She loved so deeply ; every pulse throbbed&#xD;
for Arthur; it was her first, her only love;&#xD;
and she gave herself up to the glowing pas-&#xD;
sion in the sweetest anticipation. But ho&#xD;
was, she now felt more than ever, so much&#xD;
above her. He moved so gracefully among&#xD;
the fair Creoles, that he had attracted the&#xD;
eyes of the fairer of the two. Love is sensi-&#xD;
tive; and the long lingering glances of Ga-&#xD;
briella had not escaped her. Her heart&#xD;
saddened at the thought of her own un-&#xD;
worthiness and simplicity. She was but a&#xD;
child of the forest-simple and uneducated.&#xD;
Such and similar fears agitated the poor&#xD;
muiden, and kept her awake through the&#xD;
night. Morning hred not yet dawned when&#xD;
she sprung from her couch and resumed her&#xD;
dress. She paused and listened. No sound&#xD;
was to be heard-all was buried in sleep&#xD;
and silence.  She sat down, and watched&#xD;
another hour; and   now   footsteps were&#xD;
heard. Some one came up stairs.     She&#xD;
opened the door. It was a female servant.&#xD;
"Where is Aytlhur ?" demanded she, with&#xD;
a low whisper, as if afraid of being over-&#xD;
heard.&#xD;
"In his room," answered the girl.&#xD;
" Tell him to come to Rosa; she is&#xD;
waiting for him ?" said the innocent mai-&#xD;
den.&#xD;
The Negro girl shook her head. "A gen.&#xD;
tlemmian," said she, "must not go into a lady's&#xD;
sleeping-room."&#xD;
Poor Rosa blushed deeply.&#xD;
"I will tell Bambo," said the girl; "but&#xD;
I must not go there."&#xD;
She went down, and returned again in a&#xD;
few minutes, saying that the gentleman was&#xD;
dressed, and wished to see her in the draw-&#xD;
ing-room,&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh, lead me there!" she said, tripping&#xD;
after the girl.&#xD;
She entered, when Arthur and the sena-&#xD;
tor walked from the second door into the&#xD;
room,&#xD;
The morning salutations were whispered&#xD;
scarcely audidle. Rosa slipped on a pelisse;&#xD;
and taking the arm of the senator, they&#xD;
went down stairs, followed by a servant.&#xD;
They knew what awaited them, and not a&#xD;
word was spoken. Trlhe streets were desert-&#xD;
ed.s. The pale, flickering light of a not yet&#xD;
extinguished lamp announced the morning\&#xD;
twilight. Scarcely a human form was to&#xD;
be seen, except the sentinels, who paced up&#xD;
and down at their posts. They found a&#xD;
waiter stationed before the public, house,&#xD;
who conducted them into the parlor, where&#xD;
the Indians sat assembled in deep and grave&#xD;
consultation.&#xD;
The young chief rose, and advanced to-&#xD;
wards the entering visitors to receive Rosa,&#xD;
whom he led to the settee close to Tokeah,&#xD;
and pointed silently to two empty chairs.&#xD;
Arthur surveyed for a moment the Apollo-&#xD;
like form of the lofty young Indian-the&#xD;
complete picture of a noble Highland chief,&#xD;
but for his color-and then sat down, got&#xD;
without uneasiness.&#xD;
The old miko had scarcely looked up,&#xD;
and continued in his deep musing. After&#xD;
r        a long pauses he turned his head; and&#xD;
looking round, said, in the Indian tongue,&#xD;
.        "Where is the White Rose, whom Tokeah&#xD;
picked up from among the horses in the&#xD;
woods ? Has she forgotten the beaver-&#xD;
skins which the miko gave to the white&#xD;
trader, that she might drink of his woman's&#xD;
milk, and not wither away for want of&#xD;
food?"&#xD;
Rosa began to look pale at these words.&#xD;
"aTokeah," continued the old man, "took&#xD;
'her into his wigwam, and made her the&#xD;
foremost among the girls of the red men."&#xD;
Again he paused.&#xD;
"Shall the old miko have no daughter?&#xD;
Will the White Rose leave her father, who&#xD;
has given her food, and follow a stranger?&#xD;
Who will cook his venison when he returns&#xD;
A         wrom the hunting-grounds?  Tokeah has ,&#xD;
&#xD;
given the White Rose to a great chief, that&#xD;
the heart.of the old mike may find joy in&#xD;
his children, and that their voices may&#xD;
sweeten his days when he shall be no longer&#xD;
able to hunt the buffalo."&#xD;
"Father !" cxclaimred Rosa, writhing&#xD;
with. agony.&#xD;
"Here is the bravest of the braves,"&#xD;
said the old chief, rising slowly, and with&#xD;
solemnity taking her land, and laying it in&#xD;
that of El Sol.&#xD;
Arthur and the senator stood in mute and&#xD;
dreadful suspense. Without comprehend-&#xD;
ing his words, they understood their mean-&#xD;
ing; yet such was the stern solemnity of&#xD;
the withered, ghastly-looking old man, that&#xD;
they sat rivetted, in breathless' anxiety,&#xD;
without being able to move.&#xD;
El Sol had listened all the while with, a&#xD;
forbearance which, though evidently pain-&#xD;
ful to him, was too essential a part of good-&#xD;
breeding with an Indian not to be strictly&#xD;
observed. He received the, hand of Rosa.&#xD;
Rising at the same time, and turning to the&#xD;
,old mico, he saidin, a low, solemn tone,&#xD;
"Wacondahhas spoken;-h:is voice calls El&#xD;
Sol to the prairie of the Cumanchees. He&#xD;
will find a wife there, as his father did.&#xD;
The sons of El Solshall be wholly Cuman-&#xD;
chees. Never will he lead a wife into his&#xD;
wig vam whose heart is turned to another.&#xD;
El Sol has already stayed too long with the&#xD;
White Rose. He has beheld her-he will&#xD;
never forget her; but he must not look at&#xD;
her any more."&#xD;
He led the maid, in silence, towards Ar-&#xD;
thur, who arose, and grasped her hand.&#xD;
"My young brother," said he, in broken&#xD;
English, "has kept what he has promised&#xD;
to the miko, and El Sol will keep what he&#xD;
has promised to Canondah, his daughter,&#xD;
who is laid low." ;The young chief return-&#xD;
ed again t the settee, and sat down.&#xD;
"Lister, then," resumed the old man, in&#xD;
the Engl'sh language, "that you may re-&#xD;
member the talk of the miko. When the&#xD;
White Rose lay beneath-the horses and their&#xD;
hoofs, on the road that leads from the big&#xD;
village wh.ore we are now through the coun-&#xD;

down.            'r took the rifle and the&#xD;
knife, '.     .-t of the fatal Indian out-&#xD;
&#xD;
floor, and then left the room.&#xD;
When they came down stairs they found&#xD;
two Indians, with the trunk and the packet.&#xD;
The carriage of the senator was at the door.&#xD;
The servants put both articles into it, and&#xD;
it rolled again homewards. The morning&#xD;
had, in the meanwhile, advanced ; and when&#xD;
they entered the drawing-room they found&#xD;
the family assembled. The parting scene,&#xD;
however, had left a deep impression on their&#xD;
minds, and they received the morning coin-&#xD;
pliments in silence. Eleanor tripped round&#xD;
and round, with a face that was a little'&#xD;
soured. Her curiosity had been put to a&#xD;
hard trial, and was, in fact, the only motive&#xD;
of her early rising. Her noisy movements&#xD;
had awakened the whole house-mother,&#xD;
brother, and sister. As soon as she under-&#xD;
stood the principal persons had gain eseap&#xD;
ed without begging her leave, she could keep&#xD;
silence no longer.&#xD;
" Wlre have you been, papa ?" demand-&#xD;
ed Eleanor, a little nettled that they had&#xD;
gone without asking her leave.  "Very&#xD;
soon I shall believe that we arc in an en-&#xD;
chanted castle.  Nothing hat mysteries.&#xD;
Here we are running up stairs and down&#xD;
stairs, and looking and waiting, and you are&#xD;
all over the city.''&#xD;
Rosa flew- on her neck. "Oh! do not be&#xD;
angry. We saw my father."&#xD;
&#xD;
"F lather ?" denuanded Eleanor. " You&#xD;
do not mean the Indian ?"&#xD;
a Yes," replied Rosa.&#xD;
"Oh! do not call that nasty savage&#xD;
father."&#xD;
" That is not the voice of my Eleanor,"&#xD;
said the senator, with rather a sternaeeent.&#xD;
"Few fathers would have done what these&#xD;
Indians did.'&#xD;
He explainedo his family what he had&#xD;
just witnessed.&#xD;
Eleanor had tripped up to the window,.atl&#xD;
saw the trunk and packet carried it) the&#xD;
house. Its extei'ior was too promising nat&#xD;
to acite the curiosity of the merry girl she&#xD;
opened the daar of the saloon, and wnt into&#xD;
the eorridor. The senator cast a siguilicant&#xD;
glance at Arthur.      a&#xD;

The servants brought~both trunk and box&#xD;
into the drawing-room.&#xD;
"Do you like to see Indian= fashions ?"&#xD;
demanded the Creole of his daughter, while&#xD;
the'servant opened it.&#xD;
The girls tripped towards the open trunk,&#xD;
with an awe with which a connoisseur would&#xD;
approach the veiled painting of a} Raphael&#xD;
d'Urbino. Eleanor lifted one of the robes&#xD;
with a sort of respect that extorted from her&#xD;
-father a fit of langhtcr.&#xD;
"For Heaven's sake," exclaimed she,&#xD;
"where does that come from?7"&#xD;
"Not from the Indians, certainly,"' said&#xD;
the planter.&#xD;
"And that.?" taking another,   'But&#xD;
what is this ?" catching up the morocco&#xD;
casket.&#xD;
" Indian beads, in all probability," re-&#xD;
turned the planter.&#xD;
Arthur opened it-a necklace of brilliants,&#xD;
with braclets and ear-rings of sparkling&#xD;
atones, dazzled their eyes, arid attracted&#xD;
oven the attention of the Creole.&#xD;
"They are, indeed, beautiful; worth more&#xD;
than a hundred thousand francs," said he.&#xD;
"See, Eleanor, in what manner the Indians&#xD;
provide for their children."&#xD;
" Oh ! tell me," said the girl, with an air&#xD;
of droll impatience, "where such as these'&#xD;
.are made ?"&#xD;
"In London," replied Arthur, "and 'for&#xD;
mysister."  .&#xD;
"Oh, they will exactly suit Rosar!" ex-&#xD;
elaimed the girl, taking at the same time&#xD;
ithe measureof Rosa. ' Come, now, child!&#xD;
come! we ipust dress you-we have every-&#xD;
thing; c'ne !-come !" and each of them&#xD;
taking hold of Rosa, ran with her to their&#xD;
apartme nt.,&#xD;
When the troublesome spirits were gone,&#xD;
Arthur folded the packet. aThey lcft the&#xD;

O  A  ROSA, THE INDIAN CAP'TVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
his fathers. met on the road that leads&#xD;
through the country of the Choctaws from&#xD;
the big village of the white men, on the&#xD;
endless river, a party of the warriors of the&#xD;
Choctaws of the six villages. In the midst&#xD;
of them were four white men and three&#xD;
white women, one of whom was very young,&#xD;
and very tender, mounted on horses. A&#xD;
fight ensued between the Oconees and the&#xD;
Choctaws, who were at war, and the latter&#xD;
were put to flight. That the, four white&#xD;
men, who had killed many braves, of they&#xD;
Oconees, were caught by them, and scalped,&#xD;
with the women ; none but the child was&#xD;
saved. The clothes of the women were very,&#xD;
fine, says the same manuscript, and they .&#xD;
got for thema-and their beads a great many&#xD;
blankets and gnns. Here the information&#xD;
ceased. There was Uo date, no name what-&#xD;
soever.&#xD;
S'The information," said the senator, "is&#xD;
precious, and may lead to disclosures. But&#xD;
let us see further."&#xD;
'hey now examined the gold chain. It&#xD;
was of Mexican worknanship, and of .ex&#xD;
traordinary fineness. On it hung a medal-&#xD;
lion, on the one side of which was.engraved&#xD;
a coat of arms, surmounted with a coronet&#xD;
--three Saracen heads, with a sabr over&#xD;
their. On the other side were engraved the&#xD;
letters, 6 J. d'A."&#xD;
"This eoat of arms," said the senator,&#xD;
who prided himself not a little on his de-&#xD;
scent from an old French fainily, " this coat.&#xD;
of arms shows clearly an ancient family. I&#xD;
understand something about heraldry. But&#xD;
the medahion is too thick for its small size&#xD;
-it mutst oplen.&#xD;
He tried it on several sides ; at last forc-&#xD;
ing a needle into the narrow edge, it opened,&#xD;
and a genthman in Spanish uniform, with&#xD;
the craos eat the order of Calatrava appeared&#xD;
--bt still no tiunme.&#xD;
"It is the portrait of her father; there is&#xD;

with no better success, "1 have been so    " Who 1" asked both Eleanor and Ga-&#xD;
fortunate c,  find out a person who will briella, in a tone whose vehemence but lit-&#xD;
&#xD;
answer your wishes and ours. Madame&#xD;
Grillard has relatives in Jamaica, and she&#xD;
intended long ago to pay them a visit. I&#xD;
sent yesterday for her, and she is quite w il-&#xD;
ling to accompany you, provided she is per-&#xD;
mitted to do so by the general."&#xD;
'There is no little question about that,"&#xD;
replied the senator.  I am really glad of&#xD;
it. Without female companions, I could&#xD;
not see how you are to take her along with&#xD;
you. Delicacy towards those with whom&#xD;
we are goiug to enter into closer ties, is the&#xD;
laughter of respect, and the mother of hap-&#xD;
piness. 'It will, hwever be necessary to&#xD;
Lay the case before the commander." lie&#xD;
sat down and wrote a few lies, which he&#xD;
gave to a servant. " I am afraid," said the&#xD;
senator, " you will have a hard game wtithj&#xD;
the girls. They are so fond of her, that I&#xD;
ani sure the mere mention of palling will,&#xD;
fall heavy on them--they are just coming."&#xD;
The trio returned with Rosa, again met-&#xD;
ainorphosed.  A  light green riding-dress&#xD;
enclosed her sylph-like form, and was bound&#xD;
round her waist by a girdle, with a gold&#xD;
aigrette. She moved with an easy, grace-&#xD;
ful step, towards Arthur, and looking tim-&#xD;
idly, and yet confidently up toihim, said,&#xD;
"See what my sisters have done with poor&#xD;
Rosa," laying at the same time her hand on&#xD;
his arm.&#xD;
"Pie, for shame!" whispered Eleanor,&#xD;
" You must not do that.&#xD;
" Why not ?" said she, clasping his arm&#xD;
still faster, as if afraili lest he might escape&#xD;
her.&#xD;
" Be a little more distant, a little more&#xD;
proud, and cold. You must by no means&#xD;
show to the lords of the creation, as they&#xD;
call themselves, what is passing in this weak&#xD;
corner," pointing to her heart.&#xD;
" But Rosa cannot conceal what her heart&#xD;
speaks so loudly."&#xD;
. Mistaken child !" said the vivacious&#xD;
girl. "But we will teach you-in six months&#xD;
you will be a proficient." '&#xD;
"But she departs to-day," said the sena-&#xD;
tor.&#xD;
&#xD;
tie concealed their unpleasant sensations.&#xD;
"Rosa-perhaps, in a few hours."&#xD;
''How, paa ?"    said  Eleanor, " yen&#xD;
again jest with your poor girls ; but if ye&#xD;
kiew how you are tormenting us, you would&#xD;
not do it."&#xD;
"I speak truth," said the senator.&#xD;
For a while the girls looked attheir either,&#xD;
then at Rosa, and again at Arthur, with a&#xD;
mien in which the most unpleasant surprise&#xD;
was strongly depicted.&#xD;
And is it really so? And will you, Mr.&#xD;
Graham, leave us, and take Rosa with you? "&#xD;
"I must," said Arthur.  "A dear, and&#xD;
perhaps a heart-broken mother, and my&#xD;
poor sister, demand it iirfperiously."&#xD;
"Oh ! you may go," said Eleanor a little&#xD;
peevishly, " but leave us Rosa-yon cannot&#xD;
take her along with you."&#xD;
All the preparations afead--Madamet&#xD;
Grillard will accompany Rosa " said the&#xD;
father.&#xD;
"Do not leave us, Rosa," begged both&#xD;
girls, each taking her by an arm " reainan&#xD;
with us, Rosa-Arthur will soon return."&#xD;
"Return! and Arthur will go without&#xD;
Rosa," said she, slowly, as if afraid of giv-&#xD;
ing utterance to her fetrs. H1r eye became&#xD;
dim, her whoc 'ountenance hind changed&#xD;
into a deadly paleness. Arthur flew towards&#xD;
her-he placed his aria around her. \&#xD;
" Arthur will not go without Rosa," said&#xD;
he, in a soothing tone  "Nothing shall&#xD;
again separate us."&#xD;
For a moment she looked up to him, asif&#xD;
doubting his words. When, however, his&#xD;
open, confiding eye met hers, she said,&#xD;
" Arthur must not go without Rosa. It&#xD;
would break her heart," laying her hand on&#xD;
her bosom. " Arthur promised her red&#xD;
father to become a brother to her."&#xD;
"It would not do," said the Creole. "It&#xD;
would really break her heart."&#xD;
phe certainty of losing their new friend,&#xD;
and more especially Rosa, whose transcend-&#xD;
ant beauty and harmless innocence hud won&#xD;
the hearts of all the family, threw a gloom&#xD;
over the circle, which soon brought tears&#xD;
&#xD;
ROSA, THE INDIAN CAPTIVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
into the eyes of the girls. The breakfast&#xD;
p passed over in deep silence, as did the fol-&#xD;
lowing hour. It seemed a second to those&#xD;
who wished to prolong it to years.&#xD;
Madame Qrillard now made her, appear-&#xD;
ance. She was an elderly lady, ofthe true&#xD;
French school. She ha.d spent'he greatest&#xD;
part of her life iteducating the children of&#xD;
the wealthier Creoles. She entered her of-&#xD;
lice as duenna almost assoon as she came&#xD;
intothe parlor, by casting a half-forbidding&#xD;
19ok at Rosa, whose hand was: still locked&#xD;
in that of Arthur.&#xD;
. "And so, noon ready 7" demanded the&#xD;
senator.&#xD;
"Happily, II-ept' myself in readiness,"&#xD;
returned the lady, "though it was intended&#xD;
my journey should take another direction."&#xD;
" Ah! I understand-up the Mississippi.&#xD;
I trust the Englishmen will not be so nun-&#xD;
gallant as to plunder our ladies."&#xD;
" The French," said she, 66 are the most&#xD;
gallant people; and-yet     -&#xD;
"True," said the senator.  .&#xD;
'However," exclaimed Eleanor, who had&#xD;
tripped to the window, "you do not intend&#xD;
to take all these movables to Jamaica,&#xD;
madam?"&#xD;
"And where else, miss 7" returned Mad-&#xD;
mne Grillard, sharply.&#xD;
"Come, and see, papa," said the 'droll&#xD;
girl, a tear still twinkling in her eye.&#xD;
A wagon,. loaded with a dozen trunks;&#xD;
and a dozen or more boxes, halted before&#xD;
tih house.&#xD;
"You cannot take these things to Jamai-&#xD;
ea," said the senator, who, notwithstanding&#xD;
his efforts, could not suppress a smile.&#xD;
" They would freight a boat of twenty tons&#xD;
burden. You have but one carriage, and:I&#xD;
a  uncertain whether I shall be allowed&#xD;
to send mine alon."&#xD;
"Charming!" exclaimed Eleanor. "That&#xD;
vill gain us another hour.&#xD;
Bat itpassed as quickly as the former;&#xD;
and Madame Grillard returned sooner than&#xD;
was expected, with her diminished stock-&#xD;
till sufficient, however, to affright a poor&#xD;
gentleman, who was destined to sit in a car-&#xD;
&#xD;
riage, blocked up on every side with such&#xD;
agreeables.&#xD;
The senator now sent word to the adju--&#xD;
taut, at Arthur's request. He soon made&#xD;
his appearance in the carriage of the com-&#xD;
;yander. After having saluted the company,&#xD;
he said to Arthur, " The general has direct-&#xD;
ed me to deliver his .best wishes to Mir.&#xD;
Graham and the young lady fQr a happy&#xD;
journey. He has not the least objection to&#xD;
the departure of Madame Grillard.,&#xD;
The Englishman bowed politely.&#xD;
"I am further, to inform ,Mr. Graham&#xD;
that the commander of the, British fQrces&#xD;
has expressed his desire to have as sog as&#xD;
possible the pleasure of seeing Mr., Gsa-&#xD;
,m. His carriage will be waiting half-&#xD;
way between the two camps."&#xD;
The information was received by the Eng-&#xD;
lishman with another silent bow.&#xD;
The hour of separation was -now come.&#xD;
The regret was unfeigned, and .fell heavy&#xD;
on the whole noble-minded family. It was&#xD;
long before Arthurcould tear himself frpm&#xD;
the almost paternal embrace of the Creole.&#xD;
The parting scene with Madame Gentillon&#xD;
was shorter, but not less affectionate. It&#xD;
was still shorter with Eleanor. He .now&#xD;
took the hand of Gabriella. 6" The inter-&#xD;
est," said he, in a low whisper, "which the&#xD;
noble Miss Gentillon has taken in my fate,&#xD;
at a period when I seemed to deserve it so&#xD;
little, will for ever be one of my sweetest&#xD;
recollections."&#xD;
' Mr. Graham," said Gabriella, with dig-&#xD;
nity, "was unhappy and suffering, and this&#xD;
gave him a   laim to the sympathy of-"&#xD;
The senator now approached, -and cut&#xD;
short a'scene which,'he--felt, could not ut&#xD;
increase the heart-ache of his daughter&#xD;
" Rosa," said Mrs. Gentillon, 'vhile she&#xD;

she was absorbed in thought, and seldom&#xD;
did a word escape him. The young chief&#xD;
bad watched the hapless, lone old man with&#xD;
increasing tenderness. When the canoe had&#xD;
gained the little harbor, where hundreds of&#xD;
vast trees were riding quietly at anchor, the&#xD;
old chief pointed to an immense cotton tree,&#xD;
whose prostrate trunk stretched into the&#xD;
river, with its top buried in the mud. The&#xD;
canoe glided swiftly between the trees, and&#xD;
halted at the point. The old man swung&#xD;
himself on the tree, and crept up the bank,-&#xD;
followed by El Sol and the whole band.&#xD;
When he had reached the bank, he threw&#xD;
himselff on the ground, and lay fora while mo-&#xD;
tionless. The warriors stoodround him, their&#xD;
eyes rivetted on the miko, their heads sunk&#xD;
on their chest, their hands folded together; l&#xD;
but not a sound broke the solemn silence.&#xD;
"Earth !" groaned the old man, still ly-&#xD;
'lug on the ground, and the wyiud raising hist&#xD;
/glossy, silvered hair, "earth, that hast seen&#xD;
the sons of 1im who gave birth to the son 1&#xD;
of the red men, Tokeah greets thee ! Earth ! 1&#xD;
where sheo is mouldering whose breast gave I&#xD;
him suck, Tokeah hails thee ! The master t&#xD;
of thy boundless forests was he born-the °&#xD;
miko of a mighty people was he chosen, as&#xD;
his fathers were. A fugitive, he now stands t&#xD;
on thy last boundary, an outcast from thy&#xD;
bosom, a stranger to thee and to the graves&#xD;
of his fathers. Great Spirit, why hast thou t&#xD;
donie tis .Por countless summers the fathers 1&#xD;

his fathers? Why must the memory of him  v&#xD;
and of his race be tob'n from the earth ? m&#xD;
Speak, - at Spirt! Let Tokeah have a mi&#xD;
sign. that he many know thy will." ti&#xD;
The oldman looked up to the wide vault a&#xD;
of heaven with an imploring eye. It was b&#xD;
overcast. The north blast moaned through&#xD;
the forest. Tokeah's eye became wistful.&#xD;
Again he sank on theground. 4 cold shud, ti&#xD;

muttered he. "'thou lookest daik on To- s&#xD;

The chief now rose with dignity; and&#xD;
motioning to his friends, he said, with a&#xD;
melancholy solemnity, "Seven summers&#xD;
have passed since the msiko of the Oconees&#xD;
turned his back on the land where his fore-&#xD;
fathers dwelt. Two times he has crossed&#xD;

deep into the withered palms. The blood&#xD;
ran from his fingers, the skin was torn from&#xD;
them; but the haste of the Indian increased,&#xD;
as if afraid lest some one might deprive him&#xD;
of his treasure. He bored till he had turned&#xD;
up the whole mass of earth, and collected&#xD;
all the remains of his father. For-the first&#xD;
and only time in his life,'tears gushed from&#xD;
his eyes. He ran towards the grave of his&#xD;
mother. The plough, had here gone deeper.&#xD;
Only a few handfuls of earth covered her:&#xD;
bones. With unutterable grief, he added&#xD;
her remai m to those of his father. The&#xD;
moon poured 'her bright silvery light on the&#xD;
savage as he lay on the ground before the&#xD;
cofil. "Spirit. of my father 1" groaned he,-&#xD;
"thou hast spoken true. The beasts of the&#xD;
white men have passed over thy bones-&#xD;
they have defaced thy grave. Look down&#xD;
from thy abode, and behold how thy child&#xD;
has done what thou' hast bidden him. He&#xD;
will take them  now where no despiteful&#xD;
hand shall uplift them. He will seek for&#xD;
them a place where his own bones shall&#xD;
rest. He will bury them among the people&#xD;
who will revenge thee on thy nefarious inL&#xD;
traders. Thou shalt look with joy on thy&#xD;
children, and glory in their deeds. But thy&#xD;
son is like an aged oak-the blast has&#xD;
withered his strength-the storm has shiv-&#xD;

dren are his people. Spirit of my father, if&#xD;
thou beholdest the face of the Great Spirit,&#xD;
petition him for thy son and his children."&#xD;
(The barking was again heard.)  "I hear&#xD;
the sounds of the forerunner of the enemies&#xD;
of my race.   Farewell, my native land !&#xD;
Farewell, trees, in whose shade Tokeah has&#xD;
so often taken the cool mid-day breeze after&#xD;

waters he has so many times refreshed his&#xD;
limbs, and where he first paddled the canoe !&#xD;
Farewell, hills, on which his father taught&#xD;
him to send the quick arrow !"&#xD;
The moon 'poured once more her light&#xD;
from the flying clouds, and the barking was&#xD;
heard for the third time.&#xD;

The chief now arose; and laying the cof-&#xD;
fin softly on his shoulders, as if afraid to&#xD;
disturb the remains, he threw the thong&#xD;
over his neck, and hastened back to the&#xD;
Cumanchees. "The spirit of my father has&#xD;

"Then let us go on our home-path," re-&#xD;
turned the chief; "and the Great Spirit will&#xD;

Again they crossed the , Mississippi, and&#xD;
entered the mouth of the Red Rive'. Ten&#xD;
more days had now passed. They had long&#xD;
ago left the swampy regions of the Missis-&#xD;

high plains that separate the.Arkansas from&#xD;

the snow- clad tops of the Oyask Mountsins,&#xD;

swell towards the Rocky Mountains.'&#xD;
El Sol pointed silently to the bright aerial&#xD;
tints with which these outposts of the&#xD;
mighty ridges were crowned.   "'Behind&#xD;

his rifle ; his men followed him. They had&#xD;
scarcely entered the canoe, their horses&#xD;
awitnining behind, when the quick .report of&#xD;
rifles was heard-accompanied by a shower&#xD;
of arrows.&#xD;
"Will my son promise the miko to be a&#xD;
kind father to the Oconees ?" said Tokeah,&#xD;
with a hollow voice, single balls still whist-&#xD;

into a yell of the wildest despair. El 'Sol&#xD;
seized the arms of the old man. His mands&#xD;
&#xD;
:1&#xD;
&#xD;
still grasped the'coffln, whieg reposed on&#xD;
his knees; but his frame was relaxed. A&#xD;
ball had entered his breast, and life was&#xD;
gone. The young chief threw himself over&#xD;
the corpse in mute horror. A cold shudder&#xD;
passed over him. The canoe had long been&#xD;
made fast before' he woke from his stupor;&#xD;
when at last' the soft touch of his Cuinan/&#xD;
ehees made him aware of the danger, he&#xD;
toook the corpse, and bearing it to the shore,&#xD;
seated it before him  on horseback.  His&#xD;
men, after having destroyed the canoe, fol-&#xD;
lowed, and they then-moved on-towards the&#xD;
village of the Pawnees, which they entered&#xD;
on the following day, amidst the appalling&#xD;
sounds of the death song, with the remains&#xD;
of the lastof the mikos of the Qconees,&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXII&#xD;
Years elapsed after these events. It was&#xD;
on a serene evening.   The setting  sun&#xD;
was shedding his last rays through the yelp&#xD;
low tinted cotton and banana trees with&#xD;
which the dark green alleys of pruned coffee&#xD;
shrubs, that spread round Graham's seat&#xD;
were studded, 'Gradually their lengthened&#xD;
shadows were losing' themselves in the con-&#xD;
fused colorlessiues of twilight. The dis-&#xD;
tant hills still gleamed in a garish sunshine.&#xD;
The evening breeze stole fresher and fresher&#xD;
from the sea shore. The last sound of the&#xD;
negro's song had died away. Only the low&#xD;
notes of a straggling humming-bird about .&#xD;
the flower-beds, or the merry chattering of&#xD;
a parrot in the cocoa trees were heard. All&#xD;
breathed peace and silence.&#xD;
On he piazza of a magnificent mansion&#xD;
sat Sir Arthur, and upon his right his beau-&#xD;
tiful wife Rosa, whom we now introduce to&#xD;
our'readers as lady Graham.f 'A child, love-&#xD;
ly as a seraph, played in her arms. From&#xD;
time to time, the eyes of the happy couple&#xD;
wandered from their own group to the de-&#xD;
lightful scenery that lay around them.&#xD;
"A delicious evening," said Rosa-" I&#xD;
think we are about to receive a visit," turn-&#xD;

"I prsume not," replied her husband.&#xD;
"They come from Kingston. It is too soon&#xD;
-I hope they will give us at least time to&#xD;
settle after our passage. I am so estranged&#xD;
from my second home, after a two years' ab-&#xD;
sence, Mother," said he, addressing an el-&#xD;
derly lady, tvho was stepping out of the sa-&#xD;
loon with letters in both hands. "vyou would&#xD;
not have seen us soon, had it not been for&#xD;
Rosa,"&#xD;
"Then I have to thank you, my darling,&#xD;
for this agreeable surprise," returned the old&#xD;
lady, joining, at thu same time, the happy&#xD;
party.&#xD;
" We wanted nothing to complete our&#xD;
harpiness, but our dear mother and-"&#xD;

"I fear, my poor child, you had to con-&#xD;
tend against two powerful antagonists. From&#xD;
the letters I received4before your arrival, I&#xD;
was really afraid your uncle would not per-&#xD;
mit you to depart as soon, and Arthur, I&#xD;
know, is inseparable from old England."&#xD;
"Just the contrary !" exclaimed the young&#xD;
baronet, with a triumphant air. " Not a&#xD;
sound escaped her, and if I myself were not&#xD;
so deep a soul-reader, we might still be at&#xD;
Ludlam Castle."&#xD;

that Rosa should be found acceptable toom&#xD;
relations. . Your reception has exceeded my&#xD;
most sanguine hopes. I must confess I was&#xD;
rather anxious, as your uncle is so particu-&#xD;
lar, and his prompt demand to see you he-&#xD;
fore your nuptials made me tremble a little.&#xD;
Thanks to Providence, who has disposed it&#xD;
s well! You are, perhaps, the only being&#xD;
of whom your uncle is fond."&#xD;
"He wts really displeased at our depart-&#xD;
ure," said Sir Arthur, " and grew so strange&#xD;
and mysterious when we took leave of him.&#xD;
But what is the most astonishing, he came&#xD;
the day afterwards to Ludlam Castle to see&#xD;
Rosa once more-gout, and a host of in-&#xD;
firmities, notwithstanding."&#xD;
"He desires your departure from Jamai-&#xD;

vided for your passage in one of his Ma-&#xD;

letters come from? they have been here&#xD;

hin a couple of letters, and taking from&#xD;
Rosa's arm the child, which she caressed&#xD;
with motherly tenderness.&#xD;
"Oh, ftom our dear friend Gentillon,"&#xD;
said Sir Arthur.&#xD;

A short conversation ensued between the&#xD;
two strangers ; marked, however, by a sub-&#xD;
misivo tonz on the part of him who bad&#xD;
hitert' spoken. Arthur felt a little net-&#xD;
tIed, to have addressed himself, as he found,&#xD;
to a  ec'ndary personage.  A complying&#xD;
sign on the part of the one who had hitherto&#xD;
been silent, brought the speaker and two&#xD;
servants in a moment from their seats. The&#xD;
humble alacrity with which they hurried to&#xD;
let down the steps, and to lift the gentleman&#xD;
out of the carriage, bespoke a man of rank.&#xD;

de Montgornez, is pleased to accept of Sir&#xD;
Arthur Graham's hospitable invitation,"&#xD;
said the principal person, with loftiness and&#xD;
a low bow; which latter, however, was&#xD;
changed into an obeisance towards the lady&#xD;
&#xD;
who now entered the gate.                 "Chevalier d'Aranza," said the latter,&#xD;

assembly, with a slight but respectful glance.  "Silva Valdes plantations," interjected&#xD;
The silvery voice of Lady Rosa, who bade the old lady, "are said to be among the&#xD;

but without betraying the least emotion, he Colonel Howard and his wife entered, end&#xD;
turned again to the young baronet, to whom shortly afterwards the chevalier, dressed for&#xD;

"The house of Aranza has for more than&#xD;
a century been in the possession of the Silya&#xD;
Valdes plantations."&#xD;
"The Chevalier d'Aranza," interjeeted,&#xD;
the lady mother, "does not intend to reach&#xD;
Silva Valdes plantations to-night ?-they&#xD;
are seventy miles from Kingston." #&#xD;
"I am rather afraid I shall not be able&#xD;
to reach them," returned the nobleman.&#xD;
" If Chevalier d'Aranza will honor our&#xD;
house with his presence, it will give us great&#xD;
pleasure," said the young baronet.&#xD;

the chevalier.&#xD;

Sir Arthur.&#xD;
"It is but seldom  that the Chevalier&#xD;

members of the party proceeded into the&#xD;
dining-room.-&#xD;
"You will'find your 'neighborhood very&#xD;
much improved," said the old lady to the&#xD;
chevalier, after the first arrangements for&#xD;
the dinner were over. "From what I un-&#xD;
derstand, the Langdales, you know," inter d&#xD;
jected she, with a glance at Arthur, "and&#xD;
Colonel Howard, hive purchased there.&#xD;
Silva Valdez plantations are in a most flour-&#xD;

possessions whose proprietors are absent."&#xD;
The chevalier bowed, but gave no answer.&#xD;
"Is it long since you have been from Ja-&#xD;

shorter tone, doubtless displeased at his. si-'&#xD;

"And have you not, during the whole&#xD;
time, seen your plantations ?"&#xD;
"The service due to myovereign, or&#xD;
rather the disobedience of his children, left&#xD;
me but little time to think of my own af-&#xD;

smile,  were even my servants less faithful,&#xD;
there are certain cases where one becomes&#xD;
indifferent towards objects that have only&#xD;
these charms, when we can divide them with'&#xD;
others ."&#xD;
"Not married, then ?" said the old lady,1&#xD;
with an accent which betrayed that bachet&#xD;
ors stood not very high in her opinion.&#xD;
The chevalier raised his eye in a manner l&#xD;
which seemed to indicate that he was but1&#xD;
little accustomed to similar investigations.&#xD;
Instautly, however, he resumed his former t&#xD;
melancholy reserve.&#xD;
" I was, madam," replied he--his eye fell&#xD;
involuntarily upon Rosa.Ef&#xD;
There is, in a questioning of this kind,Yf&#xD;
a feeling of iferiority, extremely pleasant a&#xD;
to a refined mi'.d. Lady Graham begar4 to e&#xD;
be aware how little her short acquaintance f&#xD;
gave her clbim to a confidence on the part C&#xD;
of her guest, that might open a barbed&#xD;
wound. A long pause ensued.             s&#xD;

followed his example. "May they regain&#xD;
that oyal liberty which they have once en-&#xD;
joyed, and which made the Spanish mon-&#xD;
archy happy and respected ih the eyei of&#xD;
the world."&#xD;
A bitter smile passed across the county.&#xD;
nance of the nobleman. "The Chevalier&#xD;
d'Aranza," said he, rising at the same time,&#xD;
"is infinitely obliged to fir Arthur and Lady&#xD;
Grahamn for the interest they take in the af-&#xD;
fairs of his country. The ladies !" said ho&#xD;
giving a toast in his turn.&#xD;
"And Old England !" subjoined Colonel&#xD;
Howard.&#xD;
"And our friends in Louisiana !" con.&#xD;
eluded Sir Arthur.&#xD;
"Louisiana?" demanded the nobleman,&#xD;
with a vivacity that contrasted too strongly&#xD;
with his reserve not to excite the attention&#xD;
of the family. "Has Sir Arthur been in&#xD;
that country?"&#xD;
"It has fallen to my lot," replied the bar..&#xD;
onet, "to be thrown into those muddy re-&#xD;
gions, and to be lost there. I may say&#xD;
with truth, that I. have served my appren-&#xD;
ticesaip to the Yankees."&#xD;
"i hope it had a happy result," said the&#xD;
nobleman.   "The face of the country,"&#xD;
added he, without waiting for the baronet's&#xD;
reply, "is very much changed since it came&#xD;
under the dominion of the United States, I&#xD;
understand. I am afraid none of the fami.&#xD;
lies have remained who resided there when&#xD;
I saw it last."&#xD;
"! Pardon me, chevalier, but how long is&#xD;
that ?"&#xD;
"Nearly nineteen years."&#xD;
"Then; chevalier, you would, find it dif-&#xD;
icult to recognize .this cuntry. Even in&#xD;
our years it has changed very much. My&#xD;
acquaintance is very limited ; should, how-&#xD;

We need iot say a word to the readers of the WzEK HYlRA 1a in praise of this&#xD;
capital story of American life. They aie all familiar with it already, in the form&#xD;
under which it first appeared as a prizedtale, and they will now gladly welcome it&#xD;
again in its attractive book form. Not only is the plo ingenious and fall of thril-&#xD;
hag interest, but the author has know so well the ark of concealing art, as to give&#xD;
the whole a charm of iiaturalness and reality. The characters are real and alive.&#xD;
We recognize them at a glance as just such persons as "live and move and have&#xD;
their being" in actual American Society. In fine, aside from  the romantic story&#xD;
which is lit up by Laura's "Diamond Cross," we find that neither Dickens nor Mrs.&#xD;
Beecher Stowe,,nor even De Tocqueville has gLven a better an  more truthful picture&#xD;
of American scenery, life, manners and ideas than is presented in this new Novel of&#xD;
