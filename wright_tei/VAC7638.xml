THE growing taste for works of this kind-works intended to promote temperance and virtue, to lift up the lowly, to expose to open day the hidden effects produced by Rum, to give narratives of misery suffered by the poor in this city- has induced the Publishers to offer liberal inducements to the author to use his powerful pen, and words of fire, to depict his "Life Scenes," and embody them in a volume, which, we are satisfied, will prove one of the most acceptable to the moral portion of the community, ever published. It is a work of high tone, that must do good. The peculiar style of the author is as original as the tales of truth which he narrates. It is-unlike that of any other author, and every page is full of fresh interest and thrilling narrative. As a temperance tale, it has no equal. As such, we hope it may prove but the commencement of a series. As an expos6 of life among the poor in this- city, it will be read with deep and abiding interest, in all parts of this country. It is a work for the fireside of every family; a book that commends itself to the heart. No one who has read tre "HOT CORN STORIES," as they appeared in the Tribune, but will rejoice to have the oppor- tunity to possess them, and many more 'like them, all com- plete and connected, inone handsome volume, such as ie now offer. To a moral and religious public; to all who would promote  &#xD;<pb n="vi-vii" xml:id="VAC7638-00000005"/> VI          INTRODUCTION. temperance; to all who would rather see virtue than vice abound; to all who have a heart to feel for other's woes; to all who would have their hearts touched with sympathy for the afflictions of their fellow creatures, "Life Scenes," as depicted in this volume, are respectfully commended, by THE PUBLISHERS.   AUTHOR'S PREFACE. "Or, pshaw," says pretty Miss Impulsive, "I hate pre- faces." So do I. Nobody reads them; that is, nobody but a few -old fellows with spectacles. I would not write one, only that some folks think a book looks not well without. Well, then, I have written a great deal- in my life-travels, tales,. songs, temperance stories; some politics, a good -deal upon agriculture, much truth, and some fiction, always in the newspapers, never before in a book. I know that many, very many, havle read what I have written with pleasure, or else "this world is awfully given to lying," for they have said so. Will they read my book? That we shall see. If they do, they must not criticise too closely. Remember that some of the most thrilling sketches were written amid the daily scenes and avocations of 'a city editor's office, for the. paper in which they first appeared, without any thought or design on the part of the author of making a book:;--that was the thought of thie publishers. They read the first sketches, and judged, we hope rightly, if enlarged and embodied in a neat volume, it would be appreciated as one of the best efforts, in this book-making age, to do'igood. If they have judged rightly,-if it does have that effect,-- if the public do appreciate the volume as they often have my fugitive effusions,-then shall I be rewarded, and they may rest assured, whenever they buy a volume, that a portion of the purchase money will go to ameliorate the condition of *  - *(vii ) -i  &#xD;<pb n="viii-9 (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC7638-00000006"/> Viii       AUTHOR S PREFACE. the poor, such as you will become acquainted with, if you follow me in my walks through the city, as depicted in this volume, which I offer most hopingly to all who do not know, and most trustingly to all who do know him, who has so often signed himself Your old friend, SOLON ROBINSON.

"FE SCENES iN NEW     YORK ILLUSTRATED. CHAPTER I. OUR TITLE.--THE STORY. "How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature." IT is a queer title for a book; what can it mean 2" is the exclamation of those who open it for the first time.  t Visit this city-walk with me from nine o'clock till mid- w night, through the streets of New York, in the month of August, then read'the first interview of the author with little , Katy, the Hot Corn girl, and the story of her life, and -you  will not ask, "What does it mean?" But you may ask, what does it mean that I see so many squalid-looking women, so many tender children, so many boys, who with well directed labor might work their way to fortune; or crippled men, sitting upon the stone steps along the street crying, "Hot corn! here's your nice hot corn-smoking hot, smoking hot, just from the pot!" Your heart, if it has not grown callous, will be pained as mine has been at the sights of ,  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7638-00000009"/> l * "          HOT CORN. misery you will meet with, and you will then exclaim, "What does it mean that I see these things in the very heart'of this great commercial city, where wealth, luxury, extravagance, all abound in such profusion? Surely the condition of the people, the ways and wapts of the poor, cannot be known, or they would be improved. Why does not somebody write a book illustrating these "Life Scenes in New York," whose every page shall be a. cry, startling as this of 'Hot corn, hot,.- corn!' now pealing in the midnight air ." So thought I; and so straightway set about the work, with ample material at hand, and more accumulating at every step. In writing a book, the first thought of the author is, what shall be my title  What better could I, have than HOT CORN, since that was the inciting cry that waked my -pen to action, to paint these life scenes in vivid pictures, for r the 'world to look at and improve? If, in my daily walks and midnight rambles, I have seen revolting sights, the details of which are harrowing to your soul as you read, so much the more need that they be opened to your view. Wounds must be seen to be healed. Old sores are often pronounced incurable, simply because they are old. First, strip off their dirty covering, then probe and wash, and then apply the healing balsam. If not already gan- grened from long neglect, you may save the patient's life, and at -all events, ease his suffering, and smooth his road to the grave. Be mine the task to strip and expose, and yours to wash and heal. *  *  i^   *  . .    "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.         1  o Of just such life scenes as I depict, there are enough tran- spiring every night to fill a volume. Come, walk with me, of an August evening, from the Bat- "tery to Union Square, and you shall see all the characters of a romance. 'Tis concert night at Castle Garden. 'Stand here a short halfhour, and look at the gay and smiling throng. There is material for many a tale. Three thousand robbts of fine cloth, silks, gauzey:and lace, pass the Battery gates in one night, fluttering to the open sea breeze,: without one thought from those who wear them for the poor little girl that sits shivering by the path, crying hot corn, or vainly striving to beg one penny from the overflowing purses that freely give dollars for amusement, and less than nothing to misery, or for its annihilation. Little do they think that this child has a mother at home, who once counted one in just sucha thoughtless throng. Here might a chapter be written, but let us on; we shall find plenty of subjects. If we stop to write the history of that little girl and her mother, we shall fill our book before - we start. The Philadelphia boat has just landed her passengers, at Pier No. 1., North River, and the crowd are coming up Bat. '"--tery Place.  Here is a  picture of American: character. Every one is pushing forward as though there was but one bed left in the city, and to obtain that he intended to outstride and overreach all his fellow travellers. Take care, little hot corn girl, or you will be run over, and your store trampled under- * X  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7638-00000010"/> 106          HOT CORN. foot. Bitter- tears for your loss will run down your hollow cheeks, but they will- gain you no sympathy. The only answer that you will get, will be, "Why didn't you get out of the way, you little dirty brat-good enough for you." Yes, good enough for you, that you -have lost your entire stock of merchandize; what business had you in the way of com- merce, or path of pleasure? "But, sir,"' says benevolence in a drab bonnet, " you have hurt the child." "What if I have? she has} no business in the'way. She is nothing but a hot corn girl; they are no better than beggars and often are little thieves. Why don't she stay at home?" Sure enough. Simply because necessity or cruelty drives her into the street. Now your cruelty will drive her home to be beaten by a drunken father, for, your act of wanton careless- ness. ; Stand aside, my little sufferer, or you will be run over again. Here comes a little dark skinned, black-eyed, black-haired man, with life and death in his very step. What magic power impels him forward. He is a Jew-a dealer in second-hand clothes. Surely his business cannot be so important that he need to upset little children, or step on the gouty toes of slow-going old gentlemen, in his hurry to get forward.                  - It is Friday night, his Sabbath has already commenced, he can do no business--make no monish--to-night.

The side-walks are crowded, and the street between the curb-stones full of great lumbering omnibuses and carriages, that go up and down all night for hire; but there is a melancholy stillness in all the houses where wealth and fashion, in our young days, lived in lamp-lighted parlors, and diamonds flashed down upon the listener to music which had its home in these gay dwellings, where happy looking faces were seen through open windows. Iron shutters close them now, and commerce wears a dark flwn by gas light. On the right is Wall street, where foirtnes are made and lost as by the turn of a card, or rattle of a dice box.

And a pale-faced little girl sits upon the steps of the Bank of the Republic, adding to  that constant cry, "Hot corn! Hot corn!" Now here comes the Cerberus of this money palace. What possible harm to his treasures, can this little poverty-clad girl and her sickly looking little beggar boy brother do, sitting here upon the cold grey, stone steps, with an appealing look to every passer- by to give a penny or buy an ear of corn.

It is pain, the worst of pain; it comes from a blow upon the heart; worse than that, i. this case, for the man is her husband.

Her rent was coming due, and every shilling looked to her of tenfold value to-night. Her children are in the street, filling the night air with an appealing. cry, "Hot corn, hot corn, who'll buy my nice hot corn?" her husband was begging for one more shilling to waste-worse than waste-to close an ill-spent day.  Oh, what a contrast between this and their wedding day! She resisted his -importunity until he found 'twas no avail, and then he swore he would upset her little store in the gut- ter, if she did not give him the money. What could she do? She would not call an officer to take him awav. No, she could not do that, he  was her husband.  She could not resist him, could not have an altercation in the street, that would draw an idle crowd  around her, spoil her trade, and worse than that, let the world know that this bloated, ill- looking, miserable re'mnant of a  man, was- her husband. Shame did what persuasion or fear could not: she gave him the shilling, and he started to cross the crowded street. He heeded little of danger-he had often crossed when more drunk than now-he heeded not the tripartite crush of car- riages coming up and going down these streets, all meeting in a sort of vortex at that point. - e 'heard, or heeded not, the drivers, "hi, hi, hi, get out of the way, you drunken son of a --" and down he went among the horses' clattering feet,   upon the slippery stones, and the wheels passed over him, crushing bones-human bones, and mangling flesh, and mix- ing human blood with street dirt. The omnibuses turned aside, the passengers shuddered as the poor wretch was lifted up, covered with blood and dirt, and inquired, "Is he dead?" the drivers looked down coolly from their high seats, with a consoling remark, that, "it's nothing but a drunken man," yet, that drunken man was that woman's husband; him who, fourteen years ago, walked the streets. as well dressed, as proud, as sober as any in the crowd who now gaze carelessly upon his bruised form, and hear the remark, that he, "is nothing but a drunken man." Fourteen years ago-yes, this very night--that woman walked this very street, arm in arm, with that man, and heard him, for the first time, call her wife. It was a happy time then, and " all was merry as the marriage bell." Lit- tle thought they then--less thought they a year afterwards, while rocking the cradle in their own happy home, that the time would come when he would raise his hand in anger to strike that loving wife, or that child would be. driven, with kicks and curses, into the streets, or that he would lie bleeding upon the pavement -he had so often and so proudly trod before, a poor mangled drunkard.

How his city friends would have laughed at him if they had heard the question-"Have you got a baby '" No he had got no baby, yet he was a man full forty years of age, and looked as though he might have been a father, and so thought the little girl. Yet he had no baby. Why? He was a bache- lor! So; he had to answer, 4 no, my pretty miss, I have got no baby." "Oh la, haven't you? Well we have. We have got a baby at our house!!" This was not interesting to a bachelor.

Husband was a sweet word once; it is a bitter one now; yet it must be spoken, for they are about to bear him away to the hospital. Whether dead or alive she knows not, and she rushes madly forward, seizing the policeman, with a cry of, "No, no; not there, not there; take him home, I will take care of him-nobody can take care of him so well as I can. Oh, let me take him home! Do let me take him home." What could she do with him in her one room, the home of herself and children. She could not stay to nurse him day after day, for then her trade would be lost; somebody else would take her standl; there would be no income, all would be outgo, and all would soon be exhausted; nothing to buy bread, nothing to pay rent, and then out must go the whole, sick or well; they must go in the street if they fail to meet that dreaded periodical-the rent day.

She did not think of the blows, the kicks, and cuffs, and curses, received from him during long bitter years, for they were given by-not by him-not by her husband-but by the demon in him-the devil engendered by rum. She thought nothing of the cruel neglect and poverty and suffering of herself and children, for that was a sequence of the other. She did think of this night, fourteen years ago. She did think of the night when this girl, now clinging to her dress and convulsively crying, "Mother, is he dead," was born, for then she was a happy wife and mother. Then that father took that child in his arms and. kissed and blessed it-then he took her in his arms and kissed and loved her, and called her his dear wife.

Hadl the husband been what he was when that girl was born, the heart of many a wife would give the ready answer. She looked upon her and remembered  the time when she first heard these words, "Have you got a baby?" She looked upon her, and all intervening time faded  from memory, and she thought and felt as she would have felt if he had been struck down that night. She tears herself away from the grasp of the little girl, telling her to pick up the apples and go home, she must go with father. Another hand clings to her dress, and looks up with such  an appealing look and says:- "Don't go, mother; they will take care of father. Don't  leave us.'

The girl, in her father's drunken days, had been one of Sally's street companions; they had begged, and stole, and peddled hot corn and pea-nuts together. But Sally knew her not. How could she? Then she was, ragged and dirty, far worse  than Sally; her parents were far poorer, and lived in a worse  room, one of the worst in Centre street, and both of them were great drunkards, and she was, so everybody said, the worse child that ever run unhung." How could she know the well behaved, nice looking young  lady, walking by her side. But she did know that she spoke kind words in a sweet tone, and her heart was touched, and she went on with a light step. That blanket wrapped a, happier heart that night, than ever fluttered under the silk dress of her former playmate, Julia Antrim.  They went on; the old man gave his arm to the widow and led the little boy; the daughter walked with Sally. They venter the front door of a good house-when did either ever enter the front door before-up one flight of clean stairs, and there is their home, a room, and two bed-rooms, and kitchen; small to be sure, but a most comfortable home, for the old man and his daughter. He was a carpenter, and made from  a dollar and a half to two dollars a day; she was a stock- maker, and could earn from three to five dollars a week, enough to pay nearly all expenses.

"So I told him, and that seemed to quiet him. And then I begged him to forgive me for what I had done towards making him a drunkard.

And he looked around proudly upon the comforts of this home, and contrasted them )ith the miseries of that. Now Margaret-Mag or Slaggie, no longer-began to " fly around." Breakfast was to be got, and what was much more difficult, a full-sized woman, a half-grown girl, and a quarter- grown boy, were to be clothed. How was it to be done? One of her dresses, "with a tuck,"--tucks are fashionable in these days--was soon made to fit Sally. The father said, he would go out and get some clothes for Mrs. Eaton and little Willie, for, thank God, he was able to do it, for what he saved by soberness, not only enabled him to live and clothe himself, but to fulfil that best of all Christian injunctions, to be kind to the widows and fatherless, and he did not know of any that he was under more obligations to than the wife and chil- dren of Bill Eaton, and, God willing, he was going to clothe them; and then he was going to go with them to Mr. Pease, the man that had been the means of reclaiming him, and get them a home in -the House of Industry, until they could find some other one, or a way to earn a living.

Who could it be . Margaret ran down to see. A boy from a second-hand clothing store, entered with a large bundle. "I wants to know as how if the woman that was burnt out is here " " "Yes." "And a little boy and gal " "Yes. " "This is the place then. Are you the gal what was at the fire and said, come with us? '" ' Yes, why do you ask that?" "'Cause the gentleman told me to ask, and when I was sure I was right, to give the gal these three gold pieces, one for each word, and the bundle of clothes and the letter to the woman. That's all.

One contained full suits for the mother, daughter, and little boy, all black--the other was a letter to Mr. Pease. a Can this be the work of man?" said Mrs. Eaton; " who knew, who could know, that I must wear the widow's weeds, so soon ."

"Here's your nice Hot Corn, smoking hot, smoking hot, just from the pot!"Hour after hour one evening, as I sat over the desk, tItis cry came up in a soft, plaintive voice, under my window, which told me of one of the ways of the poor to eke out means of subsistence in this over-burdened, ill-fed, and worse-lodged home of misery-of so many without means, who are constantly crowding into the dirtiest purlieus of this notoriously dirty city, where they are exposed to the daily chance of death from some sudden outhreaking epi- demic like that now desolating the same kind of streets in New Orleans, and swallowing up its thousands of victims from the same class of poverty-stricken, uncomfortably-pro- vided for human beings, who know not how, or have not the power, to flee to the healthy hills and green fields of the country. Here they live-barely live-Z-in holes almost as hot as the hot corn, the cry of which rung in my ears from dark till midnight. *. This chapter was published under the simple title of "Hot Corn," among the "City Items7" of the New York Daily Tribune, August 5, 1853. It is but slightly altered fromn the original text.   "FE SCENES  N- NEW YORK.       45 Hot corn! hot corn! here's your nice hot corn," rose up in a faint, child like voice, which seemed to have beefi aroused by the sound of my step as I was about entering the Park, while the city clock told the hour when ghosts go forth upon their midnight rambles. I started, as though a spirit had given me a rap, for the sound seemed to come out of onee of the iron posts which stand as' sentinels over the main entrance, forbidding all vehicles to enter, unless the driver takes the trouble to pull up and tumble out of the way one of the aforesaid posts, which is not often done, because one of them, often, if not always,. is out of its place, giving free ingress to the court-yard, or livery stable grounds of the City Hall, which, in consideration of the growth of a few misera- ble dusty brown -trees and doubtful colored grass-patches, we call "the Park." Looking over the post I discovered the owner of the hot corn cry, in the person of an emaciated little girl about twelve years old, whose dirty shawl was nearly the color of the rusty iron, and whose face, hands, and feet, naturally white and delicate, were grimmed with dirt until nearly of the same color.  There were two white streaks running down. from the soft blue eyes, that told of the hot scalding tears that were coursing their way over that naturally beautiful face. "Some corn, sir," lisped the little sufferer, as she saw I had stopped to look at her, hardly daring to speak to one who did not address her in rough tones of command, such as " give me some corn, you little wolfs whelp," or a name still more  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7638-00000026"/> "          HOT CORN. opprobrious both to herself and mother. Seeing I had no look of contempt for her, she said, piteously,. " please buy some corn, sir." "No, my dear, I do not wish any; it is not very healthy in such warm weather as this, and especially so late at night." ' "Oh dear, then, what shall I do?" "Why, go home. It is past midnight, and such little girls( as you ought not to be in the streets of this bad city at this time of night." "I can't go home-and I am so tired and sleepy. Oh dear!" "Cannot go home. Why not?" "Oh, sir, my mother will whip me if I go home without selling all my- corn. Oh, sir, do buy one ear, and then I shall have only two left, and I am' sure she might let little Sis and me eat them, for I have not had anything to eat since morning, only one apple the man gave me, and part of one he threw away. I could have stole a turnip at the grocery when I went to get-to get something in the pitcher for mother, but I dared not. I did use to steal, but Mr. Pease says it is naughty to steal, and I don't want to be naughty, indeed I don't; and I don't want to be a bad girl, like Lizzy Smith, and she is only two years older than me, if she does dress fine; 'cause Mr. Pease says she will be just like old drunken Kate, one of these days. Oh dear! now there goes a man, and I did not cry hot corn, what shall I do?" "Do! There, that is what you shall do," as I dashed the corn in the gutter. "Go home; tell your mother you have sold it all, and here is the money."   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.        47 "Wont that be a lie, sir? Mr. Pease says we must not tell lies." "No, my dear, that wont be a lie, because I have bought it and thrown it away, instead of eating it." "But, sir, may I eat it then, if you don't want it .?" "No, it is not good for you; good bread is better, and here is a sixpence to buy a loaf, and here is another to buy some nice cakes for you. Now that is your money; don't give it to your mother, and don't stay out so late again. Go home earlier and tell your mother you cannot sell-all your corn and you cannot keep awake, and if she is a good mother she won't whip you." "Oh, sir, she is a good mother sometimes. But I am sure the grocery man at the corner is not a good man, or he would not sell my mother rum, when he knows--for Mr Pease told him so--that we poor children are starving." Oh, I wish all the men were good men like him, and then my mother would not drink that nasty liquor, and beat and starve us, 'cause there would be nobody to sell her any-and then we should have plenty to eat." Away she ran down the street towards that reeking centre of filth, poverty and misery, the noted Five Points of New York. As I plodded up Broadway, looking in here and there upon the palatial splendors of metropolitan " saloons"-I think that is the word for fashionable upper class grog-shops-I almost involuntarily cried, " hot corn," as I saw the hot spirit of that grain, under the various guises of" pure gin"--" old rum"-  &#xD;<pb n="48 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7638-00000027"/> 48           HOT CORN. pale brandy "-" pure  port"-"Heidsick "-or "Lager- bier"-poured down the throats of men-and ah! yes, of women, too, whose daughters may some day sit, at midnight, upon the cold curbstone, crying "Hot corn," to gain a penny for the purchase of a drink of the fiery dragon they are now inviting to a hpme in their bosoms, whose cry in after years - will be, "Give, give, give," and still as unsatisfied as the horse-leech's daughters. Again; as I passed on up that street, still busy and thronged at midnight, as a country village at mid-day intermission of church service, ever and anon, from some side-street, came up the cry of "Hot corn-hot corn!" and ever as I heard it, and ever as Hshall, through: all years to come, I thought of that little girl- and her drunken mother; and the- 'bad man" at- the corner grocery, andthat 'herWwas: the best, the strongest Maine Law argument -which had ever'fallen upon my listen- ing ear.   -           , Again, as I turned the corner of Sping street, the glare and splendor of a thousand gas-lights, arid the glittering cut glass of that for the first time lighted-up, bar-room of the Prescott House-so lauded by the press for its magnificence-dashes our eyesand blinds our senses, till we are almost ready to agree, that first class hotels mifst have such'Five Point denizen- making appurtenance,- as- this-glittering room, shamelessly, invitingly open to the street; when- thiat watch-word cry, like the pibroch's startling peal, came up from the near vicinity, wailing like a lost spirit on the midnight air--"Hot corn, hot    "HOT CORN.

CHAPTER   III. w 4 -     WILD MAGGIE. "A woman sometimes scorns-what best contents her." IT is human nature to scorn many things which would con- tent us-'which do content us after we once taste them. One of the reasons why the vicious scorn those who would make them better.; why they scorn to change their present wretched life, or miserable habitations, is because they know not what would best content them. When that missionary first located his mission to the poorest of New York city poor, the drunkards, thieves, and prostitutes of the Five Points, he was scorned by those he came to save. He and his mission were h*ated with all the bitter hate which the evil mind oft feels for the good, made still more bitter by the sectarian venom of ignorant Catholics towards the hated heretic Protestants. Every annoyance that low cunning could invent was thrown in his way. Feeling the inefficiency of the system so long and so use- lessly practiced, of giving Bibles or tracts to such people, to be sold or pawned for a tenth part of their value, he began a new system. This was to give employment to the idle, to teach all, who would learn, how to work, how to earn their own living, and that industry would bring more content thao ^  - '  .                   ;(   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.        51 drunkenhess and its conc'omitarivices. Though stolen fruit may be weet, the bread of toil is sweeter, and he would teach them how .to gain it. One of the first efforts made was work for the needle; because that was the most easily started, can be carried on with less capital, and, on the other hand, produaethe least capital-or rather poorest pay to those who labor. Yet it is better than idleness, and he soon found willing hands to work, after he opened his shop, and invited all who would conform to the rules, and were willing to earn their bread, rather thaii beg or steal it, to come and get work-such as coarse shirts and pants-work that they could do, many of them with skill and great rapidity, but such as they could not get trusted with at any common establishment-the very name of the place where they lived being sufficient to discredit them-so that security, which they could not give, for the return of the gar- ments, closed the door against their very will to work. Another discouraging thing against the very poor who did occasionally get 'slop shop work," arose from  some gross, cruel, wicked, downright robbery, perpetrated upon " sewing women" by some incarnate fiend in the clothing  trade. The difficulty to get work, the miserably poor pay offered to those  who "Stitch, stitch, stitch, Band and gusset and seam, Seam and gusset and band, With eyes and lamp both burning dim, With none to lend a helping hand,"  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7638-00000030"/> 52          HOT CORN. is enough to sink stouter IWarts than those which beat iii misery's bosom, Sunk in misery, poverty, crime, filth, degradation, want; neglected by all the world; hated by those who should love; trodden down by those who should, if they did a Christian duty, lift -p; -living in habitations such as but no matter, ou shall go with me, by and by, to see where they live- how could they lift themselves up, how could they be indus- -trious and improve their condition, how could they accept bibles and tracts, with any promise of good? So thought the missionary; and so he set himself about giving them the means to labor, with a hope and sure promise of reward. Some of those who sent him there to preach salvation to the heathen of the Five Points differed with him--differ still-- thinking that a Christian minister degrades himself when he goes into a "slop 'shop" to give out needle-work to misery's household--or attempts to teach industry to idle, vicious chil- dren, or reform degraded wrlen, by teaching them the ways of living without sin, without selling their bodies to buy bread, or in their despair, to exchange the last loaf for rum. So he opened a shop-now enlarged into a "House of Industry "-and soon found his reward. But he was annoyed, hated, persecuted, beaten-but God and a good will conquered. Among other petty, vexatious trifles-it is trifles that annoy -a little girl, in rags and filth, with a mat of soft "bonny brown hair," no doubt well colonized, bare-headed and bare- footed, in cold or heat, used to come every day to the door,   "FE SCENES IN NEW  YORK.      58 ringing her shrill musical voice through the open way, through opprobriqus names, mixed with all sorts of sentences of Catho- lic hatred to Protestantism, that showed that she was herself a missionary from adults of evil minds.

What magic power had wrought this change? Words of kindness, charity, hope, teachings of the happi- ness attendant on virtue, religion, industry; by these the worst can be redeemed. How? "Finding every effort unavailing," said the missionary, "I changed my tactics. I was busy one morning in the work- shop, laying out work, when I cast my eye towards the open door, and there saw Wild Maggie, waiting for a word upon which she might retort. Without seeming to notice her, I said, loud enough for her to hear, 'Oh, how I wish I had some one to help me lay out this work.' There was a look of intelligence spreading over her face, which seemed to say as plainly as looks could say,' I could do that.' "Will you?' I said; she started as though I was mentally replying to her passing thoughts. "She did not say, 'Yep' but she thought it.

When she was sober she would talk, and cry, and promise, but the demon rum would overcome her, and then she would curse her daughter, and call her all the vile names -that the insane devil in her could invent. And so it went on; Maggie still determined, still trying. The right time came at last. One night, Maggie was not at the meeting. By and by, there was a little stir at the door. What is the matter? A little girl is pulling a woman, almost by force, into the room. It is Mapgie and her mother. She has got her old ragged dress off, and looks quite neat in one that Maggie has made for her.

"What a night--what a scene, but you have not seen the worst of it. The very heavens, as though angry at such awful use of the gifts of reason, and the abuse of appetite, sent their forked messengers of fire to the earth-less dangerous than the fire that man bottles up for his own damnation; and the water came down in torrents, pouring into that cave where the dead, and living, and new born were lying together, and overflowed the floor, and when I felt its chill," said she, "I awaked out of my drunken sleep, and felt around me, to see, no, I could not see, all was pitch darkness.

"I cannot go back," she said, "to live with your father, if I would stand fast; and I cannot think, after hearing that woman's story, last night, of ever drinking again. I know that woman; I knew her when she was a girl, one of the proudest and prettiest. My husband has spent many a dollar with hers in the bar-room. Oh yes, I knew her well.

But there is no hope." "Yes, there is hope. I shall watch him; and, mother, I will save him." It was a  great promise-a great undertaking for a young girl to promise with an "I will." When did "I will" in woman's mouth ever fail? That will was the strength of her life. It was for that she now lived and labored. Now she had hope-now 'twas lost --now revived again.

Snakey went to One- eyed Angeline, and promised her a share in the gallon, if she would contrive a plan to get Smoky Sal out of the House of.

One had reformed, or was trying to reform, for Reagan had got her into tle House, and seemed very anxious for her, having, as he said, been the cause of her downfall. The other hated her for her reformation, and would drag her back, down, down, to the wretched life she had escaped from. So she sent word to Sally that she was sick and almost dying, and begged her to come and see her. How could she refuse? So she went, and found her with her head tied up, and in dreadful pain. Directly in came Snakey Jo, with the first installment of the gallon. It was to bathe her head. Can an old inebriate put liquor upon the outside of the head without putting it in? Sally could not. She smelt-she tasted-she drank-was. drunk-and then Angeline took hei down to Cale Jones's grocery, and into his back room, and then that black imp of a worse than slave's master, watched for Reagan as he started for home, and with an air of honesty, that might deceive the rwariest old fox into a trap, he told  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7638-00000043"/> 78         , HOT CORN. him how "Angeline had coaxed Sally into the grocery, and he had been watching an hour -that was the only truth he spoke-he watched for another victim-" and she hadn't come out yet, and he was afraid-she was in trouble; and now, Mister Reagan, I is so glad I is fell in wid you, accidental like, case I didn't know as you was in the Points, case you can get her out, and get her back home." With a natural impulse to do good, he determined, impru- dently, to be sure, to do what he had not done since he signed the pledge-to enter a rnm-hole. There he found the two women as the negro had told him. Sally was completeiy overcame, and lying in one corner of "the back room-'  Back it was, quite out of sight or hearing of the street, where many a victim had been robbed at a game of cards or by more direct means.

Who would think of speaking a foul word to Miss Mary Dudley . Who would speak with respect to Moll Dud? Parents, think of it. Now, here was another -Tom.  A bright, active boy-Tom Top, whose proper name was, Thomas Topham.  What if he had been called Charles? why, his nickname would have been an elongation to Charley, a name that everybody loves. At any rate, he would not have been, drunken Tom--a poor, neglected orphan boy, who, for want of some one to guide and keep him in the path of virtue, had strayed into the very worst of all paths of vice.

He did so, I tasted it and set it down a moment for the ice to melt. When I took it up again, I swallowed the whole tumbler full at a gulph. In a moment my throat, my stomach, my brain were on fire. I had drank half-a-pint of white whiskey. Those wicked wretches had hired Tom to substitute one glass for the other. What transpired for three days after, I know not."

They- did not look in Cale Jones's back room, for he " took his Bible oath that Jim Reagan had never entered his door in a three month." Finally, after the pack had spent every cent of his money, and pawned every article of his clothing, they were ready to get rid of his company. But they were not quite satisfied with the misery they had made for his wife, and/so they plot- ted a scheme so wicked that the most incarnate one, of all the hosts of the infernal regions would blush to own the deed. They knew that Sally had been a source of disturbance, a cause of jealousy to his wife in by-gone years, and so they laid their plan. Madalina, a little beggar girl, an Italian rag- picker's daughter, was promised a sixpence to go, as she would not be suspected, to tell Mrs. Reagan, that Tom knew where her husband was. It was a faint hope, but drowning men catch at straws. Tom was hunted up.  He was easily found, for he had his instructions, " to bring the old woman along."

She might go back to her old missionary paramour. She might go to ---- no matter where, he was drunk. But he could not get up, for the-villains had stripped him of every stitch of clothing; they hadnot even left him a shirt. So she went away, sorrowing. "Tom," said she, "come, go home with me, that is a good boy, I feel so faint and weak."  Tom was a good boy; who had ever said it though? One, one he remembered, and these words came like hers and nestled down in his -heart. They will live there and drive out evil ones. Tom went home with her, giving her his arm and telling her to lean upon it. Tom  was not the best of guides, he made several missteps that day, for tears dimmed his eyes, but he made one good step, it was up the ladcler of reform. "Mrs. Reagan," said he, " let me stay here to-day, I have got no home, and I don't feel as though I wanted to go back to Cale Jones's." No. He   did not want to go back there. He had heard the sound of his dead mother's voice, saying, good boy. No- body would say, good boy, if he went back there. Conscience too was doing her work; conscience told him what he had done to a, woman who now said, " good boy." So he-stayed--he was a  good boy,--he was sick and lihe waited upon her all day. At night he was going to get Mr.   83   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.   Elting and Nolan to go with him and bring Reagan home. That would be his reward.

Tom made a full confess- ion; and still she did not hate him. She told him, how' he could help her. He should go with her; she was going to bring her father home. She gave him  a little bundle of clothes to carry ; and away they went. She stopped on her way down, at the police office, made her complaint, and took an officer along with her, who arrested Cale Jones and the two women; the rest of the -gang were prowling for prey some- where else. The women were sent to the Island, next day, for'they had no friends. The plotter of villainy had.

Reagan, since his wife's visit in the morning, had steadily refused to drink any more, and had become in a measure sober. It was a sad meeting with his daughter. At first, he refused to see or speak to her. ,He was ashamed., Nature overcame him at last, and he got up and pulled off the dirty suit his robbers had put on him, preparatory to kicking him into the street, and put on the clean ones, -which Maggie and Tom had brought him ; and then they took him, each by an arm, -and went home. It was a sad home; it never will be a happy one again. Then she went to work and got him some supper,   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.       85 spading of her own little store to buy some tea, and such things as he could eat. "Now," says she, "I have got another thing to do to-night, for I must go back again in the morning. Tom, I am goink to provide you with a home.

Had he gone back and renewed his pledge, after his first fall, when he was dragged down, he might have been saved; but he would not; he said, he had proved himself icapable of ever being a man again, and so he sunk in despair. Week after week his clothes, his furniture, his wife's clothes, even her daughter's gift-Bible, went for rum. Nothing was left, but starvation. Yes, there was one thing left for her-one tling that that wife had never before received from her hbus band. A blow, a black-eye, and a kick.

Tom had faith, she had none, she was a sad victim of des- pair-a despairing wife. But time will heal the deepest wounds. She went to work, grew cheerful, and contented there to spend the remainder of her life, which she said, would not be long. Of that she seemed to have a presenti- ment, and made all preparation which it becomes a  reason- able mortal to make for such a prospective journey. -She seemed to have but one wish. "Oh! if I  could see my husband as he was a felw months   "FE SCEN'ES IN NEW YORK.      87 ago, I should be willing to die then. But I cannot bear to die now with the thought upon my mind, that he would never shed a tear at my grave." His time was coming. Tom was a philosopher.- "Didn't I tell you," says he, "that the fire would soon burn out. He was here last night, walking up and down 'the pavement for hours, looking down into the kitchen when you were at work." "Perhaps he wanted to strike me again." "No, he was as sober as a judge." , Oh, dear! then .may-be he was hungry, poor man." "So I thought, and went and bought him a loaf of bread.

"I can't help it; it is one, and why not call it so?

And then I talked to him about taking the pledge again, but he said, 'no, Tom, I took it once, I don't want to break it again.' 'No,' said I, 'you did not break it, it was me that did it, I was the guilty one.' And then I told him all about it. lHe never knew before.

She was equally afraid to meet, him. Finally, one of the assistants went out and talked with him. "Do you think," he replied, " that I could ever be a man again ?

We have just read of one of the many thousand sad instances that have occurred in this world, of iurn separating those who had taken upon them that holy ordinance which makes them as one flesh, one heart, one mind: and, unless such have one mind both to be drunk together, how ca, they live with one another?

Who furnished the money? Who made the inmates whal they are?

What caused the inmates to be what they are? Rum! Who made them   harlots? Not those who marry, or are given in marriage.

"But do you promise all this faithfully?" "Yes, sir, I will." It was a woman's "I will," spoken right out with a good, hearty emphasis, that told, as it always tells, the faith and truth of woman, when she says, "I will." "Then I pronounce you man and wife." "Now, Thomas," says the new wife, after I had made out the certificate and given it to her, with an injunction to keep it safely--"now pay Mr. Pease, and let us go home and break the bottle." Thomas felt first in the right pocket, then the left, then back to the right, then he examined the watch fob. It is probable that the former owner of this principal article of his wardrobe, owned a watch. It is more likely that the present owner had been often in the hands of the watch, than that he had often had a watch in his hands. He was evidently searching for lost treasures. "Why, where is it?" says she. "You had two dollars this morning." "Yes, I know it; but I have only got two cents this even. ing. There, Mr. Pease, take them.

So, by a few words, I hope, words of power to do good, Thomas and Matilda, long known as, drunken Tom and Mag, were transformed into Mr. and Mrs. Elting, anSd having grown somewhat more sober while in the house, seemed to fully understand their new position, and all the obligations they had taken upon themselves. "For a few days," said Mr. P., ." I thought occasionally of this two-penny marriage, and then it became absorbed with a thousand other scenes of wretchedness which I have wit- nessed since I have lived in this centre of city misery. Time wore on, and I married many other couples; often those who came in their carriage and left a golden marriage fee-a deli- cate way of giving to the needy-but among all, I had never performed the rite for a couple quite so low as that of this two-penny fee, and I resolved I never would again. At length, however, I had a call from a full match to them, which I refused." "Why do you come to me to be married, my fi'iend ." said I to the man. "You are both too poor to live separate; and, besides, you are both terrible drunkards, I know you are." "That is just what we want to get married for, and take the pledge." "Take that first."

"Well, then, go and bring that friend here; let me see and hear how much it saved him, and then I will make up my mind what to do. If I can do you any good, I want to do it." "My friend is at work-he has got a good job and several hands working for him, and is making money, and won't quit till night. Shall I come this evening?" '"Yes, I will stay at home and wait for you." He little expected to see him again, but about eight o'clock the servant said that man and his girl, with a gentleman and lady, were waiting in the reception room. He told him to ask the lady and gentleman to walk up to the parlor and sit a moment, while he sent the candidates for marriage away, being determined never to unite another drunken couple, not dreaming that there was any sympathy between the parties. But they would not come up; they wanted to see that couple married. So he went down, spd found the squalidly wretched / pair, that had been there in the morning, in conversation, and (apparently very friendly and intimate, with the lady and gen- tleman.'

I saw she trembled violently, and put her clean cambric handkerchief up to her eyes." "What could it mean? Married them when worse off . Who were they?" "Have you forgotten us?" said the woman, taking my hands in hers, and dropping on her knees; "have you forgotten drunken Tom and Mag? We have never forgotten you, but pray for you every day!"

So they did.  So may others, by the same means.

"He, that of the greatest works is finisher, Oft does them by the weakest minister." I HAVE still another little episode in this life drama--a scene in one of the acts, which we may as well put upon the stage at this point of the story, though it is quite unconnected with those that immediately precede it; yet you will find a character here, in whom you have, perhaps, taken some inter- est.  It is the termination of the story of the Hot Corn girl, whom  you read about in chapter second, whose portrait you have already looked at in the frontispiece of this volume. You have read in the story of Little Katy, what a world of cheap happiness can be bought with a shilling. No one of the thousand silver coins wasted that night in hotel, saloon, bar-room, grocery, or rum hole, gave the waster half the pleasure that that shilling gave to three individuals-he that gave and those who received. No ice-cream, cake, jelly, or health-destroying candy, tasted half so sweet as the bread pur- chased with that sixpence. No man ever made so small an investment, that paid so well, both in a pecuniary point of view and large increase of   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.       105 human happiness, for it has been the means of waking up :benevolence, not dead but sleeping, to look about and inquire, what shall I do to remove this misery-producing curse from among us? Thousands have read the story of Little Katy, and thousands of little hearts-have been touched. Many hands have been opened-more will be. These little stories, detail ing some of the sufferings which crime and misery bring upon the poor of this (dty, will be, as some of them already have been, read with tearful eyes. You have read the story of a poor neglected child of a drunken mother--not always so- wasting her young life away with no object but to live, with no thought of death. It is a sad tale, and it is not yet finished. The next night after the interview with that neglected, ill-used little girl, the same plaintive cry of "Hot corn, hot corn!- here's your nice hot corn!" came up through our open win- dow, on the midnight air, while the rain came dripping down from the overcharged clouds, in just sufficient quantities to wet the thin single garment of the owner of that sweet young voice, without giving her an acceptable excuse for leaving her post before her hard task was completed. At length the voice grew faint, and then ceased altogether, and then I knew that exhausted nature slept-that a 'tender house-plant was exposed to the chilling influence of a night rain-that an innocent girl had the curb-stone for a bed and an iron post for a pillow-that by and by she would awaken, not invigorated with refreshing slumber, but poisoned with the sleep-inhaled miasma of the filth-reeking gutter at her feet, which may be breathed with impunity awake, but like 5* ^  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7638-00000058"/> 186      *     HOT COHlN., the malaria of our southern coast, is death to the sleeper.* Not soothed by a dreamy consciousness of hearing a mother's voice tuning a soft lullaby of "Hush, my child, lie still and slumber ;" but starting like a sentinel upon a savage frontier post, with alarm at having slept; shivering with night air and fear, and, finally, compelled to go home, trembling like a culprit, to hear the harsh words of a mother-yes, a mother-but oh! what a mother-cursing her for not performing an     impossibility, because exhausted nature slept-because her child had not made a profit which would have enabled her more freely to indulge in the soul and-body-destroying vice of drunkenness, to which she had fallen from  an estate, when " my carriage " was one of the " household words" which used to greet the young ears of that poor little death-stricken, neglected, street    1 sufferer.                                \ * On many of the Rice and Sea Island plantations in South Carolina and Georgia, in fact upon almost all the coast lands of these States, the  malaria is so deadly in its effects upon the sleeper, that every effort is made to keep awake by those who are accidentally exposed for a single  night to its influence. Many of the most beautiful residences in the vicinity of Charlestori, are uninhabited by white persons in summer. The negroes are not at all, or only slightly affected. The overseers . often have a little cabin in the most convenient pine woods, to which they retire before nightfall.     - No doubt, though to a less deadly degree, the malaria arises from the filth in our dirty streets, killing its thousands of little children every  year.

Wait a little. Tired worn with the daily toil-for such is the work of an editor who caters for the appetites of his morning readers- I was not present the next night to note the absence of that cry from its accustomed spot; but the next and -next, and still on, I listened in vain-that voice was not there. True, the. same hot-corn cry came floating upon the evening breeze across the park, or wormed its way from some cracked-fiddle voice down the street, up and around tye corner, or out of some dark alley, with a broken Epglish accent, that -sounded almost as much like " lager bier "' as it did like the commodity the immigrant, struggling to eke out his precarious existence, wished to sell. All over this great poverty-burdened, and wicked waste, extravagant city, at this season, that cry goes up, nightly proclaiming one of the habits of this late-supper eating people.- Yes, I missed that cry. 4 Hot Corn" was no longer like the  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7638-00000059"/> 108 -         HOT CO LO. music of a stringed instrument to a weary man, for the treble. string was broken, and, for me the harmony spoiled. Who shall say there is not music in those two little words? "Hot Corn" shall yet be trilled from boudoir and parlor, as fairy fingers run over the piano keys. Hot Corn! Hot Corn! shall yet be the chorus of the minstrel's song, and hot tears shall flow at the remembrance of "Little Katy." But that one song had ceased. That voice came not upon my listening ear. What was that voice to me? It was but one in a thousand, just as miserable, which may be daily heard where human misery has its abode. That voice, as some others have, did not haunt me, but its absence, in spite of all reasoning, made me feel uneasy. I do not believe in spiritual- manifestations half as strongly as some of the costermongers of the fruits of other men's brains, who eke out their existence by retailing petty scandal to long-eared listeners, would have them believe; yet I do believe there is a spirit in man, not yet made mani- fest, which makes us yearn after coexisting spirits in this sphere and in this life, and that there is no need of going be- yond it, after strange idols. I shall not stop to inquire whether it was a spirit of " the first, third or sixth. sphere," that prompted me, as I left my desk one evening, to go down among the abodes of the poor, with a feeling of certainty that I should see or hear something of the lost voice, or what spirit led me on; perhaps it was the spirit of curiosity; no matter, it led, and I followed, in the road   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.       109 I had seen that little one go before-it was my only cue-I knew no name-had no number, nor knew any one that knew her whom I was going to find.

I went down Centre street with a light heart; I turned into Cross street with a step buoyed with hope; I stood at the corner of- Little-Water street, and looked around inquiringly of the spirit, and mentally said, " which way now?'  The answer was a far-off scream of despair. I stood still with an open ear, for the sound of prayer, followed by a sweet hymn of praise to God, went up from the site of the Old Brewery, in which I joined, thankful that that was no longer the abode of all the worst crimes ever concentrated under one roof. Hark! a step approaches. My unseen guide whispered, "ask him." It were a curious question to ask a stranger, in such a strange place, particularly one like him, haggard with over much care, toil, or mental labor.

"Sir," said Mr. Pease, "what brings you here at this time of night, for I know there is an object; can I aid you?" "Perhaps, I don't know-a foolish whim-a little child- one of the miserable, with a drunken mother." "Come with me, then. There are many such. I am just going to visit one, who will die before morning-a sweet lit- tle girl, born in better days, and dying now--but you shall see, and then we will talk about the one you would seek to save." We were soon treading a narrow alley, where pestilence walketh in darkness; and crime, wretched poverty, and filthy misery, go hand in hand to destruction. "Behold," said my friend, "the fruits of our-city excise. Here is the profit of money spent for license to kill the body and damn the soul." Proven by the awful Curses and loud blows of a drunken -husband upon a wife, once an ornament of society, and exemplary member of a Christian church, that came up out of one of the low cellars, which human beings call by the holy name of home! The fetid odor of this filthy lane had been made more fetid by the late and almost scalding hot rains, until it seemed to   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.       1" us that such an air was only fit for a charnel house. With the thermometer at 86, at midnight, how could men live in such a place, below the surface of the earth? Has rum ren- dered them proof against the effect of carbonic acid gas? We groped our way along to the foot of an outside stair- case, where our conductor paused for a moment, calling mvy attention to the spot. "Here," said Mr. Pease, "the little sufferer we are going to see, fainted a few nights ago, and lay all night exposed to the 'ain, where she was found and beaten inuthe morning by her miserable mother, just then coming home from a night of -debauch and licentiousness, with a man who would be ashamed to visit her in her habitation, or have 'the world' know that he consorted with a street wanderer." "Beat her! for what?" "Because shedhad not sold all her corn, which she had been sent out with the evening before. Poor thing, she had fallen asleep, and some villain had robbed her of her little store, and, as it is with greater crimes, the wicked escaped and the inno- cent suffered." I thought aloud: "Great and unknown cause, hast thou brought me to her very door?" My friend stared, but did not comprehend the expression. "Be careful," said he, "the stairs are very old, and slip- pery." "Beat her?" said I, without regarding what he was saving. "Yes, beat her, while she was in a fever 9 elirium, from which she has never rallied.

We had reached the top of the stairs, and stood a moment at the open door, where sin and misery dwelt, where sickness had come, and where death would soon enter. "Will he come?" A faint voice came up from a low bed in one corner, seen -by the very dim light of amiserable lamp. That voice. I could not be mistaken. I could not enter. Let me wait a moment in the open air, for there is a choking sensation coming over me. "Come in," said my friend. "Will he come?" Two hands were stretched out imploringly towards the Mis- sionary, as the sound of his voice was recognised. "She is much weaker to-night," said her mother, in quite a lady-like manner, for the sense of her drunken wrong to her dying child had kept her sober, ever since she had been sick; "but she is quite delirious, and all the time talking about that man who spoke kindly to her one night in the Park, and gave her money; to buy bread."    .

He begged Tom to write to Maggie: "I know it will make her happy to learn that I am here."  So it did. The rose had another rival now. Her cheeks blossomed afresh.

So he went on for some time, till he grew stronger and gained more confidence-his wife strengthened him by -her counsel, and then he ventured out to work where he could earn good w1ages. It was curious to see him go quite out of his way, around a whole square, perhaps, to avoid going by one of his old- haunts, .

Those who sell liquor know the advantage to them of this temptation. So they fix up the street corners with all the enticing attractions of artistic skill. The cool ice water; the free lunch; the ever-burning light for the smoker's conve- nience; the arm-chair and easy lounge, and cool room in summer, or well heated one in winter; the ever open, always free resting-place for the tired walker, or ennui-tormented gen- teel loafer, are only a few of the inducements to just "step in a moment;" and then the old appetite is aroused by the sight and smell of liquor in the glistening array of cut glass, and by the influence of a score of old companions stand- ing- before the bar-they will stand before another bar hereafter-or sitting at the little white marble tables, sipping or sucking," sherry cobblers " and " mint juleps " through a glass " straw." Woe to the tired walker who has been tempted into one of these invitingly open rooms. If he has the power to   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.       117 resist his own inclination to drink, he may not have enough io resist the persuasion of half a dozen of his acquaintances, or the force of crazed brains and strong hands, by which he is dragged up and held, while they merit the curse denounced upon those who " put the cup to their neighbor's lips." Per- haps he will be taunted with meanness for coming in to drink water and rest himself, " and not patronise the house." From this, those of us who desire to see those places of temptation shut up, may take the hint. Let reading rooms be opened, free to all who choose to come in and read the papers, drink ice water, and enjoy their rest in the shade, or partake of the comforts of a warm room, for a five cent fee. A coffee and tea room, strictly so, may be attached.' How much better than drinking such liquor as those who visit all our public places must do, or be set down as mean. "Let them stay at home," is a common answer to those who say they fell by the temptations of such places. "L Suppose," said Jim Reagan to me one day, " that we have no home; That was my case when I was a young man. I lived in a common boarding-house; in my little uncomforta- ble room I would not stay; where else had I to go but the public bar room, and there I learned to drink; I was a good fellow then; a genteel young man, and married a genteel young girl; I did not go down all at once-it was step by step, slow but sure--to Cale Jones's grocery and the Centre street cellar." True, thought I, as I entered the front door of the first hotel in this great metropolis, the largest in America, and looked  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7638-00000064"/> "8          HOT CORN. through the splendid marble hall, two hundred feet long, lighted by glittering chandeliers, into the immense drinkingr saloon of that fashionable place of resort; and I said to myself, "some of these fine forms of men, clothed in fine linen and rich broad cloth, may some day fall as low as thee, poor Jim Reagan. You began your course in, just such a genteel drinking room." "Yes," says he, " and the first drink I ever took in one, for I was brought up a temperance boy,I was dragged up by the strength of two companions, and held while the bar-keeper baptised me, as he called it, by pouring the liquor down my throat, over my head, and saturating my clothes till the smell made one sick, and then they gave me more to settle it. ' A- hair of the same dog,' said they, ' will cure the bite.' Bite it was. No mad dog's bite ever caused more sin and sorrow than that bite did me. We cry, 'mad dog,' and kill the poor brute; the worse than brute we ' license' to live." Thus he would sit and talk by the hour. "If I can onlvy keep out of the way of the tempters," said he, "I never shall drink again." He was now accumulating money; he always came home to sleep, "for," says he, "I feel, as sure as I enter this door, that I am safe." It was determined, as soon as Maggie came again, that they would go to keeping house. "If that blessed child was only with me," said the father, as the tears rolled down his furrowed cheeks, "I should feel as though I had a shield through which none of these traffickers in human souls could   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.       119 reach me. My-wife is like an aged counsellor, there is wisdo m in her every word, but she cannot go out through the streets, leaning upon my arm, still full of manly strength, like Mag- gie, while I lean upon her still greater strength--the strength. and might of a strong mind." "Here is a letter from our dear child," said Mrs. Reagan to her husband, one evening as he came in from work. "Sit down and read it aloud, for some how, my old eyes get dim every time I try ; I cannot imagine what is the matter with them." I can. They were full of tears. Strange, that we shed bitter and sweet water from the same fountain. Reagan put on his spectacles, took the letter, looked at the first words, took them off, wiped the glasses, looked again, repeated the operation, laid both letter and spectacles upon the table, got up and walked the room back and forth, then he tried to speak-to utter the first words of that letter9 if he could get over that he could go on, but he could not, they stuck in his throat. At length he got them up--"Dear father and mother, I am coming home to kiss you both." Simple words! Common every-day words.   But they were strong words, for they had overcome the strength of a strong man, and he fell upon his wife's neck and wept like a child. "Such words to me-me who have kicked, and cuffed, and froze, and starved, and abused that child for years. Oh, God, preserve my life to make her ample amends for my wrongs and her love.! Oh, God, preserve her life to make us both happy, and drop a tear at our grave!"  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7638-00000065"/> 120         HOT CORN. Prayer calms the spirit. Realization and acknowledgment of sin soothes the soul. Reagan could now read the letter without difficulty. His 'spectacles did not need wiping again. 'It was dated, "Near KATONA, Westchester County, New York. "DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER: "I am coming home to kiss you both. I don't know but I shall kiss Tom, for he has written me all about it--I know *- it all-I know how you was brought in, and how you took the pledge, and how you have kept it, and how industrious you have been, and how you have saved your money, and ' how you want to go to housekeeping again, and all about it- I know it all. Tom writes me every week. He is a good boy. Well, in two months I am coming down. You need not look for me before, and then, if you want me, I will come and live with you." "If we want her! Did you ever hear the like? But, then, what is she to do? She is a big girl now, and must not be idle. I wish she had a trade. Every child ought to have a trade." "Well, well, wife, let us have the balance of the letter." "Yes, yes, go on; you need not mind what I say. .Go on." "Let me see; where was I? 'Come and live with you,' that's it." "And now I must tell you such a piece of news-good news. Oh, it was a good thing I came up here.

"Do wait, wife, and you shall hear." "It is a nice, genteel trade, too.

But, dear me, why don't she tell what it is?" "So she will if you let me alone. A girl must have her own way to tell it; probably she will do that in a postscript." "Well, read-on. I am so impatient." , '"Perhaps you would like to know what my trade is?" "Why to be sure we should. Why don't she tell 2" "So I will tell you. I am a stock-maker--those things the gentlemen wear round their necks. And it is very curious how I learned the trade. A lady from New York-oh, she is a lady!--came up here on a visit, and for work she brought along some stocks to make. She lives in New York. I believe she keeps a few boarders, and makes stocks. She is a widow lady, quite young, and very pretty, only she is in bad health; she has no family, only her uncle, who is an old bachelor-a nice old gentleman, who has adopted her as his daughter, and is going to give her all he has when he dies. She has no father and mother, as I have, and no brothers and sisters, nobody to love but the old uncle--he does love her, so do I. I did not at first.

Her name is Athalia Morgan--" "Morgan, Morgan--Athalia Morgan. I will warrant it is she. Don't you remember, wife, that old Morgan, the great shipping merchant? his son married a sewing girl, and his sister married George Wendall." "Oh, oh, how singular! It was she that was talking when Maggie took me into the temperance meeting that night, telling how her husband died. And now Maggie has met with another of the family. And her husband must be dead too." Yes, he died just as miserable a death as Wendall. Let us read on and see what of his wife. I hope he did not drag her down with him as I did mine." "James, James, you are not to. speak of anything that is past." "Well, well," and he brushed away another tear and read on: "After she had been here a few days, our folks told her about me, and how I used to run the streets, and how I got into the House of Industry, and how they got me from there, and what a good girl I had been-yes, they did-and then Mrs. Morgan, she began to talk to me so kindly; and then I told her everything about myself, and some about you, and she told me a great many things about herself. Oh, it would be such a story to put in a book. And then she grew as fond   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.      123 of me as I was of her. And every day when I had my work done, and every evening, I used to be up in her room, and she showed me all about her work, and I used to help her, and now she declares that I can make just as good a stock as she can, and almost as fast. She can make eight in a day; when I help her, bdd times and evenings, she can make twelve. Last week she made, with what I did, seventy-two, and put them all in a box. How nice they do look! That is seventy- two York shillings-nine dollars-! And she says when I come home to live, she will recommend me-I must have a good recommend to get work-when I can get just as much such ' work as I can do. Oh, but she is a good woman! I guess you would cry though as much as I have, to hear her story. I will tell it you some day. Mrs. Morgan is going down to- morrow. I wish I was. But I cannot.

I want- to bring her and Elsie together, and make peace on earth as there will be in heaven, where I hope to meet them both. They will soon follow. This life, at best, is short. Mine will be, I am sure." "Don't have such gloomy forebodings, wife; it seems to me that you were never in better health." "I know it, and never more happy." This was on Thursday evening.  On Saturday evening everybody was astonished to see Maggie come bounding in, with a step as light and quick as a playful lamb. "Where's mother? Is she well? Has anything happened.? Where is father? Is everything all right with him?" were the questions she asked, in such rapid succession that nobody could answer any one of them. "Where is Tom? Is he well? Where is Mr. Pease and Mrs. Pease? Are they well? Is mother in the kitch- en?"          -  "Yes, yes, yes, yes, to the whole string." Awayshe went, three stairs at a time, and then she almost overwhelmed her mother with kisses and questions; and up she went to the third story, and there was father in his room, reading the Bible. When had she ever seen that before? The last time she saw him, he was so dreadfully intoxicated that he did not know his own child, that was lifting him out * i   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.       125 of the gutter. Now he was sober, well clothed, cheerful, and happy. As she opened the door he read: ,Who hath woe? who hath sorrow-?   ho hath conten- tions a who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes . "They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine. "Look not thou upon the wine when it is red; when it giveth his color in the cup; when it moveth itself aright. "At the last it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adlder. "Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and-" And he looked up, as his ear caught a little rustle of a womains clothes, and his eyes beheld a strange woman--a beautiful, neatly-dressed young woman, with laughing, bright eyes and rosy cheeks, and such a saucy little straw hat, so tastily trimmed--Mrs. Morgan did that-and altogether such a lady-like girl, that he did not recognise her, and he turned his eyes again to the book and repeated: "Thine eyes shall behold strange women-" "Father!" The book dropped from his-knees to the floor, as he sprang towards her. "Am I so strange, father, that you did not know me?" "Indeed, my daughter, I was afraid to speak; I did not know but a strange woman had been sent to punish me; to 'sting me like an adder.' Oh, Maggie, you don't know how I feel that I deserve it.

It is strange, passing strange, to think that my daughter, my little neglected, dirty, ragged, mischievous-" "Wild Maggie, father." "Yes, she had run wild; should be the lovely--you do look lovely, Maggie-girl now in my arms. Oh, Maggie! Maggie! this is all your work." "No, no, father; you must give the good Missionary his share of the credit; and the good people all over the country who have sent him money and clothes to feed and clothe the naked, and reform the drunkard. What should we have been to-day, if he had not come to live in the Five Points, father?" "I Should have been in my grave- a poor, miserable "drunkard's grave; it is awful to think where else I should have been." "Well, well, father, -you are happy now," "Yes, I am, and so is mother, and we shall be more so when we get a home of our own, and all live together. Why, Maggie, why, who did dress you up so neat?" "Oh, my new friend I wrote you about, Mrs. Morgan-you got my letter-yes-well, I do wish you could see her, she is such a good woman." So they talked on, and then the old lady came up, and then Maggie told how they had arranged it all. On Monday, father was to see if he could find a couple of nice rooms, and Maggie was going, to see Mrs. Morgan, for Mrs. Morgan's old uncle had told Maggie, that whenever she wanted to go to keeping house, to come to him, she did not know what for,   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.      . 127 but she was sure it was something good, for he was a good man, but he never let anybody know what he did for poor folks, he did love to do things in his own way. And Mrs. Morgan was going to write up to the people where she lived, and if father and mother wanted her, they would let her come before her time was up. "Your father will want you." "Will you, too? Do not you want me, mother?" "I do not know, Maggie, I can hardly tell. Who can tell what a day may bring forth. I am glad to see you; I have been praying all day, that the good Spirit would direct your steps hither to-day." "Did you pray that last night?" "Yes s" "And -this morning 2" "Yes." "I thought so-I felt it, all, night, all the morning, just as though a little stream of fire was running through me, all over; now in my head, now in my heart, now in my very fingers' ends; now I started at a whisper in my ear, that sounded just litke mother, saying, 'Oh, Maggie! Oh, that she would come! Oh, that I could see her once more!' and then I felt as though I must come. I was afraid something was going to happen. But now I find you all well, I see what a foolish girl I have been."         f "No, Maggie, not foolish, not foolish; something tells me that you have only obeyed the dictates of a good heart, guided by an invisible power.

I have arranged a place for you to sleep to-night, for the house is very full, and we can scarcely find beds'for those we have, and there are applications for more poor children every day.

"Oh, mother, she is so dirty!" "She used to be, she is not so now. She was so when she ran the streets, just like another little girl." "Oh, mother, I1 know who you mean,- but I did not know that she had been improved." The next day, the father and mother and daughter were sitting side by side in the chapel, and it was the remark of more than one, "Oh, what a change " "Is it possible that that is old drunken Reagan and his wife, that used to live in that Centre street cellar, and that that is 'Wild Maggie?' What a change'! Why she is real pretty, and so bright, and so affectionate see how she looks out the hymn for her mother; and now they all kneel together. Well well, that is better than all drunk together." After morning service, Mrs. Reagan went into the kitchen to assist about dinner, "I cannot tell hw it is," said she, "but I feel as though this was the last meal I shall ever eat with my husband and Maggie; perhaps I shall not eat this." She never did. Half an hour after that, the house was in wild commotion.   "FE. SCENES IN NEW YORK.      1.29 "Where is Mr. Reagan?-where is Maggie?-call the doc- tor!-oh, dear!--oh, dear! Mrs. Reagan is in a fit." It was a fit which all must have sooner or later. Her fore-- bodings, from whatever cause they came, had given her pre- science of her death. The husband and daughter were soon kneeling over her where she had fallen upon the floor, vainly'trying to revive animation. The physician vainly essayed his skill. "' It is too late. My mother is in heaven." "It is certain she is in the hands of God, and she died with a blessing on hei lips for her child," said one of the women who were present when she fell. "What did she say, Angeline?" "Sally, how was it? you heard it best." This is drunken Sal and old Angeline, whom -you have seen before. They, too, are- inmates; sober, industrious ones, of the House of Industry. "She said, 'Oh, God, forgive me all my sins! And my husband, forgive him, oh, Lord! as I do. Margaret, oh, God!

"Yes," said Angeline, " and that reminds me to tell you that she said just before she died, but I thought she was talk- ing, wild like, that if she did not see you again, that I must tell you not to go back to Westchester, but you must be. sure to stay with your father, he would be so lonesome when she was gone." The poor husband was lonesome; he already felt it. Then he felt what blessings he had left. He had good health and strength, and a most affectionate good child to comfort him in his old age. And then he poured out such a prayer, as all, ought to hear who lack courage to go on in the glorious work of lifting up the fallen, and giving strength' to the feeble, and .forgiveness to the erring. The day closed in sad- ness, yet there were some who witnessed the sad scene who felt that " it is good to be afflicted." The next day after these events I was in Greenwood Cemetery, that lovely resting-place for the dead. It is a land- mark in this progressive age, that shows the good fruits of an improved state of society.

It was by the side of one almost old enough to be forgotten, and yet the number of years since it was made were very few, and very, very -short. There was a rose bush growing at the head, but I saw through the green leaves the name of "Morgan, ZEt. 62." I was not curious to know what Morgan, for my thoughts were far away. I did wonder, it is natural to do so, if that was Mrs. M4organ by his side, and if they had always lain so quiet, without words of contention, or "Caudle Lectures." My doubts were soon to be solved, for now came a cart and a couple of stone setters. How quick, and how carelessly they work; now the hole is dug, now they lift the little stone out of the cart, now they set it upright, now they fill in the dirt around it, now they give a few stamps with heavy boots just over the head of the sleeper--he hears them not-now the stone is planted, now they jump into the cart, s slash the whip, and curse the poor old horse for his laziness, and rattle away with a whistle and merry glee. Now we can read the name on the new stone. Ah, it is not his wife-it is "1 Walter Morgan, .Et. 27." His son-perhaps, anr only son -how soon he has come after his father. It is a comnlon name, or I might moralize farther upon what I know of that name. I am interrupted, and walk off a little way and turn to look again. A fine, benevolent looking gentleman-faces- do look benevolent-r-is getting out of a carriage. He is about the age of the elder Morgan. His brother, perhaps. Now, he lifts out a rose bush, in bloom, in its little world, all Xts own, in an earthen pot.

It is a young widow. Fancy is at work now; it says, "Is she pretty?" Weo are too far off to discern features, but we can think. We do think that a widow who comes to plant a flower at her husband's grave, is a flower of a woman, let her face be what it may. So I sat down with pencil in hand, writing, "Musings at the Tomb."  I had just written, "Benevolent old gent and beau- tiful young widow," and was going to add, rose bush planted at husband's grave, and all that sort of thing, when somebody slapped me on the back-that knocks out the sentimental- with a clear hearty expression of, " my old friend." "Why, Lovetree, is this you? Athalia-Mrs. Morgan, 1 should say." "No; always call me by the name you first knew me by." "4 Then I should call you Lucy." "No, no, not that, not that."        * is Forgive nie, but I did not intend to call up unpleasant reminiscences. Ah, what have we here? A little train of mourners, with a, tenant for that open grave.

"So we will, and then I will arrange the plan for them to go to housekeeping together. I have already got a place in View." So they met, and so Athalia, said, "' Come with us.." And so they went. Maggie looked upon it as another remarkable interposition, or something, at any rate, that she could not account for, that Mrs. Morgan should have felt impelled to come over here to-day, of all other days, and that they should meet so singularly; " for," said she, "fifty different parties might be riding about among these hills, and dales, and groves, looking at this lonely poor grave, and at that twenty thousand dollar monument, and yet no one know that the other was so near. Well, it is a place where all must come. I hope we shall all meet our friends as happily as I have mine to-day." So they went home with Mrs. Morgan, and three days after they went to a house of their own. You have already seen how they were able afterwards to say to others, "Come with us," when a houseless widow and her two children stood in the street the night of the fire--the, night that rum and its effects made Mrs. Eaton a widow.

You did not see him in the crowd at the fire, but he was there, and heard his protege say, "Come with us."  He was just going to sav it, but he liked it better that Maggie had said it first. Then he said to himself-it was one of his odd freaks of benevolence -I will surprise the dear girl directly, and make her remem- ber those golden words to her dying day. You have seen him. It was Athalia's uncle. Who is Athalia ? Turn over. Read.   CHAPTER     VIII. ATHALIA, THE SEWING GIRL. " How full of briars is this working day world." " With fingers weary and worn, With eyelids heavy and red, A woman sat'in unwomanly rags, Plying her needle and thread." ATHALIA wore not unwomanly rags at the period when I shall commence her history. She was clad in the garb of a country girl, just arrived in the city, in the full expectation that fortune awaited her, just as soon as she could learn the trade of a dress-maker. Oh, how she worked, and laughed, and sung! She was the life of the shop. Sometimes she thought of home-home where mother was-and then she wept. But the sunshine of youth soon sends the clouds and dew drops that dim the eye away to forgetfulness, Athalia was sixteen-sweet sixteen in face and mind. What a bright blue eye, what soft brown hair, what wit, and oh, what a voice in song'! and such a heart, 'twas tuned for others' woes, and not her own. Why comes this mountain flower from her country home ? Her father was a farmer-ah ! was-would be still, only that he had swallowed his farm. The mortgage to the store at the cross roads, the damage paid in a law suit for a fight, and   &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7638-00000073"/> the cost of throwing his neighbor's horse down his well, had left him without a home for himself, and so his children went forth into' the world to seek bread; the daughter, of course, by the needle, the sons at sea.  Athalia chose the city. How little she knew the danger. "She would have shuddered to see a man sit carelessly down upon a powder keg with a pipe in his mouth. Not half so dangerous is that, as for a young country girl, with a beautiful face, to come here. Oh, how she worked one whole year to learn her dress- maker's trade, without one cent of compensation. 'Such is the law. The law of custom with milliners' apprentices. Then she went home. How joyfully her mother opened her arms; how sweet was that kiss-a loved mother's kiss. Did she love her father? How could she love a man who often cursed, and sometimes beat that mother? She went home to stay, to ply her new trade among her old neighbors. How could she love her father when he would not let her stay, and, like a drunken brute as he was, drove her back again to the city? "You have learnt a city trade, and you have got city airs ; nobody wants you here." It was not so. Everybody wanted her there but her mis- erable father... Everybody else loved Athalia. They saw no city airs; all they saw was that a rough diamond had been polished. What is it worth without? So she came back to the city with a heavy heart. What was she to do? She could go back to her old .shop and work   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.      137 eighteen hours a day, for twenty-five cents, and scanty food; lodging, as she had done during her long year of apprentice- ship, three in a narrow bed, in a room with just air and space enough for the decent accommodation of a cat, nothing more. What hope in such a life? What would she have at the end of the year? Just what she had at the beginning? No; for one year of youth would be gone. She could not go back; there was no hope there. So, with another girl just as poor, but just as willing to work, she took a room, and took in work, or went out to do it. Then how she was exposed, how in danger. Libertines live in genteel families. Ah, and are pet sons of mothers who would give dollars to dissipated rakes, and grutcge shillings to poor dress- makers. And if the poor girl should be caught in the snare of such a son, how the mother would rave and drive her away unpaid, because she had disgraced her " respectable boy." Mrs. Morgan was one of Athalia's lady 'patrons."' Haugh- tily proud, yet not, like some of her class, positively dishonest, cruelly dishonest. She wanted the labor of the poor sewing girl, because she possessed great taste, and could dress her daughters better, and what was still more, though so little practised by the rich, cheaper, than she could get their dresses at a " regular establishment." That was just what the daugh- ters most disliked. They knew that none of their acquaint- ances wore such neat-fitting dresses, but when the question was put, "Where did you get them made?" they could not answer, "Oh, we always get everything at ladame Chalam- beau's fashionable establishment in Broadway."  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7638-00000074"/> 1838          HOT CORN, They could not change their mother's policy, and so they determined to dri;ve poor Athalia out of the house. They had another object. Athalia was beautiful. -Her face was such as we are apt to conceive that an angel must have. And everybody who came in the house while she was there, and saw her, said, "Oh, what a sweet face!" This was gall and wormwood to the "young ladies," for their faces;were just such as you would suppose were made out of those two ingredients, and they were true indications of their minds. So they hated the poor seamstress for double cause. At first she came to the table with the family. But the girls could not help observing that she was the diamond, they the setting, to all eyes. She was better bred than they, with all their boarding-school education. Where had she got it? In a country school house, and her mother's kitchen. Once, once only, after tea she was invited to sing. Who supposed that she could touch a piano note. She accepted the invitation, as all well-bred girls do, who know that they can sing, and Walter offered his arm to lead her to the piano. Walter was the brother, the only "son and heir of our family." He had just returned from a lady-killing Niagara tour, and met Athalia for the first time at the tea table. It was the last time, the sisters- said, that he should meet her there. She went home that evening; she had finished her job and received her poor pay. That was one of Mrs. Morgan's virtues; she paid the stipulated price to those who worked for her.            *   "FE SCENES IN NEW   YORK.      139 What daggers, scorpions' stings, and poisoned darts, poor Athalia and Walter would have felt, while he- stood over her at the piano, if they could' have felt the glances of scornful, angry eyes.

But aristocracy had stept down to the level of one who ", Plied her needle and thread, In poverty, hunger, and toil;" Who sang with a voice of saddening song, Of the home on her own native soil. Of the spring and the brook where it flow'd, Of the plums and the pears where they grew, Of the meadows and hay lately mow'd, And the roses all dripping with dew. And her heart it went journeying back, While her fingers plied needle and thread, Till the morning came in at a crack, Where it found her still out of her bed. Shall I ever work thus like a slave, With the scorn of the rich and the proud? For they think that a seamstress must crave For the work that is making her shroud. Walter justified, apologised, for he was bound in the iron fetters, a polite custom."

"Well, she shall never come there again. I always told mother that she might know better than to bring her to the table; and the pert minx, if she knew her place, would never try to stick herself into genteel company. So much for having a dress-maker in the house." "Elsie, Elsie, I am ashamed of you." I think you had better be ashamed of yourself, mother." "I found her," resumed Walter, "at your table, and I took the only vacant seat, by her side. I did not find her pert, but on the contrary, I must say it, better behaved, better spoken, than my sister Elsie, when speaking of or to her mother." "You had better insult me, by your comparison, Sir Walter." "No; I do not intend that. But I was only explaining why I paid attention to the lady." "The lady-lady! That to a sewing girl who goes out to work by day's work. Did you learn that at college or at Saratoga?" "I have learned to call every female lady, who looks, acts, and talks like one. I hope my sister Elsie will not unlearn me. I found the lady at your table. I found her polite and diffident. She is not a forward minx. I walked with her to the parlor." "Yes,.and she should have known better than to go there. Why did she not go back to her'work?"   "FE SCENES IN NEW   YORK.       141 "Elsie, she had done her work, and was waiting for your father to come home, so I could get some money to pay her; for I should be ashamed to keep her out of her money, or oblige her to call again.

It was me, your mother, that asked her to sing one of those plaintive, sweet songs, I had heard her sing to the children while at work. It was you that urged her. What for? That she might fail.

" Smitten-smitten-my brother Walter smitten with my dress-maker! Faugh! I wonder if he went home with her, for he went out at the same time ?" Yes, he did go home with her. It was her first false step. But ye that stand fast, do not censure this first step of her fall. She was young and handsome; so was he. Theirs were such hearts as nature sports with. Both were touched. He went home with her. They-got into a stage at Seventeenth street to ride to Broome, for there was the home of the sew- ing girl. At Broome street he forgot to pull the check string. She did not notice it till the crowd of cars, carriages, and swarms of human beings, which fill up that great wide thoroughfare, Canal street, awakened her, from her reverie of wild thoughts, to the fact that they were already too far down. Before he could stop her she had pulled the string, and the driver held up and looked down through his little peep hole at his passengers, ready for his sixpenny fare, which he will contrive to make seven cents, if he makes change for you. Walter acknowledged that he did not mean to stop the stage; he wanted Athalia to go to Taylor's, and take an ice cream with him. But she was inexorable. He plead, she said, no; she said it sweetly, and, finally, they compromised by her agreeing to go to-morrow. evening. The second false step! Then he walked home with her. She said, good night, at the door, he said, " Oh, let me see you up these dim stairs." "Oh, no, I am used to them, I can find my room in the   dark. If Jeannette is at home, she will hear a little signal upon the wall, and open the door, then it will be light." " Give it then." She did; Jeannette was not at home. "Oh, let me go up, and just look in, and see where angels live." Oh, flattery! thy. power is great.  Why should she refuse, since he was to come again, she had promised that.? So she said, "come up, then," and away she tripped into the darkness, her step so light that he could not tell where it fell. Directly there was a little scratch, a flash, a blue flame, very small, and then a full white light, and a match, and then a lamp was burning. "Come up. Take care of the narrow, crooked steps, they are not like your broad easy stair-case." She had made another false step. Did far off visions of fancy revel in her brain, that she might some day go up that broad stair-case, arm in arm with that handsome young man ?.

"Yes, sir, but only a few days, weo had to make up the month's rent, eight dollars for the room, and five for the fur- niture." Walter put his hand in his pocket. What for? He felt how easy it would be to take out a hundred dollars, and tel her, to go and pay for -that furniture, and not pay rent for it any longer. Then he thought how ridiculous, to be so affected by the woes and wants of a sewing girl. How his proud sisters would laugh at him. Pride conquered a heart prone to a good action.

She is a sweet, good girl; I wish she was at home." "Wish again, and you will see her." Both started as though caught in something they were ashamed of. Why should they be? True he had approached very close to Athalia, as she stood watering her flowers and feeding her bird--both windows were full of flowers, and over each a canary bird; and he was watching all her operations with as much interest as though they were all his own. "Poor things," she said, " they look neglected." She loved flowers. So did he. He loved their owner, but he had not said so yet. He hardly knew it; he would not let any one know it; hence he started when Jeannette spoke, for he thought she must have seen it. He blushed and turned round, and then she blushed; there was a trio of blushes. What for? Jeannette did not think it was a stranger. She thought it was Charley Vail. Charley was a sort of beau, yet not a beau. He was Jeannette's cousin; and though he did not love her exactly, he liked her, and I guess that she liked him; Athalia thought more than liked him. Charley would have loved Athalia if she had given him the least encourage- ment, but she would not, for she hoped he would love his cousin and marry her. He was a good fellow, always ready to do anything on earth for "the girls"--in short he was Charley. Jeannette blushed. She had reason to, for, thinking it ?*            &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7638-00000079"/> "8         HOT CORN. was cousin Charley-who else could it be, there in their room alone with Athalia, in the evening-she tripped up behind him and gave him a good hearty slap on the back. He turned around, she almost felt him hugging and kiss- ing her, but he did not. She looked again, the light now shone in his face, and there she stood before a stranger. Is it any wonder she blushed? is it any wonder he blushed? is it any wonder they all blushed? She played with her bonnet strings; he twirled his hat; Athalia could not play with any thing. She had the lamp in one hand, and the bird cage in the other. But she could laugh, and she burst out in such clear, musical tones, as she said, . Why, Jeannette, did you think it washarley ." That explained 4he whole. ' He understood the blow now. Did he also understand what Charley would have done, if it had been him- that got the blow. Perhaps he thought, for he said, "You have struck me, miss. I never take a blow without giving one back. There." Did he strike her? What! strike a woman! Shame! Oh, no; but he caught her in his arms, before she could be aware of the movement, and such a kiss! such a good, hearty kiss as he gave her. Ah, well! who would not? She was a nice, sweet girl, not quite so pretty as Athalia, but one that a colder heart than his might relish in just such a case. She * pouted a little, and talked about great liberty in a stranger; but who took the first liberty? True; but "that was a mis- take."

And what was she angry about? That he had kissed Jeannette instead of her? Take care, little heart, jealousy is creeping in among thy pulsations.  Take care, big heart, for just now Charley enters the scene, and before her has observed that a stranger is in the room, he has kissed Athalia. - Mischief has broke loose to-night.

Jeannette would have sooner struck a bear than him, yet he did not bite her. Charley would have sooner kissed that same bear, and risked the hug, than have kissed Athalia before a stranger, for he is a good boy, a little mis- chievous, but would never do a- thing to hurt the feelings of another, particularly a woman.

What would his proud sisters say, if they knew how "low he had sunk himself, to keep company with sewing girls?"But he would not tell them.

But he wanted to hear Athalia sing once more. No. She had no piano. His hand was in his pocket again. How he would like to 'send her one to-morrow, but he dared not say so. He did look around the room, to see where he could set it. There was no room. She could not sing any more to-night. Ask Jeannette. She sings a beautiful little song while we are at work. No, she could not., She was afraid to sing before strangers. But Charley asked her, in his blandest manner, and then she would sing one verse if he would go right home. How anxious she was to get rid of him. So she sung: "Why bitter life with useless tears, With mourning unavailing? Why bitter hope with ceaseless fears, Of shoals .where we are sailing?

More false steps. How many will it take to reach the end? Walter went home, never more happy.    You have seen how he was taken to task. He had defied the laws of caste. It did not require stronger Argus eyes than his two sisters possessed to see how deeply he was enamored with Athalia. How they did wish they knew whether she had dared to look up to him, as he had down  to her. How should they find out. It does not take mischief-makers long to contrive their plot. If one, woman wants to ruin another one, there is one always ready to assist her in her wicked design.

Mischief is always busy. It must be so with an envious wicked woman. The Morgans changed their tactics, and adopted those more wicked than I could invent. They soon found that they wanted more dresses, and what was very remarkable, they did not want to go to the French dress-maker. What could be the reason? They had watched their brother; they had seen him go to Athalia's; they had seen him in the theatre with her; they had met them walk- ing, arm in arm, in Broadway, " the shameless hussey;" and once they had entered Thompson's, and walked upstairs to take ice cream, " actually over our heads."

"It is a pity," said Elsie, " that he would not ruin her, and that would be the end of it." Did a spirit furnish that cue, or was it a wicked woman's own conceit? At any rate, it was a cue upon which they acted. Athalia was sent for, and the young ladies never were so affable before. Every opportunity was contrived for Walter to accomplish   the purpose of a villain. Their schemes had the exact contrary effect desired. He had made such advances at first as " men About town" do make, and had met with such a decided repulse, not an angry one, but a virtuous one, that he never would try again. "I expected it," said she to his proposals, "I am used to it -I am   almost every day exposed to such tempting offers, to escape a life of poverty-I have ceased to look upon them as insulting-nature, and fashion, and the state of society, are such in this city, that a girl with an unfortunate face like mine, must fall, unless she is possessed of such- fortitude as but few young girls are naturally-gifted with. You may ask me that question every day; every day you may, if you feel like wounding the feelings of a poor girl, repeat your ques- tion, and every day you will get the same answer." "Athalia, forgive me. Oh, forgive me; I never will repeat the question again; whether you forgive me or not, you need have no fear of that. What a failure then had his sisters made.

The simple interest upon the cost of his house and furniture was seven thousand dollars a year, and his annual expenses double that sum.

Not one useful thing had either of them been taught, not one lesson in the art of self-support; all was self-indulgence. They laughed, or would have laughed at the idea, if any one had dared to mention it, that the time would ever come, that they would have occasion to lift a hand to procure their own bread. It is a bad school-it has many scholars. Mr. Morgan came home one day in unusual glee; he was naturally a stern man. He had heard of the very successful voyage of the Matilda-named after his daughter-to Chinam where she would load with teas and silks for a home voyage. She was insured in a very rich London office. Some of his cautious friends advised him to " hedge," by insuring also in other offices; he had never met with a single loss in his life ; he had often been his own insurer, and took about half the value of the Matilda now on his own insurance book, which showed a great many thousand dollars in his favor.

"Well, settle it your own way. I go to-morrow, and if you are going with me, you had better be getting ready; besides, let me tell you, young Wendall is going up too. We are going to have some great sport, fishing." That decided Elsie. If George Wendall and the Grundys were going, she must go, for he and Minnie Grundy needed watching. She would go, if she wore the old hat, and a dress that had been worn twice before. "Where is that seamstress? she must work all night, and get my dress done any way." "Elsie, daughter, she cannot do that, her, eyes are very wealk. You had better take her along with us, the poor girl; give her a little country air, and let her finish your dresses there." "Yes, yes, that's it, wife, let her go along. She appears to be a right, tight little craft. A sail will do her good. What a pity she did not hail from the right port.  * *    "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.     " 159 "You have very curious notions, father." "That is my business." ' Well, for my part," says Matilda, "I think she can go just as well as not; our maid and she can have a room together, and nobody need to know that we have brought a seamstress along with us; if they did, they would think it very vulgar. Of course, she won't come to the table with us, at the hotel." "No, indeed; I guess she will not; though, I suppose, we shall have a private table; shall we not, father?" "That is my business." But as it was settled that she was to go, it was, finally, thought- necessary to tell her so, and she was sent for, and told of the arrangement. How could she go I How start so sudden . How-leave Jeannette? She could not go. Yet she would like to. Perhaps she never would have another opportunity. She would go down and see Jeannette, and if she could go, she would come up very early. Away she ran upstairs for her little straw hat and black mantilla. Walter had been a "silent member" of the party. - What wild thoughts ran through his brain, when he found that Athalia was to be one of the party. Did he dream :of the shady walk, the moon- lit lake, and egg-shell boat, with only two in it, floating upon the glassy surface of the water? Did he think that he should climb the rocks with her, and wander through the ruins of old Ticonderoga . Yes, he did dream; youth do dream.

Of the hook that he would bait and put in her hands, and the fish that would be caught. Fish!! It is not fish alone that young girls catch, when young men bait hooks {r them, in wild woods, and lonely glens, where mountain streams murmur soft music. As she came down upon the steps, Walter was waiting there. What for? For a poor sewing girl. He wanted, he said, that she should stop with him and pick out a hat and some little articles, a toilet box, and sundry conveniences or necessaries, to one on a journey, for his sister Matilda. Oh yes, she would do that, with pleasure, if he -wished it. Hle did wish' it. The selections were made with great taste and without regard to expense. The hat was a little treasure. What was that sigh for? Can a woman-a young girl- just on the eve, too, of a journey to a watering place, see such a hat shut up in its paper case, without a sigh? It is more than human nature ever could do. Athalia is human, and that hat is just such a one as she would like herself. She is too poor. So she sighed and went home. "Shall I send it?" "Let it be until I return, and then I will give directions." It is no matter what Walter said to her on the way home, but she had determined to go with the Morgans, to Lake George, and so she told him. "Good night then, I must go home and get ready, you know what the word is with father--' that is my business.'  He had a little other business. He went back to the stores and gave^ he necessary orders about the purchase.   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.       161 "Would the lady be kind enough to write a little note that' he would dictate, and put it in the bonnet box?" "-Certainly, anything to oblige the gentleman. Was that his sister? His cousin perhaps? Well, she is very pretty, any rate. Was that her name? What a sweet name." E What sweet words to Walter. How we do like to hear those we love spoken of in such words. How Athalia busied herself getting her few things ready. What she lacked, Jeannette, the good soul, lent her. She never thought how lonely the room would be for the two or three weeks she would be away. "I wish I had a few dollars to, spare, Jeannette, I certainly would go and buy just such a hat as I picked out this evening for Matilda Morgan. It was very pretty. And Walter, he admired it too. He said it was so tasty, when I tried it on, to let him see how it looked." Just then there was a rap at the door. "Oh there comes cousin Charley.," No, it could not be (3harley, it was a little rap. The door was opened, and there stood a little girl with a bandbox and bundle.-It is a shame to send such little girls out late in the evening with such heavy bundles. "Does Miss Lovetree live here?" "Yes." "Then this is the place." "Oh dear," says Jeannette, " more work. Who can this be from I Why, Athalia, what is the matter, you look amazed!" "I am amazed.

I cannot take it, indeed I cannot. Accept such a present from him? No, no, no." He had thought of that.   Jeannette by this time had the bandbox open. Did woman ever resist that temptation? . "Ah here is a note. This will explain the mystery." "To MSS LOVETREE:- "' As it is decided that you will go with us to Lake George, please accept a few. things that you will need, which I have commissioned my son to buy. "From your friend, "MRS. MORGAN." "Oh that is a different thing, if they come from her. And then for him to pretend all the time that they were for his sister. It is too bad. Oh, but it is a love of a hat though I is it not, Jeannette?" Yes, it was; that was settled. First one tried it on, and then the other. Jeannette said it was a bride's hat. Athalia I said she ought to be ashamed of herself to say so. Then all the other little bijouterie were overhauled, and looked at, and talked over, and praised, and then the note was read again, and the postscript; there was a postscript, there always is a postscript to a woman's letter. It was the postscript that gave it the air of genuineness. It read: "P. S.-Don't say a word to me, or hint where the hat came from,  for I don't want Mr. Morgan or the girls ever to know; nobody knows but Walter."  r\            l   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.      163 No, nobody knows but Walter. There was no fiction in that. In the morning there was another rap-louder this time. It did not disturb any sleep though; there had been none in that room that night. It was John, come for the trunk and bandbox-two things that a modern lady never travels with- out. There was a wagon load of them left the Morgan and Grundy mansions that morning, and they and their owners all arrived, in due course of cars and locomotives, at Lake George. Mr. Morgan and George Wendall fished, the girls flirted, Athalia sewed and sighed, and walked out evenings, slyly, with Walter Morgan. More false steps. Sly walks in town are bad-in the coun- try, dangerous. There are a great many precipices, down which such a couple may tumble. George was a glorious fishing companion for the shipping merchant. He could row and drive, and get up all the tixings; and, after dinner, talk, and laugh, and drink, till both went to bed " glorious." "Mr. Morgan, you drink one bottle too many.' "Pshaw.

"Ask father." "Enough said." He did. He took care to ask him just at the right time. "Why, George, my boy, good fellow to fish. Did not think you had your hook there. Got any bait? No. Well I have. Enough for both of us. I will bait your hook, boy. That is my business." "Thank you, sir.

Now, now-right off to-nigliti Nothing like going to sea while the tide serves." He was a prompt man always. It was no use to say no, after he had said yes, or, " that is my business ;" so in half an hour after that, Elsie Morgan was Elsie Wendall. Of course more wine was drank, after which a letter was brought to him,-from his head clerk, marked, "Important-- in haste."  So Mrs. Morgan told him. "That is my business; take it up to my room. Do you think I am going to read-the stupid letters of old Precision at -this time of the evening, and my daughter just married ." At-ten o'clock next morning, after the mail had gone, he read: "Sir:- "We have advises by telegraph from London, just as the steamer   - ,I4 "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.      .165 was leaving port, of the failure of the London insurance office, in- which the Matilda is insured.

How the bell did ring; how he stamped, and swore, and wrote, and yet he could not send his letter till next morning. ' Why did not old Precision insure at once? Every dollar on earth would be swallowed up if that ship were lost." Simply because he was Precision, and the merchant, who had directed him for forty years, had never given him leave to act, upon his own discretion, in an emergency like this. "That is my business," was the unvarying answer. Two days after, he had another letter from his precise clerk. He did not order it up to his room, to wait till next morning, for he was in a tearing passion when it was handed him; and he felt as though he would have opened it if the biggest rocks in that mountainous region had been piled upon it. What had so disturbed the rich merchant?. Those who have them not, are apt to fancy that riches and happiness are handmaids. What was the matter? His son, his only son, had just approached him, taking advantage, as Wendall had, of a propitious hour, when wine had done its work-he drank brandy since the news in that letter, and that fired, not soothed him-he approached him with a beautiful sweet girl upon his arm, to ask his consent to their marriage.

You, my only son, marry a common sewiig girl, never." "It is too late. Here is my marriage certificate.^ His father opened his mouth to curse him. What for?

He knew the fault was all his -own. He had said, when urged to open the letter, an answer to which would have saved all, "that is my business." It was a sad, sad business. That one more bottle had beggared himself, and all that were dependant upon him. He had just married one daughter to a man whose only qualifica- tion was " a good fellow," who could shoot, fish, smoke, drink, drive fast horses, cheat his tailor, and the poor widow board- ing-house keeper, and, finally, take advantage of a besotted old rich merchant, when he had drunk just to the point of good- nature-when the indulger in strong drink feels like hugging everybody and " all the rest of mankind,"-to-get his consent for him to marry his ugly daughter. It was a marriage of convenience, the obligations of which he intended to keep just as many other such obligations are kept in this city. All 'this ran through his mind upon the electric telegraph of the brain. Flash after flash it went through, and then came the heavy thunderbolt. He could have endured all-the rest; he could not endure that his son should marry a sewing girl. Why? His father was a tailor, and he married a tailor's daughter, and he hated everything that could remind him of his own needle-and-thread origin. He hated her too, be- cause she was so much more lovely-than his own daughters.  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7638-00000089"/> 168&amp;         HOT COR2. For five minutes he sat with the letter in his hand, glaring at that, then at his wife and Matilda with a look of sorrow,; then at Elsie and her half-drunken husband, with contempt; then his eye came back with a fixidity of hatred upon Walter and Athalia.'              *  At length Walter ventured to break the awful silence. "Father."  "Don't call me father again. I disown you, you poor milliner's apprentice. Beggar! Don't speak to me." Walter paid no heed to the order, but said mildly, " is the Matilda lost." "That is my business. Leave the room." His sisters took up the cue.    v "Yes, you had better go now. Go, and set up shop. You can carry home dresses for your wife." He came to that afterwards. Then Elsie's husband put in a word of insult. "I say, Walter, it strikes me, that is rather a costly topsail for a beggar's wife. I hope she gets her bonnets in an honest  way. Who pays the milliners' bills .?" Walter raised his cane to strike the villain that could utter such a vile insinuation upon the character of a virtuous girl, and would have paid all his tailors' bills at one blow, but Athalia sprung upon his arm, and held it down. His father l either thought, or pretended to think, that he raised his cane  to strike him; probably not having heard the remark of Wendall, and thinking only of his own wrongs. He seized a bottle-a weapon that has knocked down its thousands-and '?   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.       169 sprang forward to strike down his son. His arm was already up, a horrid oath was struggling in his throat, his face turned black from the effects of suffocation, he reeled, the bottle fell to the floor with a crash, and he would have fallen down among the broken glass and spilt wine, but for Walter, who caught him in his arms, and bore him from the room towards his chamber. Athalia rushed out for a physician. It was too late!-Death had. already said, "That is my business." While these events were transpiring in the country, others of great import to the rich merchant's family were enacting in ' the city. Creditors are not slow when they see misfortune fall upon one, whom they were ready to bow to yesterday, to tread upon him to-day. Creditors and their ministers,-the judges, attorneys, sheriffs,-are all ready for a share of the pound of the broken merchant's flesh. Shylocks still live, and Antonios still fail. That was a sad funeral cortege which accompanied the dead bankrupt back to the city. Sad, not so much from sorrow, as wounded pride and fallen greatness. It was sad to see the daughters of a dead father absolutely refuse to travel upon the same train, with an only brother's wife. He would not go without her, and so thewent without him. It was night when they arrived. They had despatched John in advance, to-set the house in order, and meet them at the depot with the carriage and a hearse. The latter was there, the former was not, and they had to submit to the indignity of a hired hack. At the house, all was dark.

Why should he not get drunk 8 They rung the bell angrily. It was a long time before it was answered. Then a heavy footstep came down stairs- not up from the servants' room-and approached the door, and opened the inner one, so that he could see through the blind who demanded admission. A sharp-faced, keen, black- eyed, weasel-looking man, with a chamber-lamp in his hand, and one of Mr. Morgan's dressing gowns upon his back, stood before:the astonished family with the question trembling upon his lips, of "Vats you vant here?" "Want? we want to come in, to be sure, why don't you open the door? Who are you? What are you doing here?" "Veil, you can't come in.

And heclosed the door in their faces, and they heard his heavy step reverberating through the long hall, and up the broad stair-case, as he went back to his lounge, "in my lady's chamber."

The hearse and hired hack had driven off. There lay the dead-he never would say, "This is my business," again -the wine-maker might say so. Both were silent. - Neither would own his, work. In the vaults of that house, three thousand dollars worth-no, cost-of wines were stored. Fifty thousand dollars worth of the richest rosewood and mahogany furniture, china, cut glass,ad silver ware, stood idle, while its late possessor lay in his coffin upon the threshold, with his family standing around, vainly asking permission to rest the body of the dead owner one night, in its journey to the tomb. What should they do? Walter, if he had been there, could have directed what to do. He was not. Then he was cursed in thought, if not word, because he was not there. "It is 'all his fault," said Elsie; "it was his abominable marriage that killed father." Where was her husband? She looked around for him. He had slipped away " to get a drink." What a brute, she thought. So he was. That is what going to " get a drink " makes of a man. "We must go to Mr. Grundy's," said the widow. How? The hearse and hack were gone, and could not be got back in an hour. A passing cart was called, and the coffin of the millionaire placed upon it, and the family followed, to knock at the door of a neighbor's house, with the same results-to be answered by another sheriffs officer, but who, by chance, happening to be an American,-and pos- sessed of common sense enough to know that the dead would not steal, and those who attended upon him would not be i- ,0n  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7638-00000091"/> 1-72          HOT CORN. likely to do so, he- opened the door, lit the gas, called up one or two of the servants still left in the house, and did a few other things that natural humanity -dictates upon such- an occasion.

Here, I draw the curtain. You have already seen the ter- mination of a man who could leave his young wife and her  dead father standing in the street, to go and " get a drink." It was him that died in the rat hole, in Cow Bay.- It was Elsie that told how he died, how she gave birth to a child by the side of her dead husband, and how the rats suck]ed up the life blood of that child. You have seen Matilda, before. Turn back to a picture, in Chapter V., and look at her upon her wedding-day. It is needless for me to go with you along the beaten path of her career, down, down, down, from ball-room to bar-room; from house of   "a place to meet a friend"--to a house of ' ladies' boarding-house"--to a house of common resort-the abode of wretchedness, woe, sin, degradation, disease, andL "painted sepulchres "-from that to a low room, with "-my man," and, finally, to fill the picture in the Two- penny Marriage.

Ah, I see now; Athalia never told of their failure, and how all their wealth vanished like morning dew; that all those five dollar carpets, thousand dollar mirrors, and single chairs that cost more than all your neat furniture, were- sold'under the hammer to pay debts; and that Walter had not a cent in the world, and that he lived a long time upon the money which she earned, with, 'C 'Work, work, work.

" "And did Walter do nothing ." What could he do?    He knew nothing-had never learned to do anything; besides that, how could he take to any occupation, when he had always been alove work, and free from want. If his father had put him into his counting- room with old Precision, he might have been a good book- keeper, and could now have had employment upon a salary. As it was, he was a useless, worthless member of society. His father had lbeen asked, if-he did not think of putting Walter into some situation where he would learn to help him- self, but his answer was, "that is my business;" and there ended the matter. Finally, after some months of idleness, supported by his young wife's toil, a few friends concluded to advance him a thousand dollars, to go South, where, as he thought, he could make a fortune; and if he got away where nobody knew him, he could go into some sort of business. Athalia ent with him. They landed at Savannah, put up at the best hotel, four dollars a day, and win- and cigars, upon an average, six more. It was easy to calculate just how long a thousand  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7638-00000095"/> 180          HOT CORN. dollars would last at that business. Athalia pined in idle- ness; of course, a young "Northern merchant's" wife could not use her needle in a city where a lady, of ally pretensions to fashion, would not help herself to a glass of water if the pitcher stood at her eldow. A slave, always ready at her bidding, must be called to wait upon " young missus." It did not take Walter long to form new acquaintances; besides, he met with several of his old college chums, and so it was a day here and a night there, upon this plantation and that; of course, his pretty wife was always welcome, so long as nobody knew that she was a sewing girl. That secret leaked out at last, and then- "What then?" Then those who had courted and fawned around the rich merchant's wife, and thought she was the prettiest and best bred woman, and most intelligent, they had ever met with, and the most modest and most amiable- "So she was. I never saw her equal." Nor they either-but then she was a sewing girl, when he married her-perhaps never was married. That was finally annexed by envious, malicious, jealous rivals, who. felt her superiority, and how much more she was admired by the gentlemen than they were. All this came at last, by a true friend-a slave-to Athalia's ear. She had felt the chilling change, and, finally, obtained the secret from her yellow chambermaid. Her mind was instantly made up. That night-sheiacked her trunk; Walter, as usual, was out' aattending to business,' such as young men   WLIS  SCENES 'IN -NEW YORK.     181 often attend to at -midnight in some private back room, sitting around a table, counting spots upon -little bits of pasteboard.

She waited- in vain' for Walter, and then wrote a long letter, detailing all the facts and giving ample reasons for her course, and begging him to abandon his; to settle up what matters he had as soon as possible and follow, her. Then she laid down for a short nap, with orders to Mary to wake her if Mr. Morgan came in, and if not, tot call- her :in time for the boat at any rate, and then to give him the letter. It was -an impulsive step, but that was her nature. "So it was. She always thought and acted at the same moment; and almost always right." In one week she -was back in her old -room, which she had let temporarily during her absence. - In one week more she. had an additional room and a few girls at work for her at dress-making.

In three months she had ceased to pay rent for furniture; she had bought and paid for it, and was makin'g weekly deposits of little sums in the savings bank. Then her hus- band-came back.

How her little store melted under this accumulation of expense! Finally, they got agiping again, and she persuaded him to get into some kind of employment. What could he do? There was but one "genteel"-mark the word-business that he knew of. He became a bar keeper. He had one regular customer. It was Walter Morgan! Down hill is an easy road. He took it. Athalia soon found some of her best customers dropping off. "What was the cause ." There were two. In the first place Walter had been the means of getting a notorious courtezan to give her custom to his wife. - He brought her there and introduced her as Mrs. Layton, formerly of South Carolina, now living with her nieces and daughter in this city. She used to -come often, always in her carriage, with liveried servants. Once Athalia rode home with her to fit a dress to "A sick young lady, that boarded with her." She found that Mrs. Layton lived in an elegant four story house, near a church and in a very respectable neighborhood in a fashionable street. Her rooms were furnished with a degree of splendor almost equal to the Morgans.- Little did she suspect the character of the house, particularly as her husband had introduced her there. But there was anothel cause why she lost her best custo- tomers, In a fashionable boir6e, to whichWalter still found   "FE SCENES 'IN NEW  Y  oRE.

It was only a marriage of convenience. "A mistress-a mistress-oh! that alters the case.

Her husband had tended bar, until his employer found that he drank up all the profits. Now he   . was drinking up the hard earnings of his wife. Then he began to stay out nights. Where, she could only guess. One day she sent him to pay the rent. It was the last money she had. About a week after, the landlord called for it. He had not seen Walter, had not been paid, and was very sorry for ler, but- he must have. the rent. "Would he wait a few days? she hoped her husband would pay it." There was a curl of derision upon his lip. What could it nean? "Fact is, Mrs. Morgan, or Miss Lovetree, or whatever your lame is, I let the premises to you, and look to you for the ent.

He had   "FJ' SCENES- IN NE-W YOREK.     10 done. so now. All was gone, even her large Bible, the present of her dying mother.  Her only alternative was to get a Jew to come and look at the furniture, and advance enough to pay the rent. On the way she thought she would take a dress home, and get the money for that. -She knew it was going to a house of bad repute; she had been obliged to work for such, and on several occasions Walter had carried theim home. It was a sort of perquisite with him to get the pay for such. She looked for the dress, that-too was gone. There-was another to go to the same house, which she could finish in about an hour. It was her only resource for the necessities of to-morrow. At nine o'clock she took it upon her arm and went out, and with trembling step, up to the door of a mag- nificent house, only one block from Broadway. As the door opened for her, half-a-dozen '" up town bloods," came out. "-I say,'" said one of them, before he was out of her hearing, "I say, Fied, that is Walt.

Such is the opinion of the roue--that the door of woman's affections is always open for every self-conceited puppy to walk in. Her heart was in her throat. She choked it down, and went in and inquired for Miss Nannette, and was shown up to her room. A gentleman was there, whom Nannette intro- duced as Mr. Smith, from the South. He might: be from the South, but Athalia knew him to be a married man, with a sweet young wife and two children, in this city. The dress was to be tried on, and Nannette began to strip off without a blush. Athalia did blush, and did object, and would not stay. "Well, then, George, go down a few minutes to the parlor, that is a good soul, she is so fastidious." No, he did not want to be seen there; he would go home. "Well, then, give me some money to pay for making this dress. You gave me the stuff, you might as well go the whole figure." He handed her a tenhidollar bill; she handed it to Athalia, -the dress was only five-remarking: "Give him the change; I won't take but a five out of it this time." Athalia: had no change. She looked at him, to be certain of her man, and remarked: "No- I will keep the whole, and credit him the balance, on :account of seven dollars he has owed me these two months, for work for his wife.' -     t    "FE SCENES '1N- NEW YORK,.    18 He stammered something about mistake-not him-:-cursed blunder--and left the room. The dress fitted beautifully, and Athalia felt the soothing influence of praise for her work, and would have left happier than she came, but just then her ear caught a voice in the next room. She listened. A woman replied: "Yes, if you have brought any money. I have made up my mind that you shall not stay in this room another night without you give me more money." "Oh, Josephine, I have got something better than money for you. Look here."      " "Oh! you are a dear good fellow, after all. What a pretty watch, and what a dear little locket. That will do. Now you may stay all night, and to-morrow we will go down to Coney Island again, and have a good time. I'll pass for your wife, you know." There was a door opening out of Nannette's room into-a bath-room, and out of that, a window into the room where the voices came from. It was but a thought; thoughts are quick, and so were her's, and the step that took her up on a chair, and her hand up to the curtain, which was the only thing preventing her from seeing who owned that voice. She looked. What a sight for a wife!- She saw, what she knew before, but would be doubly sure, that the voice was her husband's. She knew that-she knew that he was giving her watch, and the locket which contained the donor's like- ness, that of a dear brother lost at sea-a treasure that she '  .*n-  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7638-00000099"/> 188         HOT CORN. would not part with sooner than her own heart-to a woman to whom he had before given money-money that came, drop by drop,; distilled from her heart's blood, through the alembic of her needle; and she would see-what woman would not- what wife could resist the opportunity of seeing .--she could not-what the woman looked like, who could displace her in her husband's affections. The first sight she caught was her Bible upon the harlot's table. "What could she want of that .?" She was sometimes religious-a great many of them are- and read the Bible to find some text to justify their own course. They are also visited by clergymen, who prefer those of "a religious turn of mind." Then this Bible was elegantly bound, and very valuable. Then she saw her watch in the hands of a woman with ugly red hair, with dull, voluptuous eyes, thick lips, ugly teeth, a little snub nose, and a gaunt awkward figure, forming, altogether, one of the ugliest looking women, Athalia thought, that she had ever seen, The words burst involuntarily from her lips: "Oh, how ugly!" ' She is uglier than she looks," said Nannette. "She has ruined more men than any other woman in the city. She has kicked that fool out half a dozen times, because he did not give her more money. I should not wonder now, if he has stolen his wife's watch to give that wretch." And this was the woman that Athalia had been toiling for her husband to pamper.

She sat down a few minutes, to recover from this last stab in the heart, and then said she would look- once more and then go home. She did look, and saw her husband locked in the arms of that red-headed fury. - Then she went home; she did not go to bed; she worked all night putting her things in order.

ALTHOUGH all my scenes are connected, and bear some ) relation one to the other, yet they are not continuous. Like the Panorama of Niagara, we must go back, cross over, look up, look down, first from this point of view, then from that, to see all the scenes of that wonder of wonders.  So here, where a mighty torrent rushes on, sweeping a multitude down the great cascade, we have to look at scene after scene, before we can join them all together into one panoramic view. - Our scenes, too, are as real and life-like as those., Sometimes a tree here, a flowerthere, then a little spray, then a cloud, or the natural color, a little heightened to give effect, and make the picture more vivid; but the rocks and rushing torrent, the real foundation of -the picture, are all as nature made them.

I suppose there are some who will turn away in disgust from the double title of this chapter. What, they will say, can "Life at the Five Points " have in it that is interesting to me, who lounge on silk brocatelle, and look down upon beg- gar girls and rag-pickers-disgusting objects-through lace curtains that cost more, to every window, than would furnish a hundred families in that locality with better furniture than they now possess? No doubt you will turn away in disgust at the very sight of the title of "The Rag-picker's Daughter." Yet you may find something in the character of "Madalina," which will make you love the name. I should not wonder, in some of my walks through the city in future years, to hear that pretty name spoken to some sweet child, yet to be born in rose- perfumed chamber. Then pass not by my tale of one so lowly. See how sweet is a cup of cold water to the dying. Read. "Sir," said the doorkeeper, to Mr. Pease, one night, " little Madalina, the beggar girl, is at the door, crying bitterly, and says she wants to see you." "I suppose," said the tired missionary, "I answered hastily,   "FS SCENES IJN NElW YORK.      193 perhaps petulantly, for I had been very much engaged all day.

"4Tom," said Mr. P., "Tom, my dear boy, what is -the mat- ter-." Tom did not turn round as he had been taught, and usually did, so- as to look him full in the face when he answered; in fact he did not answer readily; there was a choking sensation in his utterance which prevented the words from coming forth distinctly. Now, this boy had been but a short time in "the Home," and perhaps a more squalid, wretched, drunken boy, cannot be found in the purlieus of the Five Points, than he was when he was almost literally picked out of the gutter, as he had been once before he came here finally, in the way you have already seen. -Once before, he had actually been dragged out of the filthiest hole in Anthony street, brought in, washed and dressed, before he came to, so as to be conscious of the change that had come over him. Then he was brought back again to his low degradation, -by just such wretches and ways of the wicked as were brought to bear upon poor Reagan, and will be upon many others, while the destroyer is permitted to walk abroad like a pestilence at noon-day.

Were the reminiscences of one, almost as low down in the scale of humanity, running through his mind---one who, after having been herself lifted up, had exerted an influence upon him to his salvation?  The tired missionary forgot his fatigue. "Tom," said he, springing up, "I will go and see what is the matter. Who is this Madalina?" "She is an Italian rag-picker's daughter, sir-they live in Cow Bay-I used to lodge with them sometimes. That is, the mother picks rags, and the father .goes with the hand- organ and monkey."

"Oh, a poor little girl flying for fear from her own parents, because they are drinking and fighting so."

"Then you don't want to beg, Madalina! Why not?' "Because people push me, and curse me, and to-day one man kicked me right here, sir." And she laid her hand upon her stomach, and a little groan of anguish and accusation against the unfeeling monster who had done the deed, went to the recording angel, and was set down in the black cata- logue of rum-selling crimes, for a day of retribution yet to come.  "Kicked you! What for? Were you saucy?" "No, sir; I am never saucy. My mother says if I am saucy, men won't give me anything. I must be very quiet, and not talk any, nor answer any questions."

"Law, pshaw! what has your book-law to do with rag- pickers' law?" "True enough; or 'father confessors,' either." The next morning Tom made his report. At first it was a positive refusal. "'She can make sixpence a day, and pick up enough to eat.'" "Well then' she shall pay you sixpence a day. She can soon learn to sew and earn more than that. Juliana does it every day." "But she shall not stay there nights. They will make a Protestant of her." "That was not the sticking point," says Tom, " tshe stays here, she cannot make a of her there.

The work is more than half done. Madalina, though still suffering from her brutal treatment, was a happy girl when she found that she was not to be driven out to beg in the streets. But she could not understand why her mother wanted her to sleep at home. Tom could. "Too young! Pooh! before she is a year older, she will be lost." Too true! Before she had been in " the Home " six months, she had learned to read, write, arid work, and had grown much in stature and fine looks. Then she would have been placed in some good family, but her mother would not consent. She still com- plainedt of her breast, and had frequent turns of vomiting. She always felt worse in the morning, "because," she said, "that was such a- dreadful place to sleep." 9*  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7638-00000106"/> 202          HOT CORN. Sometimes she did not come for a few days; her mother made her stay at home and sew.  She had learned to work, and her services were worth more at that than beg-  ging. One night she came in, in great haste, crying. "What is the matter, Madalina 8. "My mother has had an offer for me." "An offer for you. What is that 2" Tom looked daggers. "I told you so." O" "What is it, my good girl. Tell me all about it." "My mother bid me go out with her this evening, both of us dressed in our best. She said she had an offer for me, and was going to meet the man in Duane street. "' What does the man want of me, mother .' said I. "Oh, he will make a fine lady of you, and you will live with him.'

"But we went on, and I held my head down, and felt very bad. By-and-by I heard my mother say,' Here she is,' and I  looked up a little, and saw two gentlemen--that is, they were clothed like gentlemen-and directly one spoke to the other. "' I say, Jim, she will do; give the old woman the money, and let us take her up to Kate's.' t 'Mercy on me, that voice! I felt that sore spot in my breast grow more and more painful.

"What did you do?" - "I stood a little behind my mother while she held out her hand for the money, and when their eyes were turned I ran. I only heard them say, 'Why, damn her, she is gone.' Yes,- I was gone, and here I am. Oh, I am so sick and so faint! do let me lay down, and don't let those men have me. Oh dear, the thought of it will kill me .!" So it did. A cruel blow had fallen upon a tender plank. The beggar girl might not have felt it. -The little seamstress did. A taste of virtue, civilization, Christianity, friendship, love, had given the food of sin and shame a hated taste. Sold by a mother to a libidinous brute-to a miserable rum-selling, -worse than rum-drinking--wretch, who wears gentlemanly garments, and kicks, burns, and gags little beggar girls. It was too much for human nature to bear, and it sunk under this last blow, worse than the first. Madalina went to bed with a raging fever-a nervous pros- tration. All that kindness and skill could do, was done for the poor sufferer; but what could we do for the body, when the heart was sick .  - Next morning her mother came and insisted that she should go home. They begged, pleaded, and promised in vain; go she must. "Never mind," said Madalina, " it will be only for a little, little while.

You will come and see me. Good bye. Tom, you will? It was an honest, manly tear that Tom turned away to hide. Poor fellow, he need not have been ashamed of it. Such is nature. "She is worse, sir," said Tom, one morning, "and no won- der. I wish you would go and see her; she wants to see you once more. Such a place to be sick in! oh, dear!!hoew did I ever sleep there I wish you would go with me to-night, 'about ten o'clock, when they are all in. You will see life as it is." "Very well, Tom, I will go. Call for me at ten, or when you are ready."  It was my fortune to drop in upon that very evening, and form one of the company to that abode of misery,-that home of the city poor,--so that I am able to describe it in my own langtuage. The place where Madalina lived, is a well known Five Points locality, called "' Cow Bay." As you go up that great Broadway of wealth, fashion, lux- ury, and extravagance of this great city, from the Park and its marble halls of justice, you will pass another great marble front --it is the palace of trade, where the rich are clothed every day in fine linens, when they go " shopping at Stewarts." Further along are great marts, where velvet coverings for the floor are sold; for there are some who have never trod upon bare boards. You need not look down Duane street, unless you have a curiosity to see the spot where a miserable mother r    "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.       205 would sell the virtue of her child to a wretch whose trade is seduction. Doni't look into that little old wooden shanty at the corner of Pearl street; it is a " family grocery." The little ragged girl you see coming out with a rusty tin coffee-pot, has not been there for milk for her sick mother-her father is in the hospital on the opposite side of the way-his arm was broken in a " family quarrel." You will pass the Broad- way Theatre- before you reach the next corner, with its sur- roundings of fashionable "saloons," into any of which you may go without fear of losing caste among genteel brandy- smashers and wine-bibbers. Perhaps you will be amused with a small play, such as burning, kicking, or vomiting a little beggar girl; for nice young men are fond of theatrical amusements.' Do not go into that place of "fashionable resort," the theatre, if it is a hot evening, for it is worse ven- tilated than the black-hole of Calcutta, and if the fetid air - does not breed a fever, it will breed a feverish thirst, which will tempt you to quench it in potations of poison. Probably that is why it was thus built. A few steps beyond is Anthony street. Stop a moment here, and look up and down the great thoroughfare of New- York before you leave it. A -hundred pedestrians pass you every minute; almost without an exception, every one of them richly dressed men and women, smiling in joy and happiness, Here is an exception, certainly.

They have brought their heavy loads all the long way from Murray street. They turn down Anthony,; look where they go. , If they live in that street, it cannot be far, for there, in plain view, stands a large frame house, corner-wise towards you, right in the middle of the street. No, it only looks so, it is beyond the end of it. Yet look, note it well, the corner of that house so plain in view, pointing towards you, is one of the world-wide- known Fiye Points of New-York. "What! not so near Broadway, right in plain sight of all who wear silks and broadcloth, and go up and down that street every day? Surely that is not the place where all those bad, miserable, poor outcasts live, that the newspapers talk so much about." "The- very spot, my dear lady.' "Really, this must be looked to. It is quite too bad to think that place is so near our fashionable street, and in sight too. I thought it was away off somewhere the other side of town. If I thought it would do any good, I would let Peter take a few dollars and some old clothes, and go down -with them to-morrow." "Try it, madam. Better go yourself.

So I followed down Anthony, past some very old rat- harbor houses, filled with human beings, almost as thick as those quadrupeds burrow in a rotten wharf; so on they go across Elm; now they stand a moment on the edge of Centre, for one of the little boys has taken hold of his mother's dress to pull her back-for she cannot look up with her load--with a sudden cry of, "Stop, old woman!

She did run with her great load, till she almost dropped under its overwhelming weight. Why should she thus labor-thus expend so much strength to so little purpose? She knew no other way to live. Nobody gave her remunerative labor for strong hands; nobody took those two stout boys, and set them to till the earth, or taught them how to create bread, and yet they must eat, and so they prowl about the pulled- down houses, snatching everything they can carry away--a sort of permitted petty larceny, that teaches those who practice it how to do bigger deeds; and those old timbers they split up into kindling wood and peddle through the streets.

On they went, down Anthony street; and I followed, deter- mined to see the home of this portion of the city poor. It was but one block further-only one little space beyond this great, wide, open, railroad street, whose thoughtless thousands daily go up and down from homes of wealth to wealth-producing ships and stores, little thinking of -the amount of human misery within a stone's throw of the rails on which they glide swiftly along. One block further, and the street opens into a little, half acre sort of triangular space, sometimes dignified with the name of " park," but why, those who know can only tell, for it has no fence, no grass, and but a dozen miserable trees; 'tis lumbered up with carts and piles of stones, and strings of drying clothes, and scores of unwashed specimens of young humanity, whose home is in the dirt, whether in the street or- parents' domicil. tiere let us stop and look around. A very short street, only one block across the base of the " park," runs to the right from where we stand, past the "Five Points House of Indus- try," to Cross street. axThis is the, most 'notorious little street in New York. Its namne is Little Water street. It lead from the "Old Brewery " to "Cow Bay." Who that has lived long in this city, or read its history, particularly that portion of it written by Dickens, has not heard of the "Old Brewery?" It is not there now. That awful den of crime, poverty, and wretched drunken misery has been pulled down, and in its   "FE SCEN'ES IN NEW YOR K.       20$ place a substantial brick edifice, in which is a chapel and school-room, and home of another missionary, has been erected by the noble, generous efforts of the Ladies' Home Missionary Society, of the Methodist Church. The old tenants have been driven out or reformed. How different, too, are the present occupants of that large brick pile in Little Water street, fi om those who filled its numerous rooms before the missionary came there. Every room was a brothel or a den of thieves, or both combined. Now it is a house of prayer-a home for the homeless-a place of refuge for midnight wandering little beggar girls. Before us lies the misnamed, neglected triangle, called a park. iAt the further end is the frame house that we see so plainly as we look down Anthony street from Broadway. At the left, as though it were a continuation of Little Water street, lies that notorious Five Points collection of dens of misery, Cow Bay. It is a cul-de-sac, perhaps thirty feet wide at the mouth, narrowing, with -crooked, uneven lines,!ack to a point about a hundred feet from the entrance. Into this court I tracked the kindling-wood-splitters, and threaded my way among the throng of carts and piles of steaming garbage; elbowing my way along the narrow side-walk, and up a flight of broken, almost impassable steps, I reached the first floor hall of one of the houses, just in time to see that great load of wood and its bearer toiling up a narrow, dark, broken stair- way, which I essayed to climb; but just then, from the room on the left, at the foot of the stairs, there came such a piercing, murder-telling, woman's shriek, that I started back, grasped  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7638-00000110"/> 210          HOT CORN. my stout cane, determined to brave the worst for the rescue, made one step, pushed open the door, creaking with a horrid grating upon its rusty hinges, and stood in the presence of an Eve, before the fall, in point of clothing, but long, long after that in point of sin. As I entered the open door, she sprung towards it; her husband caught her by the hair, and drew her back, with no gentle hand or word. "Let me go, let me go-help!-he wants to murder me; let me go-help, help, help!"   - I did help, but it was help to the poor man, for she turned upon him with the fury of a tiger, scratching and tearing his face and clothes, and then settling with a grasp upon his throat, which produced the death-rattle of suffocation. A strong silk handkerchief served the hand-cuffs place, and to bind hands and feet together; after which she lay quietly upon a little straw and rags, in one corner, the only articles of furniture in the room, except a bottle, broken cup, and something that looked as though it once had been female apparel.

And he stepped to the miserable bed; and lifted the dirty rag of a quilt, looked a moment upon the pale boy, dropped upon his knees, raised him in his arms, looked again wildly, and fell back fainting as he exclaimed, "Great God, he is dead!" What little I could do or say to relieve such heart-crush- ing woe as overwhelmed this poor father of- that murdered child-this miserable husband   of that wretched, crazy- rum-crazy woman, was soon done. What else could I do than call in a police officer to take her away to prison? whence she went to the hospital, then to the drunkard's uncared-for, unwept-over grave!

We looked in as we passed. The back room was ten by twelve feet square, inhabited by two black men and their wives, and a white woman-lodger, who " sometimes has company." Here they eat, drink, and sleep,-cook, wash, and iron. - The latter operation is performed on the bottom of the wash-tub, for there is no table. The fiont room, eight by fourteen feet, contained five blacks, men and women. Each of these rooms rented for four dollars a month, in advance. A dark centre room, occupied by a white woman, was only six by seven feet, for which she paid fifty cents a week. On the third floor, the dark centre room, same size, was occupied by a real good looking, young, healthy German woman, with her husband, a great burly negro, as black as Africa's own son, and a fine looking little white boy, four years old, as a lodger. We found the door shut, and no ventilator bigger than the key-hole. There was a smell about the air. In the back room, ten by twelve, we found the wood-split- ters-the woman and her two boys, a negro and his wife, a woman lodger, and occasional company. The rent of this room is one dollar a week in advance. The total amount of furniture, was not good security for one week's rent.

These stand a little way apart, with a couple of boards laid across the space. On these boards there had been an attempt to make a bed, of sundry old coats, a dirty blanket, and other vermin harbors. On this bed lay the poor little sufferer. Not so very little either. In her own native Italy she had been counted almost a woman.

It would evidently have been a source of great gratification to Tom, to have pitched five or six of them out of the win- dow. But there were dark eyes scowling on him, out of a dozen sockets of men who come from the land of the stiletto, and looked now as though they could as readily use it as play the organ and lead the monkey. I looked about, and counted six men or stout bovs, and eight women and girls, besides several children, monkeys,   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.      215 tambourines and hand organs. In one corner was the rag- picker's store. This haid been the bed of Madalina until this evening, she grew so much worse, that she was lifted up to the bed I have described. But here she had not escaped the torment of the monkeys. They had long been her companions and seemed determined to be so still. They were climbing up and down, or sitting chattering on her bed. Late as it was in the evening there were several fresh arrivals of parties of musicians and rag-pickers from their distant walks. Several were at supper. A long, black table with a wooden bench, on either side, was furnished with two wooden trays, which had seen long service and little soap. Into these was ladled from time to time, the savory contents of a large pot simmer- ing upon the stove. Each guest helped himself with fingers and spoon. Whether the stew was composed of monkey meat, or two days old veal, I cannot say. That onions formed a strong part of the ingredients, we had olfactory demonstration. Some of the party indulged in a bottle of wine, and we smelt something very much like bad rum or worse brandy; but generally speaking, this class of the city poor are not great drunkards. One end of the room was entirely occupied by a camp bed. That is, in that narrow space of ten feet, ten human beings, big and little, of both sexes, laid down side by side. The balance of the family lay around here and there; some- on and some under the table, some on great black chests, of which each family had one, wherein they lock all their personal goods from their pilfering room mates.

Will some of my readers, who faint at the smell of unsavory food, or who could not sleep but in fresh linen and well ailred rooms, fancy what must be the feelings of poor Madalina, who had just begun to taste of the comforts of civilized life, now sick and dying in such a room, where the penny candle only served to make the thick clouds of tobacco smoke more visible and more suffocating . One of the difficulties in all these close-packed rooms is the necessity of keeping the door always shut, to prevent pilfer- ing, thus leaving the only chance for fresh air to enter, or foul air to escape, by the one small window in the roof. Having given you a view of the room, and its inhabitants and furniture, let us look again upon poor Madalina, as she lies .panting for breath upon her hard pallet. Her face, naturally dark, has an unhealthy whiteness spread over it, and there is, a small, bright crimson spot upon one cheek-the other is hidden in the taper fingers of the hand upon which it rests. Such a pair of bright black eyes! Oh, how beautiful! Her wavy locks of jet, are set off by a clean, white handker- chief, spread over the bundle of rags which forms her pillow, by one of her visitors. Now, in spite of pain, there is a smile lighting up her face, and showing such a set of teeth as a princess might ,covelt Whence this happy smile?

It was no use; she was inexorable. The padre was a very good doctor-the padre was good for her soul-the padre would pray for her; and if she was to die, she should not die in the house of a heretic. So we parted. It was a hard parting, for she clung to each one as she said: "Good bye; I wish I could go with you, but my mother- you have taught me to obey my mother, that all good chil- dren obey their mothers-so good, bye--good bye, Tom. You will bring me another drink to-.morrow? yes, I knew you would, if I asked you, you are so good to me." There were tears at parting, and they were not all tears of a sick child, or good boy, but"strong men wept. "Tom,"' said the feeble, sobbing voice, after we had almost reached the door, over the careless sleepers on the floor; ' Tom, come back a minute, I want to-want to-say-what if I should not see you again?

What he felt I cannot tell. I will not tell what I felt after the first flow of scalding tears had passed away, but I fear there was an unforgiving spirit in my heart; and if the foot which crushed that tender flower had been there then, per- haps it and its fellow had not carried their moving powel, the head, "this side up with care." Perhaps that head would have been pitched headlong down' these long, steep, dark, and narrow stairs, to the pavement-less hard than its guiding heait.

AT the close of chapter nine, we left Athalia standing by the side of her truik and bandbox on the sidewalk, in front of her now empty home. After paying   up the rent, and a few outstanding little bills, she had but a scanty store left in her little purse. Of this she set apart, as a sacred deposit, almost the entire sum, to redeem her Bible and watch-the locket at any rate. Now she wished she could see Nannette, for she was the only instrument she knew, that she could employ in the negociation. She could not go where she lived, for fear of meeting Walter, whom she had determined never to see again. She had sent for a hack to take her away, she really knew not where.   She had but few, except business acquaintances in the city; none upon whom  she felt willing to call in her emergency. She felt so cast down, that she could not look one of them in the face.

How should she see her? what should she do? It is an old proverb, "Wish for the devil and he will appear." Just then a carriage drove up and stopped where she stood. She was so certain it was the one she had sent for, that she did not observe that it contained two ladies, until the driver had opened the door, and one of them spoke. "Why, Mrs. Morgan, are you going away . How unfortu- nate. I wanted three or four dresses made. When will you s be back?" When 2 How could she tell, since she -did not know where she was going? She was in a fever of excitement to go some- where, to get away before Walter should come. She felt as though it would kill her to see him then. All day she had been calm; she had found it absolutely necessary, in order to keep herself so, to drink two or three glasses of wine. If it had been wine, such as the fermented juice of grapes will make, it had not done her material harm ; but it was such as is made in this city, or " got up " expressly for this market; and she began to feel the effects of the alcohol it contained dying away. She felt as though-she was dying, too. She did not, therefore, hesitate long, or refuse the pressing invitation of Mrs. Laylor to go home with her and stay all night. Although she began to suspect the character of.;!Vrs. Laylor's house, she did not know it, or her either, or ihe would have spent the night where she stood rather than in her best room. She was still further induced to go, when she found that   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.       227 her companion was Nannette. True, there was a flash, a mere flash of thought across her mind, why so common a woman as Nannette should be in the carriage of so reserved a lady; one who, if she was guilty of slight improprieties herself would not be suspected for the world, and had no charity for the inmates of houses in M  street. *Little thought Athalia, that Nannette, when she visited Mrs. Laylor's, passed for " a very respectable married lady, who would not be known for anything-it would ruin her;" or else, when dressed in deep mourning, with a thick veil over her face, which nothing could induce her to remove, was a "very interesting young widow, of one of the first families in the city, who was obliged, by necessity, to accept the love of a gentleman-a married gentleman--who visited her house, but would not make the acquaintance of any woman ex- cept one in just such a condition as this 'sweet young widow.'" I know, I speak it boldly, a woman now living in this city, in up-town style, upon money obtained from six dupes, every one of whom she had " on a string" at the same time, and some of whom she used to meet at that very house, under just such guises. I say it, still more boldly and truly, for "old sores must be seen to be healed," that she has thus duped the whole six in one day. I know the woman-I know five of the dupes, and that each one of them has a wife.

Athalia little suspected all this; still less did she suspect that she had been watched all day; that her order for a car- riage even had been intercepted, and Mrs. Laylor had come in its stead. She did not know then that the stable owner was the paramour of Mrs. Laylor, and Nannette the pimp qf this most dangerous woman-dangerous, because she struck her game, both male and female, out of the upper class of society, giving them a fair start on the road down to a cellar in Cow Bay.   We have seen one of the Morgan family that she started on that course, who run a swift race. She is now fishing for another-already has her in her net, for she has ordered Cato to put up the baggage-already has Athalia seated by her side, condoling with her in her afflictions, giving her sweet sympathy, telling her a few truths and many lies--" instru- ments of darkness" win by such--wondering how she could have lived with her bad husband so long as she had, when she could live so much better-" by the needle "--without such a man. She does not propose another now-of course not; she will bide her time for that, when all her plots have ripened the seed she is now sowing. They were soon at home; before Athalia had half done telling how fearful she was of meeting Walter, and how she wianted to get'out of town before he discovered her; and then Mrs. Laylor told:er how very private she could be at her house-she would give her the third floor back room, and f- :   "FE SCENES IN NE W YXORK.-      22 send her meals up to her, and she need not see a single soul but Nannette and herself, besides the chamber-maid-" none but your best friends." Why did Mrs. Laylor whisper Nannette, and why did she run in the basement way, and why did they have to wait ten minutes for the' door to be opened?  And where was Athalia's thick veil, with which she had intended to hide her face so that no one would see her, for the excitement of the day had flushed her cheeks, and made her fascinatingly beau- tiful, and she had no desire to expose it, to -tempt the passion of any one who might chance to meet her? "Where can my veil be, I am  sure I had it in my hand when I got in the carriage?" ' I cannot see; perhaps Nannette has gathered it up with her shawl." So-she had. It had been slipped into the folds of it on purpose, for Mrs. Laylor was already working her plans, and counting the hundred dollars that she was going to charge some rich fool for bringing about a meeting with " one of the handsomest women in the city-a dress-maker, fresh from the country." In furtherance of this object of a wicked woman, in pursuit of gain, she had sent Nannette into the house, to station one of her dupes where he could see, without being seen, the  unveiled face of Athalia, as she passed in, and up the stairs. For this purpose, the usually dark hall had ' been lighted, and the veil stolen.

He would have sought a wife, but his salary would not support one in the style that she would demand, or his congregation expect their pastor to maintain; and so he sought indulgence where he had found out accidentally that some of the -members of his own church had sought it for themselves. He had slipped in, with handkerchief over his face, just before Mrs. Laylor went out. She told him that she was going to the railroad depot to meet. a young woman from the country, a dress-maker, whom she had sent for,! to come and make a few dresses for her and "my daughter," as she unblushingly, called Nannette, who, she said, "had been away from home, at school." The words were true, yet the speech was a lie, a wicked lie, made to deceive one who had been unwary enough to put his finger in a trap.. She had been away from home, a home where she left a mother, and brothers, and sisters. And she had been at school-a school where language and manners are taught; but, oh! what language, and what ways, and manners. It is a school which is computed to have thirty thousand teachers in this city. What strange inconsistencies our human nature is possessed of. This Nannette had naturally a good heart. We saw that in the scene where Mrs. Morgan discovers the depth of depravity to which one of those teachers had dragged down her husband. 'et, no sooner is Athalia plDaced by misfor- tune in a position to be subject to temptation, than she offers   "FE SCENES IN NEW   YORK.      231 231 her gratuitous services to Mrs. Laylor, to effect her complete ruin. What for?  Who can answer? I cannot, unless the fable of the fox that lost his tail in a trap, will give a cue to the solution. I fear, that we are too apt to wish others no better than: ourselves. It must have been some such motive that actuated   Nannette: the little pecuniary advantage offered by Mrs. Laylor for her assistance, does not seem to be a sufficient motive for (one female, though she herself has lost the priceless jewel of female virtue, to wish to bring another of her sex into that vortex which engulfs all who come within its maelstrom  power, as certain as that upon the Norway coast.

As a nom de plume, I will call .him, Otis, because it is the most dissimilar to his own, of any one I can think of. Otis had been tempted to visit this house, as I said before, by a natural strong passion, but that would have been insuffi- cient, had not a sort of Paul Pry friend told him of the delinquency of one of his flock, and urged him to watch him.

Goaded with such an accusation, he retorted upon his informer, and he in his turn reiterated the charge, and urged Otis to " call on a professional (that is pastoraD visit," and satisfy himself. This he did, and. found the house most genteelly and richly furnished; the owner, " a widow, living," she said, " upon the interest of money in bank,"--she meant the interest of bankers' money-a very modest, genteel lady, very much pleased to have him call, and begged him to repeat the visit "some afternoon or evening when the young ladies, her nieces and daughter, would be at home, and if he was fond of music, they would play for him, and one of them could sing beautifully." She could sing the "Mermaid's song." He was completely deceived. Who might not be by such a siren? The truth is, that her penetrating eye had seen at a glance quite down into his very secret thoughts, and that he possessed passions which she could inflame and turn to account, and she laid all her plans to that end. Although satisfied, after one or two visits, that all the inmates of the house were correct, he had his suspicions aroused as to those who visited them, for he could not help noticing the fact, that while he was there one evening, there were no less than five calls, apparently of couples, who were received in a dark hall, with whispered words, and then went upstairs, and after awhile went out in the same quiet '   fi. c, he s w through the crack of the door that the ladiewere veiled with thick:ifrk veils, such as we meet every day upon the Broad-   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.       233 way side-walk. But the most convincing thing of all, was an incautious word spoken aloud,.by one of the visitors as Mrs. Laylor was letting him out. He knew the voice. It was the man whose conduct had led him first to this house. Then he was so well satisfied, that he told Mrs. Laylor his suspicions, and she acknowledged that she did sometimes let a room to a gentleman and lady, but to none except persons of the highest respectability, such as himself, for instance. That was a cue.  He took it and fell into the snare. She agreed "for a consideration," to introduce him to one of the most respectable ladies, upon the understanding that she was to remain closely veiled,--as the whole'proceeding was to be veiled from the Argus eyes of the world. The "respectable lady" was drawn  from the same house to which we   have before had  an introduction; in short, she was the same   "lady" in whose room Athalia saw her husband from Nannette's room. With Otis she played the part of -" clergyman's widow," and for that purpose always dressed in deep mourning, just as her sisters in sin do now every day in the fashionable promenades of this city;, and she played it well, until one night, after having taken one bottle extra between them, for he had not yet learned that wine drinking was but little letter than whiskey drinking, ' she let out on him," in such a manner that his eyes were opened, and he determined to: leave the house.

First, in trusting him- self in a deceitful woman's power; and, secondly, in supposing that after she had deceived him once, she would not again. This last visit was upon the very night in which Athalia was introduced into the house, and hence the lies to inflame his mind, and the art made use of to give him a stolen glance of her face. It is no wonder that the first man fell, when 'tempted of a woman." It is idle to talk of our power to withstand their seductive arts. Otis was entrapped again.. The .sight of Athalia's beauty inflamed his already wine-heated blood, and he readily offered Mrs. Laylor a hundred dollars to bring about a successful negociation. This was just what she intended--what she expected-she had baited her trap high, and, the game was already caught. And he was not- the only one she intended to-catch with the same bait. She intended to use her as a profitable investment upon all her "'regular customers "'-for all such'houses boast of such-as long as she could make the lie of " fresh from the country," pass as cur- rent coin. She little thought, and cared less, how many lies she had to contrive and tell Athalia, before she could accom- plish her purpose. It does seem as though, when a woman loses her own virtue, that she imagines all her sex have lost or would lose theirs just as easy as herself. "I drag-down," should be graven upon the brow of every one of her class.

It does seem as though when a man loses his balance so far as to fall into the influence of such a woman, that he is "ready to believe a lie even unto his own damnation." How else could Walter Morgan-there are a great many Walter Mor- gans-leave such a wife as Athalia for such a Jezebel as he did? How else did such a man as Otis, whose business it was to watch the fold, allow the wolf to enter and carry off the shepherd?  Why, after he had found out how much he had been cheated, did he believe the-lies of the cheat again? Who can answer? I   cannot. I can only say, that in this branch of: intoxication, the only safe rule is that of. the teeto- taller, "touch not, taste not, handle not ;" and it must be more rigidly applied in the one case than the other. A man may possibly touch liquor and drink not. Can he play with a harlot and not fall? Otis should have preached a sermon, not to his'congregation, but to his own conscience in his own closet, from this text: "For a   whore is a deep ditch: and a strange woman is a narrow pit. "She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the transgressions among men."

"To-night or never -To-night is the last night that I shall ever set foot in your house. I have registered a vow in heaven to that, and I will keep it."  So he did. He had good cause to remember that night. Mrs. Laylor saw that he looked as though he intended to keep it, and as he had been fool enough to tell her so, she at once determined to fool him to her own profit. So she pro- mised him that he should have his utmost desire, and upon that she ordered up another bottle of wine, urged' him to drink and amuse himseif with the young ladies, while she went up and " smoothed the way." There is but little need of smoothing the way that leads nearly every young man, who visits such places, to destruction. But she had a way to smooth. It was her last chance with this victim, and she determined on profit and revenge. In due time she came in, and reported favorably.

Its bright rays awakened him to the startling consciousness of having over-slept himself after a night of debauch. How should he. get away without being seen? The thought troubled him sorely. But he soon determined what he would do; he would steal the veil from the face of the sleeping beauty to hide his own, and then slip out by the basement door, perhaps unseen. What harm could it do to her, since he had seen and knew the face so well? He dressed himself hurriedly, then gently drew the veil away, with a salvo to his conscience that he would not then see her face, he would look the other way. His conscience would have been more easy afterwards if he had kept that resolve. He could not.

He did, but instead of the face of Athalia, he saw that of a common street-walker-a young harridan-and he rushed from the room with the full weight of a burning conscience for his folly, with a feeling of self-degradation at being victimized a second time by the same deceitful woman; hating himself and everybody else; dreading to meet any on6  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7638-00000125"/> 238          HOT CORN. he knew, and, finally, encountering in the basement hall, striving to get out in the same sly way, the very Sian whom he had first taken to task for visiting this den of infamy. What a recognition! Neither could speak, so intense was the thought in the mind of each that the other might ruin him by simply revealing the truth. Strange that neither thought how little the other would dare to speak, least it should be inquired, "How did you know he was there? Where was you?.    Otis said afterwards to an acquaintance of mine, a physi- cian, whom he was obliged to consult in consequence of that sinful night, that he could not conceive- any agony more intensely painful in this life than that which he endured the next Sabbath, when he arose in the pulpit and looked down upon the congregation, but saw nothing, could- see nothing, but that one pair of eyes glaring upon him just as they did the morning he met them in the hall of that house where he had been so disgraced. "I little knew then," said he, " as I did afterwards, that he felt just as bad as I did, for he told me that it seemed to him that I was abouit to denounce him to the whole congregation. So intense had this feeling' become, that he was on the point of seizing his hat and rushing out when the words burst from my lips, if thou knowest aught of thy brother's failing, cover it up from the rude gaze of the world, for it can profit them nothing to know of his faults.'

He had not'1 paid Mrs. Laylor the hundred dollars promised while heated with wine, for he felt that she was not entitled to it, and he had no such sum to spare. Late one Saturday night he received a note from the lady, requesting immediate payment, and threatening exposure in church the next day if he failed to make it instanter. He had not so much money in the world, and knew no way by which he could get it immediately.  He was in an agony of fear all the evening.  The only man to whom he dared apply either for money or advice, the man who was equally guilty, was out of town. What should he do? He- did what e   ry Christian should do. He opened his Bible, and the first words, that his eyes, fell upon were, "ask and it shall be given you." He did ask, and ask earnestly, what shall I do? Before he had   done asking, the door bell rang and a letter marked "private--by express," was laid upon his table. A glance at the superscription told, him it was from the man he was so anxious to see. He opened and read: "MY DEAR FRIEND OTIS, I have had a  sort of presentiment upon my mind that you were about to be distressed for that hundred dollars, and as I. am well aware that you never would have been placed in jeopardy if I had not  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7638-00000126"/> 240          HOT CORN. first done wrong, I beg you to accept the enclosed check for that amount. "I need not say who it is from." How"strange, how opportune, how quick the answer to his asking had come back. What a load it lifted off his mind. It is not the first load that prayer, earnest, sincere prayer, has lifted. -He was relieved in more ways than one; he had repented of his folly, and had become a better and a wiser man. Gold is refined of its adhering dross by fire. Otis still lives, and every day he warns some one, not only of the folly and sin, but the danger, of visiting that class of houses, if only from curiosity. They are all traps for the unwary, and gulfs into which the soul sinks blindfold down to perdition. ' We have lost sight of Athalia. Let us return to her-she    ! will need all our sympathy, for she stands upon the very j, brink of a precipice, over which though many have fallen,    ! few ever returned. Mrs. Laylor manifested the greatest sympathy for Athalia , that one friend could for another.. She gave her the most private room in the house, and assured her that she should be welcome to it just as long as she pleased; " but of course," she said, " you will not remain a moment, after you get your things from that wicked woman. Now what can I do to       i assist you" " This was said in sucha kind, sympathizing manner, that a  more suspicious mind than hers might have been deceived;  and she answered, "Oh, you can do a good deal.   I am afraid to go out, particularly to go to that house, or that   PFE, SCENES IN. NEW YORK.      241 woman, and I want, my keepsakes. I have got seventy- dollars, and I will give it freely if I can get them again." She did not see the glisten of the. eye, or the avaricious clutch of the hand, as that miserly woman thought, "I will have that." She only heard the soft tones of her voice as she said, "my dear Mrs. Morgan, I will take it and see what 1 can do, but I am really afraid, it is not sufficient to induce her to part with them, as you say they are actually worth more money." "What shall I do then? I feel as though I could not part with them, and in such a way too, that is 'worse - than all. I would have sacrificed them in a moment for that man, if he had been sick and suffering, for want of food or medicine." "Well, well, my dear friend, do not worry .yourself. Re- member that you have friends, kind sympathizing friends, who will do more for you than they would for themselves. I will go directly and see what can be done if you will give me the money/' So she did, and by dint of threats, and coaxing, and promises to Josephine, to try and get something out of "the poor fool's wife," for her, she gave them up, and Mrs. Laylor, before night, had them safely locked in her own iron chest. "Why did she not give them to Athalia at once?" Simply, because she intended to keep both money and things. So she told Athalia, that Josephine bad not yet returned from Coney Island, where she knew she had gone with her husband, wearing her watch, passing for his wife, It , ;   "                &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7638-00000127"/> 242          HOT CORN. spending her money, which he had collected foi the making of the dress that he had stolen away without her knowledge. But she had come back; where was Walter? Somewhere with his set. He had not yet dared to face his injured wife. He intended to skulk home late at night. In the evening he went to0see his dear, sweet, amiable mistress. She was in about the same state of mind after Mrs. Laylor left her, that a female tiger would be, on arriving at her lair, after a little pleasure excursion, in which she might have killed a couple of Indian children, but was driven off before her appetite for blood was satisfied, and now found that some other equally ferocious animal had despoiled her of her own yourg. Walter and she had had " a good time" together, and parted lovingly only a few hours before. 'Sow he was surprised as he entered her room carelessly, to hear her tell him with a terrible oath--oaths are ten times more terrible in woman's than in man's mouth--to leave the room or she would take his life. At first, he thought she was in sport. One look was enough to convince him of his error. Then he thought she was mad, because he had entered without knocking, and found her engaged in dressing for the evening debauch and usual scenes of dissipation, and began to rally her oneher Eve-like appearance. That was more than some more amiable women can bear. No  matter how ill dressed or undressed, a woman does not Bike to be rallied on her personal appearance.   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.       243 Itwas more than such a human tiger could, or would-bear. She darted at him, and proceeded vigorously in the task of reducing him to the same state, so far as his toilet was con- cerned, as herself. It did not take long. First, she:crushed- his hat. His dress, coat was fine, and it was tender, for it was old, and she tore it into ribbons, in an instant. His vest and shirt followed, and she made vigorous efforts at the remaining garment, and then he broke and ran from the wild fury. She overtook him -at the top of the stairs, gave hirm a vigorous kick that; sent him, naked and insensible, down to the lower hall, where he was picked up by the police, and carried to the station house; there he had his bruises attended to, and there he would have got a passport to " the Island," only that he happened to be known, and when he told where he lived, one of the officers said, that was the fact, that he knew his wife, and a most excellent woman she was, and it would be a pity, on her account, to send him up this time, and so he volunteered to go home with him, and get some clothes and see what his wife wanted done with him. Walter found his trunk and all that he could claim as his own-it was not much, hardly enough for present necessity--where Athalia had left it, in the next-door shop, and there he learned the facts about the sale, and his wife going off in a carriage with two ladies, and a Negro driver; but he did not learn why she had gone, he needed no words to tell him that, a monitor within spoke louder than words, "A guilty conscience needs no accuser." What should he do? It is easy to say what a man should  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7638-00000128"/> 244     nTOT CORN. do. He -should go and find his wife, and fall down upon his knees; yes, bow his face intothe dust, pray for forgiveness, and promise reform. And he would be forgiven. That is woman's nature. The Forgiver of all sins, is not more for- giving. "What did he do?' That is just as easy said. He sold his last good shirt-- one that his wife had just made-to: procure the means of getting drunk. "What a pity that there should be any places where such- a man could get liquor; or that such places, if they do exist, should be kept by wretches who will take the shirt off the back of the poor inebriate for rum." Yes, it is a pity. It is the cause of ruin of more men than all other causes. From this last fall Walter never recovered. He went down, step by step, to the final termination of almost every young man who surrenders his reason to such vile influences. You heard Reagan say what that end was. Let his epitaph be, "Requiescat in Pace." With .various excuses, Athalia was kept in daily expecta- tion of recovering her property, until continued disappoint- ment made her heart sick. In vain she begged for something to do. Everyday it was promised, and every day the promise broken. She was kept from going out of the house by con- tinual tales about her husband watching it day after day, and night after night. Of course this was all sham. He had   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.       245 been told that she had gone out of town, and he believed it; he never got sober enough to think of inquiring or caring whether she was dead or alive. Finally, when Athalia could not be kept any longer upon such lying promises, Mrs. Laylor told her " that she had finally got Josephine to consent to give up the watch, and chain, and - locket, and the Bible, for a hundred dollars." Where was the poor girl to get the other thirty. She knew it was more than they were worth to anybody else, but she felt as though she would give it freely if she had it. To add to her distress of mind, just at this time she overheard a conversation in the next room between Mrs. Loylor and one of the girls-it was got up on purpose-to this effect: "To bi sure she will pay for her board. Of course she cannot expect to have the best room in the house ten weeks for nothing. But I shall only charge her seven dollars a week." "Seven dollars!" thought Athalia; "that takes thewhole of my seventy dollars; and my watch and Bible still remain in the hands of that red-headed . Oh, dear! what shall I do?" The two continued their conversation. "But, Aunt, you have promised to give that seventy dollars, and thirty more with it, to redeem her traps; how are you going to get seventy dollars more e or if you take that for her board, and let the watch go, what is she going to do in future? she has got no money, and don't work any." "Don't work any," thought she. 'How can I work shut  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7638-00000129"/> 246          HOT cOON. up here? I would work, if I had it to do. I could have earned that sum before this time." And again she said 1"Oh dear! what shall I do?" It was just what they wanted she should say. Mrs. Laylor replied: "Do! Why, she must do what other folks have to do. Frank Barkley is dying to do for her, the fool that she is; he would give her any amount of money, if she would be a little more agreeable when he calls. It was a long time before I could persuade her to drink a glass of wine with him. Some girls would have helped me to sell two or three bottles every evening. I s!all tell her to-day that she has got to do some- thing. I cannot keep anybody in the house this way much longer." What a dose of gall and wormwood was this to poor Atha  lia! This was boasted friendship. Forced by one specious pretence after another to remain; purposely kept without work, that she might get in debt, for that would put her in her creditor's power; and robbed of her money-worse than robbed; and yet she was only served just as innumerable poor girls have been served before, and will be again; it was enough to make her cry out, "' What shall I do?" And then to be accused of being ungrateful. That was worse than all. Then she thought that perhaps she had been. Mrs. Laylor had told her several times how much wine some gills could induce gentlemen to buy, and how much profit she made upon every bottle; and more than that, she had hinted very strongly how much money such a handsome woman as   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.       24T7 Athalia could make, if she was disposed to; and then she told a story about a young clergyman that used to come there, and what a great -fool he was when he drank a little wine, and how she made a hundred dollars out of the simpleton, and a great deal more; but she did not tell her how she cheated- him, nor how she had cheated Athalia out of her seventy dollars, nor that Frank Barkley had -paid her board, which she was now trumping up an account for, so as to drive her to the seeming necessity of selling her body and soul to escape from the tangled web which this human spider was weaving around this poor weak fly. In the course of the day, after this overheard conversation, Mrs. Laylor came to tell Athalia "that she had -succeeded at last in obtaining her watch and Bible, by paying thirty dollars out of her own pocket, although she did not know how in the world to spare it, but she supposed Mrs. Morgan would repay it almost immediately."  Repay it! How could she? And so she said bitterly that she had no hope. Her heart was almost broken. Mrs. Laylor, of course, condoled with her, soothed her, reassured her of her pure friendship, took out the watch and put the chain over her neck, sent down and had the Bible brought up, and with it a bottle of wine; one of th"e half brandy sort, and insisted upon her drinking of it freely, and driving off- the blues; and then, after she had got her into a state of partial intoxication, and fit for any act of desperation, sent for Frank Barkley, who had just arrived, to come up to Athalia's room, and play a game of cards. She had never before con-  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7638-00000130"/> 248          nOT CORNs. sented to that, but now Mrs. Laylor was there, and she desired it, and so he came. It had been all previously arranged thai he should, and that he should order another bottle of wine- mixed wine-and then Mrs. Laylor was called out, and went suddenly, saying as she did so: "Let the cards lie, I will be back in a minute." That minute never came. That night was the last of con- scious purity which had so long sustained Athalia through all her trials. For the next six months she never allowed herself to think. She was lost. The instruments of darkness had betrayed her into the deepest consequences. The scene shifts. Shall we see Athalia again  Wait.   1LFE SCENES iS NEW  YORK.       249 CHAPTER XIII. THE LITTLE- PEDLAR.--MORE OF ATHALIA. "Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile," And thus at this may laugh the scoffer. "Let those laugh who win." WE started in the first chapter of our volume of "Life Scenes," to take an evening walk up Broadway. How little progress we have made. We turned off at Cortland street, to follow Mrs. Eaton and her children home, and then we-went with the crowd to the fire. Then we came back to listen to the cry of "Hot Corn, hot corn! here is your nice hot corn, smoking hot!" that came up in such plaintive music from the mouth of Little Katy, in the Park. Then we followed her to her home, and to her grave. What a ramble I have led you, reader. Occasionally our route has led us back again and again into this great, broad, main artery of the lower part of this bustling world, this great moving, living body, called New York. There are several other broadways in the upper part of the city. We have but one in the lowest portion of it -that is for carriages. There are a good many broadways of the town, through which pedestrians go, where they " put au enemy in the mouth to steal away the brains," an enemy "Whose edge is sharper than the sword: whose tongue Out-venoms all the worms of Nile; whose breath "  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7638-00000131"/> 250          HOT CORN. Rides on the winds, and doth belie All comers of the world; kings, queens, and states, Maids, matrons," all in one fell swoop, To earth strjck down. Such a broadway may be seen, nay, must be seen, by all whc enter the great, high, oaken doors of the granite portal of one of the best of the great Broadway hotels in New York, for the way is wide open, inviting the weary traveller to enter the great, dome-shaped " exchange "-exchange of gold, health, peace of mind, domestic blessings, for a worm that will gnaw out the very soul ; a worm with teeth, " whose edge is sharper thanthe sword." That granite pile is a creditable ornament to the city, Its walls have a look of solidity as enduring as the hills. Yet it contains an element within that has settled the strong built fabrics of a greater Master Builder than the architect of that house, down to the very dust, in a few short years, carrying with it marble palaces and granite walls. That building was erected by one who sprang, from a class as lowly as the day laborer who helped to rear its walls, to almost immeasurable wealth, by a life of industry, freo from the vice or misfortune of drunkenness. At first it did not contain that great broadway to death. True, death had his abode there, but he kept in a cave out of sight. He did not thrust his hideous visage into the face of every guest, as he does now. The place of his " exchange" was then a place of green grass and flowers and sparkling foun- tains, upon which all the interior windows of that great   "FE SCENES IN NEW   YORK.      251 caravansery looked down with joy and gladness, smiling o'er the perfumed atmosphere, and beauty admired beautiful flowers, and listened to love-inspiring songs of biuds, an i pattering of falling water in the great marble basin. Ah . that was a court, worthy of such a traveller's home. But it did not produce the profit that flows to the owner through another liquid channel, where that fountain once leaped, played and sparkled in the sunshine. Lovely eyes stil look down from the surrounding chamber windows, not upon the flowers and birds and crystal waters, but upon an unsightly dome, and in fancy through its roof, and there they see their husbands, brothers, fathers, friends, putting an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains. How fancy will work; how it will send sharp pangs to the heart; sharper than a two-edged sword; how the feeble wife will look down upcn that roof, and pray for it to give up her husband. Other wives have prayed the tomb for the same object, both equally effective. Both will pray to both again, and both will feel that hardest of all pangs for a wife to bear, the pang that tells of a lost husband; lost in one case almost as sure as the other; the loss more hard to bear, when lost while living, than when lost by death. I was sitting, one night, in the corridor of this, with the exception of its drinking "exchange," really good, well managed hotel, looking over the balustrade, at the in-coming and out-going throng, counting the numbers that went rum- ward as three to one, to those who went up the solid stone steps, already deeply worn by the constant dropping of feet,  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7638-00000132"/> 252          HOT CORN. and trying to read the varied countenances of the ever-chang. ing, varying scene before me. It is a useful study, to study our own kind; it is a good place, in the corridor of a great hotel, to practice. Every now and then, a face beamed out from the mass which- made me sensible that it was not new, but whether an old acquaintance, or one seen before in some other crowd, I could not tell. Once only I was sure that the face which riveted my attention was that of one I had called friend, yet, for my life, I could not tell when or where. It was one of those faces which we never forget. It was one which a child would approach with confidence, to ask for a favor. It was one, which a stranger in his walk through the city, would pick out among a hundred, to ask for a direction to a particular street. Ten chances to one, he would-not be satisfied to give that stranger a direction in words, but would turn round, and go a little out of the way to show the inquirer the best route, or stand upon the side-walk until one of the right line of stages came up so as to be sure that he went right. There are a few such faces, which go far to redeem the mass from the charge of coldness or selfishness, which does seem to be the distinguishing mark of the majority. I followed this one up the steps, and as far as the vision extended, as he walked away to one of the parlors. He was an elderly man, silvering with age, neatly, but plainly dressed, and I could not help feeling that he looked in everything about him, as though it would rejoice his very soul to have a chance to do a good action. I was not mistaken. You will not be if you read on. I could not sit still after he had   "FE SCENES IN NSEW YORK.      253 passed up. I went into a long train of thought upon the mental question, the one absorbing question, "Who is he?" The argument grew' intensely painful, and I became so much absorbed in it, that I almost forgot for a moment where I was, until I was brought back to consciousness by a little voice in my ear, of, "Please to buy these, sir." I almost said, no, without deigning to look up at the quasi beggar, as the frequency of the question, in all public places, is such that it is somewhat annoying. But there was a something in the tone of the voice that sent its magnetic power through me, and put down that spirit which gives the cold shoulder to the poor, and bids them "call again to-morrow." "There is a Providence in all things," many a pious heart will aspirate, as the truths- of this little incident are made manifest. It does. certainly, seem a little singular that this little pedlar girl should be the chosen instrument of con- nexion between me and that benevolent gentleman, whom I had been vainly endeavoring to recognise in thought, and -also another character, with which the reader is already acquainted. What is there in a word, or tone, the mere sound of the voice, that sends a stream of magnetic fluid through the sys- tem, to repel or attract the speaker? What singular means are used to bring about strange results! I was magnetized by that voice. What the result was, you shall see. But after the fluid had once entered my brain, I could no more repel the voice, or its owner, or drive it away; than the iron can disengage itself from the magnet.  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7638-00000133"/> 254          HOT CORN. I looked up, and a little girl with a basket upon her arm waa standing by my side, holding up a pair of suspenders while she uttered the "Please buy these, sir?" close to my ear. She was a pretty child, between twelve and thirteen years old, rather precocious in appearance; was neatly dressed, and pos- sessed of such a mild, sweet voice, that the mocking-bird might imitate it in his dulcet notes. I could not say, no, in such tones as would send her -away, and so I replied, pleasantly, "No, my girl, I do not wish to buv them." The timid take courage at mild words. Was she too, attracted by mine? There is magnetism in the human voice. "Then, perhaps, you will buy a box of matches 2" "No." "Or a comb." "No."  , Oh, do buy something,- sir, it is get- ting late, and I am so anxious to sell a few shillings' worth more. Will you buy a pair of gloves? you wear gloves, don't you?

Will you buy that?" ("No, my girl, I never wear collars, but I will buy a pair of gloves, if you will answer me a few questions." "Will you? Well sir, if they are such as I may answer, I will, and I don't think you would ask me any other-some :men do, though." "That is just one of the questions I wanted to ask you." ! "Oh, sir, I wish you would not ask me what some men   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.       255 say to me, it is so bad; only yesterday evening, one very bad man-but I cannot tell." And she burst into tears. "Well, then, don't tell if it distresses you so." "It won't now, and I want to tell you, because I should like to let you know what a good man that grey-headed old gentleman is that came in just before I did." "What, the one with a gold-headed cane?" "Yes, sir, a tall man, with a grey frock-coat, and such a good-looking face." "Then, I do want you to tell me, if it is anything about him. I think I have seen him before." ("Then, I hope you will again, for he is one of the real good men. Well, sir, yesterday evening, I was here, and I offered to sell some things to a young gentleman, and he talked so clever, that I felt glad to think how many things he was going to buy, for he picked out a pair of gloves and six shirt collars, and several other things, and told me to come up to his room, and get the money, and I went up; I did not think it any harm, for I had been up several times before to gentlemen's rooms, and they never acted bad to me, but this one did, and I was so frightened. that I screamed, and then he caught me, and put his handkerchief to my mouth, and I don't know what he would have done, but just then I heard a rap at the door, and somebody demanded to come in, but the door was locked, and he could not, and so : -the man .that held me told him, but it did no good, for he was a strong man, and he burst the lock off in an instant, and I   &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7638-00000134"/> 256         HOT CORN. how he did talk to the one in the room, and he made him pay me for all the things he had picked out, and then he told him to pack up his trunk, and leave the city by the first boat or railroad in the morning.

Then he gave a little sigh, and said, 'Ah, my girl, I wish I had a home to take you. to, but I have none; I am a lone man in the world, but I will go and see your mother, and see what we can do for you, as you have grown. too big for such work as this.

It was my turn to start now. I had heard that voice before. In a moment I eould fix it in my memory, though it was a good many years since I had heard it, and then it was in the wilds of the West.

I was afraid something was wrong, and I began to cry, indeed, sir; don't laugh at me, I could not help it, I would have cried my eyes out to see her, but the girl said, she was not there, and I said, I saw her come there in the carriage, just a minute ago; and then another girl told the servant girl, it was Lucy, Lucy Smith, that I wanted to see; but I knew it was not, but I thought I would go up and see Lucy Smith, and may be she would tell me about Mrs. Morgan; and so I went to Lucy Smith's room, and I rapped on the door, and somebody said, come in; I thought I should go off, for I knew the voice in a minute, and I opened the door, and then it was not Lucy Smith, they only called her so for. sham, and so that nobody would know her; it was Mrs. Morgan.

Some poor unfortunat( woman, with a miserable, drunken husband, has been driver by necessity, probably to take up her abode in some house of sin, where she finds her life miserable, and is anxious tc escape; I suppose that is it." "Anxious to escape! Why, sir, you confuse me worse than ever. No one is obliged to stay in such houses, are they? If she wished to go away, she could go; it is her own sinful choice that she is there." "Friend Lovettee, how long have you lived out West?" "Well, some twenty-five years, I suppose. You have a short way of turning a corner. Was. I talking anything about the West?" "No. Twenty-five years. This city has changed some in that time, and you have got behind the times.

"Nevertheless it is gospel truth, as much as the Bible itself.

Thus she will live a short life of excitement, and go friendless and unwept to an' early grave." "She shall not. She shall not. I have money, useless, idle, more than I shall ever want, and I have no friends. I will be her friend, I will rescue her, and she shall be mine." Stella, the little pedler, had stood as though transfixed, during all this time, drinking in every word, until she found that her friend, poor Mrs.- Morgan, would have some one to care for her, some one to love her as she loved her, one who had money-, ': more money than he wanted," to assist her, and then she grew as enthusiastic as Mr. Lovetree. She caught him by the hand, and as the tears ran down her cheeks, tears of joy, blessed tears, that drop like honey upon the lips, sending sweetness through every channel of sensation in the whole system, she said, "Will you, will you .give her money to-get out of that place? Will you go and see her.? Will you love her? Oh I am so happy! I must run home and tell my mother, and that will make her happy too. Now I am so glad I told you all about it." "And you will do it," said she, looking up in his face so earnestly, "yes, I know you will, you don't look like one of those kind of folks who say one thing and mean another."

"Stop, stop a moment, you have not told us where the poor lady is that you wish us to go and see, nor what her i name is." "Oh dear, I forgot that. Yes I told you, Mrs.- Morgan, but you want her whole name; well that is such a pretty name; I love pretty names; have you a card, I will write it for you." ", What, can you write?" "Oh yes, sir, before we got so poor, I used to go to school. I would like to go now, but I have no time. You ought to see my mother write; she can write so pretty." I saw what was working in the benevolent old gentleman's face, while Stella was writing. He 'had heard her say, "I would like to go to school now," and he was resolving in his mind, "Why not? Why should I not send her there? I have none of my own to send." It was a good resolve. "There, that is it. ' Mrs. Athalia Morgan, at Mrs. Laylor's in DH   n street.'

But you had better inquire for Lucy Smith. They don't know her by any other name there. Shall I go now? Good night. I am so anxious to tell mother." "Athalia!-Athalia!" said my friend, as he spelt over the  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7638-00000138"/> 264          Hor CO co ,. name on the card.

Her earnestness makes me begin to feel a good deal interested in that woman." "Nothing, only a thought, a mere passing thought, and yet I cannot shake it off. It is rather an unusual name., I had a brother-yes, I had a brother, whether I have or not now, I cannot tell; yet he was not exactly a brother either, though we called the same woman mother, and the same man father, and whether he is living now or not I cannot say, but think not. He did very badly, drank up all his property, and took the usual course, and I suppose he is dead, and his wife too, and then his children are orphans, and why not this be one of them; it is the same name.

Now this house where we are to go, however, I take, from its location, to be one of a different character, one that maintains a show of respectability, yet is one of the most dangerous, for its victims are drawn from among a class just as good as Stella has described Mrs. Morgan." "I You think, then, that we may go there safely, at this hour of the night?" "As safely, as respects our persons, as to church. As dangerously, as respects our morals, as the poor weak bird fluttering within the charmed circle of the fascinating ser- pent." "As to that I fear nothing." "So has said many a one. I say, - He must have a long spoon that must eat with the devil,' or he will soon come to such- familiarity that he will eat freely out of the same dish. No man is proof against the fascinations of a designing woman. But as we go doubly armed, for our cause is just, let us go, go at once, for I see you are excited about that name.

Have they forgotten that we are all creatures of surrounding circumstances, subject to like influences, and liable to the same disease as those who breathe the same atmosphere, and if that is impure, those who breathe it may become so? Even now, while I write, the "New York Daily Tribune," gives this "Item" to its readers:-- "MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE.--On Sunday evening last, between six and seven o'clock, Miss G.

"It is feared that she has been foully dealt with."  Yes, and it ought to be feared that "good-looking, rather tall" young girls, are foully dealt with in the streets of this city, every night in the week.

Yes, any information will be gratefully received by the author of. this book, which he can use effectually to awaken aged parents to the fact, that each one of these girls who-wander the streets- at midnight, or who fill up the dens of infamy that line whole blocks of some of the best streets in this city, is some- body's child; some "mysterious disappearance," that has caused deep affliction, and will cause more, for she is now influencing others to disappear from the path of rectitude, in the same way that she did. Perhaps, yea, it is probable, more than probable, that Miss G. C   has been inveigled into one of these dens where worse than cannibals live, for they only eat the body, while these destroy the soul.

How the city's indignation would boil over, and how the storm of wrath would beat upon that house, until there would not be one stone left upon another. Yet how calmly that same public sleeps on by the side of a thousand worse houses, where victims are worse than cooked and eaten every day-they are roasted alive. How coldly parents will read that " mysterious disappear- ance ;" they will never think that girl has been destroyed by cannibals, far worse are here--they belong to savage life. How carelessly, how .thoughtlessly mothers will read this page that tells how their daughters may be influenced to ruin themselves, by such unfortunate associations as they must meet with in their walks through the city, while our munici- pal government permits the streets to be monopolized by the impure, because it is itsei just what the echo answered. How I would rejoice if I could make the truth manifest, as regards this matter, that, " to the pure all things are pure." Now, let us walk on. You need not stop to drop anything into the hand of that woman with a child on her lap. True, she looks like a pitia- ble object, with her opium-drugged .infant wrapped in that old blue cloak, but she is not. She is a professional beggar. I have known her these three years.

The queer idea was a true one after all. And so this woman, whom I had often seen speaking pleasant words to this poor legless Negro man, who sits night. after night, upon the Broadway side-walk, selling bouquets, is Mrs. May, the little pedler's mother. ;   "Do you know where she lives?-could you get anybody to carry -this to her to-night?.

Always cheerful, intelligent, and polite; it is a pleasure to buy flowers of him. It is a wonder that ladies and gentlemen do not all feel it a duty and pleasure both, to buy all their bouquets of this poor cripple." "It is because they never think. If they did, they cer- tainly would." "Then, I must ask them to think.. I must try and awaken the sympathies of the benevolent to look at this poor unfortunate black man as they pass, and see if they do not think him a fit subject for honest sympathy. He is not a beggar.

So will you, reader, if you come to New York, and undertake to see all the curiosities of Broadway, in one night. At length, we reached Mrs. Laylor's. It is a handsome liouse, in a quiet street. My friend hesitated about entering, He thought I must be mistaken. It did not look like what he had conceived of such houses. Then he was afraid they would suspect us, and would not let us in. "uFor the fact is, we do not look much like the class of men who visit such places," said he. "That shows how little you know of life in New York. Let me manage this matter, and I assure you, they will think us two old rakes, rich ones, too, out of whom they may make a harvest." So we went up the broad, high steps, and rang the bell with a jerk, that said, as near as bells can speak, that is somebody that has been here before. The lady, as is the usual practice, came herself to the door, unlocked it, and opened it a little way, where it is held by a chain, so that she could reconnoitre, and if the company did not suit, or if a stranger applied, she would refuse him, particularly, if she had plenty of company, unless he could give very good references. I thought of that, and so I said, with the same confidence that I had put into my pull of the bell, "Good evening, Mrs. Laylor, how do you do this evening? You were unwell the other evening when I was here. This is Mr. Treewell, from the South." That was an "open sesame," that undid the-   "FE SCENES IN  NEW 'YORK.      276 chain directly, and we walked in as old acquaintances. True, she could not exactly locate us, but our easy assurance carried us through. "Walk into the parlor, gentlemen, there is nobody there, we are quite alone this evening. Or, will you go in the back room; the young ladies and I were having a little game of whist together, to drive off the dullness." Yes, to drive off the dullness, thought I; to get. rid of the horror of thinking. That is the greatest curse that this class of women have to endure. They cannot bear to think. They must have something " to drive off the dullness." If they have no company, they must play cards, or something else to keep away thought. If they have company, wine is the panacea. They cannot afford to buy it themselves, but they often persuade gentlemen to do so, pretending to be very thirsty, when they have just been drinking, because that is a part of the contract upon which they are kept by the mis- tress of the house. If a girl had any conscientious scruples about coaxing a gentleman, to buy, or about drinking, or wasting all the wine -that all of them would buy, she would be trained into the work, or turned out of doors. So that it is a very rare thing for one of them to go ta bed sober. In the morning, or rather towards night, when they- wake up, they are almost unable to dress themselves for the next scene in the round of dissipation, until they have sent out and -got a little cheap rum, "to bring them up."   . a Those who leave studied the life of these poor, wretched  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7638-00000144"/> :276          HOT CORN. women as carefully as I have, will not wonder at the short- ness of it. Of course we accepted the very polite invitation to go in where the young ladies were., We had an object in' doing so. Neither of us knew Mrs. Morgan, and if we should inquire for her, if it suited the convenience of madame she would palm off any other one that she thought she could make pass. I adopted my plan of operations very quickly. I thought if they had had no company yet to-night, they had had no wine, and consequently would not- be in the best of moods to be communicative. As soon as we were introduced, I ordered a bottle of wine and thought I would find out if either of the three girls present answered to the name of Lucy, and if she did, I intended to whisper one word in her ear, and that word-should be "Athalia," and watch what emotion it produced. It would be entirely impossible for a stranger to form an idea what an emotion the very name of wine caused among tiem. They were fairly longing for it. We were in the good graces of all the household at once. I pleaded head- ache not to drink. Lovetree took his glass with them. I fixed upon one that I thought perhaps might be Athalia, but soon found that she was called Nannette. Another was Belle, and the third was ACdelaide. The latter was one of the most perfectly beautiful girls in face and form I ever saw, and she had really pretty red hair. I have often met or passed her since that in the street and never without ^.   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.       27- admiring her beauty and thinking of her mother, and how she must mourn " a girl lost." I was now satisfied that Athalia was not in the room, and I said carelessly. "Where is that other girl I saw here, with brown hair and blue eyes, not very tall n" "What was her name?"- "Oh, confound names, I never can think of names." "Oh, I know who he means," said Adelaide, "it is Lucy, Lucy Smith." 'u Yes, yes, that is it. It is Lucy at any rate." "She is in her room. She has got the dumps--the blues --I should not wonder if she was all melted by this time, she has been crying these three days." Crying, why what has she to cry about? I should not think anybody need to cry in this house, you never cry, do you 8" The very question almost brought a tear, but she drove it back. "Well, Lucy must come down and have some wine. Get her down, and we will have another bottle." "She won't come. We are all tired of trying. She has got the pouts, because Mrs. Laylor took her trunk away from her to keep for her board. She don't make anything. All she ever did make was out of Frank Barkley, and that she gave to redeem her watch and a good-for-nothing old Bible I don't see what she wants of that."  "Well, I am going to have her down-I have no opinion of having any girl in the dumps. Where is her room?"

"Well, well, I will bring her down, see if I don't. Come, Treewell, if sheY Will not come without we will bring her." So away we went upstairs, now satisfied that we were on the right trail, and that we had completely lulled all suspicion that we wanted- anything of Lucy Smith, except to compel the poor heart-sick woman to join in a Bacchanalian revel, at which her soul revolted.

Mr. Lovetree thought not, for Stella said they would not let her go out except some one in the house went with her to watch her. "No matter. I am almost sure that woman has got her away. These women are great at contrivance. Very likely she came prepared for it, as Stella told her of- course, all that Mrs. Morgan had told her." We made a light and the first thing that Lovetree saw was   "Acfi SCENESJ INi- ANEW YORK.   279 the Bible, and Athalia's name--her age and birth-place and the age and names of her father and mother and grandfather and grandmother, a complete family record. I thought the man would go crazy. It would have made him nearly crazy if he had found her an inmate here, as much lost to shame as those we had just been carousing with, and now to find that she was not here put him into a perfect agony. He thought he could not live till morning without seeing her. At first we thought of going directly to Mrs. May's but then we recollected we did not know where she lived and could not find out, for I had lost her card that Stella gave me. Finally we concluded to go down and talk a minute in the same kind of sang froid manner, to keep up our assumed characters and then go home and await coming events. We were rallied as we entered the room with a jeering laugh at not being able to bring one woman between us both. Then I pretended to get angry at being sent upon a fool's errand, to a room where nobody was at home. At that Mrs. Laylor started. "Was she not in the room?" "No, nor has not been lately. You are playing tricks with the wrong persons, trying to fool us." "Indeed, gentlemen, upon my honor it is no trick." She rang the servants' bell violently. "Martha, do you know where Lucy Smith is?

And there was such a string of oaths as I never heard be- fore, and hope I never shall hear again, particularly from female profane lips. None but a drunken slave driver, ever poured out such a stream of awful language, full of oaths, anger and billingsgate expressions, at the escape of one of his vic- tims, as she did at the escape of a woman whom she had determined to debase to her own level, until she had brought her to that condition that she would feel degraded in the eyes of the world, would know that all her own sex had closed and barred the door against her, so that she could never return to the-paths of virtue, and she would be to her mistress a " profit- able investment," for she would be attractive, by her beauty and manners, and " draw custom to the house."

It would- be idle to pretend that Athalia had escaped without sin. She had not. She had sinned deeply.  She said afterwards while claiming some extenuation, though by no means trying to justify her fall, that her mind was so wrought upon by her disappointments of life, by her lone and friendless condition; by the accumulation of debt, by the terrible treachery of those she had entrusted herself with as such disinterested friends, by her anxiety to obtain her valued keepsakes and get money enough to redeem them, and then escape from the pandemo- nium she found that she had unwittingly entered, that she had determined to drown her thoughts in wine, and then she accept- ed the oft-repeated proposals of Frank Barkley to redeem her watch, which he honorably did, but which another friend, one of Mrs. Laylor's friends, whom she forced her to accept, and which cost her the friendship of Frank, robbed her of, and carried off so that she never saw it again; whether he kept it or gave it to Mrs. Laylor, she never knew. Often she intended to fly, but it seemed to her that she could not get away; she was kept in one constant whirl of excitement so that she could not reason with herself long enough to "determine what to do.

Frank was very kid to her in a certain measure. He liked her, but it was a very selfish liking. He did not like to hear her talk about leaving. He liked her there, and he was almost as much her jailer as Mrs. Laylor. He took her out to all mariner of dissipation, theatres, saloons, late suppers, balls and frolics, in which strong drink-not Athalia Morgan--acted as wild a part as the wildest. But he offered her no means of escape. She began to have a sort of fondness for Frank. What woman can- avoid liking one who is devoted to her? But this devotion to one was not what Mrs. Laylor wished. It was not what brought the most money to her iron chest. She would like to negotiate the charms of Athalia to some rich libertine every day, whenever she could meet with one fool enough to pay her well for her influence with the " young widow." Among the most determined of her suitors, was a young Frenchman, who used every art which he knew well how to use with words and money, to win Athalia's favor. As a last resort, he pledged a splendid diamond ring to Mrs. Laylor, if she would accomplish what he could not. When all other arts fail to work ruin and misery in a woman's mind, there is one left, one which concentrates all the power of all the lies of the father of deception. It is jealousy. There is a little story in "Othello," about the arts of a vil- lain, to produce mischief by that power.- It is nothing com- pared with the villainy and lies invented to produce jealousy between Frank and Athalia, so as to let in the Frenchman, anid win that -ring.   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.        283 Villainy is-too often successful in this life. It was in this case. Jealousy, a feeling of revenge, drives more women to infidelity towards those they love, than all other causes. It did its perfect work with Athalia; and then the fiend who had accomplished the. work, laughed at her, and told her how she had been fooled, thinking it would have the usual effect, to make her careless of what she did in future. It had an entirely different effect upon Athalia. It was this that produced the state of mind that Adelaide called the dumps, the blues, and the tears that Stella saw her shed. Stella had told her mother much that Athalia told her, much that the child did not understand, but the mother did, for she knew how girls were inveigled into those houses, and kept there as prisoners. I have lately witnessed a scene, highly illustrative of this fact. It is one of the "Life Scenes of New York." Coming up one of the streets west of Broadway, about one o'clock at night, I saw a fellow hovering near a house, whom I recognized as a Negro wood-sawyer that ILhad seen the day' before, engaged at the same house, putting wood down the cellar grate. I knew him or thought I 'did, as a poor but honest man, and I felt pained with a fear that I had been deceived, that he had left the grate unfastened, and now was about to steal something from the cellar. I passed on- around the next corner, out of sight, and then turned back and crossed over, where I could have a full view of his operations. -There- were no lamps burning, because there should, or might have been moonlight, if it had been clear; as it was, it was a  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7638-00000148"/> 284      -   HOT CORN. fitting time for the burglar's trade. Directly, the fellow approached the grate, opened it carefully, and drew up a trunk. My heart beat with excitement, fear, and sorrow. I was just on the point of calling, "Watch," I must own with a view of letting the fellow escape, and saving the trunk, when I saw a bonnet, then a shawl, and then a full suit of woman's clothes follow the trunk up from that dark recess. My milnd was somewhat relieved; my honest wood-sawyer might be honest still, though he was probably assisting a dishonest woman; else why did she leave that house, to all appearance, an honest house, for all that I had ever seen in passing it a hundred times, in such a clandestine manner. The Negro walked on with the trunk on his shoulder, and the woman followed. It was a scene of such frequent occurrence, that it would excite no suspicion or question from a policeman. He would think it was a passenger by the train, from Boston, or Albany, or the Erie railroad, all of which make midnight arrivals. On they went, block after block, and I followed, till I thought the chase likely to prove a long one, and then I stepped up to the woman, and laying my hand upon her shoulder, said, "Stop!"She uttered a little cry of alarm, and said, "Oh, don't take me up, please don't.' The Negro stopped, looked round, and set down the trunk hastily, evidently supposing that a star had nabbed her, and that the better part o: a fight consists in running away. There was a light here, for the lamp-lighters were just going their late rounds. He gave one glance back before he   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.      285 started, to be sure he had good cause to run, and instantly burst into a most merry fit of laughter, very unlike what might be supposed that of a caught burglar. "I' Ia! ha! ha! ki, missee, you don't know dat gemman . You nebber seed dat gemman 'fore? You tink him a star? Look at um. You tink he look so he hurt you?

Compared with some of those full of foreigners, it was a little paradise. Up, up to the sixth story, that is where the poor live; here is where the poor legless Negro flower-seller lives, with his nice little family; a door opened as we approached, and a light shined out, and a voice said: "Is dat you, Peter? Has you got her, Peter? Thank God for that!" It was Peter's wife, rejoicing at the rescue of a woman from perdition. One of a poor, down-trodden race, a mem- ber of a Christian church, yet considered unworthy to sit by the side of white skinned (thin skinned) Christians,doing a most Christian act, such an one as many of her sisters in the church would consider beneath their dignity to do. We entered Peter's home. It was but one small room, scantily, yet neatly furnished. There was a little stove, and all necessary cooking utensils, and plenty of dishes, a table, a bureau, a carpet on the floor, a stand in one corner covered with a clean white cloth, and on this a'large Bible, covered with green baize, lying open, with Phebe's spectacles on the page, indicating her employment while waiting and watching. for Peter to return, as she expected, with company--one more than she expected.

Agnes met a warm welcome from   Phebe:  We shall see Phebe again, out on another errand of mercy. In some of these ever shifting-'scenes, we may have another glimpse of Agnes. . Peter explained to Phebe, how   I happened to be in company, and then we all sat down to hear Agnes's story. I shall not tell it now. But I will tell here another little story, which will give a clue to what she said about the haunted house. It is a story about " a girl lost."  The "( Tribune " one day published an appeal to the kind- hearted of the city, to give a distracted family some informa- tion of' a .girl lost."

They are "lost." This is not the first gir lost in New York. These are not the first parents who have. been deeply afflicted; who have appealed in vain th rough the press for any information of " a girl lost*" I have a little incident to relate of a girl lost. A few years ago No. 000 Church street, was accounted the " luckiest house inl the street." There are a great many unlucky ones in that street now, and that particular one is esteemed the most unlucky of all of them. , It shouldbe so. It was in that house about three years ago, that a girl was lost. For the sake of her parents, brothers and sisters, -and large family of relatives, I will not givo her true name. You may call it Julia Montgomery. She was just such a girl as the one described in the "Mysterious Diso appearance!"  She was tall and handsome, just seventeen with dark hair and eyes, and well dressed. She lived in one of the river towns, and came down upon one of the -barges that, float down such a multitude of things produced by farmers, in company'with her father and mother, who brought some of their own produce to market. On the same boat were two young men who had been up the river, they said, on a sporting excursion. This was -true. But they might have added, "What is sport to us is death to- you." They were gamblers. On the passage they made the- :cquaintance of, Julia, and by their bland manners completely won the confi- dence of the old folks., When they arrived, they were very anxious that -Julia should go home with, them and. see their sisters. They were not'so anxious that her mother should go; but they insisted very hard' that she should, because they.  &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7638-00000152"/> 200          HOT CORy. knew she would not; she had her butter and eggs and chickens to sell, and lots of shopping to do, so Julia went alone. She came back to the boat towards night to tell her mother what nice girls the Miss Camptowns were, and that they wanted she should go with them to the theatre, and then as it would be late, stay all night. The mother consented, as Mr. Camptown was such a fine young man. After the play they had an oyster supper and wine, and Julia became very much elated. Then they went home, to Mr. Camptown's home, which was no other than that notorious Church street den, and the "sisters" the most notorious sinners in it. Of course more wine was drank, and Julia became oblivious of what transpired. She waked to consciousness next morning to find herself--"a girl lost." Almost delirious, she flew from the wicked scoundrel at her side to the street door, to find it barred against her. In vain she begged and prayed, and cried to be let out. The soul incarcerated in the infernal regions might as well pray for egress. She finds in both cases only scoffing at the victim's agony. Then she grew wildly furious, and then they tied her hands and feet and carried her down into the coal cellar, " to let her get over her fit, and keep her out of sight till the old woman was out of the way." Fof three days, Camptown watched her father and mother, and then they gave up and went home with heavy hearts, for "a girl was lost." Yes, she was "lost." Then Camptown went back to enjoy his "' country beauty." She was lost to him also.

I saw him a few days ago, in the very street where that girl was lost, noticed in the "Tribune." Has he any connection with her loss . Reader, there is a girl lost. Ask where and why? .Rum and gambling can answer. Now, let us leave Agnes in the hands of the wood-sawyer and his wife, those good-hearted, kind  Christians, that despised, because black-skinned, brother and sister, more worthy than many of the despisers, and return to Mrs. May, and see how she effected the rescue of another prisoner. What Stella told her mother was sufficient to give her the- most intense anxiety about Athalia. She was so well ac- quainted with the ways of the wicked in this city, that she felt satisfied that her friend wanted good couinsel, and perhaps assistance, and she determined to give it to one who had often given such to -her. As soon as it was sufficiently dark, she slipped on a shawl and hood, and went into a neighbor's and borrowed another just like her own.

"No matter, it shall come safe back to you, in the course of the evening." So it did, and with it came Athalia, who, by that double, had eluded her jailers. Lovetree -wnt to his hotel in a state of mind not to be en- vied. He had found the strongest evidence that his niece had been in a house which polliles all who breathe its atmos- phere, and he had heard vile women speak of her as one of themselves, and he knew not how far she was like them. He had witnessed an exposition of character that night, such as he -never had before conceived possible. He first saw Mrs. Laylor, a specimen of a high-bred lady, Bland as the dewy morn That opes the buds to flowers. Then he saw her furious as the winds, By Boreas rudely driven, Wild as the storm, when Jove hurls down His thunderbolts from Heaven. He trembled with fear that she would pursue Athalia, and drag her back, and perhaps hide her where he could never find her. Undoubtedly she would have exercised her vindic- tiveness upon Athalia in some way, if she had known where she was. Lovetree had heard Mrs. Laylor swear that Atha- lia had robbed her, and that she would have her punished, and although he did not believe a word of such a charge, he believed that vile woman wicked enough to swear away an innocent girl's life.   "FE SCENES IN -NEW YORK.       293 Hie was quite mistaken. She was furious at her dlisappoint- ment' and loss of gain, for gold she worshipped, but after all she would not have done a thing to put the life or liberty of Athalia in danger of the law. The restraint she had put upon her, was one of policy, all in the way of her business. Lying and cheating were a part of her trade; it is of some others. She had been outwitted by one whom she thought too tame to resent an injury, or protect herself. Lovetree did not know that like a furious wind it would soon blow out, or that a por- tion of her apparent anger was put on for effect, for one of the other girls was held by a slender thread, and it was an object to deter her from taking the same step that Athalia had. It is a great object-great as it is with the merchant to get new goods-with all this class of houses to get new girls; those fresh from the country are objects of great importance; hence the effort to keep them until their conscience is oblitera- ted from hearts made for virtuous actions, and then they stay willingly-often have to beg for the privilege of staying, for "old goods " in this branch of trade are a greater drug in the market of seduction, than old dry goods upon the merchant's shelves.

Hence all the arts that cunning vile women know of are used to obtain new toys for their customers. Lovetree slept but little that night. How he did walk up and down the corridors of the Astor house the next morning, watching every one that entered, hoping it might be the little pedler girl. She was at home and asleep. She got home before her mother and went to bed, so that she knew nothing of the coming of Mrs. Morgan. All slept late, and Stella's mother saw her daughter sleeping so sweetly that she could not bear to wake her for her daily task until breakfast was ready. How delighted she was to see Mrs. Morgan! "Oh, mother, mother, let me go and tell that gentleman; -I will bring him right here. He will be so glad to see Mrs Morgan."      , "So glad to see me, Stella, who is it that knows me." "He don't know you at all. But when I told him about you, he and that other gentleman said that they would go right-off to Mrs. Laylor's, and get you away." ' Why, Stella, my daughter, who are you talking about? We do not understand a word you are saying." "Don't you, no, you do not; I had forgotten that I had not told you about those two nice gentlemen that I met at the Astor house last night. Oh, mother, where did you get those bouquets . As I live there is the very one that I looked at and talked about with Joseph Butler, last night. Did you buy them, mother?" "No, Tom Top brought them here just as we got home, and   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.      .295 said that an old gray-headed gentleman bought them of Jo- seph, and gave him a shilling to bring them here, one for me, and one for you." "Oh, my, that must be him, who else could it be? And then, .only think of it, his name is just like M/is. Morgan's be- fore she was married." "What, Lovetree? Is his name Lovetree .

No, no, I cannot eat now, I must run and tell him, that you are here, it will make him so happy. So it did. There was another happy person that day; ah, two or three of them, for Mrs. May and Stella were almost as happy as Athalia; when he came they saw how quickly she recognized him, and how overjoyed he was to see her, and how he hugged her and kissed her, and then he took Stella in his arms and kissed her, and told her that she should never go out peddling again; that he would set her mother up in a little shop, and Stella should be her clerk, for he felt that he owed all that he now enjoyed to her, and he owed her mother a great debt for her kind intention and goodness of heart, in getting Athalia away from that house; and then he told them all about his visit to Mrs. Laylor's, and Mrs. May told all about how she worked her plan to get Athalia away; how she dressed her up and sent her down first, and then she watched until she saw the other girl in the hall, and then went down herself.

Joseph,.she wanted Joseph to tell that other gentleman; and S6 she did, and Joseph told " the other gentleman," when he came by and stopped to give the poor crippled black man a kind word, which always lighted up a pleasant smile upon his fine face; and in the evening the two gentlemen, and the two ladies, and the dear little girl, all sat down in Mrs. May's little parlor, to such a supper, as, perhaps, never had been set in that room before. This was one of Mr. Lovetree's whims. It was a thanksgiving supper, he said, for the prodigal returned, and he wanted to eat it there, all by themselves; and so he went out and ordered the best of everything that could be provided sent there, and then as happy a party sat down as ever enjoyed a supper in New York. Athalia and Hter uncle had talked all day, and she had told him alli the secrets of her life, and he had forgiven her everything, and told her that he would love her as long as she would love him. Then he asked Stella to go out and get him some writing materials, and then her eyes fairly danced with joy as she ran and got her own little portfolio, one that she had made herself out of some colored paper, and asked him if he would use her pen and paper. He did so, aqd then wrapped up the little home-made article in a newspaper, and carried it away with him, without saying a word. Stella thought it very queer that he should do so, and she almost dropped a tear at the thought of losing it, for it had cost her a good many hours of busy work to make it. After awhile a boy l rought it back, wrapped in the same paper, but as it had her name on the outside, she thought she would open it, to   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.       297 see what he had put in it; " some paper, I dare say, in place of that which he had used." That was not what she found; she foundin place of her old one, the most beautiful portfolio that could be found in New York, filled with all sorts of sta- tionery that could be desired. After supper was over, of course Stella had to get her port- folio, and show it, and talk about it; and then Mr. Lovetree talked about what he had written with Stella's pen-it was his will. "I have made," said he, "Athalia my heir. I adopt her as my daughter, and shall always treat her as my child. I hope she will always feel towards me as she would if I were her father in fact. A She is an orphan, and she is a widow#' "A widow--a widow?" "Is Walter dead?" "Is that so, uncle-father i" "Yes, it is so. When I went to the attorney to see if I had got my will all right, and when he came to the name of Athalia Morgan, he saidi 'Oh, that is Walter Morgan's widow.' Then, I said, widow, widow, just as you all did a minute since. And he told me, that was the fact; and a good thing it was that he was dead, for he got to be a terrible sot. And now, Athalia is my heir, and my executor. When I am dead she will do what she pleases with what I leave, and get married again if she likes; she has promised me that she never will while I live.

This is the clause, 'To the owner of the pen with which I wrote this will, I bequeath five hundred dollars.'" "Why, what is there in that to cry about? Bless my heart, I thought I was going to make you all happy, and here you are all-shedding tears." "Oh, uncle, uncle, you have made us happy. These are tears of joy and gladness. How noble, how generous, how good!" "Just like him," said the other gentleman. "This to me! Oh, Mr. Lovetree, this to the poor widow! This to my daughter!" *"To me, mother, to me? Does it mean me? Yes! Oh, mother, may I kiss him 7" Before anybody could say no, if they had been disposed to, Stella was in his arms, and who shall say, that to one of his wealth, that moment was not cheaply purchased for five hun- dred dollars. Happiness is contagious. Those who feel it, feel as though they would like, to make everybody else feel just so. Stella did, for she reached out one hand and drew her mother to the same enfolding arms, and then Athalia enfolded them all, until it seemed to my dim-growing eyes that four exceedingly happy people were blending all in one. Feeling how useless is a fifth wheel to a vehicle already having four, and feeling too a sort of choking sensation, as though the air of the street would be beneficial, while this scene was on, I went off. When I had breathed the fresh air long enough to recover my equilibrium of thoughts, one came into my mind that I   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.       299 might do something to increase the happiness of the full hearts I had just left. With this new idea in my mind I took my way directly to Mrs. Laylor's. Of course I found the storm had passed. A May morning could not be more calm and pleasant. Of course I was a welcome visitor. I had ordered a bottle of wine the night beforel that paid my footing. I had spent money for one sin, and apparently seemed willing to spend more for another, and that always makes welcome guests, because profit can be made out of such visitors. I had an object in my course the night before; I had nothing of that kind to accomplish to-night, and so I ordered no wine. I looked serious, earnest, determined, and asked Mrs. Laylor for a private interview. It is not necessary to inflict the particulara upon my readers; it will be only interesting to them to know that one of the results of the tall; did -add to the happiness of those whom I had just left already very happy, for just as Lovetree was in the act of kissing good-night to Athalia, there came a rap to the door, it was a porter's rap; his load was a trunk, a bandbox and a square bundle. The bundle was opened first, its contents were now doubly dear, and Athalia longed to show it to her uncle. It was the old family Bible. Everything had been sent ]ut the watch. That was irrecoverably lost. As I was leaving Mrs. Laylor's, with the porter and Athalia's trunk, I met Frank Barkley and had five minutes talk with him. As we parted, he said: "Depend upon it I shall claim my bet, and the stake is in the hands of a friend who will fork over." The next morning Athalia met with another surprise. The three had just finished breakfast, and sat talking over the  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7638-00000157"/> 300 '        HOT CORN. strange events of the last day or two, congratulating each e other upon their singular good fortune, and laying out plans for the day, while awaiting the momentarily expected arrival of Mr. Lovetree. Mrs. May and Stella were to go out and look up a place for the " little shop," which was to hold an d  assortment of just such goods as she had been accustomed to sell out of her basket, to which her mother was to add her nice shirt collars, and perhaps the work of some other poor woman who might be in need of assistance; and Athalia and her uncle were to go "house hunting," a very common employment in New York, for he was going to set her up in a business that she could live by, and have a house for herself and him too, when he was in the city, and pretty soon he hoped that would be all the time; 'it should be as. soon as he could, get his Western business settled up; but she should have a house and take a few boarders, and always keep a room for him, and he would always call that home; " and we shall be so happy," says she, "and if he is sick I will take care of him, and if I am sick I know  he will be kind to me, he looks just as though he would; don't you think so, Mrs. May?" "Indeed he does; and you will be so happy, but I do not know as you will be quite so happy as Stella and I shall be, when we get a-going.  I  am happy now, only one thing troubles me a little, I do not know what I am going to do for * a  little money for present necessities. I had just paid my month's rent, ten dollars iii advance, and bought a piece of linen for my work, and Stella had laid out all of her little stock, and now we are quite oit. If you had money as you   aLIE SCE;S 1N A;'EW Yo/K.      301 once had, I should know very well what to do. I should ask you for a loan of five dollars. and I know very well what you . would say; no, you would not say anything, you would jump up and run to the little drawer, the left-hand top drawer of the bureau, I can almost see it now, and then you would say, 'there, there it is, go along, I don't want you to stop to thank me.' But that time has past away. I suppose I shall have to 'do what we poor folks often have to do, go to the pawnbroker again." "Your trouble, Mrs. May, is just mine too; I want a few dollars so bad that I do not know what to do, and I was about to ask you; I do not like to ask my uncle, so soon, and would not on my own account, but will on yours."  "No; no, no, do not, I can get along very well, I can pawn the linen, I shall not want that for a few days." "Yes, I will, do not say anything more, I have made up my mind, and here he comes, so it is too late for argument." There was a rap, and as they did not expect anybody else, of course it must be her uncle; who else should it be? but it was not. It was the same porter who was there last evening. He did not bring any trunk or bundle, he simply brought a letter and a very small package; a letter addressed, '"Lucy Smith.,  Athalia was on the point of denying it, but then she thought that Mrs. May and Stella both knew that was the name she was known by at Mrs. Laylor's.

She trembled at the thought of having any of her old acquaintances, who knew her by that name, write to her or speak to her as friends, for they were only friends of days which she would gladly blot out of memory--days of sin and shame, which she looked back upon with horror, as she felt their deep degradation. She trembled still more when she opened the letter, and saw that the signature was Frank Bark- ley. , She felt faint, and her eyes grew dim, for she felt that she w s still pursued--  the guilty flee when no man pursueth-- by one with whom  she had sinned, and she felt that it was a renewal of the proposition to sin again. She saw the name, and the "Dear Lucy" with which it commenced, she saw no more, she could see no more, and so she handed the letter to Mrs. May, with an "oh, dear!" Mrs. May read it, and then she said, "Oh, dear," but it was a very different "Oh, dear," from Athalia's. It was an"Oh, dear, what a  fortune," and then she handed the letter back to Athalia, and said, " read, you will not find it very bad."  Her joyous smile reassured the fainting, trembling Athalia, and she read: "My DEAR LUCY. "Dearer to me now than ever. I have heard from a mutual friend all about it. First, forgive me for the wrong I have done you. I shall not do it again. Blush not to meet me in the street or church, for by no look or word will I ever seek to renew our acquaintance.

I have thought a great deal of you, and of your history, as T gleaned it partly from you and partly from Mrs. Laylor, but the last and best part from your friend.

Now let us look at the watch." They did look at it, and of course admire it, and then Mr. Lovetree came in, and then the letter was read again, and then he said, " the fellow has got a heart after all, it has only been spoiled by bad associations; he has got a good start now in the right  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7638-00000159"/> 304       -  HOT CO'1x. path, and I shall make it my business to look him up and help him along. Do you know, Athalia, where he lives?" "I have his card, sir, in my trunk." "CVe'y well, give it to me at your leisure, and we will let him know that the pearls of that letter have not been cast before the very worst sort of pigs." Then Stella was going out to get the check changed, and then he said, "Never mind, give it to me," and then he put it in his pocket-book very carefully, and put that away in his left-hand pocket-he had a place for everything; and then he put his hand into his right-hand pocket, and took out fifty dollars in gold, and handed that to Athalia, with the remark that he would bring her the balance to-morrow, that thlat was as much as she would want to-day; and then he said, as he saw her slipping it slyly into Mrs. May's hand, "Oh, that is it. is it?" and then Mrs. May said, she m1ust tell, and then she did tell all about her want of money, and how she used to go to Athalia when she was in want, and now, when neith'er of them had any, it did seem as though the good spirit had opened the heart of that man to repentance and good works, just when it was most needed." And then they all went out, Mrs. May and Stella to hunt for the shop, which they found and had in operation in a week, and which was the foundation of a fortune, for it pros- pered wonderfully. The ball only needed a start, it would accumulate at every roll. It is accumulating still. I wish a few more benevolent old gentlemen would take each one of them a little girl out of the street, and set the ball to rolling.

"There is some soul of goodness in things evil, Would man observingly distil it out." THAT was well exemplified in the last chapter. It may be in this. If any of the readers of these "Scenes " suppose the writer lost sight of the chance to do good, and the right time to do it, that the death of "Little Katy," offered, they are quite mistaken. Although he may not be aole to do with his own purse, he has a way of procuring others to do a part that is so much needed to be done. He found that Katy had an aunt in the city, who was able to do for her sister, and he took the preliminary steps to restore the poor, lost sheep to the fold from which she had strayed. That he should have lost sight of her for a little while, in the busy whirl of city life, is not surprising. That the reader has been left in suspense, while he has had many other scenes before him, the author hopes he will not regret. We do not travel old, beaten paths, in this volume. As the subject is new, so is the way of illustrating it. Now, let us walk on. "There has been a black woman here twice this evening after you, and she says, she must have the sight of ye afore she sleeps, any how."   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.       307 This was a piece of Irish information, which met me as 1 opened the door, one night, in rather a melancholy mood, for I was as yet supperless, tired, sleepy, and about half sick, from breathing fetid air four or five hours, while visiting the poorest of the city poor, the denizens of Cow Bay. Now, it must not be understood that Mrs. McTraversa intended to tell me that the Ethiopian female, who had twice called at my abode, and declared that "she must have the sight of me before she slept," had the least desire to gouge out my eyes. On the contrary, she was only anxious to have a sight of the ugly visage I own, and come within speaking distance of me. "What for? What did she want, Mrs. McTravers?" "Sure, your honor, it's not the likes of me knows what a lady wants with a lone gentleman at this time o'night." If I did not swear, I had some very hard thoughts at the blundering awkwardness of this woman, or her entire ina- bility to convey ideas by language, so that I could understand them " at this time of night." She proceeded to give a most minute description of " the black woman," how she looked, and talked, and dressed. Who could it be? I run over in iny mind all of my Afri- can female acquaintances-not large-but not one of themr answered the description given by Mrs. McTravers. I was about proceeding up stairs, when she said, "ye'll surely go and see the sick lady." I had a slight internal.  ntimnation that I was nearly losing my patience. "Irs. MeTravers, what is it about a sick lady-? You have  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7638-00000161"/> 308          HOT CORN. not told me a word about anybody, sick or well, except a ne- gro woman, and you have not told me what she wanted." "And sure, then, I thought you knew all about it. The wench said you knew the lady." "I know a good many, but how can I tell which one of my acquaintances this may be?" "Why sure, then I thought you would know when I told you where she lived." "In the name of common sense, Mrs. MoTravers, if you know who the sick woman is, or where she lives, or what she wants, why don't you tell me?"' "Wasn't I going' to, only you put me into such a flustera- tion . There, sure, that'll tell you all about it."' And she handed me a piece of paper, on which was written, in a very delicate lady hand, though evidently nervous, "Madame De Vrai, 53 W- street." I am sure I must have looked like a living specimen of con- fusion worse confounded. The name I had never heard be- fore. The street was an unknown locality. I only knew it was a street on the west side of the city, somewhere, and whether it had such a number as " 53," was entirely too much for my arithmetic. I determined not to go. Still there was a mys- ter, that natural curiosity prompted me to solve. Who could it be?"Did the black woman say that I was acquainted with the lady?" "She did that, and that you had been very kind to her. God bless you for that same, for being so to a stranger and a foreigner too at that. The black woman said you was a bless-   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.       309 ed good man to the poor lady, and a father to her childer, dead and alive." Was anything ever so provoking as the stolidity of an Irish servant. Every word she uttered made the mystery still dark- er. I knew no Madame De Vrai; never heard of the name before in my life-took no credit to myself for any special act of kindness to the poor in general, and certainly could not call to mind any act of my life that would warrant me in appropriating the blessing so heartily offered for my accept- ance. As to being the father of the poor woman's " childer, dead and alive," I declared emphatically that it wasjust no such thing. I would not own them. So I called for some- thing to eat, and determined to go to bed, fully satisfied that African blunders and Irish ditto, duly mixed, had made one this time, too large for my mastery, either with my very common name, or by a mistake in the ofreet or number; or else somebody else had undertaken to father this family, and -now desired to shift the responsibility; certainly I had not, could not, would not father them. So I sat munching and musing over my bread and butter and cold water, of the scenes of the evening which I had witnessed. "Would, to Heaven I knew what had become of her," I thougrllt aloud. "Who?" said a kind voice at my elbow. "What lady are you so anxions about now. Any of your Five Point proteges?" "Yes. You have guessed it exactly. None other." "Is that what you have been looking for to-night. Do tell me of your visit. What have you seen 8"   &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7638-00000162"/> 310          Hor CORN. "More of human misery than I ever saw before in one night, Would you like to hear the detail?" "Yes, it may do me good to hear how others live, and if worse than I do, it may make me more contented with my own lot." "Worse than you do? Why, madam, have- you not all that is necessary to make life comfortable around you. A neat, airy, well-furnished house, plenty of room, plenty to eat, good bed to sleep on, good baths for evening ablution or morning renovation, and above all the )ther luxuries of city life, plenty of that greatest of -New York's blessings, the Cro- ton water?

Nobody is necessitated to be crim- inal." "You are simply mistaken; I repeat, criminal by necessi- ty.

At one end was the narrow, muddy stairway and door, by which we entered, and at the other a fire-place. On one side two windows with places for three panes of glass to each, gave all the light and ventilation afforded to the four families who occupied the room. These consisted of two men and their wives, two single women, an old woman and her three boys, and a young Jgirl as a boarder. There were four sleeping places, called beds, upon forms, elevated above the floor, for none could sleep on that on account of the water. "Do you always have the water as bad as it is now."

"She knew us by sight, or rather she knew him as one of the active helpers of the Missionary, Mr. Pease, the House of Industry, and the Five Points Mission. What more should she know to hate us? She knew we were not of her faith; that we believed not in the efficacy of holy water and con- fession, to work out sin; that we did not kneel and receive a consecrated wafer with ' extreme unction', and so she hated us with all the fervent rancor of religious hate. She hated us for our mission of good; for she knew we hated what she dearly loved--drunkenness and all its concomitant evils. She lated us with that envious hate of depravity, which would sink everything to its own level.

Sooner than it should go into a Protestant house, she would see it die. Alas! poor human nature; yes, poor human nature, sunk down into these depths of misery and degradation, yet every one of them are our brothers and sisters, who are rearing up children like themselves, as true as like produces like, while we look on, shrug our comfortably-wrapped shoulders, and "Thank God we are not like one of these," and yet never give, out of our abundance, one cent to make one of them like one of us.

And she sank down upon one of the pallets which wCre spread over the floor, in a paroxysm of wild, delirious grief and rage, speechless as her dying boy, lying unheeded and unheeding, by her side. What could we do? Nothing here; much elsewhere; and we looked up and registered a vow, that much as she hated us for what we had not done, yet had permitted our fellows to do without crying -out against them, that she should be avenged. If we could do nothing here-if we could not pull down the sturdy oak by taking hold of its topmost branches, yet, although its mighty strength defies our weak efforts thus applied, we can and will dig around its roots-we will take away the life-sustaining earth--and that strong tree shall be made to feel our power --it shall wither, dry up, and die, and time shall rot down its strong trunk, and the place that once knew it, shall know it no more. This then is our pledge, made over that dying boy, and, worse than by murder, widowed mother, and here now we redeem it. Here we expose the hydra-headed monster-the orphan and widow-maker-the property, health, and virtue- destroyer. Sad, harrowing as these scenes of wretchedness and misery are, they must be laid open to the gaze of the world. "Wounds must be seen to be healed." Weak nerves tremble at the idea that physicians cut and carve the dead, talking, aye laughing, as freely over the quiet heart and still nerves in the dissecting-room, as the butcher over his beef upon the market house block; yet without the dissecting of one and butchlering of the other, how should the maimed be   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.       321 healed, or meat-eating multitude be fed? So let us on with' our panorama of scenes from life in New York. Let us open this door. Ah! we have been here before. The room is seven by twelve feet, under the roof, which comes down at one end within a foot of the floor. There is a broken, dirty, window in the roof, at the right hand of the door as we enter on the side. No fire-place or stove, no table, only two broken chairs-a very old bureau--a dilapidated trunk-a band-box-a few articles of female apparel-some poor dishes and a few cooking ustensils-used upon a little portable furnace standing in the room--a poor old bedstead and straw bed in one corner-a child's cot and a doll; and yet the only occupant of the room is an old negro man, who sits of nights upon cold stones, crying Hot Corn. We look about wonderingly, peering in here and there, but except the old man we see no one.

"Who a?" said the lady who had been listening with intense interest to my narrative. "True, I had forgotten to tell you that we stood in the chamber where little Katy died. Where that last sweet kiss of an angel was given-where the candle seemed to'the dying innocent to go out-where she said, 'Good bye-mother- don't drink-any more-good b--' but before the word was finished, there was another angel added to the heavenly host around the throne of God." It was here that the scene, which the artist has so touch- ingly illustrated upon the opposite page, transpired. Turn your thoughts a moment from this page to that and look upon the picture. Turn back to Chapter VI., "The Home of Little Katy," and read over the story of the death of that poor inno- cent, and you will better appreciate the description and illus- tration of that home and that dying scene. 'Twas then and there that that fallen mother was- touched by a power greater than human strength-'twas then as she knelt over her dead child, she had said, "never, never, never, will I touch that accursed poison cup. Oh, God," she prayed, "take my child, my wronged and murdered child, and I will not repine; I will thank thee; I will praise thy name as my mother taught me to praise thee; as she loved and blessed, and prayed for me all her life, even after my fall, although hastened to 'her grave by my sin.

What was that still small voice that seemed to say in our ears, as she ceased speaking, and lay sobbing upon the breast of little Katy? "Yes, sister, he can, he will, he has; rise, thy sins are for- given thee." Did she hear it too? Else, why did she instantly rise up, with dry eyes and calm, almost happy features? It was then that I gained from her the secret of her sister's name, upon a promise that I did not keep--I could not keep --it was not my duty to keep it. But where has she gone? Has her sister got my letter?-has her heart at last been touched?-has she taken her away? It' so, why has-she not told me where.

"But she sent her name by the black woman, when she came the second time." "I know it, but it is no one that I know. The name is utterly unknown to me. It is a French name. Some mis- take." There was a mistake. What prompted me to look again at the name? I knew it as well as I should if I looked at that paper a hundred times. Yet I was prompted -to look at it once more. The desire was irresistible. Who has ever felt a longing after somethng unseen, unkniown, unheard, undefined, something that he feels as though he must have or die, yet knows not how to obtain, may realize the intensity of my desire to see that paper once more. Where is it? This pocket, and that is searched, turned wrong side out, and turned back again; the table, floor, books, papers, hunted over, but nowhere can it be found.; What has spirited it away? It could not blow out of the window, for there is no air stirring. "It must," said the lady, " have gone down on the tea-tray -I will call Bridget." A woman is worth 'a dozen men for thought, and this time she thought truly. It had gone down that way, and gone into the slop-bucket, and into the street. "Bridget, will you take a lamp and go out and see if you can find it." 4' Yes, sir, certainly, and I think I can." Blessed hope. My friend was curious to know, what il the world I wanted of that p8ece of paper .

Do wait, don't be so impatient to meet her at the foot of the stairs," I did not wait though. I gave one glance-at the soiled scrap -it was enough-the pen and ink name had faded out, but there were three words-talismanic words-in pencil marks, evidently added as an after-thought by her who had first written her name in inlk-words which sent me out of the door, and half way to the next street, before that voice, sent after me from the stair-head, of "Do stop him, Bridget, he is crazy, to go out in this rain," had reached my ears.

The girl looked at the door just closed, shutting the man out in the rain, then she examined the corner where the cane and umbrella usually stood, to be sure they had gone out too, that she had not been dreaming all the while; then she gave a glance at the table to satisfy herself that the hat had gone with the cane and umbrella; then she looked again at the paper, to see what magic power that might possess, to do such midnight. deeds. Papers have great power.  Poor Bridget, she could not read, but she could feel, and she knew that there was a cause-the effect she had seen.

What but savages are they? True they had white skins and Christian clothes,.and spoke the language of a civilized nation, and dwelt in "one of the first cities in the world." Yet they pursued a poor, young, helpless female, like a hunted hare through the streets, and now press hard upon her two protectors; one a delicate, sickly lady, the other a timid servant girl, with a cry to Bill, the leader, to " bring her out"-to drag her by force from where she has sunk down upon the very threshold of a house which'she hopes may offer her protection, yet she dares not ask it. Shanme has overcome her, she buries her face in her hands as she sits crouched up in a corner, but neither looks up nor speaks.

It appealed to a woman's heart. for protection--an appeal that never failed. How can she protect the helpless with her feeble strength, against the brutal force of rum crazed men and vicious boys, who shout, " drag her out, drag her out." Will they do it.? They heed not the appealing look of their victim-their object of sport--fun-ftln for them, death to her. They heed not the appealing words of her who would protect.

"TTLE KATY S MOTHER&amp; "A true devoted pilgrim is not weary, To measure kingdoms with his steps." WHEN Mrs. MeTravers told me that Mrs. De Vrai had sent a message for me, I was too weary to measure steps along a few blocks; but when I read those three little magic words, weariness had gone. Bridget thought so too. "He is gone, ma'am." Yes, he was gone, gone abroad at midnight with a merry heart.

N6 matter, the almanac had said it, and that was enough for the gas contractors. If the moon chose to get behind a cloud, it was none of their look out. They would not light their lamps, though darkness, thick, black darkness, spread over the earth. Why should- they? It was not in the bond. -So the traveller plodded on in the dark. How   "FE SCENES INIT NEW YFORK.      835 could one see the numbers? Not by city light, but by city license. Here burns a " coffee-house " lamp, where rum alone is sold. More improvident than his city fathers, this one lights up his lamp, of dark, rainy nights, whether the moon is in the almanac, or city fathers' brains. His number is plain enoughl. 'Tis an even number-I am on the wrong side of the street. Now, cross over, and here is, 47, 49, 51, 53-this must be it, and yet it cannot be. It is a neat, two story, brick house, with basement and attic, in a row of the same sort, in a clean, wide street. It is a very unlikely place for such a home as we have seen, for the home of Little Katy's mother. How, are we deceived again? It must be in the number; perhaps we can not see it rightly by the dim glimmer of the grog-shop lamp. It is the first glimmer that ever came from such a place to any good. There is no bell, but there is an old-fashioned iron knocker upon the door; shall I use it; what if it wakes up some strange sleeper and brings a fever-heated night-capped angry head out of the upper window, with hasty words, perhaps cross ones of "who is there?"  I have no familiar "it's me," to answer. No one will say, "wait a moment, dear, and I will open the door." All is still within. It were a pity to disturb the quiet sleepers for nothing, nothing but the gratification of idle cu- riosity; to make the inquiry if-if -Mrs. Mrs.-what was her name?

Should I inquire for "Little Katy's Mother?"I should in all probability be told to go across the street and inquire there, where I got my liquor, upon which to get drunk. Or else, perhaps, to go home and inquire if my " mother knew that I was out ;" or told that she might happen to wake up, and find her green gosling of a son gone-gone out in the street to inquire after little girls' mothers-no doubt she would be much alarmed. It was well that the moon was veiled, or else the man in it would have seen how sheepish I looked as I sneaked down the steps, with a weary step, that could not have gone the half a mile without tiring. How I did rejoice that no watchman was in sight to see how crest-fallen I went away and stood up in the shade of a lamppost! A few minutes afterwards, I would have given gold for the sight of a brass star. What for? Why did I not go home? What prompted me to keep watch at that lamp post? My object in coming had failed. I had acted upon the momentary spur of a ner- vous temperament, heated into a state of excitement by what I had seen in the early part of the evening, connected with some of the scenes of the last few weeks' excitingr life, which had driven me, without consideration, to start off chasing an ignis fatuus, in the swampy, Jack o'lantern producing air of this city, and it had led me here and left me leaning against a lamp post.

The last sad remains of a gentlemen-no-a roue, stood in: the dim light of a lamp "which had been to him the guide to; ruin. "Ha, ha, ha, my old bird, you are astir I see.

Back he went around the corner, the star went:carelessly-onward down that way, and I went eaves-diopping. I was impelled to do it. I saw a light come n;the frbnrontrooni and heard voices, and felt that there'was some strange connection between this house and that man, and perhaps myself, and that the mystery must soon be solved. 15  &#xD;<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC7638-00000178"/> 83-8    -     HOT CORN. The blinds were closed, but the sash was up. I stood close under the window, and the voices dropped down upon my ear through the slats, clear and distinct as though I had been in the room. The light-bearer with a noiseless step, as though afraid of awaking some sick sleeper, approached a bed, shading the light with her hand. It was no use. The timid start easy. There was a rustling sound, as though some one started up from an uneasy pillow and sleep-disturbing dreams. "Will he come?" That voice, those words. Do I dream, or are there spirits near? Oh, how familiar-how painfully familiar-reminis- cential of things past. What can it mean? But one voice ever spoke those words in that tone, and that voice will never speak again. The dreamer is in the street. It is my brain that is disturbed. Hark! Again! I heard aright. "Oh, no, he will not come. Why should he? What am I to'him? Yet I wanted to see him a moment.

"Well, dat all de time wid some folk." There was a groan of anguish in the bed. "But, Phebe, you describe his looks just as I saw them to- day. Have you seen him?" , Oh, yes, ma'am-thought I wouldn't tell you though- but it come out when I didn't know him.' "Where? Has he been here? Has he tracked me home ." "Why, you see, ma'am, when I goes to the door to let Agnes -Brentnall out, I sees him over the waeyy de lamp, and when she goes down the street, he walks after her, and dat am last I see of him dis night." "Poor girl, then she is lost. If ever he fixes his basalisk eye upon her beauty, how can she escape. Poor girl-God protect thee--man will not." There was a sobbing that told of tears-tears that told of a kind heart, crushed by a cold and careless world. Then I was about to enter, but something said, "not yet," and I stepped down into the shadow by the high steps, till the footfall I heard upon the pavement should go by. It did not pass--it came directly up to the door, familiar as a burglar with its night latch key.

The intruder-it was the dark-visaged man I had seen five minutes before-closed the door gently after him without latching it. There was a thin lace curtain before the window, through which, as I looked in between the slats of the blind, I could see him as he approached the bed. Phebe had left the light and gone into the back room. The lady had buried her face in the pillows-nothing but her raven locks, hanging loose in her neck, were visible. The villain looked at her for a moment, then, satisfied that she was asleep, he reached over her, and lifted a beautiful little girl from her side. "Mother! mother!" The light shone in her face--the mother started at the appealing cry for help-sprang up-Heavens, what do we see? It is little Sissee .-Little Katy's sister and her mother! What a sight for that -mother! The man she so much dreaded-the man who had so disturbed her dreams-with her child, her last, her only child, in his strong arms, and no one near to protect, to save. She sprang towards him, and fixed her feeble hands in his hair.  Of what avail? He flung her from him reeling, fainting, across the roomp. The noise brought the faithful Phebe from her couch-too late. The mother saw her child disappearing in the dark passage--she heard her screams for' help-she heard no more.

I dragged the unconscious mass of human flesh down upon the pavement, and struck three sharp blows upon the stones, with the broken cane-broken in avenging a feeble woman.

We have only heard the name once, during the conversa- tion, between Madame De Vrai and the black woman, Phebe, overheard in that eaves-dropping midnight scene described in the last chapter, unless this Agnes is the same one that we saw in a previous midnight scene. Perhaps it is, for now we remember there was a Phebe in that. At any rate that name, from both of these night scenes, had become deeply impressed upon my mind, as belonging to a beautiful girl, followed in the street by a night-prowling wolf, with a canine instinct which snuffs in the breeze the far-off scent that leads him to some wandering female, Mrs. De Vrai had said; "Then she is lost."

He will make a good Sing Sing worker in stone. It will not break his heart, for it is as hard as the stone he will hammer. But what of poor Agnes? Would that I knew. Did she fall before his basalisk eye? Such thoughts were upon my mind as I entered the door of the house I called my home, after such a night of strange adventures as I have just made the reader acquainted with. "Where have you been." was the anxious question that met me as I entered. "What in the world took you out and kept you out all night?  Did you find that woman? How is she? Is any- thing the matter? I do think you might write quite a romance out of your adventures." There is no occasion to write romance, it is only necessary to give the real pictures of life-real scenes as they occur in New York, to make up a volume more strange than wildest romance.             a "Where have I been.

"You took her in . Yes, yes; I see, I see--a heavenly eed produces a heavenly smile." What was it shot through my brain. A thought. A range thought. What could have sent it there.

Her kind protector had furnished or with a clean, white bed-gown and cap, and a prettier face, dicating about sixteeen or seventeen years, never looked up ailingly from a downy pillow.

It was the latter for whom she was now so anxious to get up out of her sick bed, that she might go and tell the gentleman who wrote the story of "Little Katy," that Little Katy's mother was almost dying to see him. It was by that token that she would find him. "Did Mrs. Morgan tell you my name." "No, she has not told me; you told me that a long time ago g "Me, sir? Do you know me, sir?"

When I got in the street, I did not know which way I went. I should have gone up Broadway, but we did not. Everything seemed so strange. I felt as though I could fly almost. I never felt so before. I clung to his arm, I could not walk without it. I felt as though I could almost hug him. And then he put his arm around my waist; I am sure I would not have let him do that if I had known what I was about; and so we went on, I do not know how far, or which way, but it could not have been a great way, and then he went up to a great fine house, with a silver plate on the door, with a name on it in great letters, it was Phillips or Brown, or something, only one name-just as though they were ashamed of the other, or else did not want to be known, or something. I said, don't go in there, what will the folks think? and he said, 'Oh, this is a friend of mine lives here, a very nice lady, and we will stop and rest a little while, and then I will go home with you.

And there it was again, for she said, 'there is a gen- tleman and lady in No. 6 now; I will give them another, all right.' I am sure, I never shall hear that word again without believing it means all wrong. But I scarcely knew right from wrong; I just held to his arm, and went wherever he led me. It was a very nice room that she showed us in. There were beautiful pictures on the walls; I could not see very well what they were, but I thought they looked like some I had seen once before, such as I am sure never should be hung up anywhere. There was a great mirror, and marble-top tables, and washstand, a very rich carpet, and such a splendid bed, and chairs and rocking chairs, one of which I sat down in, for I felt so tired and sort of sleepy; and then he told the servant to bring in some water, and when it came, he poured out a tumbler full, but I do believe it was half wine, and I drank it down, and then I felt, oh, I never can tell how I felt, or what happened after that; but I know more happened, and that more was-was-what I never can tell."

L All things are pure to those who are pure." "Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile." iPERHAPS some of my readers have been sufficiently inter- ested to inquire, "Who is Agnes, and what of her?"Perhaps there -may be some, who, like Mrs. McTravers, think she is n:ot a proper character to introduce into a respectable family, coming as she did from a house which gives an air of taint, spoiled, lost, ruined, to every character that is found within its walls. I am aware that there is room for suspicion, but suspicion is not proof. In the case of Athalia, her acknow- ledged sin is no more proof of moral turpitude than any other act of a deranged mind. A lunatic may kill, yet it is not murder. A drunken husband may beat his loving wife, and love her still. It was 'not the man who struck the blow, it was the demon Rum! It was not Athalia who lost her virtue, it was the worse than demon who robbed her-intoxicated her- destroyed her reason-enslaved her mind--but he did not, could   not, destroy her virtuous, benevolent heart. Her conduct toward Agnes, is alone sufficient to prove this. And if she had known as much as I did of Agnes, that there might be some ground of suspicion against her, it would have made 16  &#xD;<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC7638-00000190"/> -362       '   HOT COR. to odds; she would have taken her in and taken care of he, in the same way, if she had known that she was a great sinner; that is the true way to work reformation;.and then she would have said, "Go, daughter, and sin no more." But she knew nothing against Agnes; even after I had told her of the trunk, she said, all may yet be right. She was unwilling to believe that all was wrong. How triumphantly she met -me as I came home in-the evening--how'a woman does love to triumph over us in a good cause, proving herself what' she is in all the purest qualities of the heart,-our superior. "I told you so," said Athalia. "I knew there had been some base deception, some wickedness practiced towards that ,poor girl to inveigle her into that house. - Come up stairs, and you shall hear her story from her own lips; she is quite smart now, and able to sit up and talk, and looks so pretty--she is pretty, and that has been the great cause of her trouble.

And so she came, and such a time! why, if she had been her own child, she could not have been more affectionate. And then Agnes told us her story, and then I told Mrs. Meltrand, that is her name, about Mrs. De Vrai, and how that same man, who treated Agnes so badly, tried to steal Mrs. De Vrai's little girl, and then she said, 'how singular,' and then of course I said, what is so singular?" "Ah me, it is a long story, and would not interest you, but I was robbed of a dear little girl, fifteen years ago, in England, by just such a man, in just the same way, but it could not have been this man, his name was Brentnall." "Brentnall, why that is my name," said Agnes. "Your name, why you never told me that before." "No, ma'am, you never asked me, and I did not suppose that you cared to know anything about me, only that I was a good girl, and did your work well, and answered to the name of Agnes." True. How little interest we all take in our servants; they come and go and we never know that they have any namne but one that is most convenient to call them by, and we take no interest in them, hardly enough to know that they possess souls as precious as our own. "And so, your name is Brentnall, what was your father's name?"  &#xD;<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC7638-00000191"/> 364          HOT CORN.  "I don't know, ma'am, as I ever had any, or mother either." "But you must have had both." "Oh yes, I suppose I must, thhave been born, but I mean I never saw any." "Where did you live, and who brought you up?" "I lived with an uncle, near Belfast, and came over with him and his family, and every one of them died of ship fever on the voyage, and when I landed here in this great city, I was utterly alone, and almost penniless. Oh dear!" "And then Mrs. Meltrand, said,' Oh dear,' and she went away feeling sad. I do wish I knew what it could be in that name that made her feel so sad. Some reminiscence con- nected with the loss of her little. girl, I suppose. It is very sad, to lose a child by death, it must be very much more sad to have one stolen away, and never know what becomes of it, whether dead or alive; and if the mother should meet her own child in the street not to know it; but dear me, how I am running on while you are eating your supper, as though you had nothing to think of but the things that interest me so much. But if you7have been able to eat while I have been talking, come up to my room and see my protege and hear her story."                - So we went up, and found the invalid almost recovered, looking so sweet, for she looked grateful, and that, wl'en it beams out like the sunlight, will make any face took beautiful.

I  saw  an item  in one  of them this evening, about the arrest of a person whose name struck me very forcibly as being that of a man whom I once knew in Europe, and who I was very anxious to see, for I  felt the deepest interest to know what had become of his wife.

But I shall not tell my story now; I will sit down and hear yours." "Well then, Agnes, tell what you did after landing." At the sound of her name, Mr. Lovetree gave a little start, and said, "Agnes! oh, pshaw!" and sunk back again in his easy chair, as though he had been affected by the name, and thought it very foolish that he had been so. Agnes, said: "Indeed, ma'am, I don't think the gentlemen will be at all interested to hear anything about me." "Yes, yes, I have promised them." "Well, then, after my uncle died, and all my friends, I felt dreadful;, it is dreadful for a young girl to be left all alone in a strange country. So when the ship landed, or rather when she came to anchor, the people from shore came aboard, and I saw how many of the poor emigrants had friends to wel- come them, and that I had none; it was then that I felt the dreadful loneliness of my situation, and I sat down and cried, * for I could not help it, and then a man came and spoke to me very pleasantly, and asked me where I wanted to go, and all about it, and then I told him all my troubles, and then he said it was the luckiest thing in the world that I had met with him, for he was an emigrant agent, appointed by law, and he would take charge of me and take me ashore 'to a N        -h-.,   "FE SCEXES IN NEW YORKI. boarding-house, and do everything for me. And then he asked me how muchi money I had, and I told him that I had but a few shillings, of my own, but that I had three gold sovereigns that were my uncle's-he had more, a great deal more, when he died, but somebody must have- taken it away- -and that was all I had in the world besides their chests of clothes and things. And then he said, that it was very lucky for me that I had that, for he would have to pay half a guinea head-money for each passenger, no matter how many were dead, and then he would have to pay the custom-house duty, arid the wharfage and the cartage, and the'week.-in advance for the board, and that would take all the money and more too, but he would pay that and hold the things until I could pay him back. So I gave him the money, and he got the chests, all but my trunk, I would keep that, and took them ashore, and took me to a boarding-house, and that was the last I ever saw of him, or the money or chests either, he had robbed me of all of my poor uncle's things, and my three gold sovereigns; so the landlady said, and he never paid her a cent ,of board. I did not know what to do; I was willing to work, but how should I find a place. The land- lady said, I must go to the 'Intelligence office.' I thought I should like to go somewhere to get intelligence of the man who had run away with my things, or any other intelligence that would be of any benefit to a poor stranger in this great Babel of a city. And - asked her to tell me the way to the : 'Intelligence office, and I went there. It was a great room, divided into t'wo parts; one was full of men;; and the other  &#xD;<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC7638-00000193"/> s6S          HOT CORN. of girls, sitting on long,benches. I went in and sat down among them, and I suppose, I looked -sad-I . felt so, and I felt worse when I heard some of the girls snickering, and overheard them say, there is a green one.' If that was an ' Intelligence ' office, I thought it a very queer way of giving it to one so much in need of it-as I was. After a while, one of the girls came and sat down by me, and spoke kindly, and asked where I came from, and a good many questions; I was almost afraid to answer her, for fear that she was 'an emigrant agent,' too, and had some plan to cheat me, or prac- tice some deception, but I became convinced in a little while that she meant kindly; and then I told her all about myself. Then, she said, that I must get my name registered. I did not know what that was for, but I went up to the book- keeper, and told him my name, and age, and where I came from, and what I could do, and he wrote it all down in a book and then told me to give him half a dollar, and when I got a place I must give him another one; I did not know what for; he gave me no intelligence about how I was to get a; place, but he told me to go and sit down again. So I did, all that day and all the three next days, waiting for some- body to pick me out of the lot. Every hour, somebody came and looked over all the girls, for all the world just as I have seen the people do in the pig-market, at an Irish fair, until they found one that would suit.  One objected to me because I was 'green;' another, because I had never been at service in this country; another, because I had no recom- mend; and then a girl whispered to me, and told me sh6   "FE SCE3NES IN NEW YORK.      369 knew a man who would write me just as many recommends as I wanted, for a shilling a piece.

When she found that I had no friends in this country, and no father or mother in the world, she seemed still more anxious to have me, which I thought so kind of her, and then she told me that the work would be very light, only some rooms to take care of, and wait upon company a little, and she knew 1 should like the place; I thought I should; I did at first, but, I don't want to tell, before thb gentlemen, why I did not like to live there; this one knows already."' "Well, well, you need not tell, we understand all about it. You have been treated just as a great many poor girls with- out friends have been treated before in this city; and you got just as' much intelligence, and just as much profit from your application to the ' Intelligence office,' as a great many others have done before you." Now, it was Athalia's turn to tell her uncle all that she knew about Agnes, and then he told about his visit to the prison. "I found," said he, "the very man I expected, or rather hoped, it might be, and it is well that I'acted upon the impulse of the moment, for if I had not, I should have been too late.

There was a little start of surprise on my part, and that of Mrs. Morgan; but we made no interruption, and Lovetree went on with his story. We thought, though, we could not help that. "I expect he had been drinking hard, for he tore off the bandage from his arm in the night, and when the keeper opened his cell this morning, he found him almost dead with loss of blood and vital prostration. He cannot live. They had aroused him, and I -found him quite rational when I *went in, and was immediately placed beyond all doubt as to the identity of the man, for he called me by name the moment he Saw me." "I am glad you have come," said he, "I can trust you, and I want to make a clean breast of it before I die. My wife and child-my last one-are in this city, and when I am gone, I want you to go and see her, and tell'her, that I shall never trouble her any more; she will be glad to hear it, for she saw me last night, and I left the old lady somewhat in a fright.

"No, not all, for he told me, that. he believed his other wife was in this city, also, married here, and he wanted that I should look her up, too; and tell her where, perhaps, she nmay find her child." "Tell her,' said he, " that I left it with my brother, near Belfast, an Irish farmer, by the name of William Brentnall." "William  Brentnal!" said Agnes, her eyes opening with wild surprise. -"I do think," said Mr. Lovetree, "that I have lost my senses, or else some of the rest of you have.

Then, I asked him what was  her name, who I should look for, and who she should inquire for, to find her child . Then he took a little card out of his pocket, as though he would write her name, and then he seemed to recollect his broken arm, and said, with a groan, my writing days-are over, and all my days nearly.

"Then Agnes said, "Mrs. Meltrand my mother!-that is wonderful!"  Then Mr. Lovetree looked surprised; all-around him seemed to be a mass of mystery. Others began to see through it, he was now in the dark. Athalia explained. There was one point that she was not' quite clear upon, and she asked her uncle if Agnes was really De Vrai's daughter, or only Mrs. Meltrand's? "His own. Mrs. Meltrand, was his lawful wife when he married Mrs. De Vrai." "Oh my God! then Agnes is his own child." None spoke-what each thought sent a thrill of icy horror to every heart.' 'All groaned or wept, none could speak. There   "FE SCENES IX NEW YORK.       ,373 are moments in life-of speechless agony, when the mind is completely horrified, when anything that breaks the silence comes as a relief.

It is perhaps wrong to rejoice at the death of a fellow creature, but we could not feel regret. After the first flush of excitement was over, a note was written to Agnes's mother, simply stating that if she would call at Mrs. Morgan's at her earliest convenience, she would meet with an individual who could tell her of her long-lost daughter. She made it convenient to come immediately, though it was then ten o'clock at night.

It was that which drove Mrs. De Vrai step by step frommthe paths of peaceful, youthful innocence, comfort and affluence, to --but I will. not name the intermediate steps--to that wretched abode where the little girl who sold Hot Corn, and slept in the rain upon the cold stones, breathed her pure life away in prayers to that mother not to drink any more of that soul and body destroying rum.

Of course, I .was flattered, proud, vain of the attentions of an English nobleman, young, handsome, full of money, and- ardent in his professions of love, which I have no reason to think of otherwise than as sincere; I was seventeen, tall, straight, handsome form, face, and figure, and always dressed with taste.

He had always said, he would make a will, and give his vast property to me and our Child. But he put it off, as many others do, one day too long. Why do mlen defer this duty? A sacred duty to those they leave behind them, of'their own flesh and blood. I knew, as his wife, I had rights; and I went ,to England to try and obtain thenm. I left my elegantly furnished house, which cost, I don't know how many thousand dollars to furnish, for my mother and my sister, and an uncle to occupy while I was gone. I found all the property in the hands of Sir Charles's brother, and he   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.      8" was unwilling to give up the share that rightfully belonged to his wife and child, because he said, we could not recover it by law. He did not say why, mny conscience did. As awcom- promise, if I would give him a general release, he offered five thousand pounds. I would have taken it, but I had employed a lawyer, arid he hooted at the idea; he looked for more than that for his fee when he recovered the full amount. I told him that I had no marriage certificate, and that the minister who married us was- dead. So he was; Sir Charles was dead. I did not tell him that no other ever blessed our banns. I told him, that numerous persons would swear that they had heard him call me wife, and Katy his child. He said, that would do. I did not know that our opponents could produce as many more to twear, ttfat they had heard Sir Charles say, that it was only a marriage of convenience. So, for an uncertainty of five hutmdred thousand as a mere prospect, I refused the certainty of five thousand, and went to law. The evidence stood so balanced that the judge could not decide. 'Let the wife be sworn. Let her say, upon her oath, that she was married to Sir Charles, and the case will be given in her favor.' "There was a chuckling laugh just behind me, the tones of which went to my heart, and I fainted. It was De Vrai. He had known me in this city, and persecuted me with his importunities while Sir Charles was living.. I had turned "n off with a promise, all too common, 'when Sir Charles is dead.' Then he renewed his importunities, and I told him, to wait a respectful time. He followed me to England, and  &#xD;<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC7638-00000198"/> 378          HOT CORN. still pressed me, and I still put hin off. He had hinted seve. ral times that if I recovered the suit, he well knew that he should lose his. It was him that furnished my opponent with a clue to the proof that we were never married. It was him -that laughed in my ear when the case rested upon the question, whether I would swear that I was married or not. For a moment, for the sake of my child, I was tempted; that laugh recalled me partially, and I was carried away in a litter, and the case adjourned. For alughb I know it still remains adjourned. "De Vrai followed me to my hotel. I was in a state bor- dering upon distraction. With a foolish pride, to keep up appearances, as the wife of Sir Charles, I had exhausted all my means, and run awfully in debt. I had written to my uncle, in New York, to sell my furniture at auction, and send me the money.   After a long delay I got five hundred dol- lars and a very short letter, saying, that was all the nett pro- ceeds. I felt, I cannot tell how. I knew I was cheated, and wrote a bitter letter back. Then, my own friends, those who had fawned around the rich mistress of Sir Charles, cast off the poor woman struggling  to recover something for his child. In this she failed, because that child was not bo. n in wedlock. "I was now poor indeed. What could I do, alone in a strange land? I knew that De Vrai had no affectio n for me, only such as one animal has for another, bat in my despair I married him. "His means of living were derived from the same source   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.    '    379 that hundreds of well-dressed gentlemen derive theirs from:. in this city. He was a gambler ; a genteel gambler. Such as you may find in every hotel in New York, in every public place, dressed in the very best style, living in the most expen- sive manner, with no trade, occupation, or exercise of mind or skill, except the skill of cheating at-eard playing. "At first, we lived pleasantly; but pleasures with such men are short-lived, and must be often changed. If successful-in business-that is what they call their nefarious employment -they are all smiles and affection to wife and children; but if ' luck is against them,' they are the most unhappy men in the world; and make everybody else unhappy around them. As for enduring conjugal affection, I believe the excitement of a gambler's life renders them incapable of feeling its influ- ence. I can scarcely tell how the months passed which I lived with that man, for I drank wine to excess every day. Not to become intoxicated; only just fashionably excited. We lived in the best style of hotel life, often 'at the expense of the proprietors. ' A little before. Sis was born, De Vrai met with ' a run of luck,' and we took a cottage out of town, and lived very comfortably for a year, upon the proceeds of- that ' windfall.' "What that run of luck was, may be guessed at from the following extract from a morning paper:-- "SpicIDE.-An American gentleman was found dead in his bed, at his lodgings, this morning, and it is supposed he died from poison, administered by himself, in consequence of immense losses a- the gam. ing table, not only of his own money, but a sum which he hdd-  &#xD;<pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC7638-00000199"/> 380          'HOT -CORN. received in trust for a widow and orphans, in America. It is said, that he owes his losses to the wretched practice of drinking to, intoxi- cation, and that he was fairly robbed while in this condition, by a companion of his, one who made. great pretence of friendship. 13P leaves a beautiful young wife, 'quite destitute,' 'tis said." "I did not know then that this companion of his was my husband. I found that out afterwards, and that he was more than robbed. "Soon after that event, De Vrai brought the widow of his victim to live in -our house. I was the wife-she the mistress. I was blind at first, but I soon had my eyes opened. Opened not only to that fact, but that that wife had stood behind her husband's chair while he played with the villain who robbed him, and gave the signal of what cards he held; and afterwards, when he became sober enough to realize his ruin,she proposed that they should take poison, and 4ie together. "The result need not be told, only that he died and she lived. "When I made these discoveries from an overheard conver- sation, I ordered the vile woman from my house. "' My house, my house, ha, ha, you poor simpleton. Every article in this house and every cent of money that you or your husband has on earth belongs to me, and these are the papers. "' Now if you behave yourself you can stay here, if aot, you will have to tramp, both of you.' "She shook the papers in m face, and laughed at my look of easd astoishment. To finish my agony, when I began   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.       881 to talk something about the rights of an English wife, she -coolly told me that she had just as good a right to my husband as I had, for he had one wife when I married him, and that rendered my marriage a nullity. What a shock for a wife --to hear that she is no wife, or if she is, the wife of a robber, adulterer, and murderer. "a I heard all this with a sort of indifference foreign to my very nature. It was well that I did, for it enabled me to per- fect my plans, and carry them out with a degree of coolness worthy of a better purpose. I had been promising for, some time to visit a friend for a week; and I set about packing up for the journey at once. I said not one word to De Vrai of what I heard, nor gave him one -look of reproof. Fortune had made me acquainted with the secret hiding-place of the money this guilty pair has- obtained firom their poor victim, and I did not feel any compunctions of conscience in taking it from them. In three days afterwards I was in PEris. Here I lived a few months a wretched life of dissipation, and then De Vrai, tracked me to my hiding-place and rhad to fly once more; this time across the ocean. I had five hundred dollars when I arrived in this city. What might I not have done with that sum, if I had used it prudently? What I did do, I must tell, that it may be a warning to others. It would be a source of consolation to me if I knew that the follies of my life could be illuminated and set up as a beacon light to my fellow creatures, to save them from the quicksands of dissipation upon wh'y: I have been wrecked-wrecked by my own folly ad ofolish pr;ie. ,- &#xD;<pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC7638-00000200"/> 382          Ior cORN. ' It was pride, foolish wicked pride, that led me to go to a fashionable hotel, and put up, with my two children and nurse, as Madame DeVrai, from  Paris. How soon five hundred dollars melt away, even with prudent living, at a New- York a hotel. I did not live prudently. I drank to excess, gave late suppers,-and gambled. This could not last long, though many hundreds of the dollars worse than wasted in those few weeks, were won from others equally guilty of this besetting wickedness and folly with myself. Such a life could not last. My first step down was to a cheap lodging in Crosby street. I cannot tell how I lived there. I onlyv know that my valuables, my clothes, everything went to the pawn- broker, and 1 went to that wretched hole where you first saw me in Cow Bay, from whence I drove my poor little Katy out in the streets at midnight, to sell Hot Corn. It was there that my poor child died. It was there that you received her dying blessing, and I her dying forgiveness for all the wrongs that I had heaped upon her poor innocent head. It was then by her death that I was-awakened to consciousness and I felt and saw my own deep soul and body destroying degradation. It was through her death and translation to a home in heaven, that I have obtained a hope that my Father may forgive That my child has forgiven, and that I may yet see her again. It was Him, it must have been Him that opened your ear to that little plaintive cry of ' Hot Corn,' that rose up through your window on its way to the home of angels watching over a child whom her mother had forsaken. "It was His power-no earthly power could have aroused my   "FE SCENES IN   NEW  YORK.       383 mind from its lethargy, that awakened me one moment before it was too late. It was a bitter trial, but nothing else but the death of that sweet child would have been sufficient to save her wicked mother; I cannot mourn her loss, because I feel thlat she is now so much better off than while singing her nightly cry through the streets, of ' Hot Corn, Hot Corn, here's your nice hot corn!' Speaking of singing, have yoi seen the new song, just published, called ' The Dying AWords 'of Little Katy, or Will ile Come 2' "Oh it is beautiful.

It was the work of the missionary and the benevolent heart of Mr. Lovetree, and the kind words of Mrs. May and Stella, that effected what dungeons$ fetO s whips, and harsh language could not. "Oh!" said Mrs. Morgan to me one evening, " such a story as my uncle has been telling me; do tell him, uncle, about one of those' Five Point girls,' rescued from one of those misera- ble dens."

This bright :b'y is the child of drunken Bill Eaton. 4How Stella's eyes did sparkle as she saw us enter ; far more than they would to see her best customer, for now she saw her best friend, her kind patron, who gave her the means to gain good customers. *':Oh, mother, mother, here is Mr. Lovetree and Mrs. Morgan, and that other gentleman!" Then Mrs. May's eyes sparkled, for "she was so glad to see us "--she was always glad to see us. She was very busy in the little back shop, working away, and she had two very neat-looking- industriousa girls at work with her. We have seen both of them before. One of them for the first time on the steps of the Bank of the Republic, clothed in a poor dirty ragged dress, with that same little boy, sickly and pale, leaning upon,dhis sister for support, and keeping her company as the two wandered through the streets, making midnight melodious with that ever pealing- summer cry, ofk "Hot corn, hot corn, here's your nice hot-corn, smoking hot, smoking hot, just from the pot,/all hot, hot, hot!P ; She will sing it no more. She is in a better situation now for a little girl than midnight street rambling; that- is not the best school for young girls--we have seen-how near the brink of ruin -it led Sally Eaton. She was rescued just in time-just before she was lost. Two -great calamities fell upon her in one night. Her father was killed, and her mother's house was burned, leaving the   "FE SCONES IN NEW YORK.       389 poor widow and her two children in the street, naked, except ' one garment, amid the crowd that came to look upon what she then thought the wreck of all hope. It proved her' greatest blessing; for in that crowd were those who took her in, and clothed and- fed, and sent her children to school, and taught hergirl how to work; -and, finally, plaeed her as a help to another widow, where she will soon learn and earn enough to help herself. The other girl, who is now working with her old companion, was once her street associate in rags- nd wretchedness ^ afterwards, her envied, because better clothed, acquaintance. We saw her too, upon the same evening that we first saw the little Hot Corn girl driven away from her hard seat upon those cold stone steps-less cold than the heart of the great world towards its outcast'population.; We saw her again, just where we then knew that her course of life would lead her-to-intoxication,-wretchedness--crime- prisons, and-no, she stopped just short of death, and returned to virtue, industry, and happiness.  After the heartfelt, happiness-giving congratulations of Mrs. May, Stella, Sallyr Eaton, and "Brotherl Willie," were over, I turned to a nice, modest-looking young girl and said, '"and who is this .  What is your name?" "Julia Antrim, sir.' Did I dream . No, I did not dream, I looked upon sober reality. ; It was the poor outcast, whom I had seen dragged away from the underground abode of all that is bad, to " the Tombs," and from whence she went to "the Island," and as I heard, from there, at the expiration of her noviciate, to one  &#xD;<pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC7638-00000204"/> $-890         HOT COR;cr' -of the lowest, most degraded, worse than beastly, Abodes of those-who -have only the form of humanity remaining. So I told her I had heard, and she replied, , True--where else could I go I could go nowhere but there. I came out of prison with only the clothes they gave me there, with my hair cropped--branded, to tell all the world to beware of me-that I was a 'prison bird? If I desired, and I really did, to return to a virtuout life, the door was for ever closed against me. I went back to Mrs. Brown's, the woman who had first tempted me, with fine clothes and jewelry, to sin-to that house where I lost all that a poor girl has on earth-her virtue--where I had sinned and profited, as the term is, by sinning; where I had left piles of rich clothing, and pretended friends. I knocked at the door, Once so ready to open for my first admission, and that too was closed in my face with an oath, a horrid, wicked woman's oath, bidding me to go away or she would send a policeman -I knew the policeman would do her bidding-to take me away as a common street vagrant, coming there to disgrace a '-respectable house.' I went away, dispirited, broken-hearted, and sunk down into that wretched abode in, Anthony street, where I was found by Mr. Pease, and actually compelled, much against my will, to go to the Five Points House of Industry, where I was washed, and clothed, and fed, and sobered, furnished with work, and, above all else, taught to love God and pray, and, for the first time in more than two years, to feel one moment of happiness. When I was with those wretches in that miserable hole   "FE 80CE: S IN NEW YORK.      891 where Mr. Pease found me, I really thought that my heart had got so bad, that it could not, would not, ever be good again. "How I did use to curse and hate everybody that was good. That good man who saved me at last, I hated worse than all others. All who are like what I was then, hate him and fear him more then they do all the prisons and police in the city-. If somebody would publish the truth, or only half the trutlh, of what I alone know of the crime and misery about the Five Points of New York, and how much good all-the good men have done who have devoted themselves to the reformation of those wretched human beings, I do think that everybody with a good heart would buy the book, and thus contribute a mite to aid the good work--a work that saves from a life worse than death, scores of children and -young girls, lost to every virtuous thought or action; lost to all hope in life or eternity. "Oh, sir," and she seized me by the hands in her energy, "you can write-Stella has told me how you can write-that you have written some powerful stories; pray write more, more, more; the world will read, and it will do a world of good." "Well, Julia, if I write, I must have characters and names, to fill up the incidents of my Life Scenes; shall I use yours!O. Yes, yes, if it -will do good, and save others." "And mine."  "And mine."  "And mine.'" "I think," said Mrs. May, " that the incidents connected with Athalia's life, would alone make quite a volume; would you have any  &#xD;<pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC7638-00000205"/> 392          HOT CORN*- objection to having them written out and published, Mrs. Morgan?" "Perhaps I might consent, if it was well done, if it would serve as a beacon to save others from being shipwrecked upon the same desolate shore where I came so near being totally lost; only escaping by the smallest chance, and by one of the most singular interpositions of Providence, and through the efforts of one of the weakest instruments. It is to Stella, first of all that I owe my present happiness. It was through her that all my friends became interested for me. In fact, if it had not been for her, my dear uncle would never have known where to find me." "-Rather give the credit to a higher power; that power which gave him the kind benevolent heart that beats in his breast; that disposition to watch over the young and guard the innocent, which led him to take an interest in my poor child. Let us be grateful to all the humble instruments of Him who giveth every good and perfect gift to man, but to Him to whom we owe all of our present happiness, be the final praise." Now there was a little space of silence; a time for reflec- tion; all were too full of thought, holy, happy thought, to 'speak. It is good to think. The world is generally too much given to act without thinking. Mr. Lovetree was not. He thought that we had agreed to visit Mrs. De Vrai, on our way home, " but before I go," said he, "I want to invite you all to dine with us next Sabbath. I want to see our little party of friends all together, for a certain purpose.'   "FE SCENES IN NEW Y   e.      393 "Uncle always has a little surprise to play ofl upon his friends.

I assure you that this will be a pleasant surprise, though not an inappropriate one for the day, for I intend to have a minister with us to'ask a blessing upon our food." "Oh," said Stella, "I can guess it." Young girls are always ready to guess as she did. She guessed it was to be a wedding. She guessed that Mrs. Morgan was going to be married. Then the others guessed so too. Mrs. Morgan guessed not. She was sure she could not get married without somebody to have her. Of course not. But Stella thought that " somebody" would not be very hard to find. She knew a gentleman that liked her well enough to marry her." At any rate, that the party was to be a wedding one was pretty well settled. Whether the bride will be Athalia or not we shall see: So then, after lots of "good night" -and "do come again soon," we parted, and went on our way to visit the sick and dying victim of fashionable dissipation, which led her through a rapid career of a few happy months, and then through years of woe, from wine at dinner, to "cobblers " at late suppers, and bitters in the morning; till an appetite was acquired which could only be satisfied by con- stant libations of anything that would intoxicate, procured by 17*  &#xD;<pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC7638-00000206"/> 694          HOT COtNN. any means, however debasing, till she ceased to be a lady; almost ceased to be a woman; quite forgot that she was a mother; else how could she have driven that poor little inno- cent- child out upon the streets, murky and damp, with her cry of "Hot Corn, hot corn, all smoking hot!", while the poor child was chilly, cold, and starving . Poor girl--poor little Katy!' Thy mother loves thee now. Look down from thy-blest abode-it is thy mother calls, it is thy voice she hears, and she. answers, "Yes, yes I will come." "(She is better, sir," .said Phebe, as we entered the door. "She has been sitting up a good deal, and she talks of going over to your house to-morrow, Mrs. Morgan; she says she must go out, and take the air, or she never will get well." This was pleasant news, and it quite elated Mrs. Morgan. Mr. Lovetree gave one of his peculiar expressions of counte- nance as soon as he saw her, which told as plain as- though he had spoken it, that she never would go out again but once, that would be a ride which all must, none are willing, to take. We were all very much delighted to -find Mrs. Meltrand and Agnes, with Mrs. De Vrai. Mrs. Meltrand, ever since she had first seen her, had fallen in love with little -Sissee, the sweet little Adaleta, and this evening Mrs. De Vrai, had made her a final promise, that if she should not get well, Mis. Meltrand should have her for her own; and she had promised to adopt her and make] her as much her child as though she was really so. "But what is the use of talking.?

Where there is true friendship, there needs no gloss to our deeds, no hollow welcome to real friends. "BY and by" is easy said; it means an uncertain time, but it Oomes at last. It came to Mrs. De Vrai, only a few hours Ifter our last parting. Phebe came with the early morning to say, "She is gone, sir; gone to meet her poor child in the lope of the penitent. After you went away, she lay and talked and talked about you, all of you, and Mrs. Meltrand md Agnes, and how happy she should be if she was a going o die, to think that her child would have such a good mother nd sister, and so many real friends; and how  different it vould'be with herself now, here and hereafter, as well as her hild, than it would have been if she had died in her former esidence of wretchedness, sin, and woe. Then I asked her if he would take her medicine and go to sleep, and she saitd, by and by, not now; I feel so well, so happy, I can almost nacy that I see my poor little Katy in heaven among the agels. I often see her here in the room when I am laying ith my  eyes closed, but not asleep; and I often think I hear er dying words, "Will he Come!" and I say " yes, he leas )me; the   Saviour has come, my child, to your mother."   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.      397 Then she says, " then come, mother, come and live with us ;" and I answer, "lby nd by." By and by, Phebe I shall go, but not yet, I am going to get well now.' "So I went and lay down in the back room, and I heard nothing of her, though I got- up and looked at her a good many times, but she seemed to be sleeping so sweet, I thought I would not wake her to take her medicine-the doctor said I need not. In the morning I got up, and looked in the room, and there was Sissee sitting up in the bed, trying to open her mother's eyes; then she would put her arms around her neck and kiss her, but there was no kiss in return. Then she sat back and looked at her a minute, and then called-' Phebe, Phebe, mamma does not speak, oh Phebe, is mamma dead?"  Yes mamma was dead. She had died as calm and free from pain and full of joy as when she said '. good night " to her friends. She had died full of anticipationkthat she was going to live to get well; that she would not join the spirit of Little Katy now, but by and by: by and by she would come. Drop a tear, drop a tear, for she's departed! Wreath a smile, for she died not broken-hearted. This was on Friday morning. On the Sunday following, the intended party met at Mrs. Morgan's and partook of an early dinner. "For," said Mr. Lovetree,."we have a good deal to do this afternoon. In the first place, some of our friends are disposed to be united in the holy, the blessed bonds, that bind the sexes together in a union that should be indissoluble, and p;oductive of nothing but happiness. After that we have a  &#xD;<pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC7638-00000208"/> 398'         HOT CORN. duty to perform, which though it is generally termed melan- choly, must not be made so on the prteent occasion. We shall go to deposit the body in Greenwood, that lovely place of rest for thQ dead, of one who we have every reason to believe died a true, penitent, and is now with the spirit of Little Katy, where those who are murdered by the same cause that produced her death, will seldom ever be found. Our good missionary is with us, and we will have the wedding ceremony before the funeral one, because many go from that to the grave, none come from there to the marriage feast." Now all began to look around for the happy couple. Mrs. Morgan was ,dressed as ,though she might be a bride, but where was the groom  Mr. Lovetree whispered to, Mrs. Meltrand, for she was there with Agnes and little Sis, and Mrs. Meltrand said'that Frank would be there by the time. "Now what Frank is that?" said Stella in a whisper to Mrs. May.; "it must be Frank Barkley; and so it is' Mrs. Morgan that is going to be married. Oh, dear, I am sorry, I was in hopes she would always live with her old-uncle, as she does *iow." It was Frank Barkley who was expected. He was an old ; *acquaintance of Mrs. Meltrand, a little wild in his youth, and came within an inch of the precipice over which so many young men tumble. Mr. Lovetree had said, " there is some- thing good- in the fellow," and between him and Mrs. Mel- trand, it was developed. He is a good fellow-a sober fellow nowand he is going to be married. Now the door bell rings.    "FE SCENES IN NEW YORK.       399 i, There that is him."     . Yes, it was him. He was told that all were waiting for him, and he said " he had come to the minute agreed upon." Poor Stella shed tears. She cried to think her dear friend, Mrs. Morgan, was about to be married. She cried without a cause. Mr. Lovetree said to, Frank, "allow me to introduce you to my niece, Mrs. Morgan." He started back from her, rubbed his eyes, and looked :again. Stella rubbed hers. She was convinced now that they were not to be married. Poor Frank looked confused and in doubt. He approached near enough to Mrs. Morgan to: whisper, "Lucy," to which she replied, "Yes," and he said, "God bless you then," and turned away to meet his bride. This was Agnes. And he took her by the hand, and led her up to the minister who was to pronounce them man and wife, and said-"Now, sir, we are ready," Then a couple, :who were to act as bridesmaid and bridegroom's attendant, took their stations upon the floor. It was the opinion of all present that they would act as principals in a similar kcene by and by.    ,    ; Perhaps the reader would like to know who this neatly- dressed; bright couple are, for he has seen them several times before. It is one of Mr. Lovetree's oddities that you see them now. You have seen them when they would not be very fitting guests in a parlor, but they wear wedding-gar- ments now.

The neat, lovely girl at his side is Wild Maggie--Miss Margaret Reagan. The fine-looking hearty man that is leading up a well-dressed woman to the altar--another couple to be mar- ried--is one of the former customers of Cale Jones's grocery. It is Maggie's father. His bride is Mrs. Eaton. We have seen her and her two children in some of the early scenes of this volume. We saw them in the street then-we see them in the parlor now. We see them much better, much hap- pier this time, and we see them just as we might see all the laboring class, if we could abolish the traffic in rum from the world. There are two other couples here to bear testimony to that fact. It was the particular request of Reagan and Maggie that they should be present to witness and rejoice over the power of the pledge to save. We have seen both these couples stand up to be married before the same minister. who is now saying the solemn words of the marriage cere- mony to those before him.  You may see them  as they were when you first saw them, if you will turn back to the plate facing the "Two Penny Marriage." Julia. Antrim and Willie Reagan act as attendants upon this last couple, and Sally Reagan and Stella May, dressed in pure -white-dresses of their own make-,-with wreaths of flowers in their hair, made by their own hands-served the company with cakes and fruits and tea and coffee. Then the carriages came to the door, and all went-not to a tavern, or drinlfng saloon for a riot, to commemorate the most serious bvent of life, but in all soberness due to the occasion, to con-   "FE SCENES IN NEW YORE.       401  ! sign the remains of poor Madame De Vrai to her final resting- place on the earth.  It is a pleasant drive to Greenwood Cemetery, and it is a pleasant place for the tombs of our friends. It is a good place to go to meditate, among the new-made graves in the fresh-turned earth, and among the proud monuments of those who have lain long enough beneath their marble coverings to be forgotten. I did not forget to look, as I passed along, oat the rose bush which I saw planted by a widow at the grave of her rum-murdered husband.  It was- growing fresh and vigorously. Now we stand around the open grave that is soon to be fiiied by another victim of a trade that feeds scores and starves millions-that saves one life and causes a thousand deaths-that consigns youth, innocence and beauty, equally with old age, to a premature grave. Now we lower this last victim --still young, beautiful, intelligent, full of sweetness of disposi- tion and kindness of heart-into her grave. Now we look at the little cherub, the darling, sweet, much loved  Adaleta, her orphan child, and now at her sister's grave, then-at the weep- ing circle, who stand and sob as the falling clods bring forth that hollow sound, never heard in any other place. Now the voice of him who says: "'Tis the last of earth," "Let us pray," breaks the charmed circle of intense silence. Why is every eye upturned at the close? Did each listen- ing ear fancy it heard the sound of an angel's voice in- the air, breathing the words,-"Willhe Come?" "Will he Come?"

Now the tall corn is waving o'er the mountain andglen, * And the sickle is reaping both the corn and the men; And the child that was sleeping where the lamps dimly shone, Like the corn, now is with'ring, in the vale all alone. "Hot corn!I' she -was crying, in the night, all alone, "Hot corn! here's your nice hot corn!" in the grave all alone. Where the chill rain was falling, sat the- poor child asleep; Where the lights nightly burning, city vigils help keep- - Where the ague was creeping through the blood and the bone Of the child that was sleeping on the curb-stone alone. "aHot corn!" she was crying, in the night all alone, a Hot corn! here's your nice hot corn!V in the grave all alone. In a dark room lonely, lay the child all awake, With a voice wildly crying, "Will he come, for my sake?" Then a good man was praying, while to her- dimly shone, Poor fading light-ceases burning-and with God she's alone. ' Hot corn!" she was crying, in the night all alone, "  Hot corn! here's your nice hot corn!" in the grave all alone. In the dark grave sleeping, while poor Katy's at rest, While the wild storm raging, ever sweeps o'er her breast- While the mourners are weeping for the dead passed away, Let us pledge by the living that the cause we will stay.

Among the many poetical effusions which have been elicited by reading the story of "Little Katy," I think the following, which appeared in the New York Tribune, will be read with pleasure.  It is from the pen of Mrs. B. F Foster, of Nem York :---  With dizzy whirl, on rushed the wheels Along the City's murky street, And music's light, inspiring peals Rang out from folly's gay retreat; And busy footsteps hurried past, And human voices, harsh and wild, Commingling. floated on the blast; When the shrill accents of a child Rose mid the din, in tones forlorn, And cried, ' Come, buy hot corn, hot corn!" Like some sad spirit wafted by, A stranger to the ways of earth, Came up that little plaintive cry-- Sweet discord to the sounds of mirth. Unheeded by the reckless crowd, There stood a girl, a pale, wan thing, And 'neath her bosom's tattered shroud. There lurk'd an age of suffering; While e'en till night approached the morn, In feebler voice, she cried, "Hot Corn!"  &#xD;<pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC7638-00000211"/> 404           HOT CORN. The gas lamp's glare fell on her face, But lighted not her languid eyes; And down her pallid- cheeks, the trace Of tears, bespoke her miseries; With hunger gnawing at her heart, She shivered, as the night wind blew Her soiled and ragged clothes apart; Till all insensible she grew, And sinking in unblessed sleep, Forgot to cry, "Hot Corn," and weep. Alone, so young, how came she there? To sell hot corn so late at night; Had she no friends, no home, nowhere To rest, and hide her from the. sight Of the rude world?  No mother? Hush! That holy name is not the one For Katy's parent. Woman! blush For thy lost sister; blush to own That thou canst ever fall so low, - To plunge thy children into woe. Within that mother's heart, the light Of love was quench'd. quench'd by the flood, The damning flood, whose waters blight All that is left of human good.: And in her breast that demon reigned, Who sc Give, give, give!l" is, ever crying; Demanding still to be maintained, While all within, around, is dying; Outpouring in its baneful breath, Destruction, sorrow, sin and death.   "FE SCENES IN  NEW  YORK.       405 The lips which should have kissed away Her daughter's tears, dealt curses forth; The hand which should have been her stay, Was but the minister of. wrath; Blind to her wants, deaf to her-prayers, Regardless of the driving storm, To open streets and midnight airs, She drove that little shrinking form, To earn a dram! In shame and scorn With famished lips to cry, "Hot corn!" H "Hot corn, hot corn!"- night after night, More faint and feeble grew that voice-     ... Still fiercely burned each glaring light, Still music bade the town rejoiced' The ceaseless footsteps passed along, Up came the wild discordant tones, The voices of the thoughtless throng,-- The bounding wheels rolled o'er the stones,- But midst the din, the rush, the roar, Poor Katy's cry is heard no more. In one of those dark, noisome cells, The wretched call their home, she lies All motionless; the icy spells Of death, have closed those weary eyes; She speaks not now. Alas! how dread! That calm reproachful silence, when Beside the wronged and injured dead, We kneel in vain!

Weep, wretched woman, weep!

Yet not alone with thee, 'abides That curse. Oh, Men, and Christians! can Ye robe yourselves in god-lke pride, And boast your land, the one where man Is most exalted; yet permit The Demon Drunkenness to roam Unfettered through your streets; to sit By ev'ry corner, ev'ry home-- The weak and wretched to allure -To drink, to suffer, and endure?
