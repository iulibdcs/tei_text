               <head>INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER.</head>
               <p>LEST some one, with hard, critical brow, and eyes in which sympathy never found a
                  home, should ask us why we make another book, let us think the matter over, and
                  satisfy ourselves on that point. Taken unawares, we might be at a loss; for even
                  where reasons are plenty as blackberries, they sometimes grow on very high
                  branches, as our torn fingers and flounces at this moment testify. Rural
                  surroundings make us saucy and independent, and we shall take advantage of the
                  shelter of these beetling rocks, and the murmur of this wild river, to say forth
                  boldy what we think of book-making. There is, at least, a Brown Thresher on the
                  sumach over our heads that thinks as we do, for he pours forth his heart in good
                  earnest, trusting Providence for listeners, or finding a justification in the
                  impulse.</p>
               <p>Books are, in general, what we make them. To some they are hardly more than a
                  certain weight of paper and print, put together in a guise more or less
                  attractive, and forming a genteel article of furniture. Others, though they go
                  deeper, meet them always with a demurrer, and never open their covers without
                  being inspired with some disparaging thought, or some<pb n="12-13"
                     xml:id="VAC7024-00000007"/> destructive criticism. To such, the representative
                  of another's thoughts and feelings always wears the aspect of an antagonist. 'Do
                  you bite your thumb at me, sir?' asks one of the retainers of a belligerent house,
                  the moment he meets any body not wearing his colors. 'I do bite my thumb, sir,' is
                  the reply, and this is sufficient excuse for a fight. Disputatious people will
                  seize still slighter occasions, and deal black eyes and cracked crowns, like wild
                  Irishmen, 'for the pleasure of it.' Preserve us and our pages from such
                  attentions! We know several persons who have reared, and who sustain, formidable
                  literary pretensions, upon no better foundation than a habit of ridiculing and
                  abusing every book they open. Simple hearers think there must be knowledge where
                  there is so much confidence, and measure the speaker's judgment by his
                  self-complacency; so the fault-finders pass for critics. But, in truth, 'we
                  receive but what we give,' in this as in many other cases. A mathematical treatise
                  requires a prepared reader; so does the most unpretending volume, aiming at no
                  higher destiny than the innocent amusement of a listless hour. On our moods must
                  depend very much the value of any book to us, and of the lighter books most of
                  all. There are moments when this bird's song would be, to the ear that now drinks
                  it in with delight, a mere 'iteration,' to which disgust might apply the harshest
                  adjective. Yonder woody height, with its studs of rock and its thick curtains of
                  evergreen, is to the farmer an image of impertinent hindrance. It keeps the
                  sunrise off his chilly corn-fields two or three hours; it harbors his stray cattle
                  in unapproachable fastnesses; and is, in every way, and for every purpose but the
                  mere article of firewood, a very eye-sore to him. Yet there sits a painter,
                  sketching it with delight; enriching his portfolio with studies of single stones
                  among its thousands, and thinking himself happy when he can seize the character of
                  one of its mosses. Nature neither placed it there to please the artist, nor will
                  remove it to gratify the farmer. It is for those who can use it, and pursues not
                  those who cannot.</p>
               <p>The multiplicity of books is not surprising. There needs many to suit all; and it
                  is this that humble writers think of, if they think of the matter at all, when
                  they venture to call attention and ask sympathy for their private thoughts.
                     <emph>Somebody</emph> may be ready to listen, to be cheered; even, perhaps, to
                  be a little instructed, sometimes, by another's fancies, or reflections, or
                  experience. The pleasure of being listened to, is very great. There is even a
                  necessity in the human mind to communicate. The silent cell is ever the home of
                  horror, distrust and despair. It is the greatest of human misfortunes to be
                  precluded from speaking; even to be hindered speaking out thoughts of a particular
                  class, has been thought, at no remote period, cause enough of war to the knife,
                  and the risk of all else that man holds dearest. Speech, with reason or without
                  reason, in season and out of season, is one of the necessities; and personal
                  intercourse being limited in a thousand ways, there must be other means of
                  transporting thought. Books, then, become spiritual telegraphs; they annoy none
                  that let them alone; they answer some of the dearest needs of those that use them.
                  If conversation could be universal, there would be less writing; yet there would
                  always be some, for ears weary sooner than eyes. When friends live together, their
                  letter-cases need not be roomy, and posterity asks in vain for their
                  'correspondence.' They have had it, be sure; else they had been no friends. Now,
                  books are the correspondence of<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7024-00000008"/> friends
                  that have never seen each other. They conquer the limitations of human
                  intercourse, and unite those, who, if personally present with each other, might
                  never really and effectively meet.</p>
               <p>For how hard it is to pierce or to surmount that semi-transparent wall of
                  personality, which can only be sapped by long and intimate intercourse, and never
                  thrown down even by that! What is it that keeps us apart, when each would fain
                  meet the other? Here, in these delicious shades where we are writing, with earth,
                  air, and sky preaching love and harmony, numbers of human beings, every one more
                  or less alive to the beauties of scenery and the softening influence of agreeable
                  circumstances, pass each other, daily and hourly, with scarce a look or word of
                  recognition, though there is nothing but good will, or, at worst, indifference,
                  among them. But if by chance there be one among them who has spoken to the world
                  through a book, that one is felt as an acquaintance; the mind-portrait having had
                  a wide circulation, no introduction seems needed. Here, then, is an excuse for
                  books—one of many.</p>
               <p>Then look at the groups and solitary walkers, scattered through these grounds; in
                  the park, among the rocks by the stream, under the shadow of you weeping elm, and
                  on every sofa and lounge in the great house. A book is in the hand or the pocket
                  of each, unless, indeed, as sometimes will happen, the reader has been lulled by
                  the silent friend into the most benign of slumbers, and has let the volume fall.
                  Happy authors! to conduce to so much amusement—to such sweet repose! Who would not
                  make books!</p>
               <p>Tourists are proverbial for book-making, and certain critics seem to feel annoyed
                  by the propensity; yet how natural is it! 'To travel and not tell,' is superhuman.
                  Now, to recite the thing, with all its particulars, its episodes, its <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">contretems,</foreign> its raptures, separately, again and again,
                  to each of your friends—it would take the forty mouths of a Hindoo idol. Some
                  attempt this, indeed, but their friends learn to avoid them. If we have been
                  present at a railroad catastrophe, we may tell it once, or even twice, perhaps;
                  but if once we succumb to the temptation to make it our <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >cheval de bataille,</foreign> we shall easily forget which friend we have
                  displayed it to, and buttons will be left in our hands without scruple, the moment
                  we begin. Now, telling the thing in print is quite safe, and can offend no one,
                  intrude on no business hours, be to no one a twice-told tale. So our mind is
                  relieved at small cost.</p>
               <p>Surely those travellers who have nothing to tell are provoking, if not stupid.
                  There are some who will make the most charming tour, be present at the most
                  exciting show, boast of the most delightful visits, yet never let a single
                  particular escape their lips, for the benefit of anxious and questioning stayers
                  at home. They have seen all, enjoyed all, and they are content. An effort of
                  recollection would cost them something, and they do not care enough for your
                  pleasure to make it These are the very people to inveigh against the tourist's
                  book-making. Let us revenge ourselves by saying, that their imagination has not
                  strength of wing enough to follow the adventures of another, or even power to draw
                  pictures from experience that shall interpret those of others. They are like that
                  round, shorn, selfish-looking sun in a fog, that has light and warmth enough, but
                  communicates as little as it can, and stares stolidly upon us, without putting
                  down a single ladder of rays<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7024-00000009"/> to help our
                  imaginations. Give us the most garrulous tourist rather.</p>
               <p>Some stupid people have called books unsocial; they are the greatest of all
                  promoters of sociability. Besides the more obvious use of interchanging,
                  discussing, praising and abusing them, they furnish a circulating medium of ideas,
                  which, though kept in mind-purses, and not carried about openly, really keep
                  society together, too ready at all times to fall apart through misunderstanding.
                  Ordinary, blundering talk expresses our best thoughts but ill, and gives us an
                  insufficient, and often a mistaken notion of each other's powers; but when an
                  author, with a certain air of professional knowingness, says what we have been
                  dimly thinking, we are as much relieved and benefitted as when an accredited M. D.
                  steps in and gravely prescribes the very thing we are doing for our friend. How
                  many conversations has 'the last number of Bleak House' opened! How naturally we
                  test and measure the congeniality or the ability of our acquaintance, by
                  ascertaining their opinion of particular characters! A young lady of our friends
                  says she never makes up a judgment of any body till she has found out whether he
                  'understands Thackeray.' Now, what a pleasant office is this of general mediator.
                  Let us rejoice that authors are so numerous, instead of grumbling at the creaking
                  of our shelves. In this short life, a short-cut to sympathy is certainly very
                  desirable, and books are the general revealers.</p>
               <p>They reveal us to ourselves as often as to each other, Mirrors they often are to
                  our faults and foibles; mirrors, too, to our nobler selves, less rarely than our
                  modesty may suppose disguised to us by accidental circumstances, such as want of
                  success, association with ungenerous or harsh people, or a lack of high animal
                  spirits, that almost greatest of earthly blessings. Anderson's story of the Ugly
                  Duck, who, accidentally looking at himself in a pond, discovers that he is no
                  duck, but a swan, illustrates this inimitably. Diffident people draw much comfort
                  from books; the more they shrink from free intercourse with their kind, the more
                  lifted up are they by unexpectedly confronting themselves in a good, i. e., an
                  ideal light. 'As a man thinketh, so is he;' but we do not always recognize the
                  value of our own thoughts till we meet them among strangers, and in holiday
                  clothes. A daughter or sister is sometimes not discovered to be a beauty, until,
                  by some chance, she is drest for company, and seen with others of greater
                  pretension; then how our respect for her increases!</p>
               <p>What flashes come to us from books, sometimes; flashes that seem meant for us
                  alone, since others do not always perceive them; yet they light up all that will
                  burn within us. We take up a book with very little expectation; somebody has told
                  us it is dull, perhaps; and there, waiting for us, is just the inspiration, or the
                  warning, or the medicine we have been wanting. Strange power this, of mind over
                  mind; that thoughts that have lain in another's brain or heart, like strangers, so
                  little kindred had they with those around them, shall come into mine with a
                  mission of health and love, proving the best kind of relationship. When we speak,
                  then, of 'suggestive' books, we say something for the writer and something for
                  ourselves. A tiny spark may cause the explosion of a magazine and shake the earth,
                  but the <emph>powder must be dry!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>At different times of life we want different books, and to prescribe long
                     <emph>goody</emph> essays to young people is useless, let our tyros be ever so
                  docile. They <emph>can't</emph> read such things, or, if<pb n="18-19"
                     xml:id="VAC7024-00000010"/> they can, it is a bad sign, and bespeaks ill health
                  of body or mind. Shall we, then, give them boundless range through the fields of
                  fiction? The other extreme. We should cut a path for them with our own hands, and
                  be sure that it be full of beauty and variety. Drilling enough there is, or should
                  be, at school; mental gymnastics in plenty for the strengthening of the
                  intellectual muscles; repose and amusement have their claims, too, and are too apt
                  to be forgotten. Most people, in their training of the young, treat Nature as if
                  she were an idiot, capable only of unintelligible mutterings, not worth attention.
                  But in this way we may make drones or hypocrites of all but the finest and highest
                  spirits. Books that will excite curiosity are among the best; leading books, that
                  make the reader 'ask for more.'</p>
               <p>Further on in life, we like speculative and didactic books, interspersed among the
                  poetical and imaginative. We have begun to question ourselves and others, and to
                  be anxious about this wondrous being, and its duty and destiny, its meaning and
                  end. Yet, even now, we prefer books that help, to those that seem to satisfy. We
                  are more interested in a companion than in a master. This is the season of
                  theory-building, and we make our fabric partly, but only partly, from other
                  people's materials. There is sometimes a passion for one particular book or class
                  of books, but, in general, we crave a variety, out of which to pick almost
                  exclusively one kind of interest or amusement. At another period, the same book
                  will, curiously, afford us a new vein, such as we happen to be searching for just
                  then.</p>
               <p>Later still, we love to read discussions of points, which our own practice has
                  long ago settled for <emph>us,</emph> and warnings which we mentally apply, with a
                  good deal of zeal, to other people. The imagination being somewhat dulled, we
                  preach, very conscientiously, the superior value of reality, (as if imagination
                  were not reality!) and lament over the 'waste of time' of those who are still able
                  to enjoy its delights. Fiction we inveigh against; not because it has ever led us
                  astray, but because it may mislead others, or we have heard of its doing so. This
                  being led by isolated facts to forget universal principles, is the cause of a
                  great deal of quackery in literature and morals. Things are to be judged hurtful,
                  not simply because they have hurt some people, but because they are hurtful in
                  their nature. Invalids look solemn when they see others eating pine-apples;
                  tolerably well people, even, will tell you that strawberries are poison; but are
                  they so? It is often said that nobody is perfectly well, and it is equally correct
                  to assert that no one is wholly sane in mind; care, therefore, is always
                  necessary, in selecting food for both body and mind. But it is not dangerous to
                  set a stout boy down to a good dinner in all its variety; neither do we believe it
                  so to turn young minds 'loose in a good library.' In both cases, tastes and
                  instincts may be trusted. Only let the dinner and the library be both really
                  good.</p>
               <p>We want different reading for the various times of day;—in the morning the
                  bracing, in the afternoon the discursive, in the evening the social, the
                  harmonizing, or, if possible, the amusing. But there is no reading, now, purely
                  amusing. With everything that professes to be so, we must take dose of preventive,
                  as poor little martyr children of 'careful' mothers cannot have fruit until they
                  have first swallowed lime-water. The evening hours should not be spent
                  laboriously, but<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7024-00000011"/> pleasantly, if we would
                  'live long and see good days.' One of the good novels or brilliant essays of the
                  present day, read aloud to the family circle, after tea, is more potent than
                  champagne in dispersing the day's cares or vexations. The sore or weary track left
                  in the mind by toil and trouble, is more effectually effaced by a bright, cheerful
                  book, than by any more noisy or showy expedient. Happy those who have discovered
                  this!</p>
               <p>The times of year, too, ask their various tones of reading. The book for January
                  suits not well with the dog-days; the tender green of Spring harmonizes with one
                  set of thoughts and studies; the mellow coloring of Autumn with another. There
                  are, indeed, books for all seasons; a few written with such a universality of
                  sympathy and fitness, that in joy or sorrow, at morning or evening, in summer or
                  winter, we never open them without finding, by a sort of miracle—for is not genius
                  a perpetual miracle?—something exactly suited to our wants. Putting aside the Book
                  of books, as out of all question, this remark applies especially to Shakspeare;
                  but there are also, at whatever distance, other writers that never come amiss. In
                  general, however, we have our times of year for different classes of books, and
                  sometimes, when we are fastidious and whimsical, feel that there are none too
                  many.</p>
               <p>Considering, then, the wondrous applicability of books to the needs and notions of
                  us all, and the welcome which the right ones are sure to receive, it is not to be
                  wondered at that some of us love to write them. Especially does the writer who has
                  already found favor count upon an intimate and kindly reception. The old-fashioned
                  expression, 'Dear Reader,' has its propriety. Readers seem like old friends when
                  we have been able to interest them. Affection depends more on the heart and mind
                  than on the eyes, and those who sympathize with us in thought and feeling soon
                  become dear. We talk of 'favorite authors;' authors have favorite readers, too;
                  those who are willing to be pleased!</p>
               <p>But, to 'leave face-making and begin,'—let us not be thought fanciful in offering
                  our new book for the amusement of those cool, delicious hours that relieve the
                  summer exhaustion, and incline the mind to quiet reading.</p>
               <p>The names of such books are nothing more than a sort of poetic shadowing forth of
                  their contents. If one writes a novel or an essay, a satire or a poem, its title
                  may be a direct and natural growth of the subject or intent; and even for a
                  miscellaneous gathering, grave and gay, it used to be distinctive enough to call
                  it such. Yet there has always been confessed some difficulty about the naming of
                  books, and the world has been subject to periodical whims with regard to it. We
                  all know the quaint and absurd titles that have been given, not only to fanciful
                  and poetic tomes, but to the most solemn, warning, and exhorting works. For
                  ourselves, being imperatively called upon to find an appellation for this third
                  miscellany of ours, (publishers are very tyrants in these matters!) we thought it
                  not worth while to puzzle over the nice adaptation of a name, but best to take the
                  first comprehensive or vague one that came obedient to our call, and trust to
                  justifying it in one way if we could not in all. In this, as in other respects, we
                  trust much to the indulgence of readers who have already shown themselves kindly
                  willing to be pleased.</p>

               <head>SUMMERING.</head>
               <p>THE season of returning to town is apt to be the time when we ask ourselves why we
                  ever go away. Home looks so delightful after absence; the joyous faces of meeting
                  friends so cheer our hearts, and lift our spirits above the influence of fatigue
                  and care, that we sometimes think it has been foolish to leave all these pleasant
                  things, to wander over the face of the earth, to lie in strange beds, to toss on
                  uneasy seas, to endure the company of strangers, to renounce one's favorite
                  employments, and, above all, to relinquish the society of those whose society is
                  the chief pleasure of life to us. Very wise people reproach us with all this; they
                  say, what we cannot deny, that we should have been much more
                     <emph>comfortable</emph> at home; that our own houses are more comfortable than
                  hotels, our own beds than steamboat berths, our own dinners than any that we shall
                  find elsewhere. These sensible remarks make us quite ashamed of our wanderings,
                  perhaps. Comfort is so much the business of life with most of us, that we are
                  quite sensitive to the reproach of having mistaken the way to it. The reasons for
                  going are less obvious than the reasons for staying, and the joy of returning
                  makes us feel them with peculiar force.</p>
               <p>But do we remember that this joy of reunion and return is<pb n="24-25"
                     xml:id="VAC7024-00000013"/> purchased by the absence and the journey, with all
                  their trials and inconveniences, and could not have been felt without them?
                  Iteration wears out even our best pleasures; emotions are not to be summoned at
                  will; the home that we have never left is not the home that beams upon us after a
                  temporary renunciation. Love our friends as we may, we love them better after we
                  have lost sight of them for a while. Our employments tire, even in proportion to
                  the ardor with which we pursue them, and their zest is only renewable on condition
                  of some intervals of complete repose or change of object. So that for the mere
                  purchase of intenser pleasure, it is worth while to refrain for a time; but there
                  are stronger reasons for summer jaunting.</p>
               <p>Supposing that our life has only a certain fixed amount of power, and that both
                  happiness and duty command us to make the most of this power for the work that is
                  given us to do, seasons of complete change and relaxation, even of new fatigue and
                  voluntary privation, in unaccustomed directions, must be advantageous to our
                  bodily and mental condition, since aching heads, and pinched and anxious hearts,
                  often admonish us that too long perseverance in a single track is not congenial to
                  so varied a nature as ours. Even the unbroken enjoyment of home luxuries and ease,
                  is conducive to anything but strength, either of character or muscles. City life,
                  especially, is notoriously unfavorable to vigorous and enduring health; its
                  excitements tend, more through their ceaselessness than their intensity, perhaps,
                  to insanity and premature decay, or sudden failure of the energies of nature. We
                  are not of those who believe city life to be necessarily unwholesome. It would be
                  so to animals, doubtless; but man's bodily condition depends so much upon ample
                  and judicious exercise of his mental and moral faculties, that some of the
                  disadvantages of too close contact with others, and of employments more sedentary
                  than those which are favorable to perfect health, are probably counteracted by the
                  more wholesome uses he may make of brain and heart, when surrounded by fellow
                  beings, than when in comparative solitude. Such a country life as we can imagine,
                  might, indeed, unite all advantages; but we are talking of the actual, and not of
                  the ideal.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the best way of making the most of life, is that which is practised by so
                  many of our citizens—living in the full town and partaking of all its intellectual
                  excitements and means of culture, its cheering social amusements, its varied human
                  interests and religious instruction, for the colder part of the year, while the
                  fireside is so cosy and delightful; and in the summer learning a new chapter of
                  life, finding out a new set of powers, associating with a new round and variety of
                  character, discovering the ideas of other people on subjects on which we might
                  suppose there could be but one way of thinking, and, in short, making ourselves as
                  much new creatures as possible, with a continual reserve of our old habits and a
                  constant tendency and desire to return to them. To say nothing of the
                  wholesomeness of fresh air and hardy exercise—the last a theme hardly to be
                  mentioned to ears polite, in a country where it is not fashionable to be
                  strong—this way of parcelling out life is certainly defensible, to say the least.
                  One thing is certain, that those who have most thoroughly and rationally practised
                  it are best prepared to defend it.</p>
               <p>The question as to how and where the summer is to be spent, is quite another one.
                  To some, the plain farm-house, with the early voices of birds, and the humbler
                  noise of the farm-yard,<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7024-00000014"/> new milk for the
                  children, tumbling in hay-mows and riding without saddle for stout boys, and a
                  thousand pretty country sports for little girls; long walks, and rides, and
                  fishing excursions for the elder, and shaded seats at noon, and pleasant windows
                  at sunset for all, afford the needful change. To others, the sea-shore, with its
                  variety and its sameness, its refreshing surf and its moonlight beach, is more
                  congenial, and braces the limbs and spirits better. Others long for the excitement
                  of watering-places to balance the excitement of the city, as he whose hands have
                  become shaky with brandy must have his coffee very strong to steady his nerves.
                  Others, again, dream of the novelties and wonders of foreign lands, and seek the
                  verification of their idea at the expense of a long sea voyage, and the encounter
                  of strange people and strange tongues. All this while, the wise shake their heads,
                  and congratulate themselves upon being comfortable at home.</p>
               <p>The money that is expended in this summer change, is a prominent objection with
                  most of those who condemn it. They speak as if they, or any of us, lived by the
                  law of necessity, and never spent anything that could possibly be avoided. But, in
                  truth, this is so far from being the case, that these very comfortable people will
                  perhaps spend in the course of the year on extra luxuries for the table, extra
                  expenses in dress, or extra indulgence of some sort, what would pay for the summer
                  recreation twice over. It is simply a question of spending money in one way or the
                  other for pleasure and advantage. Perhaps the home luxuries are as injurious as
                  the jaunt would be beneficial; that is our opinion, but it is not the opinion of
                  every one.</p>
               <p>Some years ago, it was rather unusual for people of moderate means to travel in
                  summer. Most of our citizens contented themselves with short trips, or, perhaps, a
                  few weeks' boarding in the country. But this was when our cities were smaller, our
                  modes of life less unnatural and exhausting, our social ambition less pungent,
                  perhaps our physiological ideas less rational. With great opportunities for
                  acquiring wealth, came great anxiety to acquire it, and with this anxiety, and the
                  success consequent upon it, perhaps, much disease, suffering, and premature decay.
                  The wealthy were advised to travel, and soon found reason to be glad they had done
                  so; and their example has encouraged others, who, though not wealthy, are
                  suffering, to resort to the same remedy, instead of retiring into a sick room and
                  tiring the patience of the dyspepsia doctors.</p>
               <p>But shall we all wait until we have a claim to be ranked among the suffering? Does
                  worldly wisdom counsel that? If travelling cures, will it not also have a tendency
                  to prevent disease? Many are beginning to think so; and when they find themselves
                  wearied and overdone, do not sit down till disease has crept over them unawares,
                  but ward it off by refraining from the toil that had threatened to produce it. It
                  used to be quite a proverb with the English and French, that all Americans who
                  came to see them were ill. The remark is no longer appropriate; travelling abroad
                  is no longer confined to the rich and the sick. Health may be still a principal
                  object with many, but it is future health of mind as well as body. Instruction,
                  too, comes in as a leading motive; not instruction in the fashions, but in
                  whatever the study of ages has been able to bring to perfection.</p>
               <p>It is a humane impulse, and it has a humanizing effect, to go out among our kind;
                  to see other phases of character, other<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7024-00000015"/>
                  modes of life, the result of other habits. It makes the heart softer and more
                  affectionate, to discover the good qualities hidden under uncouth or even
                  fashionable manners; to become accustomed to the peculiarities of others, and
                  learn how 'use lessens marvel,' and disgust, also. To go from home attacks our
                  imperious habits, and makes inroads upon our extravagant appreciation of personal
                  comforts. To teach humility, there is nothing like it; for what can be more
                  exquisitely contrary to our usual convictions, than the discovery how many
                  nobodies there are in the world of as much consequence as ourselves? In
                  travelling, every grand, personal claim is brought down to the vulgar test of
                  money. Let us try to make our dignity, or our family, or our reputation, serve us,
                  instead of a full purse, at any hotel; our own cook-maid may take precedence of
                  us, if she choose to spend her savings while we attempt to spare ours. Few will
                  even criticize her manners, if her silks be rich enough. <emph>Our</emph>
                  threadbare gentility will need not only vouchers but endorsers, if the pockets be
                  not well lined. This thought is good for us, though not pleasant. We take it like
                  medicine, but it cures without faith. We must pay in hard cash for every extra
                  grain of importance we indulge in. Among friends and inferiors, assumption does a
                  good deal; but when we are away from home it is instantly tested, assayed, as it
                  were; not like gold, but by gold. Now, from a little experience of this kind pride
                  shrinks like a mimosa. We dare not say it <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>Folds up its tents, like the Arabs,</l>

                     </lg>
                  </q> but it falls back, at least, and bides its time. The world is far from being
                  one grand, general, Mutual Admiration Society. The eyes and manners of strangers
                  tell us many new and some unpalatable truths, such as the tongue dares not utter;
                  but being truths, that which is true within us runs to meet and greet them, spite
                  of our anger and disdain. Perhaps we thought our turned silk looked as well as
                  ever, until we saw it mirrored in Mrs. Grundy's eyes; but ours are instantly
                  opened under the influence of hers. We fancied our son a fine, genteel-looking
                  young man, until Miss Biggs and Miss Prim gave him the cold shoulder on the
                  approach of moustached and eye-glassed Mr. Cackle. Then we fell to comparisons,
                  and for comparisons there must be judgment, and for judgment, when we are not
                  going to tell any body the result, sincerity; and so we get to the reality of
                  things, and all our pleasant little delusions fly away, and leave what may not
                  look so pretty at first, but is, after all, much more wholesome and more
                  dignified. To be obliged to content ourselves with our real claims is a great
                  gain, and it is bought by travel.</p>
               <p>We can hardly be said, now-a-days, to obtain much real information by travel.
                  Panoramas and books have changed all that—the former, especially. When one of
                  those three mile pictures is burnt up, we may reasonably suspect the railroad and
                  steamboat people of the incendiarism. One cannot but know beforehand just how
                  every place under the sun is going to look. Whoever has seen Sattler's cosmoramas,
                  has looked out of the window at the scenes they represent, as long as he liked.
                  When we saw Quebec for the first time, it seemed as if we had been gazing at it
                  last week, so perfect was the transcript in a great panorama not long since
                  exhibited. The very vessels anchored in the river were identical, and had never
                  moved. Niagara is as well known to the shop-boys of New<pb n="30-31"
                     xml:id="VAC7024-00000016"/> York, as to the most conscientious tourist. Still
                  we go, and feel that we have learned something; and we are right; but it is not
                  something that can be written down or pictured, anywhere but in the individual
                  mind. So much of the mountain or the cataract as becomes a part of us and of our
                  being, is an inestimable gain; nought else of all the costly accomplishment of
                  travel.</p>
               <p>This is why travelled people are radically different from others. And the fact
                  that people who are always travelling are good for nothing, does not conflict with
                  our statement, but rather confirms it, for they fail in the very point we have
                  specified. They furnish their minds with little else than a daguerreotype or a
                  panorama, destitute of the intelligent commentary that alone makes such a show
                  valuable. People who are restlessly racing the world over, year after year, come
                  at length to be emptied of all but the driest facts, without one grace of
                  imagination or combination. What they have seen has given them just enough
                  pleasure or knowledge to make all that is present insipid; and as to affections,
                  the insatiable traveller must systematically dry them up, in self-defense. Old
                  Weller, who had "thirty mile of chambermaids" in love with him, and only laughed
                  coolly in his sleeve at all of them, was not to be blamed, for how could he return
                  their affection? <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l rend="ti-1">The moon looks</l>

                        <l>The brook can see no moon but this.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> And a game so unequal must soon end.</p>
               <p>So the love of travelling must have its limits. It is a passion in some; as much
                  so as ambition or pity, and, like them, requires reasonable bounds. The moment we
                  find ourselves uneasy at home, we should cease to travel, and sedulously cultivate
                  home interests; engage more earnestly in social life, and, as far as possible,
                  make ourselves necessary to the people among whom it is our duty to live. For what
                  state is so terrible as isolation? And isolation of mind is worse than all. The
                  heart must starve and dwindle when it loses the relish for its natural food.</p>
               <p>Travel, rightly used, makes us happier and more useful at home. Freshened eyes
                  give a happy shine to whatever they look upon, and renewed good humor brightens
                  not only our own faces but the faces of others to us. Stagnation is the enemy of
                  cheerfulness. The black pool would run dancing and laughing in the sun, if it had
                  a proper outlet. When things do not go right with us, it is half the time owing to
                  a lack of animal spirits; and much of our discontent with others has the same
                  source. Let any thing occur to set the blood leaping through the veins, even
                  something not particularly pleasurable, and a thousand petty vexations and gloomy
                  thoughts fly off, we know not whither, showing that they had only a phantom-life;
                  for the mind from the smallest materials forms images according to its own nature
                  or condition. Sir Walter Scott, looking up from a Life of Byron which had absorbed
                  him for some time, saw Byron himself standing at no great distance, every
                  lineament perfect; but when Scott had walked but a few steps, the figure of his
                  brother poet resolved itself into a few shawls and plaids, that had been hanging
                  in the hall, day after day, unnoticed. So we have only to quit the occupation that
                  has fatigued the mind, and just stir the blood into a healthful flow, to let
                  daylight in upon the gloomiest megrims, and discover that Providence has no
                  particular spite against us, but<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7024-00000017"/> offers
                  us much more of happiness and comfort than we choose to accept. But when this
                  great object is accomplished, let us sit down again, and remember that direct
                  self-cultivation is by no means the sole or the highest object of life.</p>
               <p>The effect of grand scenery upon the mind is very decided, and can hardly fail to
                  tend towards good. There may be as many wonders in a midge's wing as in Mont Blanc
                  or the Mammoth Cave; but they are not wonders that affect the mind in the same
                  direction. Providence has so ordered it that the objects most important to the
                  great human family and most accordant with our nature, are those which ask us aid
                  of science for their enjoyment and appreciation. There is probably no rational
                  being who is wholly unaffected by the grandeur of mountains, the waving and the
                  shadow of primeval woods, the thunder of the mighty cataract. However dull and
                  ignorant the brain, the blood will thrill and the nerves shake at these
                  manifestations of Supreme power. Witness the deification of natural objects in the
                  early days of the world—a form given to thoughts and feelings which could find no
                  vent or explanation but worship. And worship is now the impulse, but with the
                  dignity and sanction of knowledge, which transfers the heart's instinctive
                  language from the most sublime of created objects to Him who made them all, and
                  who, from immeasurable distance, inspires them with the charm which no human heart
                  can wholly resist.</p>
               <p>But who can measure how greatly cultivation enhances the power of these
                  feelings—not only direct but general cultivation; an acquaintance and familiarity,
                  not only with the objects themselves, but with what genius has said and shown of
                  them. Every real advance, intellectual or moral, tells on our power of admiration;
                  the loss or lessening of this power is one of the surest signs of general
                  deterioration. The <foreign xml:lang="LAT">nil admirari,</foreign> which some
                  would-be fashionables affect, is an emulation towards the owl and the tortoise.
                  The habit of admiring is one of the noblest; it is next to the habit of loving.
                  Ignorance and envy are its opposites; and the mind and heart may be so corrupted
                  by these as to resist the feelings of admiration, even when merely inanimate
                  objects are concerned. But the greatest souls that have ever lived have owned the
                  influences of natural scenery most fully. Next to human interest, the poet and the
                  artist find their best inspiration in wild, sublime Nature. Even the most verbose
                  descriptions and the poorest paintings of natural scenery show its power over the
                  imagination; for in no other direction are men so apt to attempt the impossible,
                  and to fancy they have succeeded because memory supplied to themselves all that
                  their skill has been unequal to impart to others.</p>
               <p>Let not, then, the impulse to summer travel be classed among fashionable follies.
                  It may be turned to poor account, indeed, as witness the unsavory crowds, the
                  steamy lights, the unwholesome habits of too many of the retreats alternately made
                  'fashionable' or 'vulgar' by the caprices of a few of the bolder leaders of ton.
                  If there be hundreds willing, rather than be omitted from the list of notables, to
                  swelter amid inconveniences that they would not tolerate at a friend's house,
                  there are thousands who roam during the hot months among the mountains and lakes
                  of their own country, or try the fresh breezes of ocean and the wonders of foreign
                  lands, from pure love of nature and improvement; who love the freshness of the
                  summer morning, the forest shade at noon, the moonlit walk, the exciting ascent of
                  woody mountains, the roar of cataracts; Lot because<pb n="34-35"
                     xml:id="VAC7024-00000018"/> fashion has stamped them for the present, but
                  because, from the beginning, the Author of all good has placed between these
                  objects and the mind of man a sympathy and affinity, the result of which is proof
                  enough that it is His work and enjoys His sanction and reward.</p>

               <p>THERE are some people in the world, who, though not averse to some of the aspects
                  of fashionable life, yet dislike watering places. To seek change by going where
                  the whole dull round of the winter is repeated—ruminated, as it were; to seek
                  rural beauty where nature is put in stocks and stays, and trodden down and
                  travestied in every possible way; to seek retirement where the crowd is more
                  selfish and more encroaching even than in town—seems to them as absurd as
                  odious.</p>
               <p>These originals—these contemners of an authority from which there is no appeal,
                  none the less confess a love of pleasure. They do not claim to be above the need
                  of relaxation—satisfied with variety in duty—living martyrs to the serious and the
                  sad in life. They have their own simple and odd way of seeking amusement; a way so
                  odd and so obscure that we have fancied<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7024-00000019"/> a
                  little sketch of it might possess for the fashionable world something of the zest
                  of novelty; it is so natural for those who live in a whirl of excitement to fancy
                  that nobody can of choice live out of it. Perhaps it will seem not life exactly,
                  but only existence.</p>
               <p>True fashionable life is, however, but partially naturalized on our fresh American
                  soil, and in our unworn American hearts In spite of our efforts to appear as if we
                  were born to it, many an inward whisper of demur writes itself upon our faces;
                  many an awkward non-compliance shames our consistency, while it does honor to our
                  sincerity and humanity. Nature, nursed by the mere shadow of our forests and the
                  breath of our virgin soil, is too strong for us. We have not yet been successfully
                  schooled into heartlessness. Love, and Charity, and Sympathy, still yearn within
                  us, though they are repudiated by Fashion, who insists upon undivided sway. So
                  those who would plead for simple people and simple pleasures may yet hope a
                  hearing.</p>

               <p>Whether fifty years or five before the time at which we write, it matters not—for
                  we treat of things with which exact chronology has nothing to do—a circle of
                  friends and neighbors, living in and near a town used in summer as a
                  watering-place, resolved for once to avoid the tedious pleasures and lonely bustle
                  which the long days always brought about their homes, by retreating to an
                  undiscovered, or, at least, uncelebrated nook, where nature had as yet leave to
                  make what faces she liked, and where no impertinent blunder of art had attempted
                  to improve her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tournure.</foreign> It seemed a somewhat
                  rash experiment, this; for the selection of members of such a party, not being
                  made by secret ballot, could not be wholly candid and exclusive. It was by no
                  means certain that six weeks' of summer <foreign xml:lang="FRA">abandon</foreign>
                  would not prove too much for the philosophy of some; and that near and constant
                  intercourse, under circumstances of less that home-convenience, might not end in
                  unhappy revelations as to the temper of others. But the experiment was worth
                  trying, especially as it was of too quiet and humble a kind to excite invidious
                  remark.</p>
               <p>Then the thing had no unpleasant trammels about it. There were no inclosing
                  mountains about this "happy valley," forbidding egress to those who were tired of
                  happiness. There was even no fixed time for rustication; nor were friends from
                  without prohibited from joining the party for a longer or shorter period, in case
                  the taste for rurality should spread. Whatever liberty can do for constancy was
                  provided for, and the most prudent examination of the materials of the mass
                  discovered no dangerous elements. There was not even too much friendship,—as might
                  easily be, since friendship is at least as sensitive and jealous as love. No
                  sentiment beyond kind neighborly feeling, and the esteem which intelligent
                  habitual intercourse engenders, had prompted the choice of companionship; the
                  affinities were all of the most harmless kind. Love was almost out of the
                  question, as will be seen when we have introduced our coterie of seceders.</p>
               <p>Speaking naturally, we begin with Miss Ingoldsby, because her image rises first to
                  our thoughts. She was one of those women who are more lovely at five and twenty
                  than at sixteen, because their beauty lies largely in the expression of soul.
                  There was a wonderful depth of harmony in this young lady's<pb n="38-39"
                     xml:id="VAC7024-00000020"/> face, that made one forget to notice the rich
                  coloring of her complexion, and the corresponding and heightening darkness of eyes
                  and hair which served as shadow to those velvet roses. Tall, quiet, and perhaps a
                  little stately— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>Her eyes alone smiled constantly; her lips had serious sweetness,</l>
                        <l>And her front was calm—the dimple rarely rippled on her cheek.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> You could think of her only as unique; you never thought of likening her to
                  any one else. Yet none had less the air of pretension, or even consciousness. She
                  was always occupied, and, whether with mind or fingers, never with self. Elegant
                  tastes she had, but they were for simple things—things whose charm or value
                  depends not at all on exclusive possession. She talked well, but not with
                  intention; or if with intention, only so for the sake of others' pleasure or
                  advantage; never merely to shine, or to make some chance scrap of knowledge tell,
                  or to frame in some poetical quotation. Cultivation made Miss Ingoldsby only more
                  natural, for she had learned above all things how hateful is affectation; and
                  indeed she had always had small temptation that way, being inevitably charming,
                  and living surrounded by eyes that assured her she was all they desired. There is
                  no telling how much ruinous affectation and unlovely effort we might save if we
                  yielded admiration and love more generously. It is deprecation or defiance of
                  expected criticism that causes half the paltry airs that spoil society. Her father
                  was with her, and she was his earthly all; no wonder she walked with an
                  unconscious queenliness, for what gives such grace and tender dignity to the
                  manners as the sense of being wholly loved? Would-be people felt her air to be a
                  little reserved—the ill-natured among them said haughty; but if so, it was only in
                  self-defence. Refinement cannot always wholly disguise its suffering, and
                  vulgarity bitterly resents the slightest manifestation of distaste or weariness.
                  But Miss Ingoldsby was as generally liked as so admirable a woman could be, and
                  the love of her friends was a kind of quiet enthusiasm, which did not flow out
                  into the praise which stimulates envy. When the summer-flitting was planned, the
                  first thought was whether Mr. and Miss Ingoldsby would be disposed to try it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Marston, and her son,—an overgrown boy of sixteen, a college sophomore, who
                  fancied that study had injured his health,—are to be counted next; Mrs. Marston,
                  staid, reasonable, well-read, well-principled; the youth one just calculated to
                  keep such a mother's heart in a continual flutter. These were near neighbors of
                  the Ingoldsbys at home, and the families had an habitual liking for each other;
                  traditional, indeed, for their forefathers had inhabited the very same spots, and
                  left many vestiges of their old neighborliness during the troublous days of the
                  Revolution. So they were well past the critical stage, and took each other for
                  granted very kindly—a state of things favorable to harmonious companionship, even
                  where there is no great mental or spiritual affinity. After these we come to Mr.
                  Berry, a bachelor, one of the soberest; but so full of thought, and feeling, and
                  poetry, and all romantic lore, that no one cared to inquire his age, which might
                  have troubled him, for, though something of a philosopher, he was human and
                  unmarried. His worst fault was a disposition to moralize, (some said dogmatize);
                  unless we consider as such his propensity to quote poetry, of which ample proof
                  will be found hereafter. This habit proved infectious, too, or else the natural
                  influence of woods and fields waked up the latent fires of others<pb n="40-41"
                     xml:id="VAC7024-00000021"/> of the party, so that they took to citing verses
                  hugely, doubtless to the secret scorn of those who respect only the tangible, or
                  who have not the blessing (?) of good memory. Miss Berry, his sister, was a good
                  deal younger, but seemed to have found time for nearly as much reading. She was
                  shy and timid, however, and brought out what she had to say with a manner at once
                  hesitating and abrupt. To those who knew her worth, like these friends and
                  neighbors, she was a delightful companion, and the party would hardly have missed
                  any body more, always excepting Miss Ingoldsby.</p>
               <p>Will any body be kind enough to inform us what is the origin of the
                     expression—<emph>a grass-widow?</emph>
               </p>
               <p>In vain have we sought a plausible etymology for this strange phrase, which yet
                  seems fully naturalized among us, and which has so usurped the function of
                  defining a certain position, that we know not how or where to find a substitute.
                  It designates a lady who is separated from her husband, not exactly by divorce,
                  but by circumstances which mutual affection is not quite powerful enough to
                  surmount. We have known a gentleman to go to Europe for his health, intending to
                  be absent a summer or so, and there remain five years, frequently appointing a
                  time for his return. On the other hand, ladies have been so fascinated by Italy,
                  that they have continued to reside there, leaving husband to make himself
                  comfortable at hotels and boarding-houses at home. For the honor of human nature,
                  be it observed that these things seldom occur where there are children in the
                  case.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Whipple was called, in her neighborhood and at the watering-places which she
                  was fond of frequenting, a 'grasswidow,' and we must let the title stand for the
                  position in which she lived, not knowing how to replace it by a better. A deserted
                  wife she was not, exactly, since she was as little disposed to live with her
                  husband as he could possibly be to seek her society; and they were on excellent
                  terms, corresponding with great regularity. Scandal had never breathed upon Mrs.
                  Whipple's good name; her behavior was unexceptionable; she never flirted; she was
                  no babbler, nor did she often make mischief. She dressed with all her might and
                  all her means; she never missed a party of pleasure, or neglected the opportunity
                  for a visit; she chaperoned young ladies and advised young gentlemen; she knit
                  stockings for the poor and embroidered slippers and smoking-caps for the rich; she
                  was an indefatigable church-goer, and played a capital game of whist; was an adept
                  in social etiquette, and an eloquent declaimer against the follies and
                  heartlessness of fashionable society. Like that ingenious little figure, which,
                  roll it where you will, has so many and such even sides that it always stands
                  firm, Mrs. Whipple was invariably "all right" with regard to those around her.
                  Serious with the serious, she never interfered with the whims of the gay. Not
                  being inconveniently interested in any body in particular, she was able to make
                  herself agreeable to all, maintaining a friendly neutrality which interfered with
                  no one's private likings or dislikings. We need not fill up this outline of Mrs.
                  Whipple's character, for all our readers have doubtless seen a Mrs. Whipple.</p>
               <p>Some people said she had one fault—that she was an unblushing flatterer; but this
                  was when she flattered somebody else. The subjects of her praise seldom
                  complained. We have this lady to add to our <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >coterie,</foreign> not, perhaps, because she fell into it naturally, bat
                  because she was the guest of one of the members.<pb n="42-43"
                     xml:id="VAC7024-00000022"/> Why she accepted an invitation uncongenial with her
                  habits, we can only guess. Boundless curiosity was one of her characteristics, and
                  perhaps the novelty of the plan tempted her. Or she might have desired to see how
                  what she called "sensible" people—a term which from her lips had always the
                  suspicion of a sneer—would endure a summer of rural seclusion. There is nothing of
                  which the world is more incredulous than professions of distaste for what it loves
                  best, especially when this distaste refers to no special enthusiasm.</p>
               <p>We are saved the necessity of sketching Mr. Aldis, the nephew of Miss Berry and
                  her brother, by a "Character" of Tennyson's. If Charles Aldis had sat to the poet,
                  the likeness could have been no more life-like. <q>

                  </q> And so on.</p>
               <p>This gentleman—a specimen of a certain sickly and inert cultivation not uncommon
                  among us—was accompanied by his sister, much like him in fact, but seeming
                  something stronger, because we do not pay her sex the compliment of expecting so
                  much from it. A man's faults sometimes pass for almost graces in a woman, even
                  though we are far from acknowledging the heresy of masculine and feminine virtues;
                  the characters of man and woman may be sketched in lighter or deeper tints of the
                  same color, but the same primaries must serve. Anne Aldis had if any thing, the
                  advantage as to depth, so that she seemed immeasurably superior to her
                  brother.</p>
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Shelton, a newly married couple, with Miss Grove, Mrs. Shelton's
                  sister, complete the circle. It is hard to characterize newly married people; they
                  are generally either very insipid or very artificial; that is, they are either
                  much occupied with each other, or affecting not to be so; and in either case not
                  very good company. But here were ample walks and unsearchable rambles, and all
                  about the little picturesque village which our refugees had chosen, such quiet
                  coverts and enticing labyrinths as make one believe in fairy land.</p>
               <p>There were a thousand good reasons why Mr. Shelton and his fair Egeria—baptismally
                  devoted to forest shades—should thread these mossy paths every day, and lose
                  themselves and become irretrievably bewildered, so that they could not find the
                  way home until dinner-time, or tea-time, as the case might be. Meanwhile Miss
                  Grove was left upon the hands of the public for entertainment; but, as she worked
                  in crewels or <foreign xml:lang="FRA">crochet</foreign> without ceasing, she was
                  happily raised above the accidents of social life, and gave very little trouble to
                  any one.</p>

                     >blonde</foreign> girl, picturesque and ornamental at least, when you did not
                  examine too closely. We say no more at present, except that the young lady wore
                  very long ringlets, which she occasionally sewed or knit into her work, and then
                  snatched out again,<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7024-00000023"/> leaving not a few

               <p>The village lay not exactly on the edge of the wide ocean, but within sight of it,
                  on the shore of a small cove, rocky and wild as heart could wish—we dare not name
                  it, lest it be thronged and spoiled next year. No steamboat had yet found it out,
                  nor did telegraph wires vibrate within a dozen miles of it. The inhabitants, who
                  were divided between fishing and farming, sent a boy on horseback for the mail
                  every Saturday, and he often brought back nothing but a few newspapers. The
                  present accession altered this matter somewhat, of course; but even now the very
                  atmosphere was loaded with stillness. <q>

                  all agreed, whatever diversities might have been found among them otherwise. They
                  walked, they boated, they rode; they made the woods ring with careless talk, and
                  sounds meant on purpose for the echoes. The ladies tried to learn the art of
                  milking, but found the cows quite too much for them; and Miss Ingoldsby amused
                  herself with feeding the poultry, until she could not stir abroad without a train
                  of screaming, hopping, fluttering, creatures, following her and pecking at her
                  slippers. Mr. Berry put on a gravely knowing air when he talked with the farmers,
                  but it was easy to see that he was stealing knowledge, which he was quite unable
                  to repay in kind. He was preparing for agricultural speeches in next winter's
                  ter's legislature. As for Mr. Ingoldsby, being rather portly in <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">contour,</foreign> he was not particularly fond of climbing
                  rocks, or jumping across rivulets with the aid of a long slender pole—favorite
                  gymnastics with some of the party. So he generally set out with a book in his
                  pocket, or some newspapers if there were any unexhausted, and, when he began to
                  feel rather red and short-breathed, would sit down in the shade, and, taking out
                  his glasses, soon lose himself—in contemplation we are bound to say, for he
                  stoutly denied that his cogitations ever partook of the nature of slumber. His
                  reading always turned to the general benefit, however, for he remembered every
                  thing worth remembering, and was not too lazy or too selfish to tell it for the
                  pleasure of others, as so many readers are. The Sheltons, we have said, were
                  disposed to be erratic, but we must not leave the impression that they were silly
                  or ill-bred. They contributed their part to the current social feeling, and
                  generously allowed their absorption to be laughed at, without putting on the old
                  rusty defensive armor of dignified looks about it. Mrs. Marston was always
                  agreeable. She had great calmness of spirit, and a power of saying just the thing
                  that was needed at the moment; was willing to suggest plans and have them modified
                  or rejected; stay behind when conveyance was scanty; give her opinion on any point
                  in debate, whether she was interested or not; and, in short, made herself of as
                  small account as her friends would let her, as a sensible middle-aged lady should,
                  making up her mind that it was very natural for society to be more occupied with
                  younger claimants upon attention. Mr. and Miss Aldis, Henry Marston, and Miss
                  Grove, felt themselves of a good deal of importance, and made very good company
                  for each other.</p>

               <p>Miss Berry alone, of all the circle, had a passion. We are sorry to disappoint the
                  reader, but it was not the passion of passions, but only an insane desire to
                  gather sea-weed, or <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Alga</foreign> as the lady more
                  euphoniously termed the wondrous films of rose and purple, and gold and brown,
                  that she waded after, and gathered, and spread carefully and cunningly on cards.
                  With her great disk of a straw hat, and her quaint bathing costume, she did make a
                  most remarkable figure, slipping off mossy rocks into crevices that looked black
                  and shadowy and as if they were full of eels; or standing with all gravity,
                  knee-high in water, gazing fixedly as if she saw fairy castles, or were studying
                  the pictured clouds on the bay's fair bosom. But the water was not always calm
                  enough for these mystic rites, and Miss Berry, in her natural form and
                  unpossessed, was one of the most genial, chatty, agreeable persons in the world.
                  She had travelled, and with profit, and was full of scraps of pleasant knowledge,
                  which, as she had gathered them for the pleasure of gathering, she dispensed for
                  the pleasure of dispensing, or because they were the natural outflowing of the
                  current of pure and lively thought within. Her cheerfulness was cloudless, and her
                  ready smile lightened and danced all over her face, till one forgot that its
                  dominant expression was serious. Society would be sadly off without a few single
                  women like Miss Berry, unabsorbed by private cares, and at leisure for special
                  offices of kindness. She had not been a week at M——before she was acquainted with
                  every man, woman and child in the settlement, and knew something about their wants
                  and difficulties; but so quietly and privately that no one suspected her of
                  spending all the time during which she was not visible, in devising liberal things
                  for all cases within her power.</p>
               <p>To some apprehensions a circle composed of such materials as we have here faintly
                  sketched would be dull enough. No flirtation! no balls! no opportunity for display
                  of dress or equipage! In one word—one magic word—no <emph>excitement!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Yet we aver that our party enjoyed every day and hour.</p>
               <p>One proof we can offer, which perhaps will seem yet harder to believe—that they
                  wrote a great many long letters. It is true that this bespeaks a very quiet kind
                  of happiness. We are not disposed to withdraw from what is sometimes called
                  pleasure, to write ourselves down for absent friends. A certain degree of calm is
                  required for the introversion which makes letter-writing agreeable, and we are not
                  apt to find time for this amid a round of exciting amusements. The mind must be
                  free from any irksome compression of circumstances; the imagination must be gently
                  stimulated; the memory relieved from present burthens; time not marked out too
                  severely by recurring duties; the sympathies not too much drained by the daily
                  demand which none can shun who face the jostling of common life.</p>
               <p>All these conditions being fulfilled, how sweet is the memory of the absent; how
                  tenderly the claims of old affection urge themselves! Our very dreams renew the
                  cherished images that seem faded only because so delicately drawn. It is not at
                  these times that we criticise those we love. We paint them, indeed; we catch
                  full-length views, which we never find time for when we are with them; but with
                  what choice and tender touches! Here we are artistic, if ever. No charm is
                  forgotten—no deficiency remembered. The leading idea possesses us wholly, and
                  whatever could contradict it falls into gentle shadow under the magic light of
                  affection.</p>
               <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7024-00000025"/>
               <p>Yes—we insist that feeling disposed to write letters is a sign of happiness, for
                  when we love we are happy. Would that this our deep philosophy might shame some
                  one out of saying "I hate to write letters!"</p>
               <p>Tennyson has a sly touch at the picturesque of a Lady's handwriting, when he makes
                  the Prince, trying to write lady-like, scribble <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>In such a hand as when a field of corn</l>
                        <l>Bows all its ears before the roaring East.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> But the satire which pretends that women would rather write gracefully than
                  legibly is hardly consistent with the other, which ascribes to them a love of
                  talking; for surely nobody loves to talk without being understood, and what else
                  is writing illegibly?</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>The amount of reading accomplished at M——was not very considerable. There are
                  seasons when the mind is instinctively creative, whether we give it voice or not.
                  At such times reading has not its usual charm, though we may hardly suspect why.
                  We call the phase dreamy, and so perhaps it is; but if we had resolution to embody
                  those dreams, they might be found to deserve a more respectable name. Miss
                  Ingoldsby was oftener seen writing than reading, but she could not be persuaded to
                  give a rational and credible account of the multitude of closely written scraps of
                  paper which slipped into her portfolio.</p>
               <p>The weather was so delicious that the bay seemed, in its quietude, like<q>
                     <l>A blue summer ocean, far off and alone;</l>
                  </q> and the motion of the oars dipping into its glossy bosom was often all that
                  broke its stillness. On one side was a bold, rocky headland; on the other a grassy
                  point stretching down nearly to the pebbly beach; and when these were rounded, the
                  shores on either hand presented great variety of outline, and ample facilities for
                  bathing Fishing was unpopular with the ladies, and although the gentlemen made
                  some desperate attempts to become interested in it, they always seemed glad when
                  their pleasure of that kind was well over; which was not so much to be wondered
                  at, as the ungentlemanly fishermen about them were a good deal more successful.
                  Mr. Berry confessed that he never caught anything but cold, and so forswore
                  angling altogether. Mrs. Shelton declared her husband's fishing-coat, with its
                  dozens of yawning pockets, horribly unbecoming to him, so of course
                     <emph>he</emph> gave it up. Mr. Aldis managed to pop into the water, and had to
                  be pulled out of it very unceremoniously by two men in red flannel, which quite
                  disgusted <emph>him.</emph> Henry Marston alone persisted in sitting in the sun
                  whole days, and coming home with his nose blistered, and his fingers looking like
                  bunches of radishes, much to his mother's disquiet; while Mr. Ingoldsby joked him
                  unmercifully about "silver hooks," and promised to eat all the fish of his
                     <foreign xml:lang="LAT">bona fide</foreign> catching; until one evening Henry
                  brought in an enormous bass, with ample vouchers for its being his lawful captive;
                  after which Mr. Ingoldsby grew more respectful, and Henry more enthusiastic, as
                  was to be expected.</p>
               <p>After all, however, Mr Berry cruelly started a doubt whether Henry might not have
                  bought the vouchers as well as the fish!</p>
               <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7024-00000026"/>
               <p>"What <emph>do</emph> you suppose the people are saying of us at Lavington, now?"
                  exclaimed Mrs. Whipple, as the party were gathered in a great old-fashioned porch
                  at nightfall, watching the sparkles on the water and the sparkles on the land,—a
                  wide meadow near at hand furnishing myriads of fire-flies;—and listening to the
                  katy-dids, and inhaling the odors of a labyrinth of honey-suckles and roses, that
                  had grown, untrained, all about the windows and doors of the antiquated house.</p>
               <p>"Pitying us, no doubt," said Mr. Shelton.</p>
               <p>"Abusing us, rather," said Mr. Berry.</p>
               <p>"Oh no—not abusing—only thinking us very silly," said Miss Ingoldsby.</p>
               <p>"Or very romantic," Mr. Aldis thought.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Marston imagined the prevailing idea to be that they were very exclusive.</p>
               <p>"So is every one who does not give a large party every time he wants to ask a
                  friend or two to dinner," said Mr. Ingoldsby. "Exclusiveness is justly offensive
                  where it is an object—where we exclude for the sake of excluding. The
                  exclusiveness of fashionable life excites odium only because it is well understood
                  to be deliberately practised, as a means of distinction. We shall not be suspected
                  of any thing of that kind, I hope and believe."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps the worst thing that will be said of us," said Miss Berry, "may be that
                  we fancy ourselves very sensible, and set up to be wiser than our neighbors."</p>
               <p>"An imputation that we ought to bear patiently," observed her brother, "seeing
                  that it comes very near the truth."</p>
               <p>"Is it so?" asked Miss Ingoldsby; "I imagined we were only rational."</p>
               <p>"Yes, but to be rational, in so original a way, may be felt as an imputation upon
                  the rationality of those who choose a very different mode of passing the
                  summer."</p>
               <p>"You may depend upon it," said Mrs. Marston, "we shall be accused of having made a
                  desperate effort at originality."</p>
               <p>"We ought to be canonized for that, at least," said Mr. Berry. "An American who
                  ventures upon any thing original, in the social way, is a hero, and stands a
                  chance of being a martyr. We are more completely the slaves of prescription than
                  any other people. Imitation is our national vice."</p>
               <p>"We must not pride ourselves too much on originality in this instance," said Miss
                  Berry, "for I confess, as far as I had any part in suggesting the idea, it was
                  caught from a poem of Mrs. Browning's—a poem called The Island, which I dare say
                  you all know."</p>
               <p>"Oh no, we don't, I'm sure," said half a dozen voices. "You will repeat it for us,
                  Miss Berry."</p>
               <p>Miss Berry said she knew only a few verses of it—those which put the thought of
                  such a quiet summer sojourn in her head. <q>

               <p>This last stanza, containing the germ of this social seclusion which was not
                  exclusion, Miss Berry repeated with especial emphasis. She had a vast fund of
                  romance in the bottom of her good heart, and lived as much on poetry as any one
                  can who leads a life of active usefulness, or rather more, perhaps, than any one
                  can who does <emph>not</emph> lead a useful life. Those have the best right to the
                  poetry of life who fulfil all its uses. The "calm, high, spheric tune" is heard
                  only by the ear of labor. Miss Berry's dark, piercing eyes always saw more than
                  other people's, because there was nothing human that did not interest her, so that
                  she had no seasons of vacuity—none of those faintings of egotism which we call low
                  spirits. A benevolence that knew no pause forbade stagnation, and the health of
                  mind which attended it brought health of body too. She was a spirit of pure life
                  wherever she appeared; her very beauty was inspiring.</p>

               <p>This beauty Miss Berry possessed in perfection, and it diffused itself like a rosy
                  sunset hue wherever she lived and moved.</p>
               <p>"They will expect <emph>you</emph> to write a book, Miss Berry," said Mrs.
                  Whipple, continuing the suggestion of what was the thought at Lavington.</p>
               <p>This alluded to a malicious report of some enemy of Miss Berry's, that she had
                  written books—not generally believed, however; she was too pleasant and natural to
                  fill out the popular notion of an authoress.</p>
               <p>She blushed, and asked what material could be found under such circumstances.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I don't know—I dare say you can find some. What do you think of describing
                  ourselves and our doings?"</p>
               <p>"I protest against that," said Miss Ingoldsby. "I am so idle and good-for-nothing,
                  that I decline being put into print. I propose rather that Miss Berry should
                  devise a book on morals and manners, culled from the substance of our sage
                  conversations. We are very wise, here; and entertain virtuous and highly
                  commendable sentiments at small cost, since our temptations are few. Suppose we
                  give the world the advantage of these by the aid of our friend's pen."</p>
               <p>Miss Berry would not own that she possessed any power of the kind described.</p>
               <p>"It appears to me," she said, "that our book should be a joint-stock affair, each
                  member contributing something."</p>
               <p>Of course, each person vehemently protested that he or she was entirely unable to
                  contribute any thing to such an undertaking, and the subject was dropped.</p>
               <p>The world has lost much by this impression that to write down one's thoughts for
                  the sympathy, encouragement, or instruction of others is a peculiar craft. But, in
                  truth, the lines of Wordsworth on a kindred theme might be applied to those to
                  whom the name of author is a bugbear: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">

                        <l>And go to the grace unthought of. Strongest minds</l>
                        <l>Are often those of whom the noisy world</l>

                     </lg>
                  </q> The spontaneous effusion of thought would roll back at least a part of the
                  great tide of mere imitative or mechanical writing, that threatens to overwhelm
                  the public mind and patience. If each one endowed by nature as the poet supposes,
                  gave forth that which he had an impulse to utter, and <emph>nothing else,</emph>
                  we should have more authors and fewer volumes; the choicest essence of every man's
                  experience, and the most delicate aroma of every fancy's flowering. Treasures are
                  even now lying lost in private letters, which would suffice for the germ of many a
                  work with which the press and the people groan. Pearls lie ungathered in many a
                  conversation, that would put to shame the elaborate artificial gems that glitter
                  in ostentatious efforts at style and effect. As many people are wiser than they
                  know, as there are those not so wise as they think; as many need a fillip to their
                  vanity, as there are that would be the better for an extinguisher on their
                  conceit. The standard of writing would be instantly raised, if the stores of wit
                  and wisdom, love and power, that warm life creates in the depths of<pb n="56-57"

                  devoted to the general good—considered common property, of which the individual
                  possessor is only one of the stewards. What are rubies, so long as they are not
                  brought out into the sun that formed them? They belong to the day, and fulfil
                  their destiny when, set in gold, they contribute to the world's beauty, or pass
                  from hand to hand as agents in the world's affairs. If it be culpable to hoard our
                  worldly goods when we see our brother have need, it is worse to keep back our good
                  thoughts—far more needed than food or raiment. "Man shall not live by bread
                  alone."</p>

               <p>One might suppose such a homily taken from Armstrong's Art of Health, but it is
                  Wordsworth who condescends to lecture on early rising. Why are homely themes
                  considered inconsistent with great ones—or the low with the high? Why not learn
                  from Nature how common things borrow dignity from the medium through which they
                  pass? If it were not for a petty notion as to the graceful and the worthy, many a
                  fresh thought would fall like dew on the world's parched heart, instead of
                  exhaling in mere "peculiarity"—is not that the word for those who wish to be true
                  to the inward promptings?—or dropping in tears, through despair of sympathy or
                  fellowship.</p>
               <p>The sincere horror which many people feel at the name of authorship is a mere
                  delusion; for who is shocked at being the author of a long letter—a veritable
                  piece of composition; of a conservatory, an exhibition of taste;—or of a great
                  blotchy looking piece of worsted-work, a proof of misapplied perseverance;—or a
                  new fashion, an attempt at invention? But a book! Ah! that is the bugbear. But if
                  a book were simply an ebullition—a manifestation—an expression of sentiment—a
                  token of the within—why should pride or diffidence have any thing to do with
                  it?</p>
               <p>Is a person supposed to be invariably proud of the book he writes? How often is it
                  an engine of the keenest mortification, from its failure to express his thought!
                  Instead of being suspected of pride or vanity, the author deserves credit for
                  humility, when he throws himself before the world, saying—"Here is my thought—do
                  you like it? I hope you do! To me it seems to have a true life, and I sow it in
                  hope that it may spring up and bear fruit in other hearts."</p>
               <p>If we were contented with things as they are—if no pictures of the possible ever
                  colored the shifting surface of our thoughts—if the actual world were beautiful
                  enough, and our actual lot in it happy enough, to satisfy the longings of the
                  divine within us—it would be less wonderful that we should feel no impulse towards
                  bringing our inner and higher selves into communication with the secret hearts of
                  those about us. People walking at leisure over a flowery plain, with no fixed
                  object in view, no<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7024-00000030"/> difficulties to
                  surmount, no advice to ask, no aid to give, might naturally enough stray about in
                  silence, caring little for each other for want of a common object. But ascending a
                  rugged steep, beset with snares and pitfalls, and cheered by few passages of
                  beauty—leading none the less to all that the imagination and the heart were
                  created to covet—can we plod on, with no need of sympathy, no interest in the
                  success or failure of others, no desire to make our hard-earned knowledge of parts
                  of the way useful to the toiling? Especially when we find flowers and fruit, is it
                  generous not to tell?</p>
               <p>One good result of shaping and fixing our thoughts in words, is the greater power
                  and prominence given to the Ideal by thus endowing it with a body something less
                  spiritual than its own. Its influence for good—for refreshment—for consolation—is
                  greater, both for ourselves and others, when we have caught and held it while it
                  can be examined and applied. We call its effects illusion, sometimes; are they not
                  rather truth, and the common and vulgar in which we are content to live the
                  illusions?</p>
               <p>We are shy of confessing our Ideal; the world's formalities and pretended
                  realities govern us with so deadly a power. Heartless ridicule is the sharpest of
                  swords to a sensitive mind. Not all the consciousness of truth and worth that
                  earnest sincerity of purpose inspires, can fully shield us from the fear of this;
                  and many a thought is crushed into silence by despair of sympathy. In this view,
                  authorship may indeed be deemed a craft or mystery by itself, since it requires
                  elements not found in every character; there is sensitiveness,—yet it does not
                  suffice to deter; and seeming despair, yet, with a secret talismanic drop of hope
                  at the core—hope that amid the scorn of the many will yet be found that precious
                  elixir—the sympathy of the few. Without this, no one could write, even though he
                  "understood all mysteries."</p>

               <p>There is no phantom that we chase more hopelessly than Leisure. If it does not
                  come to us, we need never give ourselves the trouble of pursuing it. If it be for
                  us, we can find it in town; if not, we shall be as far from it in the country. We
                  carry ourselves and our habits with us wherever we go, and circumstances, though
                  important, have less to do with the disposition of our time than we suppose. We
                  never quite leave home behind, or we should more easily be content with new scenes
                  and people. Every day of our refugees brought its full employment with it; each
                  morning had its plan—offspring mostly of the doings of the day before. Every body
                  wondered that there was so little time for anything! "I have not accomplished a
                  bit more here than I should have done at home!" murmured Miss Grove, plaintively,
                  over her worsted-work.</p>
               <p>Rural amusements are particularly thievish of time, from the fatigue they
                  occasion. There is a sweet weariness after a day in the fresh air, that leaves us
                  fit for nothing but talking or dreaming. This idle fallow state of mind and body
                  is good for both, let severe utilitarians say what they will.</p>
               <p>"I feel positively ashamed," would Miss Ingoldsby exclaim, of my idleness. Not a
                  single thing of any value have I done since we came here. I brought books, they
                  are almost unopened; work, I have hardly even thought of it. This will never do!
                  See what an amount of spinning our hostess and<pb n="60-61"
                     xml:id="VAC7024-00000031"/> her daughters have finished! That huge pile of
                  rolls in the upper chamber is diminished more than half, and the basket of skeins
                  has grown proportionably. And this, besides all the baking and butter-making for
                  us—for we eat as if we earned our appetites!"</p>
               <p>"I'm sure I earn mine," said her father; "don't you call rowing over to the
                  island, yesterday, something?"</p>
               <p>"Why, father, you did not touch an oar!" said Miss Ingoldsby, laughing.</p>
               <p>"No, indeed! it was quite enough to broil so far in the sun. I shall not make many
                  such expeditions with you. If you are so fond of the island, why not encamp there?
                  there is plenty of shelter; those old huts are good enough for a party of romantic
                  ladies and gentlemen."</p>
               <p>"O! that would be so nice!" said all the young ladies at once, and the thing was
                  carried by acclamation.</p>
               <p>"But beds!" said Mrs. Marston.</p>
               <p>"O, you might come back in the evening. To go over in the morning, with provisions
                  for the day, might do very well; but these broils for pretended fishings, I can't
                  encourage. You might give Elinor one of the caves on the north side for a House of
                  Industry, to which those who brought consciences with them into the country could
                  retire for certain portions of the day, while we hardened ones, who came on
                  purpose to be idle, could find amusement for ourselves."</p>
               <p>"And take naps undisturbed," said Miss Ingoldsby, slyly.</p>
               <p>"Naps, indeed! One can never meditate without being suspected of napping! But
                  really, I have reason to think our hosts would be glad to have a little breathing
                  time; Mrs. Torbet hints something about wanting to 'clean up;' you know this is
                  her first experience of a constant house-full. She has hitherto had only an
                  occasional lodger or two—an artist or a city fisherman—for short periods; and as
                  she received us at some sacrifice to her orderly habits, I think it would be but
                  kind to absent ourselves as much as possible for a few days."</p>
               <p>The idea took, amazingly; the younger members of the party thought it would be
                  nice to sleep over there, too, but this was vetoed. A few boat-loads of
                  conveniences furnished the two fishermen's huts quite satisfactorily to the
                  zealous pick-nickers, and the vicinity of the island to the shore made supplies by
                  no means difficult. There was a perceptible brightening of eyes and reddening of
                  cheeks when the preparations were begun. Such flying up and down stairs! Such
                  breathless consultations, such wise housewifely expedients! Time flew faster than
                  ever, and such sharp appetites were earned, that Mr. Ingoldsby observed he feared
                  it would prove but a poor speculation for Mrs. Torbet, after all.</p>
               <p>THE ISLAND.</p>
               <p>The first day was spent mostly in making arrangements and saying how pleasant it
                  was; on the second, Miss Ingoldsby established her House of Industry, and invited
                  all well-disposed persons to give it their countenance during certain warm hours
                  of the day. It was a sort of cavern, looking out upon the sea; rather broad than
                  deep, but well fringed with shrubs and vines, and easily eked out, as to shade, by
                  the aid of a gay calico curtain of Mrs. Torbet's. There was a cool spring near,
                  over which it was proposed Mrs. Egeria should preside; but this was soon found to
                  have the effect of depriving the commonwealth of<pb n="62-63"
                     xml:id="VAC7024-00000032"/> the services of her Numa, instead of only fitting
                  him for public duty. Miss Berry discovered new exploring ground for her favorite
                  pursuit, and could not find much leisure for quiet home industry; but Mr. Berry,
                  Mrs. Marston and Mrs. Whipple were constant attendants at the House of Industry,
                  while the circle was fitfully enlarged by the rest, as rambling, fishing, boating,
                  or picking the small fruits that grew plentifully about the rocks, gave them
                  leisure, or made them desire repose. Mr. Ingoldsby felt it his duty to pay some
                  attention to the preparations for dinner, so that he lingered a good deal about
                  the huts, where that mundane affair was transacted. George Marston, being at an
                  age when the mere exertion of the muscles is pleasure, performed no small amount
                  of rowing, and sometimes persuaded Mr. Aldis to help him; but that gentleman found
                  the exercise bad for his hands, his nerves, and his scrupulous delicacy of
                  costume. He preferred attending his sister and Miss Grove, who frequently
                  became—so to speak—a little weary of the grave pursuits of the House of Industry,
                  and planted themselves in a narrow woody dell hard by, where they devotedly worked
                  cushions, knit tidies, or braided slippers, while Mr. Aldis read poetry to them,
                  original and selected.</p>
               <p>It is strange what a home feeling springs up under such circumstances; how a
                  thousand pleasant domestic habits grow into the day's doings, supplying the place
                  of novelty, incident and enterprise. Nature is ever ready to hint to us where to
                  find the sweetest and most constant pleasures, as soon as we can be persuaded to
                  lay from our weary shoulders the burden of convention. This living on the island
                  and being driven to a multitude of expedients and inventions to supply
                  deficiencies, gave more pleasure to all, than the most elaborate provision of
                  comforts could have done, that left no room for personal exertion and ingenuity.
                  The ladies declared they were living their baby-house days over again, playing
                  dinner-and-tea-company; making one movable do the work of a dozen; and the rudest
                  fragment seem an article of furniture or decoration, all by the magic of
                  imagination.</p>
               <p>It was <q>
                     <l>Broken tea-cups, wisely kept for show—</l>
                  </q> in the true spirit of the poet. Fancy, with the reins on her neck, playing
                  the pleasantest antics imaginable, and nobody to point the reasonable finger, and
                  bring on a feeling of silliness and shame at the thought of being so easily
                  amused.</p>
               <p>This came, however; for there was one day a most unexpected and only half-welcome
                  irruption from Lavington—a party who, being on a summer tour, had
                     concluded,—<foreign xml:lang="FRA">apropos</foreign> to nothing—to make a visit
                  to their rusticating friends, and see how they and solitude were agreeing. There
                  was Miss Ingoldsby arranging a bouquet of wild flowers for the dinner table, in a
                  vase which had very much the look of a superannuated pitcher; Mrs. Whipple
                  preparing grasses for preservation with fingers none of the cleanest; Mrs. Marston
                  helping the tidy little maid of Mrs. Torbet to shell a great basket of fresh peas;
                  all the young people scouring the rocks, and suffering all sorts of disfigurements
                  among the briers, in search of fruit for the dessert; Miss Berry ever so far out
                  in the water, dripping like a nereid, and her brother watching her from the beach
                  with some anxiety, under shelter of an enormous umbrella. Mr. Ingoldsby alone
                  retained some pretension to gentility, for he sat on the shady side of the hut in
                  which his daughter was flitting<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7024-00000033"/> about,
                  his handkerchief on his head, occasionally looking in at the little window, of
                  what was facetiously termed the saloon, making remarks upon passing affairs in a
                     <foreign xml:lang="ITA">dolce far niente</foreign> sort of way, now exclaiming
                  at Miss Berry's occupation, now wondering when the young folks would return, now
                  asking some fatherly question about the dinner arrangements, which were ordinarily
                  not a little modified, perhaps benefited, by the care he had learned to feel about
                  such things, as he said, during a long period of widowhood.</p>
               <p>Upon our party, thus primitively and carelessly disposed, down came a whole
                  carriage-load of gay, idle, fashionable travellers, full of questions and wonders,
                  and not a little inclined to quiz the simplicity which could enjoy a rusticity so
                  absolute. And we dare not aver that the philosophy of our friends was wholly
                  unruffled, when the new-comers examined into their daily occupations and
                  amusements, and could not hide their surprise that that was all! "Is it possible
                  you can prefer this to a good hotel?"</p>
               <p>Happy he who cannot be tempted to try his happiness by another's standard!</p>
               <p>The younger members came in, like the Miss Flamboroughs, "all blowsed and red with
                  walking," and wanted to run away, but there was no hiding-place but the other but,
                  with its cooking-stove and seething dinner. So they were obliged to show their
                  fragmentary selves, with whom the briers had made sad havoc. Mr. and Mrs. Sheldon
                  presented a tolerably decent figure, for they had been reading in some cunning
                  arbor in the woods, not so far off but they could hear the fresh and highpitched
                  voices of the visitors, and now descended, cool as possible, to assist in doing
                  the honors. Mr. Ingoldsby's great solicitude was about the dinner; but the
                  housewifely thought of Mrs. Torbet had foreseen the difficulty, and she was
                  already packing into the boat sundry good things which her time of respite had
                  enabled her to prepare. So there was no lack, either of eatables or appetite; and
                  the feast, though spread when the sun had not long passed the meridian, was full
                  of relish and hilarity, all little embarrassments forgotten.</p>
               <p>Every body who felt at home was now anxious to do the honors, for the guests'
                  enjoyment of the rural dinner had somewhat modified the distrust with which they
                  were first received. Each point of view, every lovely woody dell, all the seaward
                  caves, were visited in turn, for the bounds were narrow, and seemed still smaller
                  when exhibited for admiration.</p>
               <p>"I don't know how it is that we are so happy here," said Miss Ingoldsby,
                  apologetically, "unless it is that mankind has, after all; a good deal of taste
                  left for savagery. I confess this place would lose great part of its charm for me
                  if it were habitually occupied by parties of pleasure. I love its freshness, its
                  rudeness, the mark of nature's fingers every where. I would not have it 'improved'
                  for the world.</p>

               <p>"You are quite poetical, I declare!" said one of the ladies.</p>
               <p>"We came here on purpose," Mr. Berry replied; "and Miss Ingoldsby is trying hard
                  not to be ashamed of it while you are here."</p>
               <p>"O, it must be perfectly delightful," said the lady, suppressing a yawn. "I quite
                  envy you!"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Whipple was voluble in praise of the whole affair, for<pb n="66-67"
                     xml:id="VAC7024-00000034"/> she had no idea of letting any one suppose she was
                  tired of it. She had never been so happy in her life, she said.</p>
               <p>"Miss Ingoldsby is trying to win Milton's praise— <q>

               <p>Miss Berry had by this time reached the shore, and perceived herself to be the
                  observed of all observers. The great straw hat could not conceal her blushes, but
                  she soon found her self-possession, and stood quietly while the little maid wrung
                  the water from her skirts.</p>
               <p>"You see how hard we work for amusement," she said.</p>
               <p>"Why don't you confess the truth," said her brother, laughing,—"that we came here
                  on purpose that we might be foolish without being ridiculous? All winter long the
                  town compels a pretence of wisdom, or its counterfeit, gravity; and if we go into
                  the fashionable country, the necessity continues. Here we have leave to air our
                  nonsense and cultivate our whims."</p>
               <p>"There must be plenty of time to live the 'inner life' here," said a gentleman of

               <p>"We are not so much abstracted as you might suppose," Mr. Berry replied; "we are
                  getting acquainted with common things—we are looking down into the machinery of
                  life—drawing sage conclusions as to the working of that machinery—studying
                  humanity in the abstract, as it were."</p>
               <p>"Precious little humanity you can see here, I should think!" said Mr.
                  Bradhurst.</p>
               <p>"What we do see is genuine; and besides, we see a good deal that is not here. You
                  do not know the advantage that we have for studying you all at a distance; how
                  philosophically we scan your motions and spy out the secret of your pursuits. The
                  wise sayings we have uttered on human life and action and the emptiness of worldly
                  pursuits, would fill a respectable volume."</p>
               <p>"I wish you would write them down, that we may quote them to you next winter, when
                  you are as deeply immersed as ourselves—all the more deeply for the
                  self-complacency you are gathering now, which will leave you more vulnerable than
                  ever. We'd 'bring your proverbs to confute your life."</p>
               <p>"Like the rest of the world, we shall be so content with the wise things we have
                  said, that we can easily console ourselves for the inconsistency of our doings.
                  Besides, we have only to adopt the popular philosophy, which teaches that our
                  actions are of small moment provided our sentiments be noble."</p>
               <p>"On that plan," said Mr. Bradhurst, "I do not see but you may lay up a large
                  amount of virtue here, and have the privilege of drawing from your stock for a
                  long time after. At any rate, I hope you will write the book. I should be
                  delighted to see your sifting of these conventional ideas, to which we are all so
                  enslaved. One must have studied life from various standpoints, to do the thing
                  well."</p>
               <p>"We have something of the kind in contemplation," said Miss Ingoldsby, "though
                  whether it will be as wise a book as you propose is not yet settled."</p>
               <p>"Let it be a picture of fashionable life, by all means," said Mr. Bradhurst, "with
                  grave saws on the danger of wealth, and recommendations to rural life and
                  simplicity. Be sure you end by making your heroine become a member of several
                  charitable societies."</p>
               <p>"If I do, I shall make her say very wise things on the advantages of combined
                  effort—"</p>
               <p>"I dare say! Ladies are never at a loss for ingenious reasons to justify what they
                  choose to do."</p>
               <p>"Be sure," said Mr. Ingoldsby, "to let her grow so indifferent to the things of
                  this life as never to know what's for dinner until she sees it on the table."</p>
               <p>"Ah, papa," said Elinor, "that is a stroke at my poor housekeeping."</p>
               <p>"All literary ladies are alike," said her father, "and the heroines they draw are
                  like themselves, not very practical!"</p>
               <p>"I wish you would write a novel, father," said Miss Ingoldsby; "I should like to
                  see your ideal women!"</p>
               <p>"It would be a family portrait, I suspect," said Mr. Bradhurst, archly.</p>

               <p>This visit was not entirely without results, for the random talk it brought

                  must also be conceded that good ideas are sometimes suggested in joke, that would
                  never have been broached seriously. Mr. Bradhurst's hint of a book containing such
                  views of fashionable life as would be likely to present themselves to a ruralizing
                  party, who could be cheaply wise while looking at the world from a distance, did
                  not slide off at once amid the other <foreign xml:lang="FRA">badinage</foreign> of
                  the hour. Several of the party mused upon it, and felt that the Island, with its
                  exciting yet quiet life, and perfect <foreign xml:lang="FRA">abandon,</foreign>
                  was ust the place for writing, since it so much favored reflection and remark. <q>

               <p>Miss Ingoldsby repeated these lines in a soft, musing voice, as she looked from
                  the beach that evening, after the guests had departed, while the whole atmosphere
                  was aglow with those delicious sunset hues that seem like heaven let down upon a
                  peaceful, happy earth. Purple was the tint most felt, a purple that gave the
                  poet's "hyacinthine flow" to the dark locks of the speaker; but the fires had not
                  all faded, for a light as of ruddy gold was on her cheek, and on her whole figure,
                  as she stood, her light scarf fluttering in the rising wind of sunset.</p>
               <p>"Unhappily for your quotation," said Mrs. Marston, "you cannot see the sun from
                  here.</p>
               <p>"How literal you are, Mrs. Marston! I saw the sun when I repeated the verses. Are
                  one's bodily eyes all? When a poet suggests a picture, I do not care to compare
                  items."</p>
               <p>"Imagination makes the best <foreign xml:lang="FRA">clairvoyants,</foreign>" said
                  Mr. Berry. "Miss Ingoldsby is an excellent sleep-waker. A 'world beyond the visual
                  scope' is always open to her, while we, poor outsiders, are straining our eyes and
                  wits after the actual."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Mr. Berry, though I do not quite know whether you are in jest or
                  earnest. The impressions left on my mind by beauty of any kind, are not, I am
                  conscious, as defined and accurate as they should be, and I have an instinctive
                  fear of examining and attempting to regulate them, lest they evaporate in the
                  process."</p>
               <p>"I was not jesting—you are quite right—why should you analyze? Leave that to the
                  critics. Let them pick—cater—while you enjoy. It is not every thing that will bear
                  pulling to pieces; a cobweb is annihilated in the process, yet a cobweb, all
                  rainbowed over with sun and dew, is very beautiful. If one should attempt to
                  demonstrate the beauty of one of those changeable silks that you ladies are so
                  fond of, by drawing out the threads to show how the effect is produced, what would
                  become of the lustre and harmony? There is no very close analogy between the
                  aspect of earth and sky at this hour and the beauty of the human countenance; yet
                  I never see a rich evening, like this, close in after a brilliant day, without
                  thinking of the contrast between a laughing blonde and the dark splendor of
                  southern beauty, which seems to have absorbed the sunshine that the other
                  reflects."</p>
               <p>"A scene like this," pursued Miss Ingoldsby, "excites emotion, and such emotion is
                  so much better expressed in poetry than in prose, that I am content to seize on
                  the first lines which<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7024-00000037"/> come naturally to
                  my thoughts, even though to another they may seem hardly descriptive."</p>
               <p>"Their presenting themselves is proof that they <emph>are</emph> descriptive,"
                  said Mr. Berry. "The poet thought little of items. One who knows, tells us how
                  such things are prompted: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">

                        <l>The spectacle sensation, soul and form,</l>
                        <l>All melted into him: they swallowed up</l>
                        <l>His animal being: in them he did live,</l>
                        <l>And by them he did live; they were his life.</l>
                        <l>In such access of mind, in such high hour</l>
                        <l>Of visitation from the living God,</l>
                        <l>Thought was not: in enjoyment it expired.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> Why not use them in an equally liberal spirit?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, Mr. Berry," said Mrs. Marston, "your armory is so well furnished with
                  poetical reasons for whatever you choose to support, that it is vain to contend
                  with you. We must try to see the sun where he is not, when you and Miss Ingoldsby
                  will it so."</p>
               <p>"You will lose nothing by at least feeling him where he is not," said Mr. Berry.
                  "What a delicious haze is about us now! It is as if the air were filled with
                  powdered gold."</p>
               <p>"Yes—like the Dantzic brandy that John Gray gave us one day," said Henry Marston,
                  who had been amusing himself by switching up little wreaths of dry sea-weed, with
                  a cane, which habitually furnished a large part of his occupation when he was not
                  fishing. "I never in my life saw any thing so beautiful as that brandy! It was
                  full of little bits of gold leaf, that moved about as if they were alive."</p>
               <p>Every body laughed at this odd association of sunset with a rich liqueur, but it
                  was not, after all, a very unnatural one. Deliciousness of any kind is akin to
                  deliciousness of every kind. Perhaps each one of the company had, at the moment,
                  in the secret recesses of thought, some association with the scene, which, if
                  told, would have seemed hardly more directly connected with it than Henry
                  Marston's. But the boy, careless of reputation and accustomed to sympathy, blurted
                  out his rough thought, while men and women, long subjected to the social world,
                  hid theirs, instinctively.</p>
               <p>A pause ensued—for convention, which forces us to be silent, can hardly force us
                  to talk, when the soul has flown off, with wings just snatched from memory, to
                  regions whither no common companions can follow. The air was darkening, and that
                  chill coming which seems all the chillier for the glow of the past hour. The
                  far-off line where heaven and ocean leaned one against the other was nearly lost
                  in the blending color of the two, and a silver gleam danced over the black waves
                  in the middle distance. Enough of sunset tone, however, lingered in the air, to
                  prolong the enchantment of the scene; and the stars flashed out, at first one by
                  one, afterwards in quicker succession, and then in troops, as if there was a
                  festival in heaven, the outward signs of which were vouchsafed to mortal eyes.</p>
               <p>"Do you know why the planet Venus is so beautiful to us?" said Mr. Aldis, who was
                  generally suspected of studying earthly stars with much more devotion than
                  heavenly ones.</p>
               <p>Most of the party took the question for a conundrum, and sundry desperate and some
                  gallant guesses were hazarded.</p>
               <p>"Oh no—but really—there is a reason. It is because she is so ugly on a nearer
                  view."</p>
               <p>"Pray who has seen her nearer?" said Mrs. Marston, always disposed to be
                  literal.</p>
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7024-00000038"/>
               <p>"Astronomy, ma'am," said Mr. Aldis, meekly. "It is understood—seen, indeed, as
                  well as if one were poised on the point of one of our moon's horns, with a
                  boundless privilege of examination,—that Venus is a mass of barren and
                  cloud-capped mountains, which reflect every ray of the sun. A soft, green, arable
                  surface would make a shabby evening star for us."</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Vive la laideur!</foreign>" said Miss Ingoldsby.</p>
               <p>"It is positively the only instance I ever knew in which ugliness was an
                  advantage," said the gallant Aldis, with a look of general application, meant to
                  include all the ladies. He had been in the habit of communicating this tid-bit of
                  astronomic information to his female friends, with an express reference to the
                  nice things it gave him occasion to say.</p>
               <p>"You cannot deny that beauty is sometimes a disadvantage," said Mrs. Marston.</p>
               <p>"Oh, my dear madam," said Mr. Aldis, discomfitted at being thus pushed from the
                  pinnacle whence he meant to have dispensed a shower of pretty compliments, "what a
                  sentiment! Beauty a disadvantage!"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Mrs. Marston, in her quiet way, "unless coquetry is commendable.
                  Beauty certainly makes a great many coquettes."</p>
               <p>"Do you think so!" exclaimed Miss Berry; "I must say I have fancied that security
                  of pleasing preserved some pretty women from those unhandsome efforts to attract
                  interest which constitute coquetry. Certainly some of the plainest women I have
                  known have been among the vainest."</p>
               <p>"Unless we believe beauty to be the result of mere accident," observed Mr. Berry,
                  "we have a right to expect good qualities where we find it, though Nature's
                  fitnesses may in all cases be marred, in a great degree, by untoward
                  circumstances. I intuitively look for goodness where I see beauty."</p>
               <p>"That is rather a hard doctrine for us plain people," said Mrs. Whipple.</p>
               <p>"I hardly know any plain people," replied Mr. Berry, not taking the bait; "for the
                  darkest complexion, the most oblique nose, the worst marking with small-pox, does
                  not make a face ugly for me. I can discern the original beauty through all those.
                  It is only when the structure of the face is bad that I find it absolutely devoid
                  of beauty, and behind such faces I confess I never look for goodness, though
                  culture and grace may do much."</p>
               <p>"I heard a painter say once," said Mrs. Whipple, "that he had never been able to
                  transfer to canvas the beauty he saw in the plainest face, although to ordinary
                  apprehension some of these faces were ugly enough, and he was accused of
                  'flattering' them."</p>
               <p>"There must be some truth in the old proverb— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>Beauty lies</l>

                     </lg>
                  </q> said Mr. Ingoldsby.</p>
               <p>"So much," said Mr. Berry, "that I believe if a dozen women, chosen
                  indiscriminately, were passed in review before twice as many men, every one of
                  them would find an admirer—that is, one who would pronounce her handsomer than the
                  rest."</p>
               <p>"I see you are determined to console us, Mr. Berry," said Mrs. Marston, laughing;
                  "you found your first observations were getting you into trouble, and you are
                  adroitly drawing off."</p>
               <p>"On the contrary," he replied, "It is only want of space for amplification that
                  makes me seem to hold untenable opinions<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7024-00000039"/>
                  with regard to beauty. One does not want to seem a preacher, under the light of an
                  evening like this."</p>
               <p>"Why not take your subject into our book?" said Miss Ingoldsby; "there would be
                  ample space for your 'opinions,' odd as they may be."</p>
               <p>"Agreed! but we are all to help—"</p>
               <p>"Oh yes—and then we can all put in our saws—"</p>
               <p>"Any thing but augers," said Mr. Ingoldsby.</p>
               <p>Everybody laughed at this sally of the old gentleman, but as the party returned
                  home in the boat that evening, the book was further discussed, and, in spite of
                  modest disclaimers, fairly planned and agreed upon. The rotation of authorship was
                  to be decided by lot; each chapter to be read aloud in full conclave, and accepted
                  or rejected by candid vote, every body promising not to be offended. Any amount of
                  private consultation was admissible, and no digression to be complained of; the
                  House of Industry to be given up for a certain number of hours every morning to
                  the writer of the day.</p>
               <p>"We shall find Mrs. Shelton out, now," said Mr. Berry; "she cannot keep herself
                  any longer so cunningly behind the veil of silence."</p>
               <p>The fair Egeria blushed, and said she feared she should make a poor figure as a
                  writer, but no one believed this, for she had the air of one on whom nothing was
                  lost; one of those who <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">

                        <l>No petty customs or appearances,</l>
                        <l>But think what others only dream about;</l>
                        <l>And say what others dare but think; and do</l>

                        <l>As if she never school'd within her breast</l>
                        <l>One thought or feeling, but gave holiday</l>
                        <l>To all.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> And yet we must not let the poet betray us into giving an idea that she was
                  bold, or less than exquisitely feminine. The world is so unused to candor in
                  women, that it almost demands disguise; and to be true in speech, however gently,
                  stamps a woman an Amazon, in some apprehensions. Not so with our friend Shelton,
                  who loved this trait in Egeria, and met it well by equal truthfulness, devoted as
                  he was. This probably accounted for the fact that they were never tired of being
                  together, and talked but little with other people. They promised to try a chapter
                  between them, and Mr. Berry slyly advised them to let it be one of their
                  three-hour woodland talks.</p>
               <p>That very evening the lots were drawn, and the first chapter fell to the share of
                  Mr. Berry, just as every body hoped it would.</p>
               <p>"Now don't be too hard upon us, Mr. Berry," said the ladies; "your first chapter
                  will of course be the key of the whole. Be merciful—don't cut out too much work
                  for us! If you plan a story, do not sketch out too many characters for us to fill
                  in;—if an essay, let it be a light one, not too learned—"</p>
               <p>"If I understand rightly," said the pioneer, "all we want is some slight web, into
                  which our various sentiments, called into livelier life by this fostering shade
                  and sunshine, may be woven, for our delectation in after time, and in memory of
                  our summer sojourn. This is all, isn't it? I am not sure but our circumstances are
                  better suited to thinking than to writing down our thoughts. Cumberland said any
                  beauty of outward objects about his study distracted his attention and
                  impoverished his<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7024-00000040"/> fancy; he loved best to
                  write with a dead brick wall before him."</p>
               <p>"Oh the cave—the House of Industry! that is the very place! nothing but sky and
                  ocean before you, and the vanishing line so far off that there seems no barrier
                  between you and the infinite. One's thoughts will come naturally and flow smoothly
                  there, untangled with conventions—untinged with prejudices. O, we shall do great
                  things, I foresee!"</p>
               <p>So spake Miss Ingoldsby, the golden current of whose spirits was already quickened
                  by the new plan, and reflected a thousand pleasant, dancing fancies. She cheered
                  on her kind bachelor-friend to his work, and ushered him, in laughing state, to
                  the House of Industry, which she had new decked for the occasion, adding great
                  branches of evergreen for more shade, and a carpet, "lest the chill of the
                  sand-floor should strike to the writer's brain," she said. Over the little table
                  was pinned a scroll, on which figured this inscription, in antique character: <q>

                  to my dreams, such as they may be."</p>
               <p>The next evening but one—in the old farm-parlor, after the party had returned from
                  the island,—a solemn session was held upon the first chapter of the new book, the
                  reading of which was intrusted to Miss Ingoldsby, as the blushful modesty of the
                  writer forbade his giving it voice himself.</p>
               <p>"This I suppose is to be called the <emph>seedling chapter,</emph>" said the
                  reader.</p>
               <p>"Pray don't call it the preface! Prefaces are so dull!" exclaimed Miss Grove, and
                  some of the others.</p>
               <p>Mr. Berry waited very patiently till all had spoken, and then said, "Any thing you
                  like, but wait till it is accepted before you name it."</p>
               <p>Miss Ingoldsby began with the motto, from Spenser's Hymn to Beauty, which we
                  should love to quote entire, for its pith and suggestiveness: <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">

                        <l>Of pure complexions that shall quickly fade</l>

               <p>"Monstrous long motto," said Mr. Ingoldsby.</p>
               <p>"It contains the sense of the chapter," replied the author.</p>
               <p>"Ah! that indeed!" said the old gentleman, dryly.</p>
               <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7024-00000041"/>
               <p>"Three gentlemen were discussing—as gentlemen sometimes will—the chances of
                  happiness in matrimony, and the various circumstances, cautions, errors and
                  delusions, which influence or affect those chances.</p>
               <p>"Nothing would tempt me to marry a beauty," said one.</p>
               <p>"Why not?" inquired another. "If you had said that nothing would tempt you to
                  marry <emph>for</emph> beauty, I could have said amen; but surely beauty could be
                  no objection."</p>
               <p>"For my part," said the third, "although I would not marry for beauty, I certainly
                  would never marry without it."</p>
               <p>Here were three friends, who agreed on most points, wholly at variance on that
                  important one, the choice of a wife. The first who spoke had passed thirty, and
                  began to look on marriage as a terrible risk; something on which a man must beware
                  of trusting his fancy; a matter with which imagination must have nothing to do. He
                  thought married happiness, if found at all, must be found mathematically—each step
                  tried and proved, and the whole brought to irrefragable demonstration. It was
                  because this care was not taken, he said, that there are so many unhappy matches
                  in the world.</p>
               <p>Beauty, therefore, as it proves nothing, he considered a useless, or even a
                  pernicious element in the calculation. "One who wishes to steer by the compass
                  dreads all distracting forces. A man can judge more coolly of a woman's character
                  if there be no charms of face to warp his appreciation. Sweet smiles may seem
                  amiable; a fair, smooth brow, gentle; dimpled cheeks, cheerful and good-humored.
                  Time will spoil these things, and then what remains? It is better to build one's
                  hopes on solid foundations—to love on rational principles.</p>
               <p>How many evils would the adoption of this plan have prevented!"</p>
               <p>Somebody once said, "the progress of science gives us reason to hope that in time
                  physicians will be able to ascertain and cure the diseases of the human frame,
                  with as much ease and accuracy as the watchmaker discovers and regulates the
                  aberrations of a time-piece." A comfortable prophecy, but unhappily spoiled by a
                  commentator, who remarks that when the progress of science enables the watchmaker
                  to mend a watch <emph>while it is going,</emph> we may indeed hope to see the type
                  realized in human affairs. It is not difficult to apply this citation to the
                  opinion of our bachelor friend on matrimony.</p>
               <p>The second speaker, still lingering in the fringes of the twenties, could not
                  decide so philosophically as to the unimportance of that which has, in a thousand
                  ways and in all ages of the world, vindicated its right to be considered as one of
                  the great moving forces of life. His own heart had told him that one might as well
                  reason against its pulsations, or attempt to force back the blood which it sends
                  rushing to the cheek at the very sight of a beautiful face, as contemn the value
                  or underrate the power of personal loveliness. Thus sensible of its influence, he
                  was willing to assign beauty its due weight in that great balance on which so much
                  of life's hope depends, while he prudently decided that it ought not to bribe
                  Fancy to turn the scale. Wise young man! <q>
                     <l>So young so wise they say do ne'er live long.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The third speaker had no air of rashness further than was implied in the remark we
                  have quoted. Not marry without beauty! He had seen almost thirty years, and as
                  much of life,<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7024-00000042"/> in a quiet way, as men
                  generally see in that time; and possessed, among his friends, a reputation for
                  unusual steadiness of character.</p>
               <p>"Why, Ellis," said the first speaker, "that is the last sentiment I should have
                  expected from you! Is it possible you consider beauty a matter of such
                  moment?"</p>
               <p>"How can I consider it otherwise? I place it only where Providence has placed it.
                  Beauty is necessary to my happiness; I was born to love it."</p>
               <p>"Yes—beauty in general—not mere human beauty, however."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Mere</emph> human beauty! What an expression! Can one see beauty in stars
                  or flowers who does not see it a thousand-fold in the human countenance and
                  figure?"</p>
               <p>"O I grant you—a beautiful face is very charming, but we were talking of marriage,
                  which is a matter to be settled for life. If beauty enter into the calculation, a
                  man may be but poorly off after it is gone, as it soon must be. Except as a sign
                  of the qualities which beauty ought to represent, I care little for it—in the
                  choice of a wife, I mean."</p>
               <p>"You grant me all I ask. It is as a sign that I consider it essential, and
                  lasting, too. True beauty cannot fade."</p>
               <p>"Come, come—you are wandering from the point—leading us off from the absurdity of
                  your looking upon beauty as essential in a wife, by transferring the assertion to
                  the beauty which is the result of inward excellence. On that kind we have no
                  dispute with you."</p>
               <p>"But you are mistaken if you suppose that my beauty is to be merely symbolical. I
                  insist on the outward graces of clear complexion, bright eyes, harmonious
                  features, and a graceful person. No hard-featured, angular, shrill-voiced angel
                  would do for me. Such must find mates in men like you, who scorn the aid of
                  imagination. I look upon a truly beautiful face as a sort of transparency, made to
                  glow and dazzle by the light behind it. If the picture be opaque, some one else
                  may peep and pry after the lamp—I cannot."</p>
               <p>"It is plain to see that you do not believe in the goodness of ugly girls."</p>
               <p>"In their goodness, yes—in their charmingness, no. If my sister were very plain my
                  affection for her would be none the less, for in that case love began before
                  criticism awoke. With regard to any other woman it is different. There can be no
                  love without some degree of fascination, and with me there is no fascination
                  without beauty."</p>
               <p>"It is happy for women that all men are not of your mind. As to myself, for
                  instance, intellect is much more apt to endanger my liberty than mere beauty."</p>
               <p>"What—intellect alone! without feminine graces—without evidence of heart
                  qualities! Would you have your wife chop logic with you—think of convincing while
                  you think of dining—talk blue to your visitors—be on the watch for her rights
                  rather than her duties—harden herself by theorizing and criticising! Give me a
                  woman to whom her husband and her household are of the first importance, and who
                  is able by her sweet domestic graces, to console, to soften—" Mr. Ellis stopped,
                  nearly out of breath with his own vehemence.</p>
               <p>"Why, really," said his cooler friend, "I had no idea you had studied this matter
                  so deeply, or felt so warm an interest in it. Has not your theory a practical
                  basis—is there not some<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7024-00000043"/> fair original of
                  this fine picture?—or is your imagination the sole artist?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Ellis blushed a little, and did not reply directly. "My notions," said he,
                  "date from as far back as I have thought of the subject at all. Woman seems to me
                  to have a special office in the world—to be the chief harmonizer, consoler and
                  beautifier of human existence; to be an angel of peace and mercy; to humble
                  herself that she may be exalted, to obey that she may rule; endowed with a rare
                  instinct of right, which fits her for interposing between man's passions and his
                  actions, to be an impartial spectator and judge of the struggle of life, and a
                  guard against its worst temptations."</p>
               <p>"And is beauty essential to all this?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly; for she must first win man's heart, and get the great power of
                  imagination on her side. Without this, she can be but as man to man. Her
                  friendship with him, be it ever so sincere and steady, will be subject to the
                  dangers of dispute and rivalry. Esteem there may be, but esteem does not exclude
                  the pride and self-reservation which so limit and chill ordinary friendship."</p>
               <p>"You would not have love without friendship?"</p>
               <p>"No—but no sooner friendship without love."</p>
               <p>"What do you think of this description of friendship? I am not sure but I may
                  trace back some of my notions to it: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">

                  </q> "Think of it? that it is love to be sure! the more as the description of the

                     </lg>
                  </q> I think I could be quite content with such friendship and such a friend."</p>
               <p>"But there is not a word about beauty!"</p>
               <p>"That is presupposed. Don't you see that no mere mortal could actually fulfil all
                  these dreams, and that in order that they may be enjoyed there must first be some
                  illusion? Illusion there must be, and some find it in wealth, some in position,
                  some in accidental circumstances; you, it seems, in intellect, which dazzles and
                  astonishes—"</p>
               <p>"There is no illusion about intellect."</p>
               <p>"You might as well say there is no illusion about wealth—that a man who marries a
                  rich wife for her money, gets all that he expected. It is not so. Not supposing
                  any decidedly mercenary motive, there is yet a charm about the appliances of
                  wealth which often makes young men sincerely think they are in love, when in truth
                  the same girl without money would never attract them for a moment. So with your
                  intellectual flame—the pleasure you find in her brilliancy leads you to fancy that
                  all is in unison with this charm. Now I hold that my illusion is not only the most
                  gracious but the most natural and safe, for beauty is, after all, and even
                  according to your chilly view, a symbol, which wealth is not, nor position, nor
                  yet your idol, intellect."</p>
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7024-00000044"/>
               <p>"What did the poet mean by 'something than beauty dearer?' Is it not what we can
                  all discern in the faces of those we love?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly—in the faces of those we already love. If my beloved—provided I had
                  one—were to lose her face by the small-pox, I think—I am sure—I could love on,
                  perhaps all the more tenderly for a touch of pity. And so with the changes wrought
                  by time—the original image would maintain its place, and overpower, with its very
                  shadow, all the creeping unseemliness and sad changes of years."</p>
               <p>"It seems to me that pity may be an element of love; and if so, why not the pity
                  which one feels for a very plain woman?"</p>
               <p>"I think pity a very unsafe foundation. If the cause be lasting, one's life must
                  be permanently the sadder; if it be temporary, there is danger that all charm may
                  depart with it. As to loving a plain woman through pity, it would certainly be
                  very generous, but rather dangerous; unless one had thoroughly tried the temper
                  and durability of one's generosity before, for such exalted states do not last.
                  Besides, it would be very foolish in you to pick out, for your devotion, a woman
                  who was plain to you, since there might very likely be men to whom she was not
                  plain, and who would therefore have a more natural and certain affinity with
                  her."</p>
               <p>"O, then, your beauty is not altogether a thing of rule—something to be defined
                  and inventoried, tested and decided upon without appeal! You count affinity for
                  something—"</p>
               <p>"For much, for it seems to be essential to that mysterious thing which we call
                  fascination, in these cases."</p>
               <p>"If this affinity and this fascination are so powerful, it is strange there are so
                  many unhappy marriages."</p>
               <p>"It is because men—and women too—set out with the idea that fascination is just
                  the thing they must resist; that marriage, being a serious matter—as it certainly
                  is, and something more terrible, even—must be undertaken like the transfer of an
                  estate, with all the forms of law—no poetry—no trust—no glory—no romance. They put
                  the whole thing into the form of a problem, and when all the <emph>ifs</emph> are
                  answered properly, go on in the comfortable conviction that they have acted
                  wisely, when in truth they have only been completing arrangements for passing life
                  in a sort of minor key—the joy-chords renounced—the running bass of care and
                  sorrow certain, while the heart-cheering majors and soaring lark-trills which
                  belong to love are out of the question for ever."</p>
               <p>"I do not see but you would banish prudence altogether—"</p>
               <p>"Not at all—but I would keep it in its place, which is secondary, at best. I would
                  have prudence do the work of prudence, not the work of love. When I marry—if I
                  ever do marry—you will probably think me very imprudent. I shall not proceed
                  scientifically. I shall be disposed to apply to that subject what I remember
                  reading on a different one—'Logical processes cannot demonstrate every problem
                  worthy of our faith. The whole man must advance to the proof of a spiritual
                  problem, and he must test it by his totality of thought and feeling. Then faith in
                  a thing indemonstrable becomes a rational prolongation of reason.'"</p>
               <p>"You are more scientific than I, after all—at least you attempt to find a key
                  which shall unlock all mysteries—a spiritual <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >passe-partout.</foreign> After all, I dare say we do not differ essentially.
                  You must remember that all I said at the beginning was that I would not marry a
                  beauty. Now by a beauty<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7024-00000045"/> I mean something
                  very different from a handsome woman. A beauty is one whose outward loveliness is
                  the most striking thing about her—the thing first thought of and mentioned where
                  she is spoken of—her distinction, in short. It must require an amount of
                  excellence almost past hoping for, to bear this without serious injury to the
                  character. Such a woman is subject to the insidious influence not only of direct
                  and obvious praise,—against which we can imagine a rare specimen of the sex to be
                  on her guard,—but of the continual and involuntary flattery of every eye she
                  meets—a far subtler and more intoxicating incense, which must have intense
                  operation, for good or evil—and who questions which?—on the habits of the mind. I
                  should fancy that in this, as in other cases, the more potent the stimulus and the
                  more fixed the habit, the more demoniac would be the irritability which must
                  result from its withdrawal. I should be sorry to be the husband of a decaying
                  beauty."</p>
               <p>"You have but a poor opinion of the sex, evidently; and you do not believe as I do
                  in the significance of beauty. Is it possible you can call that face beautiful
                  which has in it the expression of a mean, narrow, egotistic soul; a heart
                  untouched by generous affection—a mind wholly occupied by trifles?"</p>
               <p>"No—but a worshipper of beauty is liable to be so dazzled by the magic of colors
                  and lines, as not to perceive the real character of the entire expression."</p>
               <p>"I never saw a face in which character was not the first thing that struck me. The
                  human face is Heaven's title-page to the great book of mind, and it gives truly
                  the main topic, at least. And unlike other title-pages, it grows clearer and more
                  legible with age. It may require a practical or even a prophetic eye to read it
                  early; but day by day its letters deepen and increase in number, until at last it
                  becomes a tolerable table of contents."</p>
               <p>"You grow figurative. Yet there are hypocrites—"</p>
               <p>"True—but hypocrisy is written, too."</p>
               <p>"Swedenborg thinks that the face is but a marred, distorted, or imperfect
                  manifestation or expression of the soul, here; but that in the other life it
                  asserts its supremacy more fully, so that the body is compelled to conform without
                  reservation. This change will, however, be gradual, and hypocrites, true to their
                  habits, will be the last to undergo it in its completeness. When it is
                  accomplished, they are to be the most hideous in aspect of all sinners."</p>
               <p>"They are so now; but Swedenborg deserves the world's gratitude for the picture.
                  To be the ugliest man in eternity—what a destiny!"</p>
               <p>"Yes—for you lovers of beauty! After all, except as an expression of moral
                  qualities, beauty must be a matter of taste—subject to no rules—"</p>
               <p>"What says our oracle in 'Modern Painters?'—'Perfect taste is the faculty of
                  receiving the greatest possible pleasure from those material sources which are
                  attractive to our moral nature in its purity and perfection. Taste, properly so
                  called, is the instinctive and instant preferring of one material object to
                  another, without any obvious reason, except that it is proper to human nature in
                  its perfection to do so. All our moral feelings are so inwoven with our
                  intellectual powers, that we cannot affect the one without in some degree
                  addressing the other; and in all high ideas of beauty it is more than probable
                  that much of the pleasure depends on delicate and untraceable perceptions of
                  fitness, propriety and relation, which are purely<pb n="90-91"
                     xml:id="VAC7024-00000046"/> intellectual. But yet there is no immediate
                     <emph>exertion</emph> of the intellect; that is to say, if the person receiving
                  even the noblest ideas of simple beauty be asked <emph>why</emph> he likes the
                  object exciting them, he will not be able to give any distinct reason, nor to
                  trace in his mind any formed thought to which he can appeal as a source of
                  pleasure.'"</p>
               <p>"All that is very true; but I doubt whether the human face is included, since its
                  beauty is any thing but simple. The 'Howadji' thinks the perfection of all beauty
                  consists in balance—'as the most exquisite of summer days so breathes balm into a
                  vigorous and healthy body that the individual exists without corporeal
                  consciousness, yet is then most corporeally perfect. Beautiful balance, which is
                  the character of perfection in human character or nature, allows no prominent
                  points. Washington is undoubtedly always underrated in our judgment, because he
                  was so well proportioned; and the finest musical performance has such case and
                  quiet, and the colors and treatment of a fine picture give such propriety and
                  harmony, that we do not at once know how fine it is. It is the cutting of a razor
                  so sharply edged that we are not conscious of it. <emph>We have all seen the same
                     thing in beautiful faces.</emph> The most permanent and profound beauty did not
                  thrill us; but presently, like air to the lungs, it was a necessity of inner life,
                  while striking beauty is generally a disproportion, and, so far, a monstrosity and
                  a fault. Men who feel beauty most profoundly are often unable to recall the color
                  of eyes and hair, unless, as with artists, there is an involuntary technical
                  attention to those points. For beauty is a radiance that cannot be analyzed, and
                  which is not described when you call it rosy. Wanting any word which shall express
                  it, is not the highest beauty the synonym of balance?' Does this seem to you
                  just?"</p>
               <p>"I believe, in order fully to accept it, I should substitute 'harmony' for
                  'balance.' But I love the Howadji for saying that 'nothing in nature is purely
                  ornamental.' This thought hallows that insatiable thirst after beauty which the
                  prudent regard as a temptation and the narrow-minded as a sin. <q>
                     <l>We live by admiration, hope and love—</l>
                  </q> yet how large a portion of mankind endeavor to stille these impulses of
                  nature, and to close up, by sordid cares, every avenue provided by bounteous
                  Heaven for pure and exalting pleasures! We need not seek pleasure; it is enough to
                  fit ourselves to receive it. It is a flower whose odor the wise inhale in
                  perfection in the open air and hanging on its fresh stalk; plucked and crowded and
                  deprived of wholesome atmosphere, it brings pain and death to those who seek it
                  amiss. But shall we renounce its use? The pursuit of beauty <emph>may</emph> make
                  heartless egotists and sensualists, but it is none the less conducive, in natures
                  better tempered, to the highest virtue and religion."</p>
               <p>Here Davidson, the younger of our three friends, gave an unseemly yawn, to
                  signalize his recovery from a nap, the natural result of all this grave
                  discussion.</p>
               <p>"Where are you now?" he said; "who gives in? Has Ellis converted you,
                  Whitethorne?"</p>
               <p>"There was no need of conversion," said Mr. Whitethorne, quietly. "We think very
                  much alike in the main; but Ellis, having a personal interest in the matter, has
                  gone further into it than I have, and I chose to make him talk it out. I shall<pb
                     n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7024-00000047"/> watch very closely to see how his theory
                  answers in his own case."</p>
               <p>"On the other hand," said Ellis, "I shall remember our conversation when I call to
                  pay my respects to a very plain Mrs. Whitethorne. But I will not look hard at
                  you—that would be too savage."</p>
               <p>"I give you leave; the woman is not born yet that I shall marry."</p>
               <p>"O, then—you contemplate doing a very foolish thing some years hence? Very likely;
                  but don't say I led you into it."</p>
               <p>"You may both please yourselves with theorizing, if you will," said Davidson. "I
                  am no philosopher or metaphysician, but a very commonplace fellow, and shall
                  content myself with falling in love in the old-fashioned, headlong way. Here, in a

               <p>A dead pause followed the reading. Mr. Berry was tolerably philosophical, as
                  people having a due allowance of self-esteem are able to be in such cases; but we
                  cannot deny that he felt a little fidgety.</p>

               <p>"Most righteous judge—a sentence! come—prepare!" he exclaimed, misapplying
                  Shylock's words to his purpose. "Do not keep me hanging by the waist, but finish
                  me at once, mercifully."</p>
               <p>Nobody liked to speak first, but some one at length murmured—</p>
               <p>"Is it not rather grave?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—and a little formal?" said another—</p>
               <p>"Shouldn't you have described them a little, to give an interest?" was the third

               <p>"And the place where they met"—said Miss Grove, who read novels in the intervals
                  of her crewel doings—</p>
               <p>"What I most admire," said Miss Ingoldsby, "is the mercy Mr. Berry has shown to
                  those of us who are to follow, in not providing such entanglements at the outset
                  as might have proved terribly hampering to our genius in the unravelling. He has
                  contented himself with the suggestion of the simplest possible elements, and left
                  us to weave our own webs after our own fashion."</p>
               <p>But Miss Ingoldsby's commendation did not save the chapter. It was decided,
                     <foreign xml:lang="ITA">una voce,</foreign> to be too grave, and the author
                  withdrew it, promising heroically to take his chance anew, and try again, if the

               <p>The next trial resulted in a call upon Mrs. Marston, who declared that, with this
                  warning before her, she should take care to be frivolous enough, at least.</p>
               <p>"But remember what we said to Mr. Berry, and do not cut out too much work for your
                  successors," said one of the party.</p>
               <p>"I do not think my invention will overflow into any great variety of characters,"
                  said Mrs. Marston, laughing; "I am much more afraid of the sin of penuriousness. I
                  suppose, although Mr. Berry's chapter is condemned, I may make use of his
                  characters, if I please?"</p>
               <p>"O certainly!"—and Mr. Berry declared he should feel more than consoled for his
                  failure if his suggestions proved of use—which was probably the lady's benevolent
                  thought, for there was a lingering compunction in all hearts at the unceremonious
                  rejection of Mr. Berry's effort.</p>

                  <p>The bride was in her pearls—milk-white ones on her neck and arms, the gift of
                     love,—clear glittering ones dropping from her eyes, joy's counterfeit of
                     sorrow. All outward preparations were finished, but she felt as if the inner
                     were yet to begin—<pb n="96 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7024-00000049"/> so
                     strange did the present, for which the past had so long been laying the
                     foundation, seem to her surprised thoughts. The misty bridal veil hung across
                     the mirror, waiting the summons which must bring tears and fears and
                     flutterings to a point; but there was another veil—misty too, yet consciously
                     felt—over the mind of the young girl, usually so clear and careless. There are
                     moments which reveal us to ourselves—present our past like one unbroken
                     picture, and our future like a threat or a promise, the awful alternative to be
                     decided then and there. These moments are God-given, but how seldom are they so
                     regarded! We feel the compression from without more than the impulse from
                     within. "It is too late to think." Too late to think! It may be so with regard
                     to a jaunt into the country, when friends we have engaged are waiting; but for
                     a journey from which there is no return—is it ever too late?</p>
                  <p>"There is guidance for each of us, and by lowly listening we shall hear the
                     right word." But circumstances so fill our ears that we can hear nothing.</p>
                  <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>The clock on the mantel struck the half-hour. Bridesmaids flitted about, like
                     changing summer clouds in the rosy light of morning. The attendants were giving
                     the last, anxious glances at the bride:—sole thought of the hour—to see that no
                     delicate ordering of graces had been forgotten. There were deep consultations
                     as to whether it would be practicable for her to carry the wondrous gleaming
                     fan with the bouquet and handkerchief.</p>
                  <p>"Katherine, darling," whispered good Aunt Susan, "there are a few minutes yet;
                     send away all these giddy girls. I<figure/>
                     <pb n="97" xml:id="VAC7024-00000050"/> want to talk to you a little, dear. Sit
                     down by me on the sofa;" and she drew the ethereal white figure towards
                     her.</p>
                  <p>"Oh—dear Aunt—I can't possibly sit down!—it would tumble my dress so!" said
                     Katherine, through all her tears. The outward was too much for the inward.</p>
                  <p>A pang shot through the good heart of Aunt Susan. She had held fast her
                     simplicity of soul through all life's changes and temptations, and never could
                     learn to believe in or be prepared for any thing else in others. She half
                     perceived how deeply the prospect of a wealthy marriage, and the preparations
                     for it, which had made Katherine the single object of attention and effort for
                     some weeks, had already tinged the natural and happy thoughts of the young
                     girl. But she was all indulgence; her heart, quick as lightning, framed an
                     excuse for the seeming frivolity, and she yielded her point.</p>
                  <p>"Well, dear, we will stand, if you like it better"—but the change of position
                     quite disconcerted the little speech she had devised for the seemly
                     unburdenment of thoughts that would not be kept down.</p>
                  <p>"Katherine, darling," she said, repressing the impulse to put her arm round the
                     graceful waist now guarded with grandeurs, "all I wished to say to you was
                     that—that I hoped—that I was afraid—that—I wished you to be quite
                     certain—sure—that you love Mr. Ellis well enough—"</p>
                  <p>"Oh Aunt Susan! how <emph>can</emph> you! do you think—can you suppose—" and
                     the bride looked as indignant as truth and nature would let her; for Aunt Susan
                     had touched the tender place in her conscience,—the place she had found too
                     tender for her own handling.</p>
                  <p>"Have patience with me, my love, and have courage to look<pb n="98-99"
                        xml:id="VAC7024-00000051"/> at the truth, be it what it will. Have you ever
                     asked yourself the simple question—Do I so love Mr. Ellis that I would not only
                     prefer him to all other men if I were again free to choose, but that my
                     happiness would be seriously affected if this marriage were not to take place?
                     Try to put out of the question that you are engaged to him—that all is ready
                     for the marriage, that it would be so terrible to retreat! To marry under the
                     least delusion is far more terrible. Do try, my darling, to search your heart,
                     as you hope for happiness, your own or his. Just think of that noble, generous
                     creature waking up to the conviction that you had never truly loved him for
                     himself—that your true, real heart is not his—that you have been dazzled by
                     circumstances—deceived by your own love of all that is beautiful, that only
                     imagination is on his side—"</p>
                  <p>"Dear Aunt Susan, how can you talk so? What has put these thoughts into your
                     head? To be sure I love Mr. Ellis. You know how good he is—how kind—and how
                     devotedly he loves me. I am sure you don't think I love any body else?"</p>
                  <p>"No, indeed—or I should never have allowed Mr. Ellis to suppose you free. My
                     fears have no reference to any other attachment, but only to the depth and
                     fervor of this one. To speak plainly—as I can and must speak to you, my
                     dearest—Mr. Ellis is ten years older than yourself—his character is grave and
                     thoughtful—his tastes are sober—his ideas decided and somewhat strict. He is
                     excessively in love with you, and—he is rich. You know as well as I, my love,
                     that it was your beauty that first attracted him; but your many excellent
                     qualities have won over his whole heart, and a strong nature like his loves
                     once and always. What I fear is that you may be unconsciously deceiving
                     yourself and him into a belief that your attachment is of the same deep,
                     devoted, exclusive character as his, while you are perhaps more influenced than
                     you suspect—not more than is natural in a young girl frugally bred—by the
                     prospect of a desirable position in society, and a life of elegance and
                     indulgence. It is this that I hope and pray you will consider. Do—dear love!
                     Never mind consequences—I will take all that is possible upon myself Do not
                     mistake gratitude, pride, gratified vanity, even approbation and respect for
                     one of the best of men, for love. Dear Kate—life will not be all a play day—it
                     is not, even when we love ever so truly. Trials must come—trials of patience,
                     of temper, of fortitude, of truth. It will not be sufficient that your husband
                     loves you; you must love him, too, to make these things tolerable."</p>
                  <p>"I do, indeed! dear, dear, good Aunt Susan," said Katherine, throwing her arms
                     round her aunt's neck—but carefully, because of the lace on her sleeves;—"I do
                     love him—better than any one else in the world—except you—"and she spoke
                     sincerely and warmly, for Aunt Susan's allusion to Mr. Ellis's excellences had
                     brought him up before her imagination in a sort of glory.</p>
                  <p>"But you must love him <emph>more</emph> than you love me!" said Aunt Susan,
                     with a sigh which was not expressive of very full satisfaction. "Suppose I
                     should tell you, now, that Mr. Ellis had lost his fortune, and that you must
                     prepare to begin your married life in a small house and in a very economical
                     way—"</p>
                  <p>"What do you mean, dear Aunt Susan?" exclaimed Katherine, suddenly pale with
                     agitation.</p>
                  <p>Here was a sudden and loud rapping at the door.</p>
                  <p>"Mrs. Ashmore! Kate!"</p>
                  <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7024-00000052"/>
                  <p>"What <emph>do</emph> you mean—tell me, for pity's sake!" reiterated the bride,
                     never heeding the appointed summons.</p>
                  <p>"Only to ask you the simple question, my love—"</p>
                  <p>"But there is really no such thing? tell me—is there?"</p>
                  <p>"Katherine! Mrs. Ashmore! every one is waiting!" whispered somebody through the
                     keyhole. "Mr. Ellis is here—do come!"</p>
                  <p>Aunt Susan could not speak—she could hardly bear to part with her Katherine
                     thus;—she held her fast, as if that would do any good. Her maternal, her
                     virtuous, her holy instincts had taken the alarm—or rather the secret fears
                     which had beset her for weeks, had just then come to a crisis.</p>
                  <p>"There <emph>is</emph> no such thing, is there?" said Katherine, with quivering
                     lips—</p>
                  <p>"No, dear! no—"said poor Aunt Susan; and resigning the object of her care with
                     a secret prayer—a prayer of faith—she opened the door to the bevy of
                     bride-maidens, and a manly face that promised all that face can promise of
                     truth, honor, and generous love—</p>
                  <p>Love—healer of all ills—solver of all doubts—sad indeed is the bridal where
                     thou art wanting! At this one, of Katherine Fountain and Henry Ellis, Love
                     presided, indeed, but hardly with equal favor. To the bridegroom he gave all
                     his enchantments; and if the bride seemed less endowed, perhaps it was only
                     because of the greatness of the gifts on the other side. We would be far from
                     hinting that Katherine felt indifferent to the man she was to marry—one whose
                     merits commanded affection as well as respect; but only that for want of
                     greater insight and fuller appreciation, her attachment hardly equalled his
                     great deserts, and would scarcely have satisfied the delicate requirements
                     ments of his heart if he could have seen hers fully unveiled. Katherine was of
                     that shy and rather reserved character which leaves a great deal for the
                     imagination, and the imagination of a lover asks no better background for its
                     glowing pictures. Young, unformed, but of dazzling beauty, Katherine's very
                     want of cultivation had been converted into a charm for the accomplished man of
                     society. Disgusted with the flippant coldness of pseudo-cultivation, real
                     freshness of mind was of delicious promise to him, and the idea—not very
                     distinctly developed—of giving this ductile mind all it needed to bring forth
                     its latent power, had been a fascinating one to him, from his first
                     acquaintance with Katherine. On her part, the very sense of Ellis's superiority
                     had in some degree scared away freedom and warmth from her affection for him.
                     Where there is decided mental inequality, there may be respect, esteem,
                     gratitude, pride, willing dependence, perfect trust—but there can hardly be
                     love in its highest form.</p>
                  <p>But we have kept our bridal party too long waiting for the bride. The veil,
                     adjusted to the last degree of grace by skilful hands, gave the sole charm
                     lacking to her beauty, and with one more parting kiss to Aunt Susan, she passed
                     into the wavering cloud of bride-maidens, not without a trace on her brow of
                     the single anxious thought called up by the recent conversation.</p>
                  <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>Mrs. Marston's opening chapter met with more favor than Mr. Berry's had done.
                     The young ladies were delighted with the bride's beauty and with her marrying
                     rich. They only thought the book concluded as soon as begun. "What more<pb

                     interesting;" at least Miss Grove thought novels about married people were
                     always stupid.</p>
                  <p>Other objections there were—such as Mrs. Marston's not having indicated
                     distinctly enough the direction of the story, but this she said she purposely
                     left open for her successors, only a general agreement having been come to as
                     to its tone. The next lot fell upon Mrs. Shelton, who consented to serve only
                     on condition that she should be allowed to seek help from her husband. This, of
                     course, was readily granted by the high contracting powers, and the result was
                     the chapter that follows:</p>

                     searching, unwavering, undeceivable eyes upon our doings toward them! Was not
                     the uncle of the Babes in the Wood the only cruel guardian uncle that ever
                     lived?</p>
                  <p>Not such, at least, were Uncle and Aunt Ashmore, to whose care Katherine
                     Fountain and her baby-brother were left when their mother died, and their
                     father became something worse than dead. The busy world thought the good couple
                     had children enough of their own, and that their means were none too wide for
                     their needs. But with hearts that could hold the world, their house had
                     necessarily an elastic virtue too, and both found plenty of room for the two
                     poor, little, desolate pretty creatures, whose unconsciously appealing looks
                     would have unlocked more obstinate doors. The boy was almost an infant in arms;
                     Katherine a year or two older. Aunt Susan had two of nearly their age—a
                     circumstance which she insisted made it all the more convenient to attend to
                     the new-comers. So the little ones grew up together, Uncle Ashmore never
                     prospering extravagantly, but satisfied with finding himself no worse off at
                     the end of the year than at the beginning. Frugality and liberality went hand
                     in hand in the establishment, as they ought oftener to go. <q>

                     poverty," said Uncle Ashmore; and his family were taught to think like him, at
                     the expense of many a pleasant indulgence that their neighbors boasted.</p>
                  <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7024-00000054"/>
                  <p>"Look at what we have, and not at what we haven't," was another of his favorite
                     sentences—hard precept, but benign. The philosopher who could say, "How many
                     things are here that I do not want!" has few disciples in any age—perhaps fewer
                     in ours than any. Temptations to expense are the most insidious in the world;
                     taste seems to sanctify some of them, and for the rest we appeal to nature or
                     necessity. In this particular, the two young Fountains proved, as they grew up,
                     like eaglets in a dove's nest. Good and amiable as they were, and loving and
                     grateful,—they showed their alien blood by a thousand aspirings—not perversely
                     exhibited, but unconsciously betrayed. Katherine was a beauty—that seemed to
                     account for her love of dress, and a certain wilfulness that sometimes grieved
                     Aunt Susan. George was handsome, too, and popular at school; good-humored, but
                     self-indulgent. The Ashmore children were so much like their parents in gentle
                     goodness, that they looked up admiringly to the dazzling gifts of the orphans,
                     and yielded them a willing homage that had no taint of envy.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Ashmore was quite right when she said that Katherine's beauty first
                     attracted Mr. Ellis. He had been introduced to her in the country, where she
                     seemed a wood-nymph, in the graceful simplicity of her dress and manners. Pure
                     and happy, gently excited by rural sights and sounds and all the beaming circle
                     of summer pleasures, and lustrous with flitting smiles and opal fancies,
                     Katherine's fascinations were irresistible. To Ellis she was only the more a
                     delicious wonder for being found among plain, unpretending people. He was any
                     thing but a mere man of the world, in the ordinary sense of that term. He loved
                     the world for the good that is in it, but he was much better fitted and more
                     disposed to lead than to follow it. His taste, highly cultivated and even
                     fastidious, yet seldom interfered with his strict interpretation of the rule of
                     duty; and even Katherine's charms would have had little effect on him, beyond
                     the passing moment, if he had not felt sure that the source of all this
                     bewitching outward harmony was within. The sweetness of her temper was as
                     little to be doubted as the rosy whiteness of her complexion; her face was as
                     full of quick intelligence as of symmetry, and the glorious beauty of her eyes
                     did not conceal the gentle kindness that shone through them. Mr. Ellis felt
                     that he had never seen her equal, and he was right; his only error was in
                     supposing her more developed than she was. Aunt Susan's process,—the result of
                     tender affection and heavenly instinct—was any thing but a forcing one. It was
                     her nature to bear as much of every one's burdens as she possibly could; to
                     make all the sacrifices, and take all the blame; and a more ingenious creature
                     in contriving excuses for every one's deficiencies but her own could not be
                     found. This is the description of no great disciplinarian, and the effect of
                     training on this plan was evident through the household, and particularly shown
                     in Katherine and her brother, who would have borne and well repaid a stronger
                     system. When Aunt Susan's elder children had reached the utmost to which direct
                     instruction could bring them, their cousins were yet in a forming state; and
                     although their ability was evident, it was still uncharacterized and almost
                     unused.</p>
                  <p>To the imagination of a lover, however, it is not wonderful that Katherine was
                     all-perfect.</p>
                  <p>A man sometimes finds himself, at thirty, romantic for the first time—a
                     phenomenon whose cause we leave to the explorations<pb n="106-107"
                        xml:id="VAC7024-00000055"/> tions of the omniscient psychologists of our
                     day. Mr. Ellis fancied himself the coolest judge in the world; but in truth,
                     from the time that he became fascinated by the excessive loveliness of
                     Katherine's face and figure, it was only fancy. The most commonplace of lovers
                     could not have been further from any thing that deserved the name of judgment.
                     His devotion filled the whole field of vision with a glory that seemed to him
                     to emanate from the central form; and to the idol herself the light was equally
                     magical. "While I was happy I was amiable," says Madame De Stael, in the person
                     of one of her heroines, hinting at once a point for self-examination, and a
                     reason for patience towards the unamiable. To be admired and loved is an
                     incentive to worthiness, in a generous nature; only mean souls grow arrogant by
                     spontaneous homage. The love of such a man as Henry Ellis naturally made
                     Katherine an angel, and so justified his most extravagant thoughts. That she
                     should give him in return as much of her heart as she was as yet conscious of
                     possessing was inevitable, and it was with entire sincerity that she owned a
                     preference which implied all he wished. The marriage took place after a short
                     engagement, for there seemed no very obvious reason for a long one; and the
                     usual round of gay bustle followed the wedding-jaunt. Katherine's <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">trousseau</foreign> had been all that Uncle Ashmore's means
                     would allow, and her husband's gifts left nothing to wish for. The world
                     presented a new side to the young wife. What an easy, charming world it was! No
                     more longings after beautiful things—no more talk about economy—no more visions
                     of what <emph>might</emph> be! Every thing <emph>was,</emph>—in actual
                     possession. The exercise of refined taste seemed a sufficient object in life,
                     and harmony of wishes in that direction ample security for married
                     happiness.</p>
                  <p>The furnishing of a handsome house in——Square gave delightful occupation for
                     some weeks. There were so many charming things to be examined, so many
                     proportions to be consulted, so many colors and blendings considered, that each
                     evening found Katherine as weary as if she had bean doomed to wield the
                     suicidal needle, to win a pittance that might defer starvation. The power of
                     indulging the taste for the first time was intoxicating, and who can marvel?
                     The house seemed to grow under her hands, as room after room assumed the aspect
                     and complexion of her choice. Mr. Ellis seldom interfered, though his travelled
                     taste might have corrected some errors in the way of display, and certainly
                     would have preferred that works of Art should have been more prominent than the
                     mere upholstery and cabinet ware of which Katherine was but too fond. Indeed it
                     would have been wonderful if our young wife, untaught in Art and surrounded in
                     her native city by examples of the most vulgar splendor, had been able wholly
                     to avoid the American vice of unmeaning gorgeousness, without plan or principle
                     of harmony. To have persuaded her to prefer a fine landscape to a great mirror,
                     would have been impossible, and Ellis was too indulgent to insist on the
                     picture without the preference. He chose to wait until his wife's taste
                     demanded something more refined than the glitter she saw about her. Even in
                     matters which concerned himself personally, he yielded every thing, for what
                     she preferred soon seemed to him best.</p>
                  <p>A month or two went by in returning visits, card-leaving, and receiving
                     company. Mr. Ellis bore his part in all this most gallantly, though it required
                     no extraordinary amount of sagacity to perceive that after a certain time it
                     began to weary his very soul. Katherine, to whom it was a novelty, and who
                        had—or<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7024-00000056"/> fancied she had—nothing
                     else to do, went on with heroic strength, and evidently thought it was to be
                     always so.</p>
                  <p>It would be curious to discover—if we could discover—how large a part of young
                     girls' notions of life and ideal of happiness and propriety is derived from
                     fashionable novels. The writers of those repositories of wisdom so crowd their
                     pages with splendid and fascinating images of the pleasures of society;—make
                     people so easy and graceful, so witty and wise, in drawing-rooms and boudoirs;
                     paint dinners all elegance and vivacity, balls all admiration and success—that
                     the inexperienced must fancy social life to be a picture of light and pleasure,
                     knowing no weariness, disgust, or disappointment. It takes no great experience
                     to cure the delusion, but it requires a certain amount; and to some natures the
                     waking up from the dream is not without bitterness. The disappointment that
                     waits upon unfounded expectations is not the least severe; and it is easy to
                     seek in petulant injustice revenge for the mistake. None are more disposed to
                     undervalue society than those who once overrated its attractions.</p>
                  <p>But our bride is a long way off from this point as yet.</p>

                  <p>"Pray give me credit for having kept carefully within the depths—or shallows—of
                     my own experience," said Egeria, after she had listened, with some tremors and
                     blushes, to the reading of her little effort. "I never knew, before, that I
                     could write any thing but a letter or a school exercise; and indeed, without
                     Mr. Shelton's suggestions I should not have dared attempt any delineation of
                     character. Yet I found a little reflection bring me quite vividly what would be
                     the probable result of the training of Aunt Susan—"</p>
                  <p>The chapter was graciously accepted, and Miss Berry chosen by the lot as the
                     next adventurer.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>I</emph> shall moralize, of course," she said, laughing; "you know me,
                     of old."</p>
                  <p>But all said moralizing was sometimes in place, and, in treating of the
                     significance of Beauty, could hardly be omitted.</p>
                  <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>"We must have a Christmas dinner! a family dinner," said Mrs. Ellis to her
                     husband, in council, after wedding visits had somewhat slackened. "We will have
                     Aunt Susan and Uncle Ashmore, and all the children and George, and your sister
                     and Mr. Enfield and Mary, and your Uncle Deane—"</p>
                  <p>"You musn't set your heart upon all that, dear," said Mr. Ellis, "for I dare
                     say your Uncle and Aunt will think we ought to dine with them. The elder
                     members of the family generally claim the Christmas dinner."</p>
                  <p>"O but I can easily persuade them! They will come here, I know, if I wish
                     it."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Ellis felt as if it would be more kind and delicate not to persuade them,
                     but he did not say so. He would hardly countenance himself in thinking so,
                     since Katherine was concerned. So the Christmas party was invited.</p>
                  <p>The Enfields were of that class wonderfully numerous among us—a class peculiar
                     to our country—who live at board because their means will not allow of their
                     being surrounded with private<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7024-00000057"/> vate
                     splendor of their own; of course they had no objection to dining out on
                     Christmas day.</p>
                  <p>But Aunt Susan and her husband were, as we have said, people whose rich natures
                     had resisted the world's petrifying influences, and retained, in spite of the
                     attrition of city life, the freshness and simplicity which only good and warm
                     hearts have any right to. To them, accustomed as they had long been to see
                     their own board crowned with good cheer, and surrounded by happy and beloved
                     faces on Christmas day, the idea of dining any where but at home was sadly
                     against the grain, so that they, for once, resisted Katherine pretty sturdily.
                     But Katherine was in no humor to be resisted. There was a Champagne flush about
                     her life, now, that gave a heightened and illusive color to whatever she
                     desired, and urged her towards its attainment with an impetuosity unsuspected
                     during her soft, embryo days. It is a rare mental soil in which egotism does
                     not grow rapidly under the tropical sun of sudden prosperity; and the more
                     imaginative the quality, the more luxuriant and overshadowing the product.
                     Experience of power made Katherine feel (not think) herself omnipotent in her
                     sphere, and she never doubted but she could make Uncle and Aunt Ashmore, whom
                     she loved so dearly, happy in her way instead of their own. So she prevailed,
                     and they exchanged their comfortable dining-room, with sprigs of box stuck in
                     the window-panes, branches of hemlock and wreaths of green forest fringe about
                     the pictures, and a bright, hospitable Christmas fire burning in the grate, for
                     their niece's too magnificent <foreign xml:lang="FRA">suite,</foreign>
                     curtained with satin and lace till one could not distinguish the snow falling
                     thick through the air without, and warmed by a furnace in the cellar till you
                     felt uncertain whether a fan or a fire were most desirable.</p>
                  <p>"Had not we better have a little fire, Katherine?" said Mr. Ellis; "Aunt Susan
                     will miss her cheerful corner-seat, I am afraid."</p>
                  <p>"Fire! oh dear, no—I am sure it is very warm here!" And she appealed to the
                     thermometer, which tyrannizes over one's natural and unanswerable sensations in
                     so many houses.</p>
                  <p>Her mind's eye, if not her bodily one, was fixed on the polished grates, which,
                     though they had been left open at Mr. Ellis's suggestion, for the very purpose
                     now in question, she could not bear to see defaced. So she did not consent, and
                     the Ashmores arrived, opportunely for her, before there was time for further
                     debate.</p>
                  <p>There was a hearty as well as graceful welcome for these honored guests, for
                     whom Mr. Ellis had already learned to feel the affection and reverence of a
                     son. Katherine's delight was unbounded, and animation and pleasure so
                     heightened her beauty, that her indulgent relatives looked at her with new
                     pride, and a new sense of her right to power. George Fountain, as he kissed his
                     sister, brought out his own opinion, brother-like—</p>
                  <p>"Why, Kate, you grow handsomer every day!"</p>
                  <p>Katherine met her husband's eye, and blushed, not very painfully.</p>
                  <p>"Do you find it warm enough here, Auntie?" said she, as Aunt Susan took her
                     seat on one of the half-dozen sofas. (A great defect of fashionable
                     drawing-rooms is that they have no natural social centre. They seem made for
                     undistinguished crowds, with no common interest or impulse.)</p>
                  <p>"O dear, yes—very warm!" said Aunt Susan, whose rosy face wore a deeper hue
                     than usual. She took a fan from her pocket, and Katherine looked at Mr. Ellis
                     as much as to say,<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7024-00000058"/> "You see I was
                     right." He did not remind her that the cheerful fire he had recommended need
                     not have increased the heat.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Enfield, Mrs. Enfield and Miss. Enfield," said the servant, opening the
                     door, and the party thus announced by their own order, came splendidly into the
                     room, as if for a visit of ceremony.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Enfield was a stately lady, Mr. Enfield a nidging, insignificant little
                     gentleman, with his hair brushed wildly upwards to increase his apparent
                     height; Miss Enfield, a little, pale-faced girl, with the very lightest hair,
                     and large red lips rather scornful in expression. Her hands and arms were of a
                     papery whiteness, and so fleshless that her numerous bracelets and rings seemed
                     in constant danger of falling off. This delicacy her mamma prized very highly,
                     while to indifferent eyes it seemed a presage either of early decay or a sort
                     of half-life for a longer period.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Deane came next, a pale, serious elderly man in black, with hardly the face
                     or spirits for a Christmas party; but Katherine's gracious manners and kind
                     attentions soon won him to some degree of cheerfulness. He was a widower, and
                     had, not long before, lost an only son—his sole remaining child. He seemed bent
                     on watching George Fountain, who, full of life and health, must have formed a
                     striking memento of his loss. We love to try every new sword in the old
                     wound.</p>
                  <p>"Bless me! how hot you've got it here, Ellis!" said Mr. Enfield as soon as he
                     had made his bow. "You will have to serve us all up with the baked meats!"</p>
                  <p>"Is there a fan, Mrs. Ellis?" said Mrs. Enfield, who, quite aware that her
                     husband's danger was that of insignificance, always endeavored to give dignity
                     to his whims by assenting to them. The fan being brought, Mrs. Enfield
                     condescended to turn her attention to Aunt Susan.</p>
                  <p>"Shocking weather, Mrs. Ashmore! Dreadful driving to-day!"</p>
                  <p>"We walked," said Aunt Susan.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! did you, indeed?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said Mr. Ashmore, my wife calls her India-rubbers her iron-grays; they
                     carry her every where, and she is a coward about riding."</p>
                  <p>Uncle and Aunt Ashmore were so old-fashioned that they still dared to say
                     "riding," although the English say "driving." They adhered to the old Bible
                     English.</p>
                  <p>"For my part," said Mr. Enfield, inspecting his patent leathers, "I found it
                     quite enough to walk from the carriage to the door."</p>
                  <p>"Yes—I was nearly blown away," said his wife. "It was horribly
                     disagreeable."</p>
                  <p>"All for want of habit," said Mr. Ashmore. "The doctors would not have so many
                     cases of dyspepsia if every body walked. 'Have a carriage,' says Emerson, 'and
                     you lose your legs.'"</p>
                  <p>"O, very likely," murmured Mr. Enfield, evidently quite content to take the
                     carriage without the legs.</p>
                  <p>The children now came bouncing in. Their happy faces and joyous tones did
                     something towards overcoming the ice of the Enfields. The elder found amusement
                     on the sofa-table; little Willie went into raptures at the Maltese cat that lay
                     dosing on a cushion; while Susan, the image of her good mother, soon planted
                     herself in the window, to observe the storm and watch the poor children, who
                     were piteously endeavoring to find bits of<pb n="114-115"
                        xml:id="VAC7024-00000059"/> wood or coal wherever the wind had blown the
                     snow from patches in the vacant lot at the corner.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, see! the wind has carried off that little girl's cloak that she was
                     holding on with one hand while she picked up a long piece of hoop; and now she
                     is running after it through the deep drift! See her poor red feet! She has
                     caught her cloak, now, but there's a naughty boy has run off with her piece of
                     hoop."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Ellis went to the window. "What's all this about cloaks and hoops, Susie?"
                     said he.</p>
                  <p>"Oh—there they go—they have gone round the corner—I believe the wind blew them
                     round. But there's a lady—with her umbrella loaded with wet snow! She's coming
                     here, I declare! O—her umbrella is turned wrong side out, and her bonnet is
                     almost off!"</p>
                  <p>"It is Mrs. Dibble," said Mr. Ellis, "out on one of her expeditions of mercy, I
                     have no doubt."</p>
                  <p>A ring was heard, and at the same moment a servant announced dinner.</p>
                  <p>"Say we are at dinner, John," said Mrs. Ellis.</p>
                  <p>"Katherine, dear—don't send away Mrs. Dibble—and in such a storm, too! Ask the
                     lady in, John."</p>
                  <p>"Dibble!" exclaimed Mr. Enfield, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">sotto voce,</foreign>
                     "what a vulgar name—"</p>
                  <p>"And what a vulgar woman!" said his wife, a little louder, as Mrs. Dibble
                     entered the room breathless from the storm, her hair blown about her face and
                     her cheeks all wet and red. Katherine had looked vexed, but her husband found
                     time to whisper, "It will be but for a moment—Mrs. Dibble never wastes her own
                     time or any body's else."</p>
                  <p>"Excuse me," said the visitor, as soon as she had recovered herself a little;
                     "I should hardly have dared to enter any other nouse in——Square in this way,
                     and on Christmas day, too—but I felt sure of you."</p>
                  <p>She looked rather at Mr than Mrs. Ellis as she said this, not purposely, but by
                     instinct.</p>
                  <p>"You will come in to dinner with us," said Katherine, kindly; "our dinner is
                     just on the table."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, thank you—no," said Mrs. Dibble, and she arose at once. "What I wished to
                     say was, that there is a family absolutely starving, within a few rods of your
                     house, and I came to beg something warm for them to eat, immediately."</p>
                  <p>"Starving!" was exclaimed on all sides</p>
                  <p>"Yes, indeed!—without a morsel for nearly two days—a mother and three little
                     children, faint with hunger, and shut up to die, for the poor soul had come to
                     the awful resolution not to try any longer."</p>
                  <p>A thrill of horror ran through the group; Katherine's cheek blanched, and tears
                     came to her eyes.</p>
                  <p>"We will send something instantly," she said; "let us go to the
                     dining-room."</p>
                  <p>It was easy to select from the abundance of delicacies there, and Mrs Dibble's
                     experience enabled her to choose with judgment.</p>
                  <p>"I will go!" said George Fountain. "Let me go—I would rather carry the basket
                     than not" And he was off in a moment, Mrs. Dibble following as fast as she
                     could.</p>
                  <p>"You will at least come back and dine with us?" said Katherine.</p>
                  <p>"No—not to-day—many thanks. I hope I have not spoiled your Christmas
                     dinner."</p>
                  <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7024-00000060"/>
                  <p>But, to the honor of our human nature, be it said, such occurrences will throw
                     a damp over plenty and magnificence. The contrast is too horrible; and though
                     it always exists, and we know it, yet we cannot face its actual presence.
                     Katherine was full of contending emotions. There was certainly something a
                     little trying to a young housekeeper in the interruption. A dinner is not
                     perfect if it waits ten or fifteen minutes after it should be eaten, and this
                     was Katherine's first large dinner.</p>
                  <p>But then the opposite thought that there are thousands who have no dinner!</p>
                  <p>"Very odd woman—that Mrs. Dibble!" said Mrs. Enfield. "She is always engaged
                     about other people's business."</p>
                  <p>"I fancy her husband would rather she should attend to her own," said Mr.
                     Enfield.</p>
                  <p>"These very benevolent people," said the lady, with a little toss of the head,
                     "are generally indifferent to the comfort of those immediately dependent upon
                     them. Home duties are not showy enough for them."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Ashmore and Katherine both looked ready to exclaim at this sweeping
                     judgment, but Mr. Ellis said, quietly—</p>
                  <p>"I believe Mr. Dibble is very much of his wife's mind, and feels willing she
                     should give up a good deal of her time to the care of the poor."</p>
                  <p>"Poor devil!" said Mr. Enfield. "I dare say he tries to make the best of it;
                     but I pity him, or any other man that has <emph>a benevolent</emph> wife!"</p>
                  <p>This was said with great self-complacency, and Mrs. Enfield evidently felt as
                     if she had received a compliment.</p>
                  <p>"I must confess," said Mr. Ashmore, "that I should not like my wife to neglect
                     home affairs for the sake of looking after the poor."</p>
                  <p>"But isn't it possible," said Mr. Ellis, "to attend to the poor, and to home
                     affairs too? I suppose I must not quote Aunt Susan herself as an instance,
                     here"—with a smile full of meaning at her—"but I know another lady who is a
                     wonder in that way."</p>
                  <p>"I find it quite as much as I can do to attend to my own duties!" said Mrs.
                     Enfield, sharply. She was evidently rather excited by her brother's remarks,
                     for the marabouts and golden fringes of her head-dress quivered as she spoke.
                     "Nobody need be poor, in this country," she continued, "if it were not for
                     dissipation and improvidence; and to be always giving is only an encouragement
                     to vice. I'm sure I don't know who would give me money, if I wanted it! Do you,
                     Mr. Ashmore?"</p>
                  <p>"What we give sanctifies what is left," said Mr. Ashmore, who had no idea of
                     being understood to take sides against charitable effort. "But I meant that I
                     thought it would be hard for me to make the sacrifice Mr. Ellis was speaking
                     of."</p>
                  <p>"I think the kind of charity practised by Mr. and Mrs. Dibble a very difficult
                     one," said Mr. Ellis; "willingness to aid the poor by personal services
                     bespeaks a deeper sense of duty—a more self-denying virtue—than the largest
                     desposition to give, which is often a mere impulse. Vinet speaks of a clergyman
                     who, after quietly listening to whatever of rude repulse the coarsest nature
                     could prevail upon itself to offer in reply to his plea for the wretched, would
                     say, with unruffled brow and unshrinking perseverance—'<foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >Et mes pauvres?</foreign>' I should consider that man's claim to sainthood
                     well established."</p>
                  <p>"I have tried it, myself," said Mr. Ashmore, "and I know<pb n="118-119"
                        xml:id="VAC7024-00000061"/> the mean feeling that comes over one is so
                     humiliating, and the cold, stingy looks of those we apply to so provoking, that
                     it would be far easier to give the whole sum required, out of one's own pocket,
                     if that were possible."</p>
                  <p>"And yet," said Mr. Deane, "who denies that we ought to be obliged to those who
                     save us the time and trouble of searching out misfortune? Like Spenser's
                     Angels— <q>

                  </p>
                  <p>"Angels!" exclaimed Mrs. Enfield, who soon wearied of any subject not spiced
                     with personality, "I think Mrs. Dibble is very little like an angel! She has
                     nothing attractive about her. She is always full of some idea of her own, and
                     cannot talk as other people do. Then how she looks! Her bonnet is a perfect
                     sight, and she wears a cloak that makes her look like one of her own <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">protégés.</foreign> The servants are afraid to let her
                     in!"</p>
                  <p>"I should really think," said Katherine, who coveted beauty in every thing,
                     "that it was not necessary for her to dress quite so shabbily."</p>
                  <p>"I can tell you, dear, why she does so," said Aunt Susan. "She appropriates
                     only a certain sum yearly to her private expenses, and out of that,
                     proportioned as it is to her husband's means, must come her personal charities.
                     So she hardly allows herself what is becoming. I dare say she would be sorry to
                     know she looked so shabby to others."</p>
                  <p>"How silly!" said Mrs. Enfield, half aside.</p>
                  <p>"I mean to have a talk with her about it one of these days," continued Aunt
                     Susan. "It isn't any body's duty to look ugly."</p>
                  <p>"Labor lost!" said Mrs. Enfield, whose temper seemed irritated by the
                     justifying and respectful tone of Mrs. Dibble's defenders. "Your true
                     charitable phenomenon is always proud as Lucifer and self-righteous as a
                     pillar-saint—I detest the whole tribe."</p>
                  <p>Discussions of this kind have a wonderfully disturbing power on some people.
                     There is a pertinacious inner voice, not subject to the rules of good society,

                  <p>When George Fountain returned, he gave the most heartrending account of the
                     poor family, intermixing his pity with strong commendation of Mrs. Dibble.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Enfield pushed away his plate, and moved petulantly several things which
                     stood near it; and when Katherine kindly offered him various delicacies,
                     declined them, shortly enough. Mrs. Enfield immediately put on the air of an
                     injured person. Mr. and Mrs. Ashmore had not <foreign xml:lang="FRA">savoir
                        faire</foreign> enough to look as if nothing had happened, though they tried
                     with all their simple might. The children, who had been able to keep up their
                        own<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7024-00000062"/> private fun for a while, at
                     length began to be sensible of the presence of a hostile element, and they fell
                     into a staring silence.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Deane alone seemed to forget all in his admiring sympathy with George's
                     humane enthusiasm. He sat down by him and drew him into conversation, which,
                     however, did not become general.</p>
                  <p>The games in the drawing-room did something, and the tea and coffee something
                     more. Mrs. Enfield consented to play and sing, and though see would attempt
                     nothing but grand Italian cavatinas, and Uncle Ashmore's old-fashioned ears did
                     not quite relish the foreign tone, yet really good music will speak for itself,
                     and he was delighted before he knew it, and so were all. Even Mr. Enfield could
                     not resist the general pleasure, the less as it was due to his wife; so music
                     proved, in this case, what it should always in this jarring world of ours,—a
                     compelling spirit of health. The evening closed gaily, and Mrs. Ellis's first
                     dinnerparty would pass for a success, according to all the rules.</p>
                  <p>But when all had departed, and Katherine, alone with her husband, was talking
                     over the matter, she confessed that her Christmas party had to her been a
                     failure.</p>
                  <p>"I hardly know what was the reason," she said; "but certainly Aunt Susan and
                     Uncle Ashmore were not in their usual spirits. The children, even, were dull;
                     and then that <foreign xml:lang="FRA">malapropos visit</foreign> of Mrs.
                     Dibble—" She stopped, for her heart reproached her.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Ellis was too generous to bring forward all the reasons he could have
                     suggested for the failure of the Christmas party.</p>
                  <p>"My sister and her husband," he said, are inharmonious people. They are spoiled
                     by prosperity and indolence, and their native good qualities are buried under a
                     load of pride and exclusiveness clusiveness. They seem laboring to satisfy
                     themselves with the externals of life, and the rebellious longings of their
                     hearts for something better give them a discontented air. Then Mr. Deane is too
                     profoundly sad to be fully sympathetic with any gayety. He seems interested in
                     George, but in nothing and nobody else."</p>
                  <p>Katherine sat for some time in silence. Mrs. Dibble and her errand passed in
                     review, and it is to be feared, although perhaps the young wife would hardly
                     have owned it to herself, that she secretly referred the clouding over of the
                     party to the unlucky preference given by that lady to her house over any other
                     in the square. There was something officious about it—something that violated
                     the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bienséances,</foreign>—that obtruded uncomfortable
                     images in the midst of luxury and happiness. In these days the death's head is
                     banished from the feast. "There must be poor people—there always have been and
                     there always will be. We are surrounded with them; it is in vain to make
                     ourselves uncomfortable about any particular instance. People like Mrs. Dibble,
                     who go about ferreting them out, are always very disagreeable. They forget
                     every thing else; take no interest in society."</p>
                  <p>Did Mrs. Ellis say these words to her husband? No indeed— <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>To speak them were a deadly sin!</l>
                           <l>And for having but thought them, her heart within</l>
                           <l>A treble penance must be done.</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q> She reproached herself, all the while; but the brightness of her new lot
                     had already begun to affect her general estimate of things. All recollection of
                     unhappiness or want was distasteful. An existence beautified by love, wealth,
                     station, Art, refinement, was her ideal of happiness. Such a picture her life
                     now presented<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7024-00000063"/> sented in prospect;
                     and the view excluded, for the moment, all sorrow, whether her own or others.
                     She found no place in her landscape for a 'brown tree,' unconscious that the
                     glare was even now injuring her moral sight.</p>
                  <p>"Ah! Aunt Annie," said Miss Aldis, "now we know you must have written a
                     book!"</p>
                  <p>"Why, pray?"</p>
                  <p>"Because you have written such a long chapter, and in such a little while!"</p>
                  <p>"We shall see what <emph>your</emph> chapter will be," said some of the rest,
                     laughing.</p>
                  <p>"Mine! oh, I wouldn't write one for the world! The lot had better not fall on
                     me, for I should have to refuse."</p>
                  <p>But the perverse fates called her, the very next time, and she could be saved
                     from a fit of crying only by her uncle's promising to serve in her stead. Mr.
                     Berry said he began quite to long to try his hand again, now that the lines had
                     been marked out a little. Of course nobody objected, but it may be imagined how
                     all laughed when the old bachelor announced the chapter as</p>

                  <p>Happily the gayeties which follow a wedding do not last always. There is a time
                     to be sober, too, and this Mr. Ellis was prepared fully to enjoy. Katherine
                     thought she had been longing for it, but the fascinations of her new life were
                     potent, and her estimate of sobriety was not always that of her husband.</p>
                  <p>If contrast be an element of harmony in married life, no couple could be better
                     mated. The character of Ellis was one of remarkable solidity; his opinions had
                     foundations; he was thorough in every thing. Born to fortune, his tastes had
                     been cultivated at home and refined by foreign travel; his associates were
                     select, his intimacies few. How a man of his stamp happened to be captivated
                     with Katherine Fountain—a girl whose education had been imperfect, whose few
                     accomplishments were of a middling order, whose natural powers were in a manner
                     stagnant for want of healthful stimulus and a guiding spirit—we have already
                     seen. Mr. Ellis's admiration of beauty, and his firm belief in its
                     significance, had led him to overlook all that might to a cooler eye have been
                     evident deficiency, in so exquisite a creature, the extreme worth of those who
                     had trained her being a sort of security that in the deeper accomplishments of
                     the heart she could not be wanting. A young woman brought up under Aunt Susan's
                     influence must have in her the genius of good wifehood; Katherine was sincere
                     and not without seriousness; she was young, and there was time for every thing.
                     If she cared rather disproportionately for things essentially frivolous, that
                     was natural at her age. It would be her husband's delightful task to regulate
                     and inform her taste, giving to every object its due place, and gradually
                     replacing the lower by the higher. If she evinced an undue pertinacity at
                     times, it was the innate strength of her character, her high sense of duty,
                        and<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7024-00000064"/> her adherence to what seemed
                     to her right. It needed only to apply and confine this rigidity of will to
                     subjects of importance, to make it a most valuable quality, in a world half of
                     whose sins are sins of vacillation and want of courage.</p>
                  <p>So reasoned our sage lover; and we can hardly wonder that he thought beauty
                     like his wife's must bespeak every virtue.</p>
                  <p>Her form had an undulating grace which not all the artifices and constraints of
                     fashion could have spoiled, and her movements, unstudied and devoid of the
                     tricks which caprice invents for the distinction of <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >soi-disant</foreign> exclusives, were strikingly simple—a beauty not enough
                     prized in our young women, and which, when not, as in this case, a natural
                     gift, is the fruit of only the best training. With this expressive elegance of
                     form and motion, accorded a face in which color and outline harmonized so
                     sweetly that the eye was at a loss to analyze the charm. It was like a cluster
                     of dewy blossoms when the morning sun first shines upon it, fusing its
                     loveliness in light. No strong trait of character had as yet written itself
                     legibly on this delicate surface; it was only a tablet of excellent
                     possibilities. The complexion was lily-fair, and the check tinged only with a
                     flitting rose, as emotion quickened the eloquent blood. In expression,
                     Katherine's face leaned a little to the sad; for delicate beauty is never
                     wholly gay; and this sweet sadness promises the sympathy and tenderness whose
                     lack even beauty fails to supply</p>
                  <p>The training of such a creature seems to the imagination no heavy task, yet
                     Henry Ellis discovered, before he had far passed the threshold of married life,
                     that to play the guiding spirit in the transition from girl to woman is not an
                     easy one for a lover. Young love prompts praise, and is the happy parent of
                     unconscious flattery; and when love as true and tender ventures to speak
                     another language besides this its first, the sensitive ear is apt to detect or
                     fancy harshness, in the softest tones that can frame words of reproof or even
                     advice. It was not long before Katherine began to feel herself wounded by
                     difference of opinion, by objections, by hesitation, even. Her ideal was built
                     up of materials furnished only by her own imagination, and she never suspected
                     that a wife who wholly and ardently loved, would have borrowed from the beloved
                     one a thousand tints and graces for the fabric, if not the very foundations.
                     She felt her husband's superiority with pride, but not without a secret and
                     unrecognized pain. He was so reasonable! she did not relish the unintentional
                     compulsion of his calmer and better regulated nature, and in her heart she
                     called it an iron will, never suspecting the adamant of her own, by means of
                     which she discovered, or thought she discovered, the unyielding nature of his.
                     Yet these difficulties were but incipient. The early domestic skies were rosy
                     and tranquil, and only a trained eye could have discerned in the horizon the
                     hand's breadth of cloudy bar that threatened their happy calm.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Ellis's first care had been to invite George Fountain to become an inmate
                     of his house, and his next to procure for him the best instruction, and to give
                     his really fine talents every opportunity of development. This delighted
                     Katherine, and she acceded willingly to her husband's suggestion that she
                     should take part in such of George's lessons as befitted her, for the sake of
                     regular occupation during a portion of the morning, as well as to supply
                     certain deficiencies in her education. This went on admirably. Katherine found
                     herself all the more at leisure for this regularity of employment, and the
                     pleasure of improvement began to make itself felt. Ellis looked on,<pb
                        n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7024-00000065"/> delighted, and his own personal part
                     in the labor of love was not wanting. He turned Katherine's attention to books,
                     and read with her his favorite authors. Her taste, naturally good, began to
                     expand under cultivation, and her discrimination unfolded itself in proportion.
                     It was all a delicious voyage of discovery, through summer seas, touching at
                     islands of adventure and pleasant surprise, with a pilot who possessed the
                     happy power of guiding the winds and smoothing the waters at his will. <q>
                        <l>Love at the helm and pleasure in the breeze.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. Deane was often present at these readings, and contributed not a little by
                     his taste and knowledge to their variety and interest, while it was delightful
                     to the young people to be able somewhat to relieve the melancholy with which a
                     series of misfortunes and disappointments had shadowed his life. He possessed
                     an easy fortune, but those were gone with whom he could have enjoyed it, and
                     failing health seemed to his somewhat morbid feelings a reason for not making
                     more resolute efforts against the encroachments of sorrow. In George Fountain
                     he always took peculiar interest. A resemblance, fancied or real, which Mr.
                     Deane pleased himself with tracing between George and his lost son, gave him a
                     wonderful charm in his eyes. Katherine, who was proud of her brother, soon
                     learned to love Mr. Deane, and the little party moved on as amicably, and
                     settled into as habitual affection, as if they had lived together always.</p>
                  <p>And happy would it have been if this simple state of things could have
                     continued unchanged. Such seasons of calm, unmarked by exciting events, yet
                     full of pure and wholesome life and meaning, are the seed time of the future.
                     But the plans of life of those who live in society are much at the mercy of
                     circumstances. The library in—Square had not been more than a few months the
                     scene of the studies and amusements we have mentioned, when Mr. Ellis came in
                     one morning, looking blank and almost vexed, and holding in his hand a note
                     from Mrs. Enfield.</p>
                  <p>"My sister writes me," he said, "that our cousin Mrs. St. John, of Baltimore,
                     is coming here for a few weeks; and that she hopes, as we are at housekeeping
                     and she is not, we shall ask her to stay with us." This was a compliment the
                     Enfields often paid their friends—one of the dignified and convenient results
                     of boarding-house existence.</p>
                  <p>Katherine suppressed an exclamation of dismay, which she felt would be
                     unbecoming on the occasion of a first visit from her husband's relations; but a
                     long perspective of interruption, constraint, and forced gayety, with the
                     dreaded figures of Mr. and Mrs. Enfield intermixed rose up before her startled
                     imagination. She remembered having heard something of what Mrs. St. John's
                     visits were, and that their annual recurrence had been one motive for the
                     Enfields' breaking up housekeeping.</p>
                  <p>"What shall I say, dear?" said Ellis, with a smile that had a dolorous twinkle
                     in the eye.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, that we shall be very happy, of course," said Katherine, smiling back in
                     the same spirit, "though I own I feel my incompetency to entertain Mrs. St.
                     John."</p>
                  <p>"You need be under no uneasiness on that score," said her husband, "for Mrs.
                     St. John is a lady who always makes her wishes known, and contrives to
                     entertain herself wherever she is."</p>
                  <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7024-00000066"/>
                  <p>So Mrs. St. John came, and with her not only her own servant, who was expected,
                     but her son and his servant, who had not even been mentioned. They arrived at
                     night, and as Mrs. St. John said, nearly dead with fatigue and exhaustion.</p>
                  <p>Here were four rooms to be occupied, instead of two, as Katherine had expected.
                     But the house was so ample that this difficulty was but momentary. Not so that
                     which arose when Mrs. St. John was shown into her room.</p>
                  <p>"Charming!" she exclained, looking round with her glass. "How very beautifully
                     you have arranged every thing. But, my dear Mrs. Ellis, I fear I shall have to
                     be troublesome enough to beg you will have those curtains removed, for I never
                     sleep under any thing of the sort; I consider them extremely unwholesome."</p>
                  <p>"Will draperies so light as these incommode you?" said Katherine, who thought
                     with dismay of the attempt to take down in a few minutes what the upholsterer
                     had been hours in putting up.</p>
                  <p>"O yes, indeed—I could not think of attempting to sleep under them. The very
                     idea is quite enough. Just allow the servants to take them down, if you please,
                     and I will return to the drawing-room for a few minutes."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. St. John established herself on the sofa in an attitude of elegant
                     languor, requesting Katherine, who had been hoping to slip away to attend to
                     the demolition of her beautiful draperies, to sit by her side. She complained
                     of excessive fatigue, and required the incessant attention of her servant.
                     After several things had been brought for her refreshment she seemed a little
                     revived, and asked Katherine to play something for her. This was a new trial
                     for our bride, whose music was but mediocre ocre; so she endeavored to excuse
                     herself, but there was no escape. She felt herself to be succeeding pretty
                     well, when Mrs. St. John exclaimed, "My dear Mrs. Ellis! I forgot to ask
                     whether there are draperies in Eugene's room. If there are, I fear I must
                     trouble you to have those removed, too, for I would not dare to allow him to
                     sleep under them. His health is very delicate!"</p>
                  <p>Glad to escape the piano-forte, Katherine withdrew to give the necessary
                     orders. Mrs. St. John surveyed her retreating form through her glass with the
                     eye of a connoisseur.</p>
                  <p>"A beautiful creature!" she said, encouragingly, to Mr. Ellis. "You have really
                     done honor to your taste. She wants nothing but an air of fashion. Her <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">tournure</foreign> is elegant, though I see her maid does not
                     understand dressing her hair."</p>
                  <p>"She dresses her own hair," said Mr. Ellis.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! it isn't possible! How very odd! Violet shall dress it for her, and then
                     you will see the difference."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Ellis felt that he did not care to see any difference; but knowing Mrs. St.
                     John of old, he did not say so. Katherine returned, after a while, looking,
                     sooth to say, a little flushed and uncomfortable. She felt as if she was
                     already half turned out of her own house.</p>
                  <p>After some little delay, the party were satisfactorily disposed of, and the
                     family had retired, when Mrs. St. John's maid rapped at Mrs. Ellis's door,
                     saying her mistress could not sleep, and would like a glass of champagne.</p>
                  <p>This brought, our host began to hope his cousin was now comfortable for a few
                     hours; but in a moment a loud shriek was heard, and every body was at once in
                     commotion.</p>
                  <p>Violet had managed to send the champagne cork full in her<pb n="130-131"
                        xml:id="VAC7024-00000067"/> mistress's face, whither a great part of the
                     wine had followed it. So the bed was to be changed, and fomentations to be
                     applied to the probable bruise, all which occupied several persons until near
                     morning. We can hardly say that the young housekeeper bore all this with
                     perfect equanimity.</p>
                  <p>"Patience, Katherine dear," said her husband. "Mrs. St. John will settle down
                     after a few days. Change of place always makes her rather restless at first,
                     but when she gets accustomed to us she will become quieter. She is really a
                     woman of many good qualities, spoiled by indulgence; one of those who, instead
                     of restraining their wants, feel it an absolute duty to gratify them all. That
                     she likes a thing, is a sufficient reason to her for requiring it; that she
                     does not like another, an equally good reason for refusing to put up with it at
                     all. In this way she has become sensitive to the smallest inconvenience."</p>
                  <p>Emerson says that "to him who wears shoes, the whole earth is covered with
                     leather;" a deep lesson to such as carry about with them habits calculated to
                     do any thing but protect them against the roughnesses of life.</p>
                  <p>Katherine had begun to feel a little anxious as to what this disposition of her
                     guest might require of her, but there was something so imposingly elegant about
                     Mrs. St. John's manner of doing the most ungracious things, and she so lavished
                     kind words and expressions of endearment through all, that there arose a kind
                     of admiration and wonder which half neutralized the vexation; and our young
                     wife, imaginative and new to life, was excessively susceptible to such
                     influences. She had already felt the first springings of an ambition of
                     society, and Mrs. St. John offered what was the most needed as to
                     manner—example, which good Aunt Susan and her simple circle had not been able
                     to supply. So Katherine, occupied in studying her as a study, soon forgot,
                     spite of private vexations, to judge of her as a woman.</p>
                  <p>Breakfast the next morning were no simple affair, easily dispatched and soon
                     forgotten. There were so many things to be changed before Mrs. St. John or her
                     son could possibly touch a morsel, and they had so leisurely a manner of
                     proceeding, that the morning was well advanced before it was finished. In the
                     first place, the lady felt the need of the morning sun, and to breakfast in a
                     room which did not receive it chilled her for all day; this was announced by
                     her maid before Mrs. St. John rose, as that lady did not wish to be dressed a
                     moment too soon, for fear of faintness. The table was accordingly removed to a
                     room on the other side of the house, and in due season Mrs. St. John was
                     notified that breakfast waited her convenience. On this assurance she ventured
                     to rise, and in just an hour made her appearance below. Meanwhile her son had
                     been exploring the house, spending some time on the roof with his dog and
                     George Fountain, and sending his unhappy black boy up and down stairs for
                     various articles, which he threw into the garden in vain attempts to induce the
                     too sensible brute to jump after them. This Eugene was a handsome creature,
                     with his mother's soft eyes and soft manners; wholly untrained, except to
                     follow his own inclinations; but by nature amiable enough, and not devoid of
                     ability. What with personal beauty and elegance of dress and manner there was a
                     splendor about them both that soon fascinated Katherine, ever alive to whatever
                     stimulates and gratifies the æsthetic faculty. Not all the airs they took or
                     the trouble they gave could wholly disgust her, though her husband often
                        looked<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7024-00000068"/> at her, surprised that she
                     could endure unruffled what was to his sense of propriety and kindness so
                     trying.</p>
                  <p>Breakfast over, and all the heatings and coolings and toastings and fannings
                     required by Mrs. St. John happily accomplished, the hostess proposed to show
                     her the house, which, being the still fresh fruit of her taste, was a subject
                     of some little natural pride. Eugene and his dog accompanied them, in a
                     skirmishing sort of way—in and out, before and after them, and making the tour
                     as much in the way of exercise as of examination.</p>
                  <p>"Eugene, my love!" said his mother, "you shouldn't let your dog jump on those
                     cushions! There! he is on the bed! You must really restrain him. You indulge
                     him too much."</p>
                  <p>"Oh he's quite clean, mamma, I assure you," said Eugene; "he has been well
                     washed this morning."</p>
                  <p>"But perhaps he is damp, my dear."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, I fancy not!"</p>
                  <p>Certain tracks on the pillows spoke to the point, but the dog was allowed to
                     continue his innocent gambols.</p>
                  <p>Mrs, St. John admired judiciously, but found something to suggest in every
                     room; and Katherine seemed to herself to be under the influence of some magic
                     eye-salve, so much did her guest's remarks enlighten her as to the
                     possibilities of her house. Of the library, however, Mrs. St. John expressed
                     unqualified approbation; it was so quiet, so charmingly fitted up, and, opening
                     into the conservatory, had the aspect of perpetual summer.</p>
                  <p>"You must positively let this be my domain while I stay with you," she said;
                     "it is quite a little summer heaven! I adore books and flowers, and then this
                     bay-window on the garden, and this luxurious divan—O! you must really let me
                     have a little bed here; a mere sofa, or something of that sort. I don't mind
                     what it is, in such a delightful place,—though while we <emph>are</emph>
                     putting up a bed, it is certainly just as easy to have it a comfortable one.
                     You will, dearest Katherine, won't you? you are so amiable that one is not
                     afraid to ask you for any thing!"</p>
                  <p>Katherine murmured something about the library's being her husband's peculiar
                     ground, but Mrs. St. John with the most insinuating smile, said, turning to
                     Ellis, "Oh, Henry will not mind! He knows my odd ways, and will indulge me, I
                     know!" And the thing was settled, <abbr>nem. con.,</abbr> and the state
                     bedstead which, with its delicate drapery, Katherine had thought the prettiest
                     thing that ever was seen, came inglorious into the library, shorn of its
                     honors, and looking only cumbrous and sadly out of place. The removal of the
                     bed brought with it that of most of the furniture that belonged to it, and a
                     general turn-out in the library ensued. But the pleasure expressed by Mrs. St.
                     John was considered, by herself at least, ample consolation. "I shall be so
                     happy here! she said; "I shall hardly know when to leave you!"</p>
                  <p>And truly she seemed quite content in her new quarters, discovering every day
                     some new mode of rendering them still more comfortable, such as begging Mrs.
                     Ellis to allow Eugene to occupy a small room adjoining, which had been used for
                     some of the morning lessons, now alas! quite broken up. We need not go further
                     into particulars, but leave Mrs. St. John's ways to the reader's
                     imagination.</p>
                  <p>What is more important, Eugene became quite inseparable from George Fountain,
                     whose studies were pursued but nominally after the arrival of these absorbing
                     guests. Every day brought its plans and pleasures; Mrs. St. John had a large
                     circle of fashionable friends, and the once quiet house in——<pb n="134-135"
                        xml:id="VAC7024-00000069"/> Square was the rendezvous of many very elegant
                     and important people, who professed to have no business in life. Mr. Deane and
                     all sober friends were in the shade, at least, while the Enfields and their set
                     reigned triumphant. Parties followed parties, for Mrs. St. John's delicacy of
                     health never prevented her going any where, and Katherine could seldom be
                     excused from accompanying her.</p>
                  <p>"I shall stay with you so short a time," would the fair guest say; "you must
                     gratify me! Do, darling." And truth to say, Katherine soon was nothing
                     loth.</p>
                  <p>A new world was opening upon her—a world of imposing elegance; accomplishment,
                     enjoyment, and, above all, admiration, for in it her beauty was as if new
                     found. That all this proved intoxicating, who can wonder? Exquisitely dressed,
                     with the aid of her husband's indulgence and Mrs. St. John's practised taste,
                     Katherine found herself every where "the cynosure of neighboring eyes," and in
                     those eyes she read such confessions of her loveliness as not all the more
                     measured and principled admiration of her husband could counterbalance. She
                     even began—oh! ungrateful heart of woman!—to fancy that Ellis had never done
                     her justice. The voice of flattery is louder than the tender whisper of
                     affection; the praise of indifference far bolder than the delicate homage of
                     respect. Mr. Ellis saw with pain his wife's gradual subjection to the influence
                     of frivolity, but instinctively forbore direct remonstrance. Mrs. St, John's
                     power of fascination, her ceaseless efforts to draw Katherine into the circle
                     in which she herself delighted to move, and the soft grace with which she
                     turned aside whatever objection he occasionally interposed when some new
                     entertainment was talked of, quite baffled him. He resolved to await his
                     cousin's departure, hoping that with that much desired era he might once more
                     find his wife all his own.</p>
                  <p>Philosophize as we may about the folly of yielding to social compulsions, they
                     exert immense power over us all; and, once within their charmed circle, escape
                     requires a degree of resolution possessed by few. Why did not Henry Ellis at
                     once reinstate his household gods, and banish by a word the unconscious
                     troubler of his peace? Why did he allow his wife—young, beautiful, and
                     inexperienced—to be caught in the vortex of fashionable life, which his soul
                     detested?</p>
                  <p>These were perhaps some of the reasons: Mrs. St. John's annual visit was
                     usually a short one; she was a widow, and Henry one of her very few surviving
                     relations. She was not a person of evil intentions, and her manner was so
                     gentle and persuasive that to offend her would have seemed brutal. There was
                     nothing of positive and obvious evil threatened; Katherine's manners were so
                     pure and unexceptionable that no breath of slander could approach her; her
                     husband could only object to some loss of her society, and as this was
                     voluntary on her part, his pride demurred a little at the thought of complaint.
                     He suffered certainly some feeling of estrangement; his affection was
                     disappointed, but of this Katherine seemed and was wholly unconscious, because
                     she really knew little of the nature of deep and exclusive attachment. In this
                     way the thing went on from day to day, Mrs. St. John ruling and overruling,
                     Ellis secretly uncomfortable, not to say miserable, and—Katherine perfectly
                     happy.</p>
                  <p>Upon the intimacy of the two young men there seemed to be scarcely any check
                     within the power of Mr. Ellis. He advised George, continually, and endeavored
                     to induce him to pursue<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7024-00000070"/> his studies
                     with some regularity; but without apparent perverseness, the young man yet
                     managed to elude the kind care of his brother-in-law. Brothers-in-law are not
                     usually very bold or very welcome advisers of young men. Aunt Susan and Uncle
                     Ashmore were alarmed and unhappy, and remonstrated, but with as little effect.
                     George's friend, Mr. Deane, who might in his prime have had an influence over
                     George for good, had been so weakened by affliction that he aggravated the evil
                     by supplying him with the money required for a participation in young St.
                     John's expensive habits. Expense was the worst feature of those habits as yet;
                     vice was only in perspective; but such expense would have been out of the
                     question for George, without the injudicious indulgence of Mr. Deane. Riding
                     and driving, trying and buying, comparing and exchanging horses, formed the
                     present passion of Eugene, and in these fancies he found a ready coadjutor in
                     George, characteristically inclined to the same indulgence; and the two young
                     men immediately drew about them several of like tastes and worse ones—the very
                     companions from whose influence and example George Fountain, with his personal
                     advantages, his facility and his disposition to pleasure, required to be most
                     carefully shielded.</p>
                  <p>Before the day fixed for Mrs. St. John's departure arrived, she began to
                     complain of her eyes. She could not imagine how she had injured them! but those
                     who observed her late hours and her general imprudence and self-indulgence, did
                     not find it very surprising that they exhibited symptoms of inflammation. Here
                     was a calamity! A celebrated oculist was immediately consulted, a dark room was
                     prescribed, and a whole row of vials displayed. Such curtainings and
                     screenings! such contrivings of delicate nourishment, that the doctor's views
                     and Mrs. St. John's might be made to harmonize, the former forbidding every
                     thing but what was simple, the latter resolutely determined to taste nothing
                     that was not delicious. The house was like a hospital, although the disease was
                     no more severe than many a woman in different circumstances finds compatible
                     with the full performance of all her household duties. Katherine was wholly
                     taken up with her friend's misfortune, and learned to speak of it in terms no
                     less exaggerated than her own; while Ellis felt almost reconciled to the
                     prolongation of the visit, by the circumstance which kept both ladies at
                     home.</p>
                  <p>But George Fountain paid dearer for the detention, for he became more and more
                     deeply acquainted and engaged with a set of dissolute young men, decent in
                     exterior, but in reality infected with every vice. Ellis in vain endeavored to
                     keep advised of his movements, and to convince Mr. Deane of the danger of his
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">protégé.</foreign> Mr. Deane contented himself with
                     the hackneyed observation that 'young men will be young men,' continued to
                     supply George with money, and allowed it to be generally understood that he
                     meant to make him his heir.</p>
                  <p>This gave the finishing stroke to George Fountain's self-restraint. Mr. Deane
                     had indeed but a moderate fortune, but to a young man who had never had command
                     of money it seemed inexhaustible. A short career of extravagance proved
                     perfectly intoxicating to George's unbalanced mind, and before the state of
                     Mrs. St. John's eyes permitted her departure, he had launched out into the most
                     absurd expenses, and become one of the leaders of the set in whose wake he had
                     at first timidly followed. Dress was with him a mania, although he professed to
                     dislike ladies' society; to be 'stylish' had become his highest ambition, and
                     the imitation of 'fast' men his only study. Even<pb n="138-139"

                     secretly feared a moral change for the worse; although she habitually defended
                     her brother from what she called and thought the severe judgment of her
                     husband, more experienced friends regarded George and his pursuits and his
                     companions with grief and foreboding. The experience of Mr. and Mrs. Ashmore,
                     joined with their unworldly purity of estimate, filled them with the saddest
                     prognostics.</p>
                  <p>"He will be just like his father! said Aunt Susan, weeping. Unhappy the son of

                     ceased. "I have heard of a young lady who after much flutter and announcement

                  <p>They were so, of course, for could they expect human nature to endure another

                     these things."</p>
                  <p>Fate selected Mr. Shelton next, and it was in vain he urged that the chapter
                     contributed by Egeria ought to satisfy the law—husband and wife being one. He
                     was entangled in long wreaths of grape-vine, and led to the House of Industry
                     by laughing girls, while Mr. Berry, enjoying his reluctance, cried— <q>

                  <p>Once more in undisputed possession of his wife's society, Henry Ellis set about
                     a return to the habits of life that had been productive of so much happiness
                     before Mrs. St. John's arrival. Masters were recalled, the library restored to
                     its proper calm, and the morning hours once more devoted to improvement. But
                     where was the presiding spirit of the place and hour? Her graceful semblance
                     indeed was there; she would not unamiably resist her husband's wishes; but she
                     could not recall her interest in the pursuits which had begun to charm her
                     before she ate of the tree of the knowledge of admiration and excitement. Music
                     alone she continued to pursue with enthusiasm<pb n="140-141"
                        xml:id="VAC7024-00000072"/> asm, because she liked it; that she did not like
                     other things was now quite sufficient reason for declining to attend to them.
                     George, taking shelter under her example, disliked almost every thing too; and
                     Ellis had the vexation of finding his wishes thwarted and his judgment
                     practically contemned, by those whom of all others he sought to benefit. He
                     remonstrated, but Katherine only wept, and George pouted. He offered to make
                     any change in plans, modes or teachers, but nothing was proposed. This passive
                     resistance was too much for even his patience, and he gave up. He returned
                     gradually to his own favorite employments, and left his wife to hers, not
                     without a feeling of disappointment, as if a cloud had come between him and the
                     sun of his life. With George, however, he continued to struggle, as he would
                     have done with a predetermined suicide. He accomplished at last the great
                     object of removing the young man into the family of a clergyman in the country,
                     with whom he was to study for at least one year, Mr. Deane promising that
                     during that period his now adopted son should receive no money beyond a certain
                     stipulated allowance, sufficient for necessary expenses.</p>
                  <p>When it was time for the gay world to retreat into the country for the summer,
                     Ellis proposed to his wife a tour which should embrace several of the most
                     striking points of interest, and give him at the same time an opportunity of
                     introducing her to a beloved sister, whom the accidents of life had placed in a
                     remote county, where she lived in that sort of unsuperfluous state which, while
                     it allows comfort, forbids much journeying, and renders the occasional visit of
                     a dear friend balm for a whole year.</p>
                  <p>"My sister will be delighted to see you," said he, "and she really has a right
                     to see you. I engage beforehand that you shall love her, for you cannot help
                     it. She is the most loveable creature in the world, and I long to see the two
                     beings I love best together. Then you have never seen the White Mountains, nor
                     the Lakes, nor Niagara—"</p>
                  <p>"Nor any thing," said Katherine; "but I was in hopes you would be disposed to
                     go to S——Mrs. Ainslie and Mrs. Hartington and Madame de Blainville are going
                     there, and all the Prestons and Miss Demarest—every body, in short."</p>
                  <p>If there was any thing that the soul of Henry Ellis hated, it was a mere
                     fashionable watering place, with "every body" for society—a summer sojourn
                     which owes its sole charm to the momentary caprice of a few leaders of <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">ton;</foreign> without recommendations of scenery, of
                     healthfulness, of agreeable walks and rides, or any thing else that rational
                     human beings should consider in choosing a place of retreat from the wearing
                     excitements and unhandsome emulations of the city.</p>
                  <p>"O Katherine," he said, "is it possible you can like such a place as S——!
                     Surely, dear love, you have had enough of the fatigue of company and dress this
                     winter! You are thin—you need recruiting—repose."</p>
                  <p>"Travelling is not repose, I am sure," said Katherine, with an air somewhat
                     tinctured with displeasure. "If you think I need nothing but repose, we had
                     better stay at home."</p>
                  <p>Ellis felt pained by her manner, and by her forgetting to notice his desire to
                     visit his sister. She remembered this afterwards, and said she would make his
                     sister a visit if he wished it,—and with this rather ungracious consent he
                     contented himself as best he might. The result was a sort of compromise,—six
                     weeks at S——, and then a short tour and the proposed visit.</p>
                  <pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7024-00000073"/>
                  <p>Katherine was soon immersed in preparations for this summer recreation. She had
                     very little time for her husband or Aunt Susan, and complained every evening of
                     fatigue.</p>
                  <p>"What <emph>can</emph> you have to do?" said Aunt Susan; "I am sure, darling,
                     you had every thing heart could wish, only last fall, and you have had a good
                     many new dresses since."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, I haven't a thing fit to wear at S——," said Katherine; "ladies dress
                     superbly there. Mr. Fitzgerald says that a breakfast at S——is like Madame
                     Florette's show-rooms."</p>
                  <p>"It seems to me I wouldn't go there, then," said simple Aunt Susan. "It must be
                     more trouble than it's worth."</p>
                  <p>This remark was received in silence.</p>
                  <p>"What kind of people do you meet there, dear?" continued Mrs. Ashmore.</p>
                  <p>"O, the first people in town—"</p>
                  <p>"But do you like them particularly?"</p>
                  <p>Katherine hesitated a little. She had not asked herself this.</p>
                  <p>"I do not know that I like them especially, but one likes to be in the best
                     society, and I certainly see nothing wrong about fashionable people."</p>
                  <p>"If we should ask ourselves whether the same persons, divested of the air of
                     fashion, would be our chosen companions,"—Ellis began—</p>
                  <p>"I do not think that would be fair," said Katherine, with a slight flush. "The
                     air of fashion is a charm, of itself. People of fashion are graceful and
                     elegant. They understand life, and know how to make it agreeable. I am sure you
                     do not like coarse people any better than I do."</p>
                  <p>"But does the only choice lie between coarse people and people of fashion,
                     dear? There are many cultivated and refined people who have no desire to belong
                     to the fashionable world, and who borrow no charm from it."</p>
                  <p>"I cannot find them," said Katherine, pettishly; "I know plenty of disagreeable
                     good people, but I find no pleasure in their society."</p>
                  <p>Aunt Susan sighed.</p>
                  <p>"If all good people were like you, dear Aunty,"—she added, repenting; "but some
                     of them are <emph>so</emph> unlovely!"</p>
                  <p>"There are worse sins than sins against taste," said Mr. Ellis. "Allowing that
                     good people are not as careful to be agreeable as they ought to be, it may
                     still be a question whether our virtue is not safer in their company. The
                     experience of the world says yes. It tells us of the insidious evils of a life
                     of pleasure."</p>
                  <p>"You speak as if pleasure meant vice," said Katherine; "I think it means
                     beauty, and grace, and innocent excitement,—whatever gratifies our taste
                     without doing any body harm."</p>
                  <p>"I quite agree with you, dear," Ellis replied, willing to soothe the irritation
                     which he saw reddening the cheek of his beloved; "there is only a question of
                     amount between us. Our estimate is the same, but I should perhaps differ a
                     little from you as to the prominence to be given to pleasure as a pursuit. I
                     enjoy it most when it comes incidentally, and as the result of other pursuits,
                     and I cannot but think you will one day do so too."</p>
                  <p>He stopped, for he hated to seem to lecture, and his wife forbore to reply, for
                     she did not wish to be convinced. A moment after, he asked,—</p>
                  <p>"Kate, dear, did you ever read Wordsworth's Ode to Duty?"</p>
                  <p>Katherine said "No."</p>

                     towards him, went on: <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">

                        </lg>
                     </q> Katherine smiled up into her husband's face through her tears, feeling,
                     she knew not why, as if a new chord had been struck between them. How often is
                     poetry the interpreter between heart and heart that might otherwise be slow to
                     understand each other!</p>

                     you? Naughty girl! I set you the whole Ode to Duty as a task, and command you

                     the world in remembrance of his means; it helps the deformities of nature,
                     gives lustre to her beauties, and makes a continual holiday where it shines.'

                  <p>Katherine was not above half satisfied with this gay answer. She detected in it
                     something Iike contempt for the pursuits of which her heart confessed the
                     charm. But the affection that glowed and sparkled in her husband's eyes almost
                     consoled her for the satire. Aunt Susan inquired about the journey and the time
                     of return.</p>
                  <p>"And George is not to come home until October?"</p>

                  <p>"You will certainly be here in time for Mary's marriage?"</p>
                  <p>"Certainly—without fail! Nothing would tempt me to miss dear Mary's
                     marriage."</p>
                  <p>Mary Ashmore was to be married in October to a junior partner of her father,
                     "not rich," Aunt Susan said, "but good!" Dear, good Aunt Susan! who had been
                     able to live half way through this gilded, tinsel, hard world of ours, not only
                     uncorrupted by its cold and false maxims, but absolutely untinged by its
                     pervading colors. Katherine, though partaking of her nature, had yet some

                  <p>In its best aspect, life at a fashionable watering-place is a scene of
                     "strenuous idleness." Days undivided by regular employment are necessarily
                     long, and it therefore becomes an object to kill Time. Towards this all
                     ingenuity is directed—self-interest stimulating the invention of hotel-keepers,
                     and necessity that of their guests,—until at length killing Time becomes a
                     pursuit, and thus satisfying—in some sort—the craving of nature, appeases her
                     reproaches. We have heard of gentlemen racing snails, and betting on push-pin,
                     and ladies playing jack-straws and gambling privately for <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">bonbons,</foreign> as resources against <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">ennui</foreign> at a watering-place; but these stories must
                     refer to more simple and innocent days than ours. Idleness is no longer the
                     worst sin laid at the door of fashionable summer retreats. Idleness is
                     supposed, in some codes, to be a very commendable thing, in summer; a wholesome
                     let-up after the laborious excitement of the winter; a salutary sleep of the
                     over-wearied powers, driven to their utmost tension during the remainder of the
                     year; and, perhaps, allowing the strain to be necessary, the unbending of the
                     bow is necessary too. But idleness is a medicine that must be pure in order to
                     be efficacious. It will not do mixed with the most pernicious stimulants—the
                     concentrated essence of the drugs that did the mischief. We cannot cure the
                     effect of late hours, homœopathically, by sitting up later; neutralize the
                     extravagance of the winter by the greater extravagance of the summer, or wipe
                     out, by new flirtations, the scandal of the old; nor can we atone for the
                     unwholesome practices of nine months of the twelve, by still greater outrages
                     upon nature during the other three. Rural retirement is indeed salutary to
                     jaded spirits; rural sights and sounds are balm to world-wearied senses; rural
                     quiet a life-spring to exhausted brains. But it is the farm-house, or the
                     plain, rural residence, or the exhilarating tour; not the gay season at a great
                     hotel, that can yield these. Contrast the life of fashion at a watering-place,
                     haunted by those who seek in the country only a meaner city, with this
                     beautiful picture of summer hours renewing a mind worn with noble labors. <q>

                  <p>No wonder that Katherine and her husband came to such different opinions as to
                     the best way of passing the summer, when his ideal was that of the poet, while
                     hers was shaped by the counsels—conscious and unconscious—of—Mrs. St. John.</p>

                  <p>"The sources of thought multiply beyond calculation the sources of feeling,
                     and, mingled, they rush together in a torrent deep and strong."</p>
                  <p>Much of cultivation must yet pass into the murmuring current of our young
                     wife's thoughts, before she will discover her true self. Certain vases of rare
                     and delicate device are so contrived as not to disclose their most precious
                     beauty until wine is poured into them, and a lamp's rays set streaming through
                     their magic enamelling. High romantic lore was the wine that Katherine's nature
                     needed, and Love the lamp that must give life to her loveliness. At present the
                     outward filled and occupied her wholly—not, indeed, without an occasional
                     misgiving as to the dignity and permanence of her pleasures, but with an
                     intoxication that drowned importunate thoughts. Her husband, seeing her error,
                     waited with a noble patience for the awakening. Firm in his creed that beauty
                     so harmonious as hers must have a deep and sacred significance, he watched the
                     fusing elements of her character, as the alchemist of old time gazed
                     reverentially into the crucible which was to give to his longing eyes pure gold
                     or the solvent of all mysteries. The image of what she would be was drawn so
                     clearly on his heart, that whatever seemed for the moment to differ from it was
                     but as a passing shadow, sure to leave the picture unchanged, or only the
                     brighter for the momentary eclipse, Katherine felt some secret undefined
                     consciousness of this, and had already learned to seek approbation in her
                     husband's eye, or to avoid that eye when she felt it would not give the
                     response she began to covet; but the bewildering round of emptiness in which
                     she was now engaged, drew her, by new attractions, further and further from
                     this her better home and centre, and the people with whom she associated ated
                     managed very soon to give her husband in her eyes the air of a sort of
                     Mentor—of undeniable wisdom, but given to inconvenient applications of it; a
                     person to be propitiated rather than satisfied; one who mistook lack of
                     sympathy for disapprobation, and incapacity to enjoy for moral distaste. Like a
                     child's fairy pinnace on a summer sea, Katherine flitted before the silly gale;
                     but there was all the while, lying under the waves, a strong though slender
                     thread, leading to a kind and judicious hand, ever ready to draw the frail bark
                     to its haven of safety oh the approach of danger.</p>
                  <p>Happy wife! to be so loved by such a heart. Happy husband! whose calm Love
                     itself could not unbalance; whose tenderness was not weakness, nor his guiding
                     restraint; who could respect difference and wait for assimilation; tempering
                     decision with indulgence, and jealously watching his own deepest convictions
                     lest they should tend to oppression.</p>

                  <p>Thus ended the chapter of Mr. Shelton, on which the judges took occasion to
                     quiz him a little, because he seemed so knowing about the tactics of married
                     life, and especially the whims and perverseness of young wives.</p>
                  <p>"O, my wife helped me, you know!" he said; "she knew by instinct all about
                     being perverse, although she has not begun to practise it yet. I consider it
                     very fortunate that I hit upon just such a subject; 'forewarned forearmed,' you
                     know. I have her renunciation of all that's naughty, under her own hand."</p>

                  <p>"It is too bad," she said, "that I, who know nothing of married life, should be
                     fated to this chapter, where of course our young wife must behave shockingly.
                     It will really go against my convictions, for it seems as if it would be easy
                     to be good, with such a husband."</p>
                  <p>"Don't you know that your very good men always have bad wives?" said Mrs.
                     Whipple—</p>
                  <p>"What a horrible libel upon our sex!" exclaimed Mrs. Marston. "If you mean
                     weakly indulgent men, who are too indolent to treat their wives as if they were
                     rational beings, I agree with you; but I do not call those good husbands! A
                     certain kind of indulgence is merely covert insult to the supposed weakness and
                     incompetency of the woman. I think our 'Woman's Rights' people quite right in
                     protesting against consideration which is not respect."</p>
                  <p>"But we are not making our hero a merely indulgent husband—"</p>
                  <p>"Pray make him a man, while you are about it;" said Mr. Ingoldsby, "not a
                     milk-sop, so in love with his wife's pretty face that he makes a baby of
                     her!"</p>

                     Elinor, laughing.</p>
                  <p>"A fine sturdy fellow, with a will of his own," said the old gentleman; "one

                     This Ellis lets every body walk over him."</p>
                  <p>"Wait for the end," said the several authors—and Mr. Ingoldsby seemed quite

                  <p>"Be prudent, dearest," said the anxious husband, at parting; "you are in a nest

                     hundreds, where the utmost vulgarity of manners and costume made elegance look
                     tame, and taste faded, in comparison; her, for whose privacy no drawing-room

                     stared at by smoking men. The shadowy and shrinking feebleness of last winter
                     was changed into a defensive manner, as of one who must be prepared for

                  <p>"Decidedly not," Mrs. St. John said; "a party of pleasure meant going away
                     somewhere, while this was to be held within doors. A party of pleasure involved
                     risks, quite out of the question in this case; and <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >tableaux</foreign> in particular, though rather out of fashion, were so
                     elegant, when properly (i. e. expensively) done, and so free from all objection
                     even to the most fastidious, that they could not be included in Mr. Ellis's
                     prohibition."</p>
                  <p>"It was not prohibition," Katherine said; "it was only advice."</p>
                  <p>"All the same thing, my dear! A husband's advice is like a royal
                     invitation—equivalent to a command. But as these tab leaux cannot possibly be
                     construed into an infringement of the <q>
                        <l>Awful rule, supremacy and sway,</l>
                     </q> that you seem to think his prerogative, I hope you will not refuse and so
                     disoblige us all. It must require an immense amount of amiability to be so
                     submissive! Happily for me, my poor husband <emph>liked</emph> me to be
                     independent. He never interfered with my wishes any more than I did with his.
                     He thought me quite competent to judge for myself."</p>
                  <p>"I dare say you were so," said Katherine; "I am not so sure with regard to
                     myself."</p>
                  <p>"What sweet meekness! You are really the model wife, I declare!"</p>
                  <p>"Henry has had so much more experience," said Katherine, "and his judgment is
                     so much better than mine, that I always feel bound to obey his wishes."</p>
                  <p>"Obey! oh dear! I thought <emph>that</emph> word was forgotten, by even the
                     most dutiful wives."</p>
                  <p>"Call it what you will," replied Katherine, who felt a little mortified at
                     having used so old-fashioned an expression, "I think it right to be guided by
                     his advice."</p>
                  <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7024-00000079"/>
                  <p>"Your good aunt brought you up charmingly, my dear, and your husband ought to
                     be much obliged to her for it. But why will you put such things in his head?
                     This is the very time to establish your position; if you begin now—and of your
                     own accord—for I am sure Henry does not desire it,—to play the child towards
                     him, you must do it all your life, for men never yield an inch once
                     gained."</p>
                  <p>This idea of competition was new to Katherine, but it did not wholly displease
                     her. Mrs. St John was so much older than herself, and had seen so much of the
                     world, that her opinions carried a sort of weight with them, especially as they
                     almost always favored Katherine's inclinations. So the tableaux carried it, the
                     more easily as there was a possibility that Ellis might return before the day
                     proposed.</p>
                  <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>"Here is the list," said Mrs. St John, as she came into Katherine's room, after
                     breakfast the next morning. "'Joan of Arc in prison'—(Mrs. Vandewater will take
                     that, I know; her tall masculine figure and black hair will just do.)
                     'Buckingham and Fenella'—(that was contrived to give a character to Miss
                     Pyne—the great fortune—she will be magnificently dressed, and she's a dwarf,
                     you know;) 'Paul Clifford and his Companions, drinking'—(that's for the young
                     men.) 'Faust and Margaret' was proposed, but that's so common now, you
                     know—"</p>
                  <p>Katherine had never even heard of the characters.</p>
                  <p>"It isn't possible!" Mrs. St. John said. "Next comes 'Greek fugitives after the
                     massacre of Scio'—that will afford opportunity for most picturesque
                     dresses."</p>
                  <p>"And where are these dresses to come from at such short notice?" asked
                     Katherine.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, many of us have fancy dresses, from former occasions, and every body has
                     things that can be altered. Besides, many elegant materials can be had here.
                     Your maid will easily make up any thing you will want."</p>
                  <p>"What character is proposed for me?"</p>
                  <p>"We thought of the parting of Thekla and Max, in Wallenstein."</p>
                  <p>"A parting! but who would be Max?"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Mansfield—or indeed any of the tall handsome young men—"</p>
                  <p>"O, indeed you must excuse me!" cried Katherine, blushing; "any thing of that
                     kind would be quite out of the question. I could not think of it!"</p>
                  <p>"Don't be prudish, my dear! You have only to stand in attitudes, looking at
                     each other."</p>
                  <p>But Katherine's natural sense of propriety had warned her, and she stood firm
                     here. "You must think of something else," she said.</p>
                  <p>"Well, there is 'Exchanging old Lamps for new ones;' the Princess giving
                     Aladin's lamp to the old magician disguised as a pedler. That allows a
                     magnificent Turkish dress; and Mr. Sandford, who has been so many years in the
                     East, has a book of Oriental costumes, and can give you every instruction. Miss
                     Morgan and her faithful swain, Mr. Pratt, will be delighted to do Max and
                     Thekla."</p>
                  <p>The dress of unlimited sumptuousness decided Katherine, who undertook the
                     Princess Badroul Boudour, and with the aid of Mr. Sandford's costumes and
                     exquisite suggestions, and the nimble<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7024-00000080"
                     /> ble fingers of the most invaluable of French maids, she was arrayed in robes
                     of glory that would have satisfied the Princess herself. Her dark hair, partly
                     bound in a silver net, was braided and tasselled with pearls, and her bosom
                     covered with jewels, row after row, till the the last, with its gorgeous
                     solitaire, fell below her waist. No glaring colors extinguished the delicacy of
                     her complexion. All was white, except the 'jelick' of rose and silver, and a
                     loose-sleeved robe of soft purple, that gave beautiful relief to the splendors
                     of the rest. Rich bracelets, and a fan of white down, the handle of which was
                     studded with amethysts, finished the costume. No wonder Mrs. St John declared
                     Katherine 'lovely as a dream;' no wonder Katherine's mirror confirmed the
                     sentence.</p>
                  <p>Nothing was spared in the arrangements. Practised hands took care of every
                     particular, and not a point was neglected. Soft, preparative music filled the
                     intervals of darkness and anticipation, and when the curtain was withdrawn, a
                     fine manly voice recited a few lines of poetry, dimly tracing out the sentiment
                     of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tableau</foreign> to be announced. When the
                     company were placed, a few notes from the trumpet commanded silence, Wild,
                     exulting music, dying into a wail of sorrow, ushered in these verses: <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"Heavenly guardian, maiden wonder!</l>

                           <l>When thou camest, clad in thunder,</l>

                        </lg>
                     </q> And Joan of Arc was announced.</p>
                  <p>The light and the darkness were so admirably managed that the illusion was
                     almost perfect, and as the curtain closed on the heroic captive, kneeling on
                     her straw,—her hands crossed on her bosom, her long hair lying as it were dead
                     on her shoulders, and her eyes upturned in prayer,—a tempest of applause shook
                     the place. "Encore! Encore!" was the cry—but there were to be no encores, which
                     are always of questionable policy in <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >tableaux;</foreign> so the trumpet sounded and the music went on; in a
                     strain half frolic, half sad, introducing Buckingham and Fenella—the courtier
                     in a costume of faultless elegance—the fairy figure before him half enveloped
                     in a veil of silver gauze, just lifted by two snowy arms, so as to show a
                     magnificent dress, and a very sweet face, not quite fiery enough for Fenella's.
                     This picture, too, was very successful.</p>
                  <p>Next came Max and Thekla—pale, desolate, despairing; with music of Beethoven
                     and these wailing verses: <q>
                        <lg type="stanza">
                           <l>"A grief without a pang—void, dark, and drear;</l>

                           <l rend="ti-1">Which finds no natural outlet or relief,</l>
                           <l>In word, or sigh, or tear.</l>

                           <l>Thou Holy One! call thy child away!</l>

                        </lg>
                     </q> The performers of this scene were indeed an affianced pair, kept in long
                     suspense by the tenacious vitality of some unhappy uncle or aunt, whose shoes
                     they felt obliged to wait for; so of course their personation of Max and Thekla
                     gave rise to many a joke—for to your fashionable joker nothing is sacred. They
                     made a very effective picture, but as the subject forbade the charm of dress,
                     it fell rather coldly after the dazzling scene that preceded. A few young
                     lovers in their secret hearts felt its<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7024-00000081"

                     next,—Paul Clifford and his robber friends, carousing. This was ushered in by
                     no very sentimental strains, but by a symphony that sounded very much like the
                     old Irish song,—"Fill the bumper fair!" The poetry was evidently designed to
                     hint at some refinement of the original idea of the scene; it is hardly in the
                     spirit of Paul Clifford's carouse: <q>

                  <p>Behind the curtain, meanwhile, a difficulty had arisen. Miss Henderson, who was

                     hysterical, some said), and could not be ready, and the exquisite classic
                     drapery which had been prepared for her was going a begging for a wearer. It
                     was soon discovered that it would fit nobody but Mrs. Ellis, if she would be

                  <p>Katherine was very reluctant, but she had not learned to say no! so she was

                  <p>Far lovelier than her eastern gorgeousness was this calm, simple, Greek

                     characters as possible.</p>
                  <p>At the conclusion of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tableaux</foreign> the
                     ball-room was thrown open, and dancing commenced, the characters of the evening
                     appearing in their fancy dresses. Katherine, surrounded by admirers, and
                     excited by the events of the evening, was the heroine of the hour. Her manner
                     had lost none of its quietness, but the flush on her cheek and the dazzling
                     brilliancy of her eye confessed the intoxicating power of admiration. Mrs. St.
                     John fed the flame unweariedly; Katherine, she declared, was herself for the
                     first time.</p>
                  <p>"The world has never known you yet, my dear! You have passed for a pretty
                     woman; but hereafter you are stamped as a beauty. You may do as you like after
                     this. Nothing too <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bizarre</foreign> for a beauty!"</p>
                  <p>"Mrs. Ellis, allow me to introduce one of Paul Clifford's<pb n="162-163"
                        xml:id="VAC7024-00000083"/> companions," said Eugene St. John, bringing
                     George Fountain to his sister.</p>
                  <p>"George!" was all that Katherine could say.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, to be sure! why, you're not a bit glad to see me! This is giving a
                     pleasant surprise to one's sister with a vengeance! What the deuce ails you,
                     Kate? Afraid father Ellis won't like it, eh? can't help it—he must learn."</p>
                  <p>"But your promise, dear George," said Katherine, almost in tears. "You promised
                     positively—"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, promises made under compulsion are not binding, you know! We have Paley's
                     authority for that. When I was in the screws between Ellis and Mr. Deane, I
                     would have promised any thing, rather than be lectured any longer. But never
                     mind all that! You are splendid to-night, I feel really proud of you. Everybody
                     is talking about you."</p>
                  <p>Katherine blushed. "Hush, George I don't be so foolish. You haven't told me yet
                     how you happened to come."</p>
                  <p>"O, a bird of the air carried the matter—I heard there were to be goings-on
                     here, and I thought I would pop in upon you. You did not see me at Paul
                     Clifford's table, did you?"</p>
                  <p>"No—surely—"</p>
                  <p>"I was there, snug enough, but I sat back, for fear seeing me unexpectedly
                     might confuse you when your turn came."</p>
                  <p>Katherine's excitement, which had not from the first been without a secret
                     background of uneasiness, had reached its height and was at the turning-point
                     when George presented himself, and this occurrence hastened on the hour of
                     depression; so that when to the world without she seemed at the top of her
                     triumph, she was in reality already paying dear for it. She was too
                     inexperienced to know why, but the events of the evening began now to assume a
                     different aspect, and she was ready to condemn herself for entering into the
                     matter at all during her husband's absence. While envy, hatred and malice and
                     all uncharitableness, were waked into sudden life by her supposed usurpation of
                     all the honors, she went to bed thoroughly sick of herself and every body about
                     her, and when she arose in the morning and found that George and his companions
                     had thought proper to 'make a night of it'—construing into night all the hours
                     until sunrise—she began at once to wish for her husband's return, and to dread
                     the thought of his coming. She had slightly mentioned the plan for <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">tableaux</foreign> when she wrote him, but in his daily
                     letter he had not once alluded to the subject; and though she had disregarded
                     this silent objection, which she nevertheless understood, yet in the retrospect
                     it made her unhappy. So powerful an influence had the firm and manly character
                     of Ellis established already in the mind of his young wife, in the midst of
                     boundless indulgence.</p>
                  <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>Two days longer elapsed before Mr. Ellis returned—quite long enough to allow
                     the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tableaux</foreign> party to have ripened its fruit
                     of scandal, misunderstanding and endless tattle-tattle. First of all was the
                     story of a miserable scene of debauch, in which George Fountain, who had been
                     attracted to S——by the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tableaux,</foreign> was the head
                     and front, and next came a furious enmity on the part of Miss Henderson against
                     all and several who had been accessory to the transfer of her part of Calypso o
                     Mrs. Ellis. She was "perfectly well—only a little agitated—and would have been
                     ready in a few moments, when Mrs. St. John and Mrs. Preston<pb n="164-165"
                        xml:id="VAC7024-00000084"/> seized the opportunity and the excuse to thrust
                     Mrs. Ellis into it! And Mrs. Ellis was very ready to consent,—not satisfied
                     with having the most magnificent dress of all for her own character, she must
                     snatch at the classic one too! the thing was too plain!" And a considerable
                     party of gossips of no particular charmingness took part with the injured
                     damsel.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand the war was maintained none the less keenly that the party
                     most concerned refrained from all share in it. It was said that envy or
                     jealousy of the Princess Badroul Boudour was the soul cause of Miss Henderson's
                     hysterics, and that she would have controlled them if she had thought any one
                     else—above all Mrs. Ellis—would be found to take her place, as that baffled her
                     plan of creating a sensation by the omission of one of the scenes promised in
                     the programme—etc.</p>
                  <p>As this was the only quarrel that concerned our heroine, we omit specification
                     of the rest, but they were many.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. St. John in vain endeavored to persuade Katherine to be very guarded in
                     her account of matters to her husband, and above all to conceal from him the
                     visit and disgrace of George Fountain. The first mention of the subject brought
                     a rush of tears to the young wife's eyes, and she forstalled the grave
                     objections she sometimes dreaded, by giving her husband a full history of the
                     affair from beginning to end, and taking shame and blame to herself for having
                     been induced to appear in so public a way without his presence for her shield
                     and safety. Mrs. St. John, whose ideas on some points were, like those of many
                     persons of her stamp, more vulgar than she fancied, was shocked to hear
                     Katherine say, weeping—"I will never do so again, Henry—never!" It was so
                     childish! she said, but Mr. Ellis thought it most womanly; and he felt that his
                     wife had never looked lovelier than when, with gentle eyes overflowing, she
                     thus threw herself upon his tenderness, and owned her need of aid and counsel,
                     in matters which, to coarser apprehensions, might have seamed to need none. And
                     when, as new scandals had their fungous growth out of the first, her delicacy
                     received still deeper wounds, through cruel imputations and the insinuations of
                     malicious tongues, and she begged her husband to take her from a scene which
                     had now and forever lost all its charm for her, he blessed the seeming chance
                     which had brought about this salutary lesson—a lesson which had done more
                     towards unveiling to Katherine the real spirit of the society in which she had
                     been ambitious to move, than whole homilies of advice and warning from her best
                     friends could have done. There are no lessons like those we give ourselves.</p>

                     feelings by Mrs. Ellis, Mr. Ellis observed in the papers a notice of her

                  <p>Piercefield was a little, commonplace, country village, boasting few people of
                     any pretension to cultivation, but situated in a romantically beautiful part of
                     the country, where, if any where, Nature might be considered as making amends
                     for the want of a more attractive human interest. Mr. Dudley, the
                     brother-in-law of Henry Ellis, had a large farm on the outskirts of the
                     village; a farm so large that it absorbed all its own proceeds year by year,
                     since the only way to make it at all profitable was to cultivate it upon a
                     large scale. This, in a region where domestic service is considered a
                     degradation, involved a most onerous amount of care and labor on the part of
                     the mistress, a devoted wife and mother, who had thrown herself wholly into her
                     husband's plans, and sacrificed herself to the rebuilding of his fortune and
                     credit without reserve. Katherine found Mrs. Dudley a woman still in the prime
                     of life; past the dewy freshness of her beauty, but hardly less lovely in its
                     maturity. The principal charm of her face to the common observer was<q>

                           <l>A smile that turns the sunny side o' the heart</l>

                        </lg>
                     </q> but there was a depth of expression behind that smile such as belongs to a
                     strong character only.</p>
                  <p>This lovely, equable temper and these cheerful spirits were very necessary to
                     Mr. Dudley, who, though a man of sense, had been so depressed by misfortune
                     that it required resolution of the strongest wing to bear him up. The children
                     looked up to their father with reverence, but they ran to their mother with
                     love and confidence; the whole vitality of the house seemed to flow from that

                  <p>It will readily be understood in what light such a sister would be regarded by
                     Henry Ellis, himself so warm, true, and good; of such a sunny temper and such
                     purity of intent. They met, after long separation, with a tenderness that only
                     the good and true can feel; each looked into the other's eyes with the sense of
                     a whole life's love and memory; and after a moment's inquiring pause—one
                     thought of the possible effect of those dividing years,—the recognition and the
                     union were perfect— <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>As when two dew-drops on the petal shake</l>
                           <l>To the same air, and tremble deeper down,</l>
                           <l>And slip at once, all fragrant, into one.</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q> Katherine, very susceptible of all extraneous influences, soon felt tne
                     power of this one—of goodness dignified by elegant manners and high
                     cultivation. The behavior of Mrs. Dudley under the most irksome duties, was a
                     daily lesson as well as a secret marvel to our young and over-indulged wife.
                     How such a woman—full of all elegant tastes and capacities—formed to<pb
                        n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7024-00000086"/> shine in the most refined
                     society—could bring herself to perform cheerfully the least attractive
                     household labors; to endure the most vulgar and stolid minds about her, and to
                     toil, conscientiously and without the appearance of disgust, for the
                     improvement of even the least hopeful subjects, was indeed wonderful; in any
                     country but ours it could hardly seem unaffected. She was a woman able and
                     willing to "die daily" to all she prized of outward grace, living all the while
                     the richest and most precious life within herself, and giving it out, without
                     stint, in blessing all around her. Katherine, who knew little of any but town
                     life, felt herself in a new and strange school, and betook herself to the
                     requisite study, very conscientiously.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Dudley was a man of many virtues, but also of a great, though unconscious
                     selfishness. Whatever his wife did for him or for others seemed to him no more
                     than her duty, because it accorded with her whole character; whatever he
                     himself did that was commendable had its full value in his eyes, to say the
                     least, perhaps from a secret consciousness of the effort it cost him to be
                     generous in a single instance. When two such characters as his meet in
                     matrimony, the friction ends in consuming flames, each claiming what the other
                     is least willing to grant; but where the selfishness of one is met by boundless
                     generosity in the other, there is fitting like that of the cast to the
                     mould—sharp points at one side finding suitable recessions on the opposite. No
                     pair could be better matched—on this principle—than Mr. and Mrs. Dudley; and
                     Henry Ellis, while he saw his brother-in-law's faults, had the satisfaction of
                     thinking his sister very happy. She felt that she was born "not to be
                     ministered unto, but to minister;" and she accepted her lot with wonderful
                     satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>So, too, the life they led at Piercefield seemed, to his better regulated
                     judgment, one of great respectability and usefulness, instead of a mere loss
                     and burial, as Katherine called it. Their fortune, moderate as it was, and
                     requiring the strictest economy, was much superior to that of their neighbors;
                     their cultivation and refinement, and of course their resources, infinitely
                     greater. Their influence, therefore, was powerful for good, even though the
                     people about them did not willingly defer to them. There is, unhappily, in the
                     ruder portions of this land of liberty of ours, an aversion to superiority of
                     any kind—especially to that of mind and manners; but as Providence has made the
                     influence of such superiority inevitable, it tells on even the most ungracious
                     subjects. Then Mrs. Dudley's extreme kindness of heart and manner; her devotion
                     to the sick and suffering; her generous disposition, and the simplicity with
                     which she was content to live, made her, personally, very popular, and gave the
                     greatest force to her kind hints and suggestions of improvement. Without the
                     harshness of Mrs. Mason, in the "Cottagers of Glenburnie," so long the type of
                     the lady Mentor in low and coarse life,—who is described as saying the rudest
                     things in her zeal to make people polite,—Mrs. Dudley contrived, in a thousand
                     ways, to contribute to the civilization of all who came in her way, principally
                     by example, but also by precept, when she could contrive to soften the implied
                     reproof by a tangible benefit. To fill a place like this, an instinct for doing
                     good must come in aid of principle; for daily and hourly occasion for the
                     exercise of a benevolence which seems small but is great, would weary any thing
                     but instinct.</p>
                  <p>Katherine, however, could hardly help looking upon such a life as that of Mrs.
                     Dudley with pity—almost horror. So contrary<pb n="170-171"
                        xml:id="VAC7024-00000087"/> trary was it to her own cherished ideal of
                     luxurious ease, so unsuited to the delicacy and refinement of her
                     sister-in-law, that she soon began to return, by a natural revulsion, to her
                     old ideas of fashionable life. The very morning after the arrival of the city
                     visitors, as the family sat at breakfast, an ill-looking man, rough as
                     Hyrcanian bear, came in, and with his hat on and an air of perfect <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">nonchalance,</foreign> demanded rather than asked, some
                     medicine or salve which Mrs. Dudley had been in the habit of supplying to his
                     wife, signifying at the same time that he was in a hurry and could not wait a
                     minute. Mrs. Dudley left her guests and attended to his wants immediately, as
                     if it had been the most natural and reasonable thing in the world—a proceeding
                     which brought Mrs. Dibble and the vexations of the Christmas dinner to our
                     young wife's mind. She soon found, however, that this was the rule, not the
                     exception, and that Mrs. Dudley was in the habit of sacrificing her own
                     pleasure, unreservedly, to the necessities of her poorer neighbors. On one of
                     these occasions she could not help saying—"I should think you would teach these
                     people better manners by letting them wait a little. One would suppose they
                     thought they were doing you a favor when they ask one."</p>
                  <p>"On the contrary," said Mrs. Dudley, "they never forget a kindness. What seems
                     to you rude carelessness, is often real, pressing haste, or only bashfulness,
                     which their pride makes them anxious to conceal. They are unwearied when we are
                     ill."</p>
                  <p>One morning a charming ride had been planned—the horses were standing saddled
                     at the door, and Katherine and Mrs. Dudley, both fully equipped <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">en Amazone,</foreign> and full of animation, were about to
                     set foot in hand for mounting, when a message came from a poor woman a mile
                     off, saying that her baby was very, very ill, and she hoped Mrs. Dudley would
                     come and see it.</p>
                  <p>"Ah," said Mrs. Dudley, "poor Mrs. Green! another of her little sufferers with
                     water on the brain, I dare say. Of course nothing can save it, but I cannot
                     refuse to go where my mere presence will give so much comfort. You will excuse
                     me, dear Katherine, I know, though you cannot share my sympathy with the
                     mother, not having seen her former distress on these occasions."</p>
                  <p>So saying she went quietly to change her dress; her horse was put up, and the
                     party went without her.</p>
                  <p>Another time, as soon as breakfast was over, Mrs. Dudley said—"This day shall
                     be yours! I have put aside or disposed of every thing that could interrupt us,
                     and we will have one day's solid, home enjoyment—always provided," she added,
                     checking herself, "that no poor soul has to be nursed. But I do not know of any
                     illness in the neighborhood. We will have such a nice time!"</p>
                  <p>A new book brought by Mr. Ellis was to be the groundwork of this nice time, and
                     the ladies with their sewing sat down to enjoy it, while Mr. Dudley kept
                     himself as quiet as he could, not going out of the room about some farm-care
                     more than once in ten or fifteen minutes. The air was delicious; a window
                     opening on the garden afforded the prospect of a flowery world, and admitted
                     its perfume; the birds were singing as if there were neither sin nor sorrow on
                     earth.</p>
                  <p>"I really envy you, Eliza," said Ellis, stopping to enjoy the scene. "There is
                     something in these aspects of nature that fills my mind with an indescribable
                     calm, and I cannot help fancying that one might here possess one's soul in
                     quiet, in a sense<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7024-00000088"/> hardly to be
                     expected in the city. Rural sights and sounds like these have an effect on my
                     whole being—"</p>
                  <p>"Is Miss Dudley at home?" said a voice in the entry, not rural exactly but
                     rustic—and in walked a lady and her little girl, to spend the day.</p>
                  <p>Here was a trial! No saying 'engaged' or 'not at home'; no guarding the avenues
                     and looking over the banisters!</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Dudley received the intruders so kindly that Katherine almost concluded
                     she must be perfectly indifferent to home comfort. The elder visitor took out
                     her knitting, and the little girl asked for something to eat. The carpet was
                     soon strewn with fragments of bread and butter. This, too, Mrs. Dudley bore
                     with equanimity, and even Katherine could not imagine it was because she was
                     indifferent to neatness.</p>
                  <p>The good lady began telling Mrs. Dudley the history of her troubles. Mr. Ellis
                     and Mr. Dudley walked out. Katherine soon fell asleep in her arm chair near the
                     window. When she awoke, the guest was still droning on, weeping occasionally;
                     Mrs. Dudley all attention and sympathy.</p>
                  <p>"Who could have given your son such bad advice, Mrs. Smith?" she was saying,
                     just as Katherine awoke; and Mrs. Smith began, nothing loth, on a new chapter
                     of accidents. The little girl was meanwhile amusing herself drumming on the
                     piano.</p>
                  <p>Katherine retreated to her room. "One must require no little obtuseness," she
                     soliloquized, "to endure such inflictions. Some people have no
                     sensitiveness!"</p>
                  <p>After a while Mrs. Dudley came to her. "Come down now, dear," she said, "poor
                     Mrs. Smith has gone to lie down awhile. The recital of her troubles has quite
                     overcome her, although it is a great comfort to her to find a listener. Her lot
                     has been a peculiarly hard one. She has been a willing martyr to her son's
                     children—two or three helpless little girls under the care of a very bad
                     step-mother, who, having one child of her own, seems to desire nothing so much
                     as to be rid of the others. If Mrs. Smith had a home to take them to, she would
                     gladly relieve the cruel woman of the burden; but her son has spent all her
                     property, and she can live nowhere but with him, although his affections are
                     totally alienated from her. She could support herself, but not without leaving
                     the children to their fate, which she cannot think of. The greatest earthly
                     comfort she has left is an occasional hour of talk with me, recounting the sad
                     circumstances of her darlings, and asking advice in ever new difficulties
                     occasioned by the manœuvres of an unprincipled and selfish woman. One of the
                     children is deaf and dumb, and on that account the object of especial dislike
                     to the step-mother, and solicitude to the grandmother. I am sorry she happened
                     to choose to-day, dear, but I could not refuse to give her what little
                     consolation is in my power."</p>
                  <p>Katherine's secret indignation against Mrs. Smith's troublesome troubles was a
                     little softened by this exposition, and when the story was repeated to her
                     husband his interest was immediately excited. He caused himself to be
                     introduced to Mr Smith, who was not so much a bad-hearted man as weakly under
                     the influence of a bad woman.</p>
                  <p>After conversing awhile with this blinded father, Mr. Ellis took occasion to
                     speak of the little deaf-mute, and to urge her being placed at the Institution,
                     as the means of making her useful and happy. At first Smith quite scouted the
                     idea, especially on account of the expense; but a little more talk on the
                        part<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7024-00000089"/> of Mr. Ellis induced him to
                     listen with favor to the plan. And when the rich man from town offered himself
                     to take charge of the little girl, to place her at the Institution, watch over
                     her welfare and see that she wanted for nothing, even the stepmother was
                     somewhat mollified, and the matter easily arranged. Our respect for the
                     humblest is immediately increased by finding them cared for by important
                     people.</p>
                  <p>"How glad I am, now, that poor Mrs. Smith happened to come while you were
                     here!" said Mrs. Dudley. "I might never have thought to mention her troubles to
                     you, Henry, One is so apt to be absorbed by one's own affairs."</p>
                  <p>So large a part of the grandmother's solicitude was now removed, that she was
                     like a new creature the next time she called. The younger children could get
                     along comparatively well, she said, and the fact that the elder was under the
                     protection of Mr. Ellis, had already wrought a change in the household.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, Mrs. Dudley," said poor Mrs. Smith, "a blessing always, follows you! No
                     wonder you always seem so happy!"</p>
                  <p>To Henry Ellis his sister appeared so beautiful, and the uses she made of her
                     difficult position so dignified and excellent, that he could not help hoping
                     that Katherine, under the influence of such a life and character, would catch
                     some new light on her own path and its true end. If Mrs. Dudley had been
                     deficient in outward graces, he well knew disgust would have superseded
                     conviction. Katherine revolted so against whatever was not beautiful, that no
                     amount or tone of worth could interest her, if accompanied by coarseness of
                     manners and habits. But even here, where the beautiful harmony of real delicacy
                     with great sacrifice of personal tastes, in a way of life that would never be
                     chosen as the ideal home of delicacy, were exhibited in perfection tion, Mrs.
                     Ellis, still fascinated by the outward, felt something more nearly allied to
                     horror than admiration. She saw, indeed, the beauty and the virtue, and not
                     with indifference, or wholly without profit; but her heart secretly longed for
                     scenes like some of those she had lived in since her marriage, and of which the
                     charm had not yet been exhausted. Spite of the admiration and love she could
                     not but feel for her sister-in-law, and her sense of new light from many things
                     she had seen and heard, she was quite as glad to quit Piercefield as she had
                     been to escape from S——, and when her husband expressed himself with enthusiasm
                     on the subject of Mrs. Dudley's character and usefulness, he was pained to
                     discover that the disagreeables of country life were alone prominent in her
                     mind. He took pains to bring her to a juster estimate of the value and true
                     pleasure of life, by placing side by side some of the trials of city and
                     country life; recalling the coarse and cruel things she herself had noticed
                     among people of great pretension to polish and cultivation; the grudging
                     charity, the contrasted prodigality and meanness, the heartless neglect and
                     avoidance of poor relations which is but too general among the prosperous; the
                     self-seeking hospitality, the hollow friendship, the keen rivalry—all that
                     rankles and festers under the gilded surface of town life,—but with little
                     avail. Katherine persisted in thinking all this tolerable, in preference to the
                     outward coarseness of the country.</p>
                  <p>"One can be virtuous in town," she said, "but I, at least, could not be happy
                     in the country."</p>
                  <p>"It is only an abstract question," her husband replied; "a question whether a
                     life whose main object is personal indulgence and enjoyment is the most
                     beautiful, dignified and happy life—"</p>
                  <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7024-00000090"/>
                  <p>"I do not know—I am no heroine—I am willing to take the risks and disadvantages
                     of a life of elegance and ease," said Katherine, "and leave self-denial to
                     those who like it! I should be wretched to live as your sister does."</p>
                  <p>"You forget that her way of life is her own free choice—her offer of aid in
                     retrieving her husband's affairs. Doesn't it seem to you that any life acquires
                     dignity under such circumstances? Would my sister appear more 'lady-like,' in
                     your eyes, if she had come with her children to my house, as I invited her to
                     do, while her husband underwent alone the toils and sacrifices necessary for
                     the re-establishment of his fortune? I cannot believe it! Her true character
                     never made itself known until adversity laid bare its roots. She might have
                     passed for a merely elegant woman, if Providence had not brought her to the
                     test."</p>
                  <p>Katherine was silenced, if not convinced.</p>
                  <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>After this chapter was read, Mrs. Whipple said—"I need not tell you that I
                     didn't write it."</p>
                  <p>Miss Berry sat with her eyes fixed upon the floor.</p>
                  <p>"I thought," said Mr. Ingoldsby, "that such high-flying sentiments hardly
                     sounded like you, Mrs. Whipple! You 'love the sweet security of streets,' and
                     would find yourself as little able to appreciate the charms of country life as
                     I should, I dare say. But who is to come next?"</p>
                  <p>Only Miss Grove and Mr. Aldis remained, and as they had taken the opportunity
                     of the rest being engaged with the story to fall desperately in love with each
                     other,—contrary to all the statutes,—any help from them was out of the
                     question. They begged off, and it was at last decided that the sketch should be
                     finished as best it might, by the general contribution and consultation of
                     those who began it.</p>
                  <p>"Only make it very moral—"said Mr. Ingoldsby, with a comical grimace—</p>
                  <p>"Now father, you are too bad!" said Elinor; "you know it was begun with the
                     express purpose of making it hold all our wise saws—"</p>
                  <p>"I can tell you," said her father, "if you 'rush into print' the world will
                     only laugh at your Utopian notions."</p>
                  <p>"Then the world ought to be ashamed of itself!" said Miss Elinor.</p>

                  <p>George Fountain, recalled to town by the illness of Mr. Deane, was now always
                     at his sister's side with suggestions as to what was proper or
                     desirable—suggestions which referred to the notions of the gay young men—('whom
                     call we gay? The innocent are gay'—) the <emph>gay</emph> young men with whom
                     he associated. George's favorite word of commendation was 'Noble!' a dangerous
                     word unless we fix its signification very accurately; his invariable epithet of
                     condemnation 'Mean!' a term quite as often misapplied by the thoughtless. His
                     taste ruled his sister's more than was wise or fitting, his position as one of
                     the oracles<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7024-00000091"/> of fashion giving him
                     peculiar power on Katherine's weak side. His feelings were congenial with her
                     own; his views of life more generous and elegant than any one's, in her
                     estimation. The orphan fellow-feeling that had united them so closely during
                     early life, Katherine's marriage had done nothing to loosen, for Ellis's
                     extreme kindness of heart and boundless regard for his wife had induced him
                     rather to promote than discourage the intimacy. Now, however, he was sometimes
                     pained to observe that where his views and George's happened to differ, as they
                     often did, the latter's were sure to prevail with Katherine; George taught her
                     what to require and what to refuse; his opinion of her husband's plans and
                     proceedings was the guide of hers. George could even make the solid and
                     principled generosity of his brother-in-law appear meanness, when he chose to
                     contrast it with the lavish expenditure of people of similar fortune. It is not
                     wonderful that this state of things appeared in different lights to Katherine
                     and her husband. He judged as a man, she felt as an idol, whose right it was to
                     receive as offering all that was precious, incurring no responsibility in
                     return.</p>
                  <p>This is no uncommon phase of young wifehood, but a grave Mentor might remind
                     the worshipped that the position of an idol is hardly consistent with the more
                     honorable one of a dutiful and true wife, Love's figures of speech to the
                     contrary notwithstanding. The wise bride soon steps gracefully down from the
                     pedestal where she stood properly enough for awhile, to find more secure and
                     dignified footing nearer her husband's heart of hearts—that deeper and more
                     serious heart which poets may not sing about, but which a man gives to his
                     duties, his responsibilities, his hopes and resolutions for time and eternity.
                     It is in close contact and communion with this that a wife must stand, if she
                     would realize the ancient symbol of two hearts pierced through with one and the
                     same arrow. Flowery bands there may be, and the more the better; but the arrow
                     must be of steel.</p>
                  <p>Mary Ashmore's wedding gave occasion to new differences of opinion between Mrs.
                     Ellis and her husband—differences gently urged on his part, but tenaciously
                     adhered to on hers. Katherine's affection for her cousin naturally showed
                     itself in expensive gifts; she felt no hesitation in suggesting what would be
                     desirable, because she stood ready to supply whatever Aunt Susan decided to be
                     beyond her means. Mr. and Mrs. Ashmore shook their heads at this; they
                     disapproved it and it troubled them; but it was one of the hardest things in
                     the world to resist. Ellis, too, remonstrated.</p>
                  <p>"Proportion, dearest Kate," he said, "is an element of beauty. Do not fancy
                     that I object to the cost of what you are doing for Mary; I desire only to see
                     more reference to her past habits and her probable lot in life. She will be
                     obliged to content herself with a plain and economical style of living, which I
                     fear will seem only the plainer for these gay gifts of yours. I would give her
                     an equal amount—you and I can never do enough for your aunt and her family—but
                     let it be in some more suitable, if not useful form."</p>
                  <p>Katherine did not relish this, although Ellis backed his remonstrance with a
                     handsome gift in money to Mary from himself.</p>
                  <p>"You want me to be as wise as yourself, Henry," she said. "Every body gives
                     elegant bridal gifts, now. A bride really appears forlorn who has not splendid
                     gifts and a rich <foreign xml:lang="FRA">trousseau</foreign> to show. Mary is
                     too sensible a girl to suppose it is to be<pb n="180-181"
                        xml:id="VAC7024-00000092"/> always so; do let me indulge myself in getting
                     her a few pretty things—perhaps the last she may have, poor girl! I don't think
                     Sidney Parker will ever be rich—he is too much like Uncle Ashmore himself."</p>
                  <p>There was something in Katherine's mode of saying this that implied no great
                     respect for a man who was not likely to make himself rich.</p>
                  <p>"Uncle Ashmore is too habitually generous ever to accumulate much property,"
                     said Ellis. "He sees so many cases in which a little money will do a great deal
                     of good, that he cannot resolve to refrain for the sake of laying by more than
                     a decent provision for his family. He does not even gratify himself by doing
                     good in a conspicuous way; his bounty flows in those silent and unconsidered
                     channels-which drain off the means of showy charity. Far less does he desire to
                     see his family wear an appearance above their means."</p>
                  <p>"O, nobody thinks of dressing according to their means," said Katherine; "the
                     idea is exploded."</p>
                  <p>"You are a satirist, without knowing it," replied her husband. "If I had said
                     any thing as severe against the dishonesty induced by the prevalent passion for
                     dress, you would have thought me very harsh. But pray don't let us contribute
                     more than our share to the general evil."</p>
                  <p>But George prevailed, and Mary Ashmore, without other dower than her parents'
                     good name and her own sweetness of character, entered upon her married life
                     with an outfit that in simpler times would have befitted an heiress.</p>
                  <p>This is but a sample of the influence exercised by George Fountain upon his
                     sister—trying, certainly, to her husband, but of little moment compared with
                     the deterioation observable in George himself—observable to every eye but
                     Katherine's. His habits, his companions, his sentiments, were all more and more
                     annoying to Mr. Ellis—nearly as much so, perhaps, as was the consciousness of
                     Ellis's pure and searching eye to the young <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >roué.</foreign> Both would have been heartily glad of a separation; but
                     Ellis kept down the thought from love to his wife and a desire to benefit her
                     brother, while George refrained from casting loose this last anchor in the
                     respectable, lest Mr. Deane should take the alarm. How often, in families
                     seemingly harmonious, exist these opposing forces, so equally balanced that it
                     would take no mare than a straw's weight to revolutionize the whole!</p>
                  <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>The Spring brought George, Fountain a good excuse for changing his quarters.
                     Mrs. St. John did not make her annual visit, but went to Paris instead. Another
                     visitor, however, even more important and importunate, and certainly more
                     welcome, made his appearance, in the shape of a little boy—with dark eyes the
                     'very moral' of Katherine's—and a habit of making his wants known with very
                     little scruple throughout the quiet halls in——Square. Here was an affair! It
                     seemed to be the deliberate conviction of the household that there never had
                     been a baby born before, so infinite were the preparations, and agitations, and
                     consultations about him and his mother. Aunt Susan was young again; the younger
                     Ashmores had to be excluded by main force; the nurse ruled the house, and the
                     new papa's mild eyes glistened from morning till night, spite of the efforts he
                     made to be philosophically composed. All was pure sunshine in his mind, for he
                     felt sure that the opening of this<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7024-00000093"/>
                     new spring of natural tenderness would carry away all the rubbish of Fashion
                     that was threatening to incrust his wife's heart. And at first it seemed so.
                     But with the return of health and strength came back the old solicitude about
                     modes and magnificence; and Aunt Susan's ways of thinking, and her notions of
                     the simplicity proper in all arrangements about the infant, were set aside by
                     the nurse's incessant suggestions that Mrs. Preston had this and Mrs.
                     Fitzgerald that; such and such plans were always pursued in Mrs. Basinghall's
                     nurseries, and such and such others had been condemned by Dr. Fairlove; till
                     all interest in the child personally threatened to be swallowed up in
                     arrangements for his making his <foreign xml:lang="FRA">début</foreign> in life
                     under proper circumstances. This folly came nearer to exhausting Ellis's
                     patience than any thing yet, and he tried both persuasion and authority against
                     it, but with little avail. The nurse was quite too much for him.</p>
                  <p>Nothing less than a country-house now met Katherine's ideas, and but one region
                     offered an eligible site for this, in her opinion;—that which included the
                     summer residence of certain persons whom she called her friends, though they
                     had little in common with her except the love of expense and show. Ellis soon
                     perceived that she had set her heart fully on this, and he yielded with the
                     best possible grace—as he always did when he yielded at all—an example for all
                     good husbands!</p>
                  <p>Behold our friends, then, installed in what was to be styled, by some stretch
                     of poetry, a rural residence, though, except in the lack of some few
                     conveniences, it was to all intents and purposes a city house, with nothing
                     like country about it save the trees and flowers. Town habits—a phalanx of town
                     servants—visitors most urban, who would have been amused to see one of the
                     neighboring farmers seated in the drawing-room, or one of his daughters
                     received except in a menial position—these made up the ruralizing of our
                     heroine's ideal. Her visit to Mrs. Dudley seemed only to have taught her what
                     to avoid; she had no more communication with her rustic or even her plain
                     neighbors than if they had been Caffres or cannibals, and considered herself as
                     fully excused from caring for their weal or woe as if she had been in——Square,
                     or studying political economy. We need not say that this state of things
                     accorded but ill with Mr. Ellis's more humane and patriotic theories, and it is
                     to be confessed that, but for the baby, this summer would have been one of
                     little sympathy of enjoyment between husband and wife.</p>
                  <p>Not that Mr. Ellis relished—few husbands do,—being entirely superseded by his
                     son; finding himself of no account in comparison with "the baby," and being
                     unable to win his wife's attention to any employment that had the slightest
                     interest for him. The house was practically a nursery, as far as its main
                     object of attention was concerned, and this did not accord, m any degree, with
                     its master's ideas of what was proper; but with his usual patience he bore all,
                     and waited for better times. His confidence in Katherine's good sense and good
                     feeling was unshaken, and he always looked forward with sure hope to the time
                     when she would be disposed of her own accord to remedy what he disapproved.</p>
                  <p>George remained in town, in attendance on Mr. Deane, who was becoming more and
                     more feeble, and seemed likely soon to lay down his earthly load. Mr. Ellis
                     would fain have had the old gentleman removed to his house, but this George
                     opposed resolutely, on the score that the invalid would be obliged to change
                     his physicians, and George now ruled Mr. Deane entirely.<pb n="184-185"

                     and ready for social enjoyment, he was universally popular, and had hosts of
                     friends. Katherine was very proud of her brother—proud of the abilities which
                     every body said he had, although he had never yet put them to any use beyond
                     the pleasure of the moment; proud of his elegant, dashing manners, and of his
                     fashionable connections. She would fain have called her son after him, but Mr.
                     Ellis so urged the pleasure the compliment would give Uncle and Aunt Ashmore,
                     that she consented to give him her uncle's name, feeling, however, that she
                     made a great sacrifice to her husband's wishes, for it had become a sacrifice
                     in Katherine's eyes to give up her own will in any thing.</p>
                  <p>So the summer wore away, and then the autumn and the winter, in outward calm
                     and secret conflict of feeling—not the conflict that results in quarrels and
                     disaffection, but a state that detracts much from happiness, corroding its
                     substance day by day, and lowering our expectations of it, until we learn to
                     substitute something else for it—business, or pleasure, or vice, or
                     indifference. It is somewhat strange that, referring as we all do, nominally,
                     to one standard of thought and action, there should be so many practical
                     discrepancies. A heartier and more intelligent reference to that standard would
                     obviate so many of them!</p>
                  <p>Mr. Deane lingered, in prolonged suffering and sadder and sadder decay,
                     throughout the next winter. George was not neglectful of the sick bed, but
                     rumors of the irregularity of his habits had become public, and his handsome
                     face began to tell tales of late hours and indulged passions, in the relaxing
                     of its clear-cut outlines and the inequality of its once perfect complexion
                     ion. His youthful freshness was already gone; premature knowingness vulgarized
                     his calm statuesque beauty; Perscus was degenerating into Beau Brummell;
                     classic purity into conventional pettiness. With his first beauty had departed
                     his early good-nature, or at least the even flow of it; alternations of wild
                     gayety and moody reserve now characterized his behavior, even to his sister,
                     who could no longer be blind to the unhappy change, though she admitted it only
                     with painful resistance. It was long since Mr. Ellis had attempted in the least
                     to influence his brother-in-law, but now, at his wife's earnest entreaty, he
                     sought a private conversation with him, though with faint hope of being of
                     service. As he had expected, he met only angry replies, and such insulting
                     cautions not to undertake 'lecturing,' as required all his self-command, and
                     all his affection for Katherine to enable him to bear.</p>
                  <p>Here was a speck of black reality in the midst of Katherine's golden sky! Some
                     truths flashed out of it, however, and truth is always worth what it costs.
                     Katherine was a mother, now,—the mother of a son; and George's misconduct
                     reminded her that a son is not a mere plaything—a puppet to be dressed and
                     paraded, to feed the vanity of the hour; or a fairy creature, whose beauty is
                     to prove a talisman against evil. A young mother secretly refers every thing to
                     the new object of interest, and ours had a thousand fresh, enlightening
                     thoughts of the little one on her lap, as she wept over the unhappy condition
                     of her brother, though she was far from a full perception of his deterioration
                     or its cause. She began to suspect—though dimly—that money cannot buy all that
                     is desirable; and the struggle in her mind between the experience of to-day and
                     the vague notions of her past life was full of surprise as well as pain.</p>
                  <pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7024-00000095"/>
                  <p>Things went on this way until Mr. Deane's death—an event long expected, and
                     which Katherine and her husband—now almost of one mind as to George—hoped might
                     work a salutary change upon the object of the poor old man's mistaken kindness.
                     George used to be deficient neither in generosity nor gratitude, but who could
                     recognize the ingenious, warm-hearted boy of the Christmas dinner-party, in the
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">blasé,</foreign> prematurely old, selfish and
                     grasping heir, who evidently felt relieved by the death of his benefactor?</p>
                  <p>The opening of the will was not calculated to calm the turbulent mind of the
                     unhappy young man. Besides providing much more largely than George had expected
                     for some rather distant relatives, Mr. Deane had hampered the residue of his
                     property with many cautious restrictions, all evidently referring to George's
                     habits of reckless expense; and, to give the finishing stroke to the heir's
                     vexation, had left Henry Ellis sole trustee, with more than usual discretionary
                     power, George now, throwing off all restraint, behaved like a madman, insulted
                     his brother-in-law, and cast his sister from him with expressions that cut her
                     to the heart.</p>
                  <p>Katherine, long self-deluded, was now utterly astounded,—frightened to the
                     shelter of her husband's love and wisdom, by her brother's fury—his despair—his
                     threats against himself—his execrations of the very memory of his ill-judging
                     friend. She had as yet seen only the gentler side of human nature; she hardly
                     suspected the existence of such passions as the once kind, joyous, affectionate
                     George Fountain exhibited under the stings of his present position, so much
                     worse, from causes unknown to her, than it appeared outwardly. As in conscious
                     weakness she turned to her husband for support under this overwhelming
                     affliction tion, she began to perceive the value of firmness united with
                     kindness like his, and to appreciate the difference between her brother's
                     splendid exterior and real selfishness, and the calm, balanced, considerate and
                     seemingly exhaustless goodness of him whom she had, by some strange delusion,
                     learned to look upon as an unsympathizing judge. Mr Ellis, exasperated as he
                     had been by George's insane conduct towards himself, went at once into the most
                     careful and patient examination of Mr. Deane's affairs, and was shocked to find
                     how little would be left at George's command after the provisions of the will
                     had been carried out, and the enormous expenses of the poor old man's long
                     illness at a fashionable hotel, and under the care of several physicians,
                     discharged. George must apply himself at once to the study of a profession, and
                     under what disadvantages!</p>
                  <p>So thought Ellis in his kindness, but he little suspected then what he soon
                     after discovered with horror—the extent of those disadvantages. Deluded by
                     extravagant ideas of Mr. Deane's fortune, and thoroughly entangled with vicious
                     companions, George had in the course of a single year managed to dissipate the
                     whole and even more, by anticipation, and was now in debt far beyond the
                     compass of the estate which had been his ruin. Besides this, surrounded by
                     sharpers, he had been led, in his ignorance, into transactions which might
                     involve the total loss of honor and credit. Mr. Ellis made this discovery, as
                     we have said, with horror; to his wife it was absolute prostration. Her
                     excitement almost equalled George's own; and when the first grief had in a
                     measure exhausted itself in tears, she displayed a force of passion and
                     resolution that astonished her husband.</p>
                  <p>"Save my brother, Henry!" she sobbed, clinging to him as she would have clasped
                     a life-buoy among midnight waves in a<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7024-00000096"
                     /> tempest; "Save him, oh my husband, like yourself—at any cost! I am ready to
                     make all sacrifices—to part with every thing, rather than see George
                     disgraced—lost—ruined! O my brother—my brother! If my poor, poor mother had
                     lived to see this day!"</p>
                  <p>Ellis, alarmed, agitated, yet conscious all the while of a secret pleasure in
                     this evidence of deep feeling and unsuspected strength in his wife, calmed and
                     comforted her with promises of aid, and professions—worth something from him—of
                     an interest in George's welfare second only to her own.</p>
                  <p>"Only be calm, dear love!" he said, "and let our kindness to George be real. He
                     has suffered enough already, poor fellow! by mistaken kindness. To step in, at
                     once, between him and this great lesson, would be any thing but kind. Think of
                     his future life—of his character—all is at stake at this crisis. Even his
                     reputation is of minor importance, since reputation may be earned; but that,
                     too, shall be saved. Only be patient, and let us act deliberately and with
                     judgment."</p>
                  <p>We cannot follow this generous brother-in-law through the difficulties and
                     trials involved in these promises to his wife; enough that he fulfilled them
                     all, and that she held fast by her offer,—made indeed in the first passionate
                     grief and mortification which attended the discovery of her brother's position,
                     but perhaps suggested in part by an unconfessed distrust of the permanent
                     happiness of the life that had for a while so enchanted her—to undergo any
                     sacrifice required for George's redemption. She even went beyond her husband's
                     thoughts, in desiring a complete change of life in consequence of his payment
                     of George's debts; and Ellis, not forgetting, in the delight inspired by this
                     realization of his best hopes of Katherine's character, the possible
                     temptations of old association after the storm of feeling should have subsided,
                     consented to a reduction of expenses further than was necessary, and allowed
                     Katherine to follow out the promptings of her enthusiasm, and regulate their
                     new establishment on a scale more moderate than he himself would have ventured
                     to propose, but which, nevertheless, accorded very well with his principles and
                     even his taste.</p>
                  <p>"Do not undertake more than you can bear, dear Kate"—he said, smiling.</p>
                  <p>"Never fear," she replied, "I am stronger than you think,"—and truly her
                     husband began to feel a sort of awe of this her new power. Men of sense, even,
                     are apt to be astonished at any evidence of strength of character in women,
                     perhaps naturally enough.</p>
                  <p>It would be difficult to give a just idea of all the circumstances attending
                     the new state of things. George, after going through every phase of passion,
                     rejecting all aid from his brother-in-law, saying every reckless word and doing
                     every unwise thing that an ungoverned young man might under the circumstances
                     contrive to crowd into the space of a few weeks, came at last to see himself as
                     he was, and to understand something of Mr. Ellis's character. When he had
                     reached this point, it is not wonderful that he soon began to feel the
                     humiliation proper to the contrast. What Ellis's superiority in mere wisdom
                     could never have done, his inexhaustible patience and unmistakable goodness
                     accomplished. Here, as elsewhere, a <emph>life</emph> proved irresistible where
                     arguments were powerless, and George's proud heart at last bowed itself in
                     confession and regret; and while, as much for his sister's sake as his own, he
                     accepted the sacrifice she was proud and happy to make with her husband's full
                        consent<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7024-00000097"/> sent, his spirit arose at
                     once to the desire of reparation by self-denial, labor, and the thorough
                     renunciation of the delusions that had once so much power over him.</p>
                  <p>"But I must run away, Kate," he said; "I cannot face the sight of the change
                     you and Henry make for my sake. Let me bury myself in the country, for a time,
                     at least."</p>
                  <p>"You need not quite bury yourself, George," said Mr. Ellis, smiling; "I dare
                     say my sister would be happy to receive you, if you would like to study with
                     Mr. Dudley."</p>
                  <p>"O, if she would!" said Katherine; "but I know she will! she is all goodness."
                     And tears filled her eyes as she recollected how poorly she had once valued
                     that goodness.</p>
                  <p>And George plunged into the study of law with all the impetuosity of devotion
                     that he had been wasting on unworthy pursuits, and met manfully the
                     disagreeables attendant on his new life and the total renunciation of his old
                     companionship. Trials there were, many and bitter, for no soul not utterly
                     depraved ever passes out of the glare and gloom of vice into purer light and
                     air without horrible pangs of retrospection; but there was in George Fountain,
                     as in his sister, a latent power, of which the outward symmetry and harmony,
                     that distinguished them both, was Nature's gracious token. Stunted by evil
                     culture, thwarted by unhappy circumstances, misused and poisoned under the
                     allurements of vice, mind and body would have deteriorated together; but
                     watched over and preserved from fatal taint by pure influences in childhood,
                     and borne up through temptation and difficulty by such wisdom and kindness as
                     can be found only among those who are at one with God and goodness, the accord
                     designed by Providence between beauty and virtue was once more apparent; and
                     Katherine and her brother seemed, to the few about them who knew all, more
                     lovely in the new light and glow of grateful and exalted feeling, than even in
                     the unruffled attractiveness of their earlier graces.</p>
                  <p>"This is <emph>your</emph> doing," said Katherine to her husband, in a moment
                     of grateful emotion; and the few words and the look that accompanied them, said
                     more for the past and the future than whole volumes of regrets and promises.
                     Need we say that he felt, in that moment, the reward of his patient love? But
                     such hearts are their own reward. <q>

                     Marston's reply to this sally; "none require so much courage as the good."</p>
                  <p>"And now only one more chapter," said Miss Ingoldsby.</p>
                  <p>"See that flash of scarlet on the maple yonder, and the yellow leaves on the
                     locusts. We shall leave the woods when they are in all their splendor. Who
                     shall object to our American love of gorgeous colors, when Providence sets us
                     such an example!"</p>
                  <p>"Providence does not put them upon man, or even woman, though," said her
                     father, laughing, "but only on plants, parroquets, rattle-snakes and the
                     like—"</p>
                  <p>"I think," said Mrs. Whipple, who felt a little stirred by this glance at her
                     tender point, "that Providence in not clothing us at all, gave us all creation
                     to choose out of."</p>
                  <p>"So think the Indians," persisted her antagonist; "and so they stick feathers
                     into their ears and bones through their noses. It is all a matter of taste,
                     certainly; but I shall be glad when we get beyond the aborigines in our choice
                     of colors, and begin to dress for beauty rather than for display of wealth.
                     Dress never would have called forth the censure of the wise, if it had been
                     used only to enhance human loveliness, and not to gratify human pride."</p>
                  <p>"Dear me!" exclaimed Mrs. Whipple, puzzled by this heresy, "then one ought to
                     wear nothing but what is becoming! I don't know what would become of the
                     mantuamakers!"</p>

                  <p>We have now to look upon the Ellises in a new position.</p>
                  <p>With what hope of success can we undertake the task of showing happiness in a
                     way of life neither rich nor poor—lacking both the dignity of splendor and the
                     picturesqueness of poverty; requiring no great and showy sacrifices, and
                     admitting of none of those magnificent virtues which are sure to bring their
                     reward of public praise as well as secret self-complacency?</p>
                  <p>In the first place—what did 'the world' say?</p>
                  <p>If our hero and heroine had emerged from a plain mansion into a palace, the
                     world would have been deeply interested; its sympathies would have been
                     excited, its affections active; it would have felt the force of the injunction
                     to 'rejoice with those that rejoice,' for it is a very amiable world under such
                     circumstances. To be sure it might have scrutinized a little the sources of the
                     golden stream; it might have made scientific inquiries into the nature of the
                     chrysalis which gave a magnificent<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7024-00000099"/>
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">papillon</foreign> to the sunshine; while it would have
                     conscientiously endeavored to moderate the self-gratulation of the <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">débutans</foreign> by suggesting as many mortifying drawbacks
                     as possible. But it would have smiled, and bowed, and gazed, and praised, most
                     satisfactorily. All the charming qualities of the happy pair would have shone
                     out anew, like jewels in a fresh and fashionable setting. From commonplace
                     people they would have flowered out into prodigies.</p>
                  <p>But as nobody but sentimentalists praise the sun when it goes behind a cloud,
                     so the amiable world was entirely content that Mr. and Mrs. Ellis, after a
                     brief period of brilliance, should be as retiring and retired as they pleased.
                     As to the why and wherefore, <emph>that</emph> certainly was a nine days'
                     wonder. Losses there had been none, that any body could discover; 'speculation'
                     perhaps, but where? It might be a fit of penuriousness, on finding how much it
                     took to keep up a handsome establishment and an expensive wife, for Ellis was
                     always something of a prig! But the thought of his having paid his
                     brother-in-law's debts never entered any body's head. George was supposed to
                     have done that, (foolishly!) out of Mr. Deane's property, leaving himself
                     nothing.</p>
                  <p>We dare not say that what the world, lately so important to Katherine, said of
                     her change of appearance, was of no moment to her. There were times, certainly,
                     when this was the case, but those were times of excitement, which do not last
                     always. So she was subject to alternations—trials of feeling—waverings of
                     resolution—misgivings as to her own strength—and—for we do not claim for our
                     heroine a position beyond humanity—doubts as to whether so much was really
                     required of her. We cannot always bear in mind all the stringent particulars
                     under which we came to unusual and trying decisions; so that after the benefit
                     of those decisions has begun to be felt, we are prone to question their wisdom.
                     This is one of the effects of the 'imperfection of the instrument,' as the
                     piano-tuners say; a lack of perfect proportion in the action of our powers. But
                     Katherine had a perpetual memory of George's altered—lowered face, during that
                     miserable winter, when the radiant eyes of his guardian angel must have been
                     turned away, discouraged; and a perpetual comfort in an occasional view of his
                     cleared, animated, self-respecting look under the toils of study, cheered by
                     the consciousness of honest intent. The world did not believe in the permanence
                     of this change, for in all similar cases, from Prince Hal downwards, it takes
                     refuge in doubt from the mortifying sense of the failure of its spells. Yet,
                     happily, instances in which it is at last forced into faith are neither few nor
                     obscure.</p>
                  <p>It was curious and affecting to see how much the old intimacy of communion with
                     the Ashmores revived under the new circumstances. Not that Katherine had ever
                     intentionally chilled the dear friends of her infancy by word or look. She had
                     been disposed to load them with benefits, beyond their willingness to accept,
                     and she had given no little thought to the ways and means of doing them good.
                     But there is an irresistible effect of great difference of position and outward
                     circumstances in keeping friends apart. The poorer feel it if the richer do
                     not; and the space between grows insensibly wider, in spite of the sincerest
                     efforts on both sides to bridge it over. How happy was good Aunt Susan to have
                     the cold veil removed that she had felt, if not seen, interposed between her
                     darling and herself; and how happy was Katherine to find herself once more
                     nestling, as it were, under the beloved wing! How much<pb n="196-197"
                        xml:id="VAC7024-00000100"/> more at home did all feel in the new house,
                     comfortable and elegant as it was than in the midst of too great profusion of
                     expense and ornament! And how much more time there seemed for hospitality,
                     truly such, when a host of stately people who had given no pleasure ceased
                     coming because they were no longer invited. The Enfields concealed their wonder
                     and disgust under polite coolness, for they had 'no patience with such
                     absurdity.' Mrs. St. John wrote letters of condolence which made Katherine
                     laugh.</p>
                  <p>Besides the more obvious sources of the quiet happiness which became gradually
                     and gently the habit of our heroine in her less splendid home, was one of which
                     she had had no previous conception, and for which she had laid no plan. The
                     discharge of half her servants had brought her into more intimate personal
                     relations with her own domestic affairs. It may be only a fancy of ours, that
                     Providence has so decidedly fitted woman for household cares, that she is never
                     truly and healthily happy without them; but if it be a fancy, it is one which
                     much observation has confirmed. If there be any thing likely to banish the
                     fiend <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ennui</foreign> from the dwellings of women of
                     fortune, it is the habit of assuming a moderate share of the daily cares which
                     go to make home home. To do every thing by proxy is to deprive ourselves of a
                     thousand wholesome, cheerful, innocent interests; to nourish our pride and
                     indolence at the expense of our affections; to sacrifice the life of life to a
                     notion of gentility, poor, hollow and barren; nay; is there not something
                     almost impious in scorning the position for which God so evidently designed
                     woman, and living an artificial life of our own devising, deputing our duties
                     and privileges to hirelings?</p>
                  <p>It is a singular delusion, this, of some women, and of American can women in
                     particular, for we know that even in England women of fortune are much more
                     truly domestic in their tastes and habits than we. We remember a story of a
                     certain Duchess cleaning some picture-frames, when a <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >protegée</foreign> who happened to be present, officiously desired to take
                     the office upon herself.</p>
                  <p>"Child!" said her grace, "don't you suppose I should have called a servant if I
                     had not chosen to do it myself!"</p>
                  <p>The German ladies, with all their cultivation, take the most intimate interest
                     in householdry, and they are remarkable for cheerfulness of temper, for natural
                     and charming manners, and for the intelligence and vivacity of their
                     conversational powers. Who knows but the terrible dearth of subjects of
                     conversation among us might be somewhat mitigated, if our ladies spent a part
                     of every morning among the various cares and duties, on the proper performance
                     of which so much of the comfort and happiness of life depends, and which call
                     into action far higher powers than those required for the bald chit-chat of an
                     evening party, or the inanities of a morning call?</p>
                  <p>The universal sentiment of <emph>men</emph> is in favor of active domestic
                     habits for women. It is said that men 'love to see women delicate,' and so they
                     do, doubtless. But does any moderate amount of attention to home affairs
                     deprive a lady of her delicacy? It may prevent the delicacy of dyspepsia, but
                     few gentlemen admire that. Indeed we have yet to discover the man of sense who
                     is displeased by his wife's personal care of the comfort and economy of her
                     house. Those whose lives are embittered by the lack of it are not far to seek.
                     No houses are regulated with such neatness, accuracy and elegance as those in
                     which the ladies of the family take a personal part in household duties.</p>
                  <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7024-00000101"/>
                  <p>Goethe says of a young woman of his friends—and a man of genius is entitled to
                     speak for his sex—"After the death of her mother, she displayed a high degree
                     of activity as the head of a numerous young family, and, alone, had sustained
                     her father in his widowhood. The future husband could thus hope an equal
                     blessing for himself and his descendants, and expect a decided domestic
                     happiness. Every one confessed that she was a woman to be wished for. She was
                     one of those, who, if they do not inspire vehement passion, are found to excite
                     a universal pleasure. A lightly formed, symmetrical figure—a <emph>pure,
                        healthy nature, and the glad activity that arises from it; an unembarrassed
                        care for daily necessities,</emph> with all these she was endowed. The
                     observation of these qualities was always agreeable to me, and I always sought
                     the society of those who possessed them."</p>
                  <p>Yes—we shall have all the gentlemen on our side when we venture to think
                     domestic employments suited to women of all fortunes—to universal womanhood,
                     indeed. So we insist that Katherine was happier, when, with less intervention
                     of servants, she took upon herself a certain share of the daily recurring
                     duties. Especially with regard to her son did she find her happiness increased
                     by discarding much of the hireling aid she had for a while been persuaded to
                     think necessary. Nature, no longer repressed by stupid conventions, sprang up
                     free and joyous in the heart of the young mother, and yielded all that wealth
                     of tender, indescribable, but most precious joys which so richly repays the
                     thousand cares and sacrifices of maternity. In short if the Ellis sunshine
                     seemed to the world without to be somewhat obscured, it was only because the
                     radiance was concentrated within To those most concerned it certainly seemed
                     doubled.</p>
                  <p>"But there was no splendor, and it is in vain to preach that splendor is
                     undesirable." <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Cela depend.</foreign> Splendor is of
                     various kinds. We talk sometimes of splendid talents, and we bow before them;
                     and we think of splendid goodness, though we may use another epithet. Neither
                     of these was excluded from the new <foreign xml:lang="FRA">régime.</foreign>
                     But in ordinary acceptation, splendor is the result of lavish expenditure. Was
                     that lacking? To say nothing of the gift to George—a gift which he firmly
                     determined should prove only a loan, but which was nevertheless a free gift
                     from the givers—what else the Ellises bestowed, by secret and open channels,
                     would have kept up the old dazzle, and saved the world the trouble of all its
                     conjectures. Uncle Ashmore fell into some trouble through that good son-in-law
                     of his—perhaps Mary's bridal gifts had induced extravagant notions into her
                     househouldry, but this we doubt, for Aunt Susan's daughter would not be likely
                     to go far wrong. Certainly some clouds seemed impending over that happy
                     family.</p>
                  <p>Katherine wept at the thought. "It will be so hard for dear Uncle and Aunt
                     Ashmore in their old days"—she said.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Ellis only laughed. His wife looked up, astonished.</p>
                  <p>"Don't you know, dear Kate," said the quiet man, "that it would hardly require
                     more than what your shawls cost only a few years ago, to free your uncle from
                     his embarrassments? And don't you know that not buying the shawls and fifty
                     other things that gave us no real pleasure, leaves us plenty of money to do as
                     we like with?"</p>
                  <p>Katherine's eyes grew larger at this, and her husband continued;</p>
                  <pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7024-00000102"/>
                  <p>"Forgive me, my dearest, for not baring told you this before; for having
                     allowed you to think our present moderate style of living really necessary in
                     prudence. When you proposed the change, in your tender solicitude for George, I
                     could hardly refrain from assuring you at once that I could and would do all
                     you wished, without the need of any marked alteration in our mode of life. But
                     the desire that you should try something which I earnestly believed more
                     congenial to your fine, true nature, was too tempting! I allowed you to
                     regulate matters as you chose; always intending, as soon as you had had time
                     for a fair trial, and an opportunity to know your real tastes, to restore you
                     to the former position and way of life if you deliberately preferred it. A
                     thousand times I have been on the point of saying this to you, but I confess
                     you have seemed to me so much more at home—so much more my own—so much more the
                     Katherine of my dearest dreams, in your simpler and more natural form, that I
                     could not, for very selfishness, find courage to offer you a return to the old
                     grandeur—cold and sterile as it seemed to me, and threatening a gradual
                     obscuration of my wife's best graces. But I offer it now, and without a shadow
                     of hesitation, for it was not the condition I feared, but your estimation of
                     it, and the habits of thought it seemed likely to induce. Now—with your present
                     views and objects, and your past experience—I have no fears, and if you decide
                     to return to——square, or a similar house, I shall be entirely content."</p>
                  <p>Katherine did not receive this confession with indifference. For a moment she
                     felt something akin to resentment. Had she then been allowed to make sacrifices
                     for nothing? Had she been treated like a child, who must be deceived into being
                     good?</p>
                  <p>But it was only for a moment. The next brought more gracious thoughts. One look
                     at her husband—one thought of what he was—of his patience, his unselfishness,
                     his devotion to her—cleared her mental horizon at once. Light from his
                     character seemed to irradiate her whole path, past and future.</p>
                  <p>With a gush of grateful tears she threw herself into his arms—</p>
                  <p>"Forgive you, Henry!" she said; "forgive you for your love and goodness—for
                     making me so happy? What gentler method could you have devised for awakening me
                     from my dream? Dear husband—dearest friend—I owe myself to you. Love and truth
                     have revealed life to me. How could you have answered it to yourself if you had
                     let me sink into nothingness under delusions so fatal!"</p>
                  <p>"I know not," he replied; "yet I confess I was completely at a loss. Your
                     convictions were brought about by means wholly beyond any power of mine. We
                     cannot devise and create circumstances to suit our wishes. Happy those who are
                     willing to use such as are offered by a benign Providence. Still, dearest Kate,
                     remember I am ready and willing to enlarge our way of life whenever you desire
                     it; there may be very good reasons for doing so."</p>
                  <p>"I shall never desire it," she replied, "for there is a sense of weariness and
                     disgust comes over me whenever I think of the life we used to lead. Not that I
                     pretend to have grown indifferent to wealth, or the privileges it buys, or the
                     consequence it gives. I love to spend money as well as ever, but spending it
                     without display, and for objects which the world cannot appreciate, seems to me
                     a higher pleasure than any that show ever gave me. Of mere luxury we have
                     enough—all that we can really enjoy;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7024-00000103"/>
                     for I have, discovered that whatever of it we provide beyond a certain limit is
                     not for ourselves, and becomes a burthen. If, with abundant means, you were
                     disposed to hoard," she added, smiling, "I believe I should be a very bad wife;
                     but as you love to spend too—why, it seems to me we shall be very happy as we
                     are."</p>

                  <p>"Is that all?" said Miss Grove, when the reader stopped.</p>
                  <p>"What more would you have?" said Mr. Berry; "is not every body very happy, and
                     haven't we made out our case?"</p>

                     whether he ever fell in love."</p>
                  <p>"O you know it would be long before it was proper for George to fall in love,
                     and when he did there would be a great deal to be said about it; we must

                  <p>"I consider the permanence of the young wife's conversion so ticklish a topic,"
                     said Mr. Ingoldsby, with his usual disposition to a certain quizzical
                     skepticism, "that I hold you very wise to stop where you do. The brother's

               <head>WOMEN OF THE REVOLUTION.</head>
               <p>CONSIDERING how highly every age has prized the history and biography of previous
                  times, it is matter of surprise that there are not always found those who
                  systematically record passing events and delineate living characters. Fame is,
                  indeed, in a good degree, an affair of distance. It is difficult for friends,
                  associates, or contemporaries to be sure that actions or events, which arise from
                  the present condition of things, will seem as important to posterity as to those
                  who have an immediate interest in the emergencies which gave them birth. But the
                  desire to know what has been done and said by those who have gone before us—who
                  helped to prepare the world for the coming of our day—is so universal, and we are
                  so often vexed to think we know so little, that it seems wonderful that mere
                  sympathy should not lead us to prepare pleasant things of this sort for the people
                  whose pioneers we are. How delicious are the bits of private history now and then
                  fished up from the vast sea of things forgotten! How we pounce upon some quaint
                  diary, some old hoard of seemingly insignificant letters, some enlightening
                  passage in an old author, who little suspected his blunt quill of playing the part
                  of an elucidator of history! What could repay the world for the withdrawal from
                  its knowledge of the straight-forward fibs of Sir John Mandeville, illustrative as
                  they are of the state of general credulity in his day? Or of Pepys's Diary, or
                  Horace Walpole's, or Madame de Sevigne's letters, or Bozzy's inestimable
                  jottings?</p>
               <p>Each and every generation lives in "a very remarkable age," and it is obviously a
                  high moral duty of somebody to write it down, circumstantially, for the benefit of
                  those who are destined, through its preparing influence, to enter upon experiences
                  still more remarkable. Yet when we would seek materials for the minute private
                  history of a time, in the bosom of whose common life were contained the
                  characterizing elements of this great empire—as the rich satin folds of the tulip
                  are traceable in a bulb which looks very like that humble piece of domesticity, an
                  onion—we are obliged to search as if for the proverbial needle; to dive into
                  family records, dim with the dust of time, or useless from the suspicious coloring
                  of pride or affection; to call upon the East and the West, the North and the
                  South, to rummage the memory-garrets of their "oldest inhabitants;" in short, to
                  pick, as it were, from thorns and briers by the wayside, stray locks of the
                  material which should have been carded and spun by the growers, ready for the
                  weaving skill of the present day.</p>
               <p>All honor, then, to the patriotic labors of those to whom we owe the gathering of
                  these fragments! Honor to Mrs. Ellet, who has alone done for our Revolutionary
                  mothers what so many men have been zealous in doing for their own sex, ever since
                  the national struggle was ended.</p>
               <p>No one perhaps will question, that the women of the Revolution bore a far larger
                  share of its actual hardships and sufferings than the men. The life afield, shorn
                  though it may be of home comforts, has its poetry, its inspirations, its heroic
                     element,<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7024-00000105"/> for compensation of its
                  ills. The very physical influence of duties performed in the open air—of
                  excitement, exercise, variety, and liberty, is enlivening and invigorating to mind
                  and body reciprocally. Military discipline,—the stimulus of command and of
                  subordination, of regularity, of enterprise, of endurance,—has a tendency to
                  maintain the spirits in a somewhat equable, if not elated state, and to keep sad
                  personal thoughts at bay. Activity having a direct bearing upon the great object
                  in view, keeps up the heart more easily and more steadily than quieter service
                  can. It is, indeed, an attainment in philosophy to have, and to be consoled and
                  sustained by, the feeling that <q>
                     <l>"They also serve who only stand and wait."</l>
                  </q> To do is the great pleasure of life; to suffer, or to be passive, is a
                  sustained effort of self-denial.</p>
               <p>It was to this difficult service that the women of the Revolution were called. The
                  hard labor of waiting, in patient anxiety and a composure that did not exclude
                  agony, while husbands, sons, fathers, brothers, went in search of danger, called
                  forth fortitude and faith far beyond that required for night-watches under snowy
                  skies, or forced marches without shoes. To follow, with heart and eye, day after
                  day, the ebbing life of a darling child, whose father was far away and unconscious
                  of the blow that hung over him, drew more severely upon the springs of life and
                  hope than a wound in a skirmish or a baffled enterprise, The women's lot, in those
                  times, was the ingenious prolongation of torture with which the savage takes care
                  not to kill—torture that would nerve the impatient soul to pray for a bullet,
                  rather than to dread it. To prepare a loved one for the camp and the battle, to
                  see him depart, yet withhold the protest test that nature must prompt, were
                  enough; how much more was it to combat his own misgivings at the thought of
                  leaving lonely and unprotected his dearer than life; to nerve his heart for the
                  strife by a deep sympathy in his sense of wrong; to send him forth, in the spirit
                  of the Greek matron, with a charge to return with his shield or upon it! The noble
                  qualities called forth by circumstances such as these, excite the imagination and
                  thrill the heart, till we are in danger of forgetting the hatefulness of war. A
                  young girl throws herself between a threatening pistol and her father's body, and
                  by her intrepidity preserves him from butchery; and again, when she is threatened
                  with death if she refuses to give information of the course taken by a party of
                  her countrymen, bares her bosom to the shot of a brutal marauder, who is only
                  prevented from murder by the shame or the humanity of a comrade who strikes up his
                  weapon. A wife, who has seen her husband shot down by a musket levelled over her
                  own shoulder as she entreated for his life, afterwards keeps watch over his
                  blood-stained corpse in a lonely house, in the midst of enemies, resolute to
                  protect the precious remains from further outrage. Can men do these things?</p>
               <p>A war of invasion, whose success depended upon the devastation it might be able to
                  carry into private homes, fell, of course, very heavily upon women, and awakened a
                  spirit and called forth a resistance which are habitually foreign to the sex. The
                  peculiarly feminine quality of fortitude was warmed by excitement and outrage into
                  courage; a sense of responsibility, and the necessity of caring for the absent,
                  produced prudence and awakened ingenuity; all frivolous interests were thrown out
                  of sight by the continual presence of important duties; in short, woman was
                  forced, by the dread power of necessity, into the<pb n="208-209"
                     xml:id="VAC7024-00000106"/> exercise of those noble qualities with which her
                  Maker endowed her when he gave her to be the helpmeet of man,—qualities too
                  generally allowed to lie dormant under the circumstances of common life, or
                  suppressed because man, the ruler of her destiny, approves rather the lighter
                  graces which threaten no competition in his own peculiar sphere of
                  self-complacency. The impression left by this simple record of woman's part in the
                  revolutionary struggle is that of the general tone of feeling rather than of
                  particular incidents of heroism; we remember not so much that particular women did
                  or suffered particular things, as that the whole tone of female society was
                  raised. The standard of behavior was a heroic one; the emulation was no longer who
                  should be most fastidious and dependent; who should act the part of "the tender
                  and delicate woman, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the
                  ground for delicateness and tenderness,"—so favorite a <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >rôle</foreign> ordinarily, that women will endure mach rather than appear able
                  to endure any thing; but who should utterly put away self, forget privileges,
                  forego indulgences, encounter dangers; who should bind up wounds, walk noisome
                  hospitals, convey intelligence, defend the obnoxious. It seems, truly, to have
                  been woman who held the keys of the precious reservoir of Hope from which was
                  drawn strength to endure to the end. Invaders, far away from their wives and
                  daughters, may fight perfunctorily and fail; men drawn up in defence of their own
                  firesides, and receiving ever new supplies of energy and assurance from the home
                  stores, are irresistible.</p>
               <p>But it is time to turn from our general view of the influence of woman upon the
                  great contest, to the contemplation of particular characters and incidents. And we
                  begin naturally with the mother of Washington, who struck the key-note of this
                  high harmony when she gave her faultless son to his country without a tremor; and
                  who afterwards uttered as a comment upon the homage offered him by a grateful
                  nation—"George was always a good boy." The Spartan simplicity and dignity of this
                  matron make her a very classic. If without injury to the sterner features of this
                  character, it were possible to infuse among its elements some of the lighter
                  feminine graces, we could find it in our hearts to advise our young countrywomen
                  to study it as the type of American womanhood.</p>
               <p>In the traits of many of the heroines of the earlier days of the Revolution, we
                  find a remarkable union of strength and softness, courage and refinement,
                  simplicity and shrewdness, the fruit of patriotic sentiments engrafted on the
                  habits and acquirements of aristocratic society. Mrs. Reed, Mrs. Schuyler, Mrs.
                  Warren, Mrs. Montgomery, and many others, were of this class of women. Their
                  adventures are less striking; but their characters no less admirable, than those
                  of women whom circumstances brought into more conspicuous relation with the war.
                  Mrs. Knox was perhaps the most splendid of these ladies, both on account of her
                  elegance of person and manner, and the strength and perseverance of her
                  character.—Her position in society was next to that of Mrs. Washington, ever her
                  intimate friend; and the aged officers who still survive, and love to talk of the
                  scenes and adventures of that day, never fail to speak of Mrs. Knox, of her
                  beauty, her wit, her gay and free manners, and the kindly and hospitable manner in
                  which she knew how to entertain guests of every degree.</p>
               <p>Like other women of marked intellectual power, who are rendered conspicuous by
                  station, Mrs. Knox excited envy, and<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7024-00000107"/>
                  became occasionally the subject of severe and ungenerous comment. Her very
                  frankness, the result of conscious strength and honesty, was turned against her by
                  petty minds. Thus, a traditional speech of hers, in the decline of life,
                  purporting that, if she could live her life over again, she would be "more of a
                  wife, more of a mother, more of a woman," than she had been, has been interpreted
                  as an expression of remorse; while, in truth, it is no insignificant proof of
                  virtue. It was doubtless prompted by the spirit of humility which implies a
                  recognition of the highest and purest motives of conduct.</p>
               <p>Lest this remark and others, exceedingly natural and praiseworthy, currently
                  ascribed to Mrs. Knox, should be misconstrued to the disadvantage of a
                  distinguished woman, whose candor and modesty were enhanced, in the decline of
                  life, by the adoption of a religious standard of action, we venture to insert a
                  passage or two from a private letter, written by a still surviving daughter, who
                  feels a daughter's interest in the memory of a beloved mother, while she carefully
                  disclaims all wish to make one so loved pass for <q>
                     <l>"The faultless monster whom the world ne'er saw."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"I claim for my mother no perfection of character; she undoubtedly had her share
                  of the failings which attach to us all. I am very conscious that the partiality of
                  friends, and particularly of children, is too apt to give a brighter coloring to
                  the character of those who were so dear to them than truth will warrant. In this
                  case, however, I would say, that while ample justice is done, as I think, to my
                  mother's intellectual powers, which were undoubtedly of a superior order, and gave
                  her a commanding influence in society, it may not perhaps be equally acknowledged
                  that she had heart as well as mind. Those who knew her intimately would, I firmly
                  believe, bear full testimony to the warmth of her domestic attachments. A more
                  devoted wife and mother I never knew. The keenest sorrows of her life sprung from
                  this source. It was the will of God to take from her nine of her twelve children,
                  previous to the still greater trial of parting with the husband of her youth, the
                  friend and companion of many eventful years, and many scenes of joy and sorrow;
                  and the anguish she endured on these trying occasions gave abundant evidence that
                  her heart was feelingly alive to the tender and sacred claims of wife and mother.
                  Yet I think it very probable, that in the retrospect of a long life she may have
                  seen much to regret—many duties imperfectly performed—instances innumerable in
                  which a different course ought to have been pursued. Feelings like these I have
                  often heard her express, and can now most fully sympathize with Her lot was cast
                  in the midst of all that was most attractive in our land; yet I do not believe in
                  its busiest scenes she ever lost sight of her more private and indispensable
                  duties."</p>
               <p>After the conclusion of the war, and when the services of General Knox were no
                  longer required by the country, he retired to a splendid country residence in
                  Maine, where his wife assisted him in dispensing a hospitality such as this
                  country has seldom seen. It is said to have been not unusual with them to kill an
                  ox and twenty sheep on Monday morning, to be consumed in the course of the week by
                  a concourse of guests for whom a hundred beds were daily made. Among the visitors
                  entertained here were the Duke de Liancourt, who was, as he said, heir to three
                  Dukedoms, yet without a suit of clothes to his back, until supplied by General
                  Knox; Talleyrand, who pretended that it was impossible for him to learn English,
                  while he had two masters and was believed to understand the language thoroughly;
                  Lafayette, who remembered to inquire for his friend Mrs. Knox, when he visited
                  this country as "the nation's<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7024-00000108"/> guest;"
                  and many others, who have figured on the stage of history. At Boston, Louis
                  Philippe and his brothers, the Dukes de Montpensier and de Charolais, had been
                  frequent visitors at the house of General Knox, and found solace in the friendship
                  of its fair mistress; and at all times and in all places where this happy couple
                  resided, their society was sought by the great, the patriotic, and the
                  distinguished.</p>
               <p>The character and adventures of the Baroness de Riedesel are well known, and as
                  she did not belong to the patriot side, we shall have nothing to say of her here.
                  Not that we can notice each of the heroines of the time, even by a word; we shall
                  be obliged to content ourselves with recalling a few of those whose position or
                  adventures render them peculiarly interesting or worthy of contemplation.</p>
               <p>Lydia Darrah was a Quakeress of Philadelphia, who, while entertaining perforce a
                  party of the enemy, played the eavesdropper, and used the information she obtained
                  at the keyhole to save the Americans a surprise at White Marsh. Those who approve
                  of war cannot object to this mode of obtaining intelligence; and the sagacity,
                  courage and perseverance of the good woman certainly deserve all the praise
                  bestowed upon them. How Lydia stood with the Quaker meeting, after this exploit,
                  we are not informed.</p>
               <p>"The celebrated Miss Franks" was noted for "the keenness of her irony, and her
                  readiness at repartee;" but the sharp speeches recorded of her are lacking in the
                  delicacy which should distinguish feminine wit. Mrs. Ellet's sketch of this
                  loyalist lady, converted late in life to more patriotic predilections, is
                  enlivened by an account of the "Mischianza," a festival given by the British
                  officers in Philadelphia, as a parting compliment to Sir William Howe, on his
                  departure for England, when he was superseded by Sir Henry Clinton. This account
                  of an American festival of the olden time—one of the very few formally recorded in
                  our annals, is especially interesting, from having been originally written by
                  Major André, who contributed largely to the more poetical portion of the
                  festival.</p>
               <p>"The entertainment was given on the 18th of May, 1778. It commenced with a grand
                  regatta, in three divisions. In the first was the Ferret galley, on board of which
                  were several general officers and ladies. In the centre, the Hussar galley bore
                  Sir William and Lord Howe, Sir Henry Clinton, their suite, and many ladies. The
                  Cornwallis galley brought up the rear—General Knyphausen and suite, three British
                  generals, and ladies, being on board. On each quarter of these galleys, and
                  forming their division, were five flat boats lined with green cloth, and filled
                  with ladies and gentlemen. In front were three flat boats, with bands of music.
                  Six barges rowed about each flank, to keep off the swarm of boats in the river.
                  The galleys were dressed in colors and streamers; the ships lying at anchor were
                  magnificently decorated; and the transport ships with colors flying, which
                  extended in a line the whole length of the city, were crowded, as well as the
                  wharves, with spectators. The rendezvous was at Knight's wharf, at the northern
                  extremity of the city. The company embarked at half-past four, the three divisions
                  moving slowly down to the music. Arrived opposite Market wharf, at a signal all
                  rested on their oars, and the music played "God save the King," answered by three
                  cheers from the vessels. The landing was at the Old Fort, a little south of the
                  town, and in front of the building prepared for the company—a few hundred yards
                  from the water. This regatta was gazed at from the wharves and warehouses by all
                  the uninvited population of the city.</p>
               <p>"When the general's barge pushed for shore, a salute of seventeen guns was fired
                  from his Majesty's ship Roebuck; and,<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7024-00000109"/>
                  after an interval, seventeen from the Vigilant. The procession advanced through an
                  avenue formed by two files of grenadiers, each supported by a line of light-horse.
                  The avenue led to a spacious lawn, lined with troops, and prepared for the exhibit
                  on of a tilt and tournament. The music, and managers with favors of white and blue
                  ribbons in their breasts, led the way, followed by the generals and the rest of
                  the company.</p>
               <p>"In front, the building bounded the view through a vista formed by two triumphal
                  arches in a line with the landing place Two pavilions, with rows of benches rising
                  one above another, received the ladies, while the gentlemen ranged themselves on
                  each side. On the front seat of each pavilion were seven young ladies as
                  princesses, in Turkish habits, and wearing in their turbans the favors meant for
                  the knights who contended. The sound of trumpets was heard in the distance; and a
                  band of knights in ancient habits of white and red silk, mounted on gray horses
                  caparisoned in the same colors, attended by squires on foot, heralds and
                  trumpeters, entered the lists. Lord Cathcart was chief of these knights; and
                  appeared in honor of Miss Auchmuty. One of his esquires bore his lance, another
                  his shield; and two black slaves in blue and white silk, with silver clasps on
                  their bare necks and arms, held his stirrups. The band made the circuit of the
                  square, saluting the ladies, and then ranged themselves in a line with the
                  pavilion, in which were the ladies of their device, Their herald, after a flourish
                  of trumpets, proclaimed a challenge; asserting the superiority of the ladies of
                  the Blended Rose, in wit, beauty, and accomplishment, and offering to prove it by
                  deeds of arms, according to the ancient laws of chivalry. At the third repetition
                  of the challenge, another herald and trumpeters advanced from the other side of
                  the square, dressed in black and orange, and proclaimed defiance to the
                  challengers, in the name of the knights of the Burning mountain. Captain Watson,
                  the chief, appeared in honor of Miss Franks; his device—a heart with a wreath of
                  flowers; his motto—Love and Glory. This band also rode round the lists, and drew
                  up in front of the White Knights. The gauntlet was thrown down and lifted; the
                  encounter took place. After the fourth encounter, the two chiefs, spurring to the
                  centre, fought singly, till the marshal of the field rushed between, and declared
                  that the ladies of the Blended Rose and the Burning Mountain were satisfied with
                  the proofs of love and valor already given, and commanded their knights to desist.
                  The bands then filed off in different directions, saluting the ladies as they
                  approached the pavilions.</p>
               <p>"The company then passed in procession through triumphal arches built in the
                  Tuscan order, to a garden in front of the building, and thence ascended to a
                  spacious hall painted in imitation of Sienna marble. In this hall and apartment
                  adjoining, were tea and refreshments; and the knights, kneeling, received their
                  favors from the ladies. On entering the room appropriated for the faro table, a
                  cornucopia was seen filled with fruit and flowers; another appeared in going out,
                  shrunk, reversed, and empty. The next advance was to a ball-room painted in pale
                  blue, pannelled with gold, with dropping festoons of flowers; the surbase pink,
                  with drapery festooned in blue. Eighty-five mirrors, decked with flowers and
                  ribbons, reflected the light from thirty-four branches of wax lights. On the same
                  floor were four drawing-rooms with sideboards of refreshments, also decorated and
                  lighted up. The dancing continued till ten; the windows were then thrown open, and
                  the fireworks commenced with a magnificent bouquet of rockets.</p>
               <p>"At twelve, large folding doors, which had hitherto been concealed, were suddenly
                  thrown open, discovering a splendid and spacious saloon, richly painted, and
                  brilliantly illuminated; the mirrors and branches decorated, as also the upper
                  table; which was set out—according to Major André's account—with four hundred and
                  thirty covers, and twelve hundred dishes. When supper was ended, the herald and
                  trumpeters of the Blended Rose entered the saloon, and proclaimed the health of
                  the king and royal family—followed by that of the knights and<pb n="216-217"
                     xml:id="VAC7024-00000110"/> ladies; each toast being accompanied by a flourish
                  of music. The company then returned to the ball-room, and the dancing continued
                  till four o'clock."</p>
               <p>How faded and old fashioned all this looks to the haughty eyes of the present
                  generation, when no one goes into company intending to do any thing but criticise
                  others! yet it makes one's ancestors appear very amiable. <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >Bonhommie</foreign> is nearly obsolete, for it requires simplicity, and a
                  degree of confidence in others that is a shield against ridicule. One thing is
                  obvious, such amusements suppose accomplished people.</p>
               <p>This entertainment took place at the opening of the spring which followed the
                  dreadful winter at Valley Forge. After this period, the scene of action was in a
                  great measure changed to the southern country, and the war took a more romantic
                  character. Savannah was surrendered to the British at the close of 1779, and on
                  the 12th of May, 1781, Charleston capitulated, and was occupied by Sir Henry
                  Clinton, who from that centre of operations harrassed the surrounding country at
                  pleasure. The bad faith of the British commander, by means of which one portion of
                  the inhabitants were terrified into adhesion to the crown, nerved the hearts and
                  arms of many more, who, under every disadvantage, and at the imminent risk of all
                  they held dearest, commenced a partizan and skirmishing warfare, far more wearing
                  and distressing than the pitched battles at the North, from the immediate dangers
                  of which, at least, women and children and helpless age were safe. Circumstances
                  like these naturally called forth a kind of personal heroism, for which there is
                  little field in regular warfare. Instances not unfrequently occurred, when all,
                  for the moment, depended on the courage, the ingenuity, the firmness, or the
                  judgment of a woman; when children without hesitation risked their lives at the
                  call of duty or affection; when the negro forgot the stupidity which his master is
                  so fond of imputing to him, and under the stimulus of love or pity, was inspired
                  with an ingenuity of equivocation or a boldness of defence quite at variance with
                  his supposed character. The comparative simplicity of plantation life imparts a
                  healthful tone to love and friendship, and depth and constancy to all the domestic
                  affections; and we love to think of the women of the South as the guardian angels
                  of their firesides or their palmetto shades, ever ready, with sweet influences, to
                  ward off, as far as human creatures may, the curse of slavery, and meliorate, as
                  only gentle creatures can, its sting.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gibbes, the first lady on the Southern list, may serve as a type of one class
                  of the heroic women of the South. With the quiet energy of a veteran commander,
                  she prepared her house for the reception of the invaders, after they had already
                  surrounded it and that closely. She did not conquer, but she disarmed the enemy,
                  by opening the front door when all was ready, and showing the majestic form of her
                  invalid husband, helpless in his great arm-chair, and surrounded only by women and
                  children. And when her beautiful plantation was given up to ruthless pillage, and
                  the officers became her compulsory guests, she continued to preside at the head of
                  her table, awing the intruders into respect and decent order by the power of her
                  presence. Flying afterwards in the midst of a heavy fire from the river, and
                  having under her charge, with the helpless husband, sixteen children,—her own and
                  those of her sister—she discovers on reaching the neighboring plantation, towards
                  which their fugitive steps were directed, that a little boy—one of her sister's—is
                  missing.</p>
               <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7024-00000111"/>
               <p>"The roar of the distant guns was still heard, breaking at short intervals the
                  deep silence of the night. The chilly rain was falling, and the darkness was
                  profound. Yet the thought of abandoning the helpless boy to destruction was agony
                  to the hearts of his relatives. In this extremity, the self-devotion of a young
                  girl interposed to save him. Mary Anna, the eldest daughter of Mrs. Gibbes—then
                  only thirteen years of age, determined to venture back, in spite of the fearful
                  peril, alone. The mother dared not oppose her noble resolution, which seemed
                  indeed an inspiration of heaven; and she was permitted to go. Hastening along the
                  path with all the speed of which she was capable, she reached the house, still in
                  the undisturbed possession of the enemy; and entreated permission from the
                  sentinel to enter; persisting, in spite of refusal, till by earnest importunity of
                  supplication, she gained her object. Searching anxiously through the house, she
                  found the child in a room in a third story, and lifting him joyfully in her arms,
                  carried him down, and fled with him to the spot where her anxious parents were
                  awaiting her return. The shot still flew thickly around her, frequently throwing
                  up the earth in her way; but protected by the Providence that watches over
                  innocence, she joined the rest of the family in safety."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Martha Bratton, beginning her career of heroism by defying the brutal Huck,
                  at the head of his cavalry, and persisting in her refusal to say a word that
                  should endanger her husband's safety, finished it by blowing up a depôt of powder
                  just as the enemy was approaching it.</p>
               <p>"The officer in command, irritated to fury, demanded who had dared to perpetrate
                  such an act, and threatened instant and severe vengeance upon the culprit. The
                  intrepid woman to whom he owed his disappointment, answered for herself. 'It was I
                  who did it,' she replied. 'Let the consequence be what it will, I glory in having
                  prevented the mischief contemplated by the enemies of my country.'"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Thomas was of similar spirit; and we might enumerate a host more, if the
                  South were not so rich in heroines. Miss Lungston, a girl of sixteen, already
                  under British ban for having been more than suspected of giving private
                  information to her countrymen, sets out on foot, alone at night, to cross a deep

                  her neck—the blackness of the night—the utter solitude around her—the uncertainty
                  lest the next step should ingulph her past help, confused her; and losing in a
                  degree her self-possession, she wandered for some time in the channel, without
                  knowing whither to turn her steps. But the energy of a resolute will, under the

                  escapes of the daring lieutenant and his family would grace our page but for its
                  too great length; we pass on, therefore, to a later occurrence, which includes a
                  personal exploit of the lady. The country had risen <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en
                     masse</foreign> to oppose the passage of the royal troops, who were hurrying to
                  join their standard at Wilmington. This corps of fire-breathing volunteers—"every
                  man of whom had mischief in him," as Mrs. Slocumb said,—met McDonald and his
                  Highlanders at Moore's Creek, February 27th, 1776, and fought there one of the
                  bloodiest battles of that eventful year. Mary Slocumb was at home—what?
                  skirmishing with Colonel Tarleton? no—dreaming! Woman still, under all the
                  unfeminine porcupinishness induced by the unnatural circumstances of the time. We
                  must let her tell her own story.</p>
               <p>"I lay—whether waking or sleeping I know not—I had a dream; yet it was not all a
                  dream. (She used the words unconsciously, of the poet who was not then in being.)
                  I saw distinctly a body wrapped in my husband's guard-cloak—bloody—dead; and
                  others dead and wounded on the ground about him. I saw them plainly and
                  distinctly. I uttered a cry, and sprang to my feet on the floor; and so strong was
                  the impression on my mind, that I rushed in the direction the vision appeared, and
                  came up against the side of the house. The fire in the room gave little light, and
                  I gazed in every direction to catch another glimpse of the scene. I raised the
                  light; every thing was still and quiet. My child was sleeping, but my woman was
                  awakened by my crying out or jumping on the floor. If ever I felt fear it was at
                  that moment. Seated on the bed, I reflected a few moments—and said aloud; 'I must
                  go to him.' I told the woman I could not sleep and would ride down the road. She
                  appeared in great alarm; but I merely told her to lock the door after me, and look
                  after the child. I went to the stable, saddled my mare—as fleet and easy a nag as
                  ever travelled; and in one minute we were tearing down the road at full speed. The
                  cool night seemed after a mile or two's gallop to bring reflection with it; and I
                  asked myself where I was going, and for what purpose. Again and again I was
                  tempted to turn back; but I was soon ten miles from home, and my mind became
                  stronger every mile I rode. I should find my husband dead or dying—was as firmly
                  my presentiment and conviction as any fact in my life. When day broke I was some
                  thirty miles from home. I knew the general route our little army expected to take,
                  and had followed them without hesitation. About sunrise, I came upon a group of
                  women and children, standing and sitting by the road-side, each one of them
                  showing the same anxiety of mind I felt. Stopping a few minutes I inquired if the
                  battle had been fought. They knew nothing, but were assembled on the road to catch
                  intelligence. They thought Caswell had taken the right of the Wilmington road, and
                  gone towards the northwest (Cape Fear). Again was I skimming over the ground
                  through a country thinly settled, and very poor and swampy; but neither my own
                  spirits nor my beautiful nag's failed in the least. We followed the well-marked
                  trail of the troops.</p>
               <p>"The sun must have been well up, say eight or nine o'clock, when I heard a sound
                  like thunder, which I knew must be cannon. It was the first time I had ever heard
                  a cannon. I stopped still; when presently the cannon thundered again. The battle
                  was then fighting. What a fool! my husband could not be dead last night, and the
                  battle only fighting now! Still, as I am so near, I will go and see how they come
                  out. So away we went again, faster than ever; and I soon found by the noise of
                  guns that I was near the fight. Again I stopped. I could hear muskets, I could
                  hear rifles, and I could hear shouting. I spoke to my mare, and dashed on in the
                  direction of the firing and the shouts, now louder than ever. The blind path I had
                  been following brought me into the Wilmington road leading to<pb n="222-223"
                     xml:id="VAC7024-00000113"/> Moore's Creek Bridge, a few hundred yards below the
                  bridge, A few yards from the road, under a cluster of trees, were lying perhaps
                  twenty men. They were the wounded. I knew the spot; the very trees; and the
                  position of the men I knew as if I had seen it a thousand times. I had seen it all
                  night! I saw all at once; but in an instant my who'e soul was centred in one spot;
                  for there, wrapped in his bloody guard-cloak, was my husband's body! How I passed
                  the few yards from my saddle to the place I never knew. I remember uncovering his
                  head and seeing a face clothed with gore from a dreadful wound across the temple.
                  I put my hand on the bloody face; 'twas warm; and an <emph>unknown voice</emph>
                  begged for water. A small camp-kettle was lying near, and a stream of water was
                  close by. I brought it: poured some in his mouth; washed his face; and behold—it
                  was Frank Cogdell. He soon revived and could speak. I was washing the wound in his
                  head. Said he, 'It is hot that; it is that hole in my leg that is killing me.' A
                  puddle of blood was standing on the ground about his feet. I took his knife, cut
                  away his trousers and stocking, and found the blood came from a shot-hole through
                  and through the fleshy part of his leg. I looked about and could see nothing that
                  looked as if it would do for dressing wounds but some heart-leaves. I gathered a
                  handful and bound them tight to the holes; and the bleeding stopped. I then went
                  to the others; and—Doctor! I dressed the wounds of many a brave fellow who did
                  good fighting long after that day! I had not inquired for my husband; but while I
                  was busy Caswell came up. He appeared very much surprised to see me; and was with
                  his hat in his hand about to pay some compliment: but I interrupted him by
                  asking—'Where is my husband?'</p>
               <p>"'Where he ought to be, madam; in pursuit of the enemy. But pray,' said he, 'how
                  came you here?'</p>
               <p>"'Oh, I thought,' replied I, 'you would need nurses as well as soldiers. See! I
                  have already dressed many of these good fellows; and here is one'—going to Frank,
                  and lifting him up with my arm under his head, so that he could drink some more
                  water—'would have died before any of you men could have helped him.'</p>
               <p>"'I believe you,' said Frank. Just then I looked up, and my husband, as bloody as
                  a butcher, and as muddy as a ditcher, stood before me.</p>
               <p>"'Why Mary!' he exclaimed, 'What are you doing there?' Hugging Frank Cogdell, the
                  greatest reprobate in the army?'</p>
               <p>"In the middle of the night, I again mounted my mare and started for home. Caswell
                  and my husband wanted me to stay till next morning, and they would send a party
                  with me; but no! I wanted to see my child, and I told them they could send no
                  party who could keep up with me. What a happy ride I had back! and with what joy
                  did I embrace my child as he ran to meet me!"</p>
               <p>Lest we should be wanting, both to Mrs. Slocumb and her unwelcome guest Colonel
                  Tarleton, we give a passage which does credit to them both.</p>
               <p>"When the British army broke up their encampment at the plantation, a sergeant was
                  ordered by Colonel Tarleton to stand in the door till the last soldier had gone
                  out, to ensure protection to a lady whose noble bearing had inspired them all with
                  the most profound respect. This order was obeyed: the guard brought up the rear of
                  that army in their march northward. Mrs. Slocumb saw them depart with tears of
                  joy; and on her knees gave thanks, with a full heart, to the Divine Being who had
                  protected her."</p>
               <p>This lady lived, through all her toils and dangers, a happy wife for sixty years,
                  with the husband of her youth. In her seventy-second year, being afflicted with a
                  cancer in her hand, she with characteristic bravery held it forth to the surgeon's
                  knife, declining the usual assistance. She died in 1836, her husband in 1841,—the
                  patriarchs of their district.</p>

               <p>The exploit of Mrs. Motte, who furnished the arrows which were to carry
                  combustibles to the roof of her own new and valuable mansion, is well known. It
                  may not be equally so, that after her husband's death, finding that through the
                  disastrous accidents of the times, his estate was insolvent, Mrs. Motte determined
                  to devote the remainder of her life to the honorable task of paying his debts.</p>
               <p>"Her friends and connections, whose acquaintance with her affairs gave weight to
                  their judgment, warned her of the apparent hopelessness of such an effort. But,
                  steadfast in the principles that governed all her conduct, she persevered; induced
                  a friend to purchase for her, on credit, a valuable body of rice-land, then an
                  uncleared swamp—on the Santee—built houses for the negroes, who constituted nearly
                  all her available property—even that being encumbered with claims—and took up her
                  own abode on the new plantation. Living in an humble dwelling—and relinquishing
                  many of her habitual comforts—she devoted herself with such zeal, untiring
                  industry, and indomitable resolution to the attainment of her object, that her
                  success triumphed over every difficulty, and exceeded the expectations of all who
                  had discouraged her. She not only paid her husband's debts to the full, but
                  secured for her children and descendants a handsome and unincumbered estate."</p>
               <p>This is the heroism of peace, a far more difficult heroism, we must take leave to
                  say, than that of war, even for women. Actions to be truly great must be performed
                  without the stimulus of present excitement. The true dignity of such as this will
                  be recognized when war is forgotten, or remembered as an almost impossible
                  barbarism of past ages.</p>
               <p>Further south, we come upon the exploit of a "war-woman" indeed. Nancy Hart, a
                  Georgian Amazon, hideous in person as ferocious in nature, is represented as
                  having shot a man or two with her own hand, in her own house, and coolly
                  recommended the hanging of four more before her door, on a tree which may still be
                  seen. The stream near this Penthesilea's bower is called "War-woman's Creek," in
                  her honor. Nature makes strange mistakes sometimes, and seems to have given the
                  virago's husband the milk omitted in her own composition. At least, we judge so
                  from the fact that Nancy called him "a poor stick."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ellet's account of the women of Kentucky includes many very interesting
                  anecdotes, illustrative of Indian cruelty, and female courage and patriotic
                  feeling. The satisfaction with which we read these touching records of American
                  pioneer life makes us regret, that so much more is doubtless lost than saved.
                  These things happened in days and regions belonging far less to the pen than the
                  axe and the rifle. It were worth a pilgrimage through that land of "forest, flood
                  and fell," to glean the fragments yet extant among those who must soon pass
                  away.</p>
               <p>There is a thrilling story of Wheeling, on the Ohio, then called Fort Henry,
                  whither, in 1777, a large Indian force was brought by a notorious renegade and
                  tory, Simeon Girty. Within the fort were collected, as usual, all the helpless of
                  the neighborhood, and a garrison numbering barely twelve, including boys, the rest
                  having been killed in an attempt to dislodge a party of savages near the fort. The
                  stockade was stormed by the Indians, and defended by the marksmen within with good
                  hope, until it was discovered that the powder was exhausted. The only supply lay
                  in a house about sixty yards from the gate. In this emergency, when all depended
                  on obtaining the powder, and the person who should seek it must become a mere
                  target for the savage horde without, a young girl, Elizabeth Zane, volunteered<pb

                  that no one else could be as well spared. The blood thrills as we picture her,
                  leaving the fort on this desperate errand, reaching the house in safety, emerging
                  again with the keg of powder in her arms, and skimming the ground toward the gate,
                  amid a shower of bullets. But the bullets had no billet for her, and she reached
                  the fort in safety, We need not say that her heroism saved her friends.</p>
               <p>We have adopted something of geographical order in our notice of particular
                  persons; but we proceed to call up several characters, omitted in our pursuit of
                  the more heroic and poetical instances of feminine patriotism.</p>
               <p>And first comes Mrs. Bache, the only daughter of Franklin. Like many other ladies
                  of that stirring and stimulating day, she wrote many and good epistles. She begins
                  her letters to her father, "Honored Sir," and ends with saying "There is not a
                  young lady of my acquaintance but what desires to be remembered to you." The
                  simplicity of her habits does credit to her father, who, figuring at the court of
                  France in his blue woollen stockings, writes reprovingly to her about Philadelphia
                  gaieties.</p>
               <p>"But how could my dear papa give me so severe a reprimand for wishing a little
                  finery? He would not, I am sure, if he knew how much I have felt it. Last winter
                  was a season of triumph to the whigs, and they spent it gaily. You would not have
                  had me, I am sure, stay away from the Ambassador's or General's entertainment's,
                  nor when I was invited to spend the day with General Washington and his lady; and
                  you would have been the last person, I am sure, to have wished to see me dressed
                  with singularity. Though I never loved dress so much as to wish to be particularly
                  fine, yet I never will go out when I cannot appear so as to do credit to my family
                  and husband. I can assure my dear papa that Industry in this country is by no
                  means laid aside; but as to spinning linen, we cannot think of that till we have
                  got that wove which we spun three years ago. Mr. Duffield has bribed a weaver that
                  lives on his farm to weave me eighteen yards, by making him three or four shuttles
                  for nothing, and keeping it a secret from the country people, who will not suffer
                  them to weave for those in town. This is the third weaver's it has been at, and
                  many fair promises I have had about it. 'Tis now done and whitening; but forty
                  yards of the best remains at Liditz yet, that I was to have had home a twelvemonth
                  last month. Mrs. Keppele, who is gone to Lancaster, is to try to get it done there
                  for me; but not a thread will they weave but for hard money. My maid is now
                  spinning wool for winter stockings for the whole family, which will be no
                  difficulty in the manufactory, as I knit them myself. I only mention these things
                  that you may see that balls are not the only reason that the wheel is laid aside.
                  This winter approaches with so many horrors, that I shall not want any thing to go
                  abroad in, if I can be comfortable at home. My spirits, which I have kept up
                  during my being drove about from place to place, much better than most people's I
                  meet with, have been lowered by nothing but the depreciation of the money, which
                  has been amazing lately, so that home will be the place for me this winter, as I
                  cannot get a common winter cloak and hat but just decent under two hundred pounds;
                  as to gauze now it is fifty dollars a yard, 'tis beyond my wish, and I should
                  think it not only a shame but a sin to buy it, if I had millions."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bache merits her place among the heroines of the Revolution by personal
                  services in the hour of deep need.</p>
               <p>"In the patriotic effort of the ladies of Philadelphia, to furnish the destitute
                  American soldiers with money and clothing during the year 1780, Mrs Bache took a
                  very active part. After the death of Mrs. Reed, the duty of completing the
                  collections and contributions devolved on her and four other ladies,<pb
                     n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7024-00000116"/> as a sort of Executive Committee. The
                  shirts provided were cut out at her house. A letter to Dr. Franklin, part of which
                  has been published, shows how earnestly she was engaged in the work. The Marquis
                  de Chasteliux thus describes a visit which he paid her about this time: 'After
                  this slight repast, which only lasted an hour and a half, we went to visit the
                  ladies, agreeable to the Philadelphia custom, where the morning is the most proper
                  hour for paying visits. We began by Mrs. Bache. She merited all the anxiety we had
                  to see her, for she is the daughter of Mr. Franklin Simple in her manners, like
                  her respected father, she possesses his benevolence. She conducted us into a room
                  filled with work, lately finished by the ladies of Philadelphia. This work
                  consisted neither of embroidered tambour waistcoats, nor of net work edging, nor
                  of gold and silver brocade. It was a quantity of shirts for the soldiers of
                  Pennsylvania. The ladies bought the linen from their own private purses, and took
                  a pleasure in cutting them out and sewing them themselves. On each shirt was the
                  name of the married or unmarried lady who made it; and they amounted to twenty-two
                  hundred."</p>
               <p>In another letter to her father, speaking of her having met with General and Mrs.
                  Washington several times, she adds, "He always inquires after you in the most
                  affectionate manner, and speaks of you highly. We danced at Mrs. Powell's on your
                  birth-day, or night, I should say, in company together, and he told me it was the
                  anniversary of his marriage; it was just twenty years that night." Washington
                  dancing! The statue stepped down from its pedestal!</p>
               <p>Miss Mary Philipse,—afterwards the wife of Captain Roger Morris, who was attainted
                  of treason, and suffered confiscation in punishment of his "loyalty,"—is
                  celebrated as having fascinated Washington, when, in his twenty-fourth year, he
                  travelled from Virginia to Boston, on horseback, attended by his aides-de-camp. He
                  was entertained in New York at the house of Mr. Beverley Robinson, whose wife was
                  the sister of the charming Mary Philipse. It seems quite problematical whether the
                  young chief actually offered himself and suffered the mortification of a refusal,
                  but it is not disputed that his heart was touched, and that the young lady might
                  have been the wife of the Commander-in-chief, and the lady of our first President,
                  if she had chosen. She is represented to have been one of those who rule all about
                  them by an irresistible charm, and the honor in which her memory is held among her
                  descendants proves that Washington was wise in love as well as in war.</p>
               <p>The wife of the traitor Arnold was the daughter of Edward Shippen, Chief Justice
                  of Pennsylvania, of a family distinguished among the aristocracy of the day, and
                  prominent after the commencement of the contest among those who cherished loyalist
                  principles. She was a beautiful girl of eighteen when she became the object of
                  Arnold's attentions; but although he appears, even before marriage, to have imbued
                  her with his own discontented and rancorous feelings towards those who thwarted
                  his plans of selfish ambition, there is not a shadow of proof that the knowledge
                  of his treason did not fall on her, as on the country, like a thunderbolt. But it
                  cannot be pretended that she was one of the women who help to keep men true and
                  brave.</p>
               <p>"She was young, gay, and frivolous; fond of display and admiration, and used to
                  luxury; she was utterly unfitted for the duties and privations of a poor man's
                  wife. A loyalist's daughter, she had been taught to mourn over even the poor
                  pageantry of colonial rank and authority, and to recollect with pleasure the pomp
                  of those brief days of enjoyment, when military men of noble station were her
                  admirers.</p>
               <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7024-00000117"/>
               <p>"Mrs. Arnold was at breakfast with her husband and the aides-de-camp—Washington
                  and the other officers having not yet come—when the letter arrived which bore to
                  the traitor the first intelligence of Andre's capture. He left the room
                  immediately, went to his wife's chamber, sent for her, and briefly informed her of
                  the necessity of his instant flight to the enemy. This was, probably, the first
                  intelligence she received of what had been so long going on; the news overwhelmed
                  her, and when Arnold quitted the apartment, he left her lying in a swoon on the
                  floor.</p>
               <p>"Her almost frantic condition is described with sympathy by Colonel Hamilton, in a
                  letter written the next day: 'The General,' he says, 'went to see her; she
                  upbraided him with being in a plot to murder her child, raved, shed tears, and
                  lamented the fate of the infant. All the sweetness of beauty, all the loveliness
                  of innocence, all the tenderness of a wife, and all the fondness of a mother,
                  showed themselves in her appearance and conduct.'—He, too, expresses his
                  conviction that she had no knowledge of Arnold's plan, till his announcement to
                  her that he must banish himself from his country forever. The opinion of other
                  persons qualified to judge without prejudice, acquitted her of the charge of
                  having participated in the treason. John Jay, writing from Madrid to Catharine
                  Livingston, says—'All the world here are cursing Arnold, and pitying his wife. And
                  Robert Morris writes—'Poor Mrs. Arnold! was there ever such an infernal
                  villain!'</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Arnold went from West Point to her father's house; but was not long
                  permitted to remain in Philadelphia The traitor's papers having been seized, by
                  direction of the Executive authorities, the correspondence with Andre was brought
                  to light; suspicion rested on her; and by an order of the Council, dated Oct.
                  27th, she was required to leave the state, to return no more during the
                  continuance of the war. She accordingly departed to join her husband in New York.
                  The respect and forbearance shown towards her on her journey through the country,
                  notwithstanding her banishment, testified the popular belief in her innocence, M.
                  de Marbois relates, that when she stopped at a village where the people were about
                  to burn Arnold in effigy, they put it off till the next night."</p>
               <p>Truth to say, these reminiscences of the women of our forming day are so
                  interesting, that we might extract more than half the book if we should indulge
                  our disposition to hold up to honor the daughters of the various portions of this
                  extensive country, whose characters were brought out by the influences and chances
                  of the times. We owe them an incalculable debt, to be repaid only by the best
                  possible use of the blessings they bequeathed us, and an interest in the future of
                  our country equal to that which inspired their efforts and sacrifices.</p>

               <head>WESTERN TRAITS,</head>
               <p>IF there be a country on earth where hospitality is free and hearty, it is ours.
                  Whatever faults we may possess as a people, this one virtue—if virtue it may be
                  called which is rather a gratification than a sacrifice of the natural
                  promptings—is flourishing to a degree unknown elsewhere. It seems the spontaneous
                  and generous fruit of our overflowing prosperity; the impulsive rendering to the
                  fellow-creature of the debt which we owe to the All-bounteous Parent. When not
                  crushed by self-induced Penury, or chilled by empty pride, the American heart
                  responds to the claim of the stranger with unerring, electric precision. Whether
                  guests are numbered in thousands, while the government is called upon to play
                  host, or the single stranger knocks at the door of a log-cabin in the midst of a
                  prairie, no hesitation occurs as to the reception, refreshment, and aid of the
                  weary and discouraged traveller. If immigrants overflow our alms-houses and
                  hospitals, we build more; accommodating the surplus, meanwhile, by temporary
                  arrangement, at any cost. If private visiters come down upon us in avalanches, we
                  turn the house out of doors, and make beds in impossible places, rather than
                  refuse to open our doors to any one coming in the sacred character of guest. If
                  our national character suffer—according to certain English observers—from the lack
                  of the ennobling sentiment<figure/>
                  <pb n="233" xml:id="VAC7024-00000119"/> timent of loyalty, we may console
                  ourselves, at least in part, by the reflection that a feeling and habit of
                  hospitality is ennobling too, and perhaps proves no less in favor of the country
                  than the other, especially since it often involves some sacrifice of time,
                  inclination and worldly goods, while loyalty may, and often does evaporate in
                  words. It is easier to swing one's hat and ejaculate, "God save the queen!" while
                  we toss off a bumper, than to receive a poor family, furnish them with food and
                  lodging, and speed them on their way. John Bull's loyalty has never made him look
                  more sweetly upon the tax-gatherer, or embrace with fraternal warmth his Irish
                  fellow-subjects; while our hospitality opens its doors to those whom taxes drive
                  out of their homes, and to the Irish who flee before the tender mercies of their
                  more favored countrymen. There is a vast deal of spurious but showy sentiment in
                  the world.</p>
               <p>But as a matter of individual and self-sacrificing virtue, commend us to the
                  hospitality of the western settler. It extends not only to his neighbors and
                  friends, those who may possibly have an opportunity of returning the kindness, but
                  to business visiters, tax-gatherers, duns! Every decent (white) man is asked to
                  stay to dinner, whether he come to buy land or to serve a writ. This good nature
                  often subjects the inviter to strange table-fellows, but your true Western man is
                  not fastidious. He will see 'unwashen hands,' on his knives and forks rather than
                  endure the thought of having transgressed the laws of hospitality.</p>
               <p>This feeling is peculiarly exhibited in the urgency with which he invites his old
                  parents to 'come out West,' forgetting the unavoidable dangers of the change. And
                  it is no less remarkable how many, unappalled by the prospect<pb n="234-235"
                     xml:id="VAC7024-00000120"/> of leaving the home and the associations of youth,
                  are finally induced by affection or compelled by poverty to join their prosperous
                  children in their new abode. It will be long ere we forget the coming of two old
                  people—the parents of our talkative neighbor, Mrs. Titmouse, whose log-house stood
                  in a lonely spot, where the deer ran past the windows to be shot, and the fox took
                  care of the chickens. Mrs. Titmouse was a perfect Croton in conversation. Her
                  daily talk was like streams, jets, douches—everything but the standing pool or the
                  useful hydrant which gives you just as much as you want.</p>
               <p>"I want to speak to ye just one minute," she would say, if she caught you passing
                  her door. "Sit down now, do! here's a seat"—(wiping it with Sally Jane's
                  sun-bonnet). "I've seen the day when I could ha' gi'n ye a cheer that hadn't a
                  broken back. My old man's shiftless like, ever since he walked out of the third
                  story door of the mill, and hit his head and spoilt that new cap o' his'n. That
                  cap cost twelve shillin' if it cost a copper. He bought it down to Galpin's; or
                  rather I bought it, as I may say, for I airnt the money by spinnin'. Spinnin'
                  isn't sich very bad business, after all, for I airnt enough by my wheel last year
                  to buy that 'ere cap, and them 'ere sashes, there in the corner. If my old man
                  warn't quite so shiftless, we should ha' had something for winders besides cotton
                  sheets, for them sashes has sarved for hen-roosts this six months. Its, ra'ly
                  astonishin' how hens does love to sleep where you don't want 'em to. They allers
                  roosted on the teester of that bed till we got them sashes. I'd rather have 'em
                  there than on the bed, though."</p>
               <p>Thus much would be said while the chair was dusted and the visiter placed in it.
                  Then, would the good dame seat herself upon the bed-side, and continue:—</p>
               <p>"Folks may think, seem' me so kind o' scant off, that I hain't never been used to
                  nothin'; but I can tell ye my folks down east is forehanded folks. I've got a
                  cousin that keeps'as handsome a shoe-store as there is standin' between this and
                  Detroit. And my uncle's daughter, Malindy Brown, is married to a cap'a of a
                  vessel—his boat runs on Connecticut river-I dare say you may have heard of him—one
                  Jabez Coffin. And my cousin, Joe Binks, is a good farmer, with everything
                  comfortable. When I was down east he gi'n me lots o' things. Look a here,
                  now!"</p>
               <p>And with the word, the speaker, in the vehemence of her desire to produce proofs
                  of her gentility, would hop up on the block which served for a sort of stand by
                  the side of the fire, and reach down a huge bag of dried apples, which must be
                  "hefted" on the failing knees of the visiter, in proof of the forehandedness of
                  the friends who could afford to give such evidence of their interest in Mrs.
                  Titmouse. "Theyv'e got apples as plenty as taters," she would say, with a sigh,
                  "and wool and flax too, for all <emph>I</emph>'m so poor. But I'm goin' to have my
                  old father and mother came out here, to see how poor folks live, and I don't
                  believe but what they'll be pleased to see the open-in's too."</p>
               <p>The old father and mother did come, and were duly installed in the
                     "<emph>tees</emph>tered" bed, while everything that the poor farm afforded was
                  put in requisition for their comfort. Chinese exaggeration, "Every thing I have is
                  yours," is literally acted upon in the woods in such cases. No reserve is thought
                  of, from the best bed (though it be the only one) to the last fat chicken, if<pb
                     n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7024-00000121"/> it will pleasure the honored guest,
                  particularly if he come from "the east," that land of dear and splendid
                  memories.</p>
               <p>But all Mrs. Titmouse's care did not succeed in warding off the Destroyer, whose
                  way was made easy by the weight of years, the effects of hard work, the change of
                  climate, and the marsh malaria, which steamed up more venomously than usual, in
                  the autumn of the year in which they came to visit their fluent daughter. Both the
                  old people died; the man first, and the wife of grief for her lost companion. Only
                  four weeks intervened, and the second funeral under such circumstances drew
                  together the whole neighborhood.</p>
               <p>Poor Mrs. Titmouse took her sorrow differently from other people. When her friends
                  came to honor the sad occasion, they found the coffin on its tressels in the open
                  air, under the shade of an ancient tree, and the bereaved daughter hovering about
                  it with her usual appearance of assiduous inefficiency, and an unceasing gush of
                  words. She recounted again and again, as new parties came in, the whole story of
                  her invitation to her parents, their acceptance, their journey; what she had done
                  and tried to do for them while under her roof; the first symptoms of incipient
                  fever; the whole course of medical treatment; the approach of danger; the fears
                  and the regrets of the sufferers and herself; the consolations of the minister;
                  the words of the fatal hour (chiefly her own); the preparations for burial, and
                  the difficulty which occurred as to the digging of the graves, because the money,
                  which must be paid in advance, was not forthcoming. These comprised but a portion
                  of the topics with the discussion of which Mrs. Titmouse sought to relieve her
                  heart, while her apron was every moment lifted to her eyes, to wipe away the tears
                  ever called up anew by the words associated with all these sorrowful
                  circumstances.</p>
               <p>After the clergyman commenced his duties, habitual respect dammed up the stream of
                  talk; but during the long drive to the grave, and at the grave itself, Mrs.
                  Titmouse found herself refreshed enough to recommence the story of her woes. She
                  was glad, at any rate, she said, that the old folks had such decent funerals. She
                  didn't believe they would have had better at "the cast," though all their people
                  were so forehanded; and she would never forget Mr. C.'s kindness in getting
                     <emph>them</emph> graves dug, and would pay him out of the very first spinning
                  money she got. As for her husband, she insisted he was so shiftless, that there
                  never would have been any graves dug if they had waited for him. To be sure, he
                  said his back was lame, but it wasn't so lame but what he could sit on the counter
                  at the store, playing checkers with that loafer, Levi Cram, until sun-down, never
                  thinking of what was to be done.</p>
               <p>At the grave the complaint took the form of more vehement lamentation. All the
                  while they were lowering the body, Mrs. Titmouse stood looking in and wringing her
                  hands. "Oh, my poor old father and mother! I'm sorry enough that ever I asked ye
                  to come away from your comfortable home, out here into the Michi<emph>gan</emph>
                  to die, away from every body! Not but what it's a good place to live and die in,
                  and I'm sure I'm under an everlastin' compliment to the neighbors for their
                  kindness, and particularly Mr. C., for having the graves dug, and lending us his
                  wagon; and if our pigs turn out any thing, which I'm afraid they won't, I shall
                  certainly send Mr. C. one, besides paying him in money. Or if the pigs shouldn't
                  do well, perhaps the chickens will. Any how, I'll find something, for I'm under<pb
                     n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7024-00000122"/> an everlastin' compliment; and hope
                  when any of you gets into trouble, you'll find them that's able and willin' to
                  help ye, though I wouldn't advise any one to bring their old father and mother out
                  here, for though it's a good country enough for them that's strong and hearty, it
                  ain't no place for old folks."</p>
               <p>This is but a trifling specimen of Mrs. Titmouse's grief-prompted oration; for pen
                  and ink are too slow to give any idea of all that she managed to enunciate while
                  the mould was filling in. Her talking was so proverbial in the whole neighborhood,
                  that a reprobate fellow in telling the particulars of a fit of illness, which had
                  brought him to the verge of the grave, added: "But after all, the Lord was very
                  good to me; for he never let old Mother Titmouse come near me, or I shouldn't have
                  sot here this day."</p>
               <p>After our experience and observation, we cannot recommend the emigration of people
                  advanced in years, though we are far from predicting for them the fate of Mrs.
                  Titmouse's parents. Under the most favorable circumstances, there are many
                  privations to be undergone in a new country; and though the disorders which belong
                  to a luxuriant soil in the first stages of its cultivation, are not generally
                  fatal to the young and robust, the constitution of the aged lacks stamina, to
                  rally after the first attack But to those who do go, we can promise hospitality
                  unequalled in the richest dwellings of the old world The ready hand, the hearty
                  greeting, the offered bed, the bounteous table, the best seat at the fire, await
                  the traveller who comes to the country with the intention to settle. Those who fly
                  to the prairies in pursuit of a new pleasure, may sometimes meet the cold
                  shoulder—indeed, some have made complaints of that sort; but our knowledge of
                  western people assures us that if the other side could be heard, there would be
                  good reason—either of haughty pride in the visiter, or sad deficiency or
                  unhappiness in the house—to account for any such departure from the universal
                  rule.</p>
               <p>The very privations and difficulties of a new country lead to a kindness which is
                  founded upon the keenest sympathy. Prosperity is but too apt to make us selfish
                  and exacting, while it increases our wants, and leaves us little to spare. But
                  when we have ourselves felt the needs which we observe in the newcomer—when we
                  have felt the heart-sickness which grows out of fatigue—strangeness—remembrance of
                  home, and uncertainty as to the future—all referring, not to mere luxuries and
                  superfluities, but to the first requisites of comfort, or even of existence, the
                  heart yearns with a fraternal tenderness toward him who is treading in the steps
                  we have but just quitted, and we are willing to make the toils and sacrifices
                  through which we have passed available in smoothing the way for another.</p>

               <head>SAINTS OF OUR DAY.</head>
               <p>THE disadvantageous position into which circumstances fruitful of good to a
                  certain point, have helped to push our clergy, deprives society in a great measure
                  of the benefit of their example, since their position differs so entirely from
                  that of the rest of the world, that nobody ever thinks of them as affording
                  precedents for other men's lives and doings. Every other man but the clergyman has
                  such a career of prosperity opened to him, in politics, commerce, the mechanic
                  arts, law, or medicine, that for a man of talents to decide on consecrating
                  himself to the work of the ministry, is equivalent to a vow of poverty. The
                  ministry is the only calling among us in which the greatest gifts and the most
                  severe labors, except under the most rare and fortunate circumstances, bring only
                  a meagre livelihood and no hope of provision for a surviving family. Thus excluded
                  from competition and success, in the grand pursuit which maddens the world all
                  about him, who ever thinks of the clergyman as an example? Esteem and honor he
                  has, no doubt, and abundant outward respect; but he is looked upon as a man apart,
                  and supposed to be really more in sympathy with the women who form the larger
                  portion of his congregation, and take generally some slight share in its duties,
                  than with the men who can scarcely afford time and attention for one service on
                  Sunday, let the sermon have cost ever so much time and thought, prayer and
                  anxiety. This being the case, the form of sainthood perhaps more needed among us
                  than any other, is a manifest superiority to the corruption of riches, and a
                  determination, known and read of all men, to consecrate the fruits of industry and
                  blessing to the Lord who permits their in-gathering. The triumph of the rich man
                  over his riches is a great victory, now and here. Garlands and civic crowns might
                  well be adjudged to such a hero. He must be no devotee to poverty, no despiser of
                  the thrift, the enterprise and the glorious success of our conventional life; but
                  one who, having entered largely into trade, and fully succeeded, learns to make
                  his gains the fuel of that holy fire which alone has power to consume all
                  selfishness in the career of charity.</p>
               <p>Such a man, if we have rightly read various notices of his character and actions,
                  was the late Amos Lawrence, whom we cannot forbear to mention when we think of
                  some of the saintly lives lately closed among us. Known alike as the head of one
                  of the most distinguished commercial houses in the United States, and as the most
                  liberal dispenser of charity in the most beneficent city in the world, we cannot
                  but feel that he is indeed an example of the virtue we most need. Nowhere is the
                  influence of wealth likely to be worse than where its duties are so little
                  determined by established requirements, or hereditary obligations, and where every
                  man is the exclusive controller of his own possessions. Over all the temptations
                  besetting the wealthy class in our country, Amos Lawrence must be confessed to
                  have obtained a complete victory. He began as a poor boy; he made his fortune by
                  hard work; he grew up under the spur of emulation; he dealt in a community where a
                  moderate generosity would have conciliated the entire respect of the public;<pb
                     n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7024-00000124"/> he was neither a partisan in politics,
                  nor a sectarian in religion. There seemed nothing, in short, to turn him aside
                  from the ordinary course of rising men about him; going on to accumulate
                  indefinitely, bestowing liberally from time to time of his surplus on special
                  charities, but always adding house to house and barn to barn, as the inevitable
                  and laudable business of a wealthy and prosperous man.</p>
               <p>But Mr. Lawrence did no such thing. The moment he found himself possessed of the
                  means to satisfy the natural and proper claims of his family, he determined,—not
                  to leave the cares and labors of business for the enjoyment of leisure or
                  self-cultivation, but to consecrate all that should reward his future industry to
                  the immediate benefit of his fellow-men. He resolved never to be any richer; thus
                  rebuking the spirit of accumulation, while on the other hand he honored the spirit
                  of enterprise, by continuing his activity, and devoting its proceeds to the
                  necessities of the less able or less fortunate. In pursuance of this plan, he is
                  believed to have given away, during the last twenty years of his life, not less
                  than half a million of dollars, an amount not more remarkable than the mode in
                  which it was distributed. He was no lavish or fitful giver. He made it literally
                  the principal business of his life, during the period we have named, to search
                  out, by inquiry and reflection, the best and most useful forms of liberality. He
                  spared no personal labor in the details of his benevolence. The time and counsel,
                  the sympathy and tenderness he bestowed were in proportion to the constancy and
                  magnitude of his pecuniary donations. He was as careful in distributing as if he
                  had been responsible to a board of directors, and yet as free as if he were the
                  almoner of a fortune in which he had no personal interest. The warmth of his heart
                  never encroached on the coolness of his head. The very qualities essential to
                  success in life came into play in achieving that higher success which rightfully
                  immortalizes his example. Collision with competitors had never hardened his heart,
                  but only taught him patience and pity. Business habits had not blunted his
                  sensibilities, dulled his fancy or starved his love of nature, and his sympathy
                  with poverty, with childhood, and whatever else touches the best hearts. He needed
                  no separation from common life, no narrowing down of its duties, to become a
                  saint. He pursued his business with the same, justice, generosity, purity and
                  truth, that presided over his benefactions. He was as much a saint in making as in
                  spending his fortune. He exercised as benignant an influence over his clerks as
                  over his beneficiaries; and let no young man go to ruin under his eye, while he
                  was providing for possible evils among those he never saw.</p>
               <p>Do we seem hasty in classing this man of goodness with the saints? It is true he
                  would have shrunk with no simulated blushes from the title; but can any one of
                  ordinary experience suppose that such a character had not its foundations deep in
                  religiousness of heart? "Of creeds laid in the understanding, and not influencing
                  the life," says President Hopkins, "he thought little; the tendency of his mind
                  was to practical rather than to doctrinal views. He believed in our Lord Jesus
                  Christ as a Saviour, and trusted in him for salvation. He was a man of habitual
                  prayer. The last time I visited him he said to me that he had been restless during
                  the night, and that the only way in which he could get quieted was 'by getting
                  near to God.'" So all the building, fitly framed together grew into a holy temple
                  in the Lord. None that ever looked<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7024-00000125"/> on
                  the soft, sensitive countenance of that holy man, all furrowed over as it was with
                  smiles and tears; or saw it kindle with the rapture of devotion as he walked among
                  the scenes of the Nature he loved so enthusiastically; or as he listened to the
                  appeals of religious truth; none that ever heard him speak of the sorrow or
                  suffering of others, or was privileged to partake of his own more immediate and
                  private griefs,—can think of Amos Lawrence otherwise than as a true and blessed
                  Saint. The city of Boston owes a statue to his memory; for his character was
                  intimately associated with his person, and his inspiring face ought never to
                  become unfamiliar in a community where his name will never die.</p>
               <p>Only in one city that we know of—Genoa—is there a place hallowed all about by the
                  statues of men who, from the means and habits of private fortune and private life,
                  have done some great, quiet good to the state. The walls of the old hall of San
                  Giorgio seem endowed with sentient and tender life, as the traveller reads, from
                  modest scrolls, the records of civic services done by those grave, plain citizens
                  to their birth city. One procured a remission of the tax on salt, long a burthen
                  to the poor; another dowered many young maidens; another built a bridge much
                  needed, and so on. Happy Genoa, that reared and knew how to value such citizens!
                  Happy Boston, that could line a great chamber as nobly; wise Boston, if she see
                  fit to do it!</p>
               <p>We cannot estimate how much our great metropolis, New York, might be able to do in
                  this way, if she were disposed to dedicate a pantheon to beneficence instead of
                  wealth or talent. She has at least her Peter Cooper, who, in the prime of his
                  days, consecrates at once, to a benevolent institution on the largest scale, a sum
                  nearly equal to that we have mentioned as the twenty years' contribution of Mr.
                  Lawrence to the good of his native place. But canonization very properly awaits
                  the seal of death; and we prefer to speak of a mildly shining light just gone out,
                  to our mortal apprehension, in the death of Father Hopper, a Quaker of our city,
                  and for almost three-quarters of a century known as the friend, advocate and
                  helper of all the wretched and the oppressed, of whatever name, creed or
                     color.<ref rend="super" target="#note_001" xml:id="return_001">*</ref>
                   His bright, benignant face is now forever hidden from our sight; his
                  cheery step will no more attract the reverent attention of the stranger; we have
                  no longer the benefit of his advice when the wretched is to be saved or the erring
                  admonished; but the remembrance of the just man will never die out of the hearts
                  that have known and loved him.</p>
               <note place="foot" xml:id="note_001">
                  
                  <p><ref target="#return_001">*</ref>The slight sketch of Father Hopper, inserted here, is taken from a little
                     book by the present author, called the 'Helping Hand," written for the

                     Child.</p>
               </note>
               <p>"The rich and the poor meet together, and the Lord is the Father of them all,"
                  might stand for the motto of Mr. Hopper's life. That the most remote of these two
                  classes stood on the same level of benevolent interest in his mind, his whole
                  career made obvious; he was the last man to represent as naturally opposite those
                  whom God has always, even "to the end of the world," made mutually dependent. He
                  told the simple truth to each with equal frankness; he helped both with equal
                  readiness. The palace awed him no more than the hovel suggested thoughts of
                  superiority. Nothing human—however grand or however degraded—was a stranger to
                  him. In the light which came to him from Heaven, all stood alike children of the
                     Great<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7024-00000126"/> Father; earthly distinctions
                  disappearing the moment the sinking soul or the suffering body was in question. No
                  amount of depravity could extinguish his hope of reform; no recurrence of
                  ingratitude could paralyze his efforts. Early and late, supported or unsupported,
                  praised or ridiculed—he went forward to the great work of relief, looking neither
                  to the right hand nor to the left; and when the object was accomplished, he shrank
                  back into modest obscurity, only to wait till a new necessity called for his
                  re-appearance. Who can number the poor, aching, conscious, despairing hearts that
                  have felt new life come to them from his kind words, his benignant smile, his
                  "helping hand?" If the record of his long life could be fully written,—which it
                  can never be, since every day and all day, in company, in the family circle, with
                  children, with prisoners, with the insane—"virtue went out of him" that no human
                  observation could measure or describe,—what touching interest would be added to
                  the history of our poor and vicious population for more than half a century'past;
                  what new honor and blessing would surround the venerated name of our departed
                  friend and leader!</p>
               <p>But he desired nothing of this. Without claiming for him a position above
                  humanity, which alone would account for a Willingness to be wholly unrecognized as
                  a friend of the afflicted, it is not too much to say that no man was ever less
                  desirous of public praise or outward honor. He was even unwilling that any care
                  should be taken to preserve the remembrance of his features, sweet and beautiful
                  as they were, though he was brought reluctantly to yield to the anxious wishes of
                  his children and friends, that the countenance on which every eye loved to dwell,
                  should not be wholly lost when the grave should close above it. He loved to talk
                  of interesting cases of reform and recovery, both because these things occupied
                  his mind, and because every one loved to hear him; but the hearer who made these
                  disclosures the occasion for unmeaning compliment, as if he fancied a craving
                  vanity to have prompted them, soon found himself rebuked by the straight-forward
                  and plain-spoken patriarch. Precious indeed were those seasons of outpouring, when
                  one interesting recital suggested another, till the listener seemed to see the
                  whole mystery of prison-life and obscure wretchedness laid open before him with
                  the distinctness of a picture. For, strange as it may seem, our friend had under
                  his plain garb—unchanged in form since the days of Dr. Franklin, to go no further
                  back—a fine dramatic talent, and could not relate the humblest incident without
                  giving a picturesque or dramatic turn, speaking now for one character, now for
                  another, with a variety and discrimination very remarkable. This made his company
                  greatly sought, and as his strongly social nature readily responded, his
                  acquaintance was very large. To every one that knew him personally, I can appeal
                  for the truth and moderation of these views of his character and manners.</p>
               <p>A few biographical items will close what I venture to offer here.</p>
               <p>Isaac T, Hopper was born December 3, 1771, in the township of Deptford, Gloucester
                  County, West Jersey, but spent a large portion of his life in Philadelphia, where
                  he served his apprenticeship to the humble calling of a tailor. But neither the
                  necessity for constant occupation nor the temptations of youthful gaiety,
                  prevented his commencing, even then, the devotion of a portion of his time to the
                  care of the poor and needy. He had scarcely reached man's estate when we find him
                  an active<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7024-00000127"/> member of a benevolent
                  association, and his volumes of notes of cases, plans and efforts, date back to
                  that early period. To that time also we are to refer the beginning of his warm
                  antislavery sentiment, a feeling so prominent and effective throughout his life,
                  and the source of some of his noblest efforts and sacrifices. For many years he
                  served as Inspector of Prisons in Philadelphia, and thus, by long and constant
                  practical observation, was accumulated that knowledge of the human heart, in its
                  darkest windings, that often astonished the objects of his care, when they thought
                  they had been able cunningly to blind his eyes to their real character and
                  intentions. After his removal to New York, and when the occasion for his personal
                  labors in the cause of the slave had in some measure ceased or slackened, he threw
                  his whole heart into the Prison Association, whose aims and plans of action were
                  entirely in accordance with his views, and indeed in a great degree based on his
                  experience and advice. The intent of the Prison Association is three-fold: first,
                  to protect and defend those who are arrested, and who, as is well known, often
                  suffer greatly from want of honest and intelligent counsel; secondly, to attend to
                  the treatment and instruction of convicts while in prison; and thirdly, on their
                  discharge to render them such practical aid as shall enable the repentant to
                  return to society by means of the pursuit of some honest calling. This latter
                  branch occupied Father Hopper's time and attention, and he devoted himself to it
                  with an affectionate and religious earnestness that ceased only with his life. No
                  disposition was too perverse for his efforts at reform; no heart was so black that
                  he did not at least try the balm of healing upon it; no relapses could tire out
                  his patience, which, without weak waste of means, still, apostolically, went on,
                  "hoping all things" while even a dying spark of good feeling remained. Up to
                  February 1852 did this venerable saint continue his abundant labors; when a severe
                  cold co-operating with the decay of nature, brought him his sentence of dismissal.
                  He felt that it was on the way, and with the serious grace that marked every thing
                  he did, he began at once to gather his earthly robes about him and prepare for the
                  great change, which no one could dread less. It was hard for those who saw his
                  ruddy check and sparkling eye, his soft brown hair and sprightly movements, to
                  feel that the time of his departure was drawing nigh; but he knew and felt it,
                  with more composure than his friends could summon. It might well be said of this
                  our beloved patriarch, that "his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated."
                  To the last of his daily journeyings through the city, for which he generally used
                  the rail-road, he would never allow the drivers to stop for him to get on or off
                  the car—feeling, as he used smilingly to observe, "very jealous on that point."
                  Few ever passed him in the street without asking who he was; for not only did his
                  primitive dress, his broad-brimmed hat, and his antique shoe-buckles, attract
                  attention, but the beauty and benevolence of his face was sure to fix the eye of
                  ordinary discernment. He was a living temperance lecture, and those who desire to
                  preserve good looks could not ask a more infallible recipe, than that sweet temper
                  and out-flowing benevolence which made his countenance please every eye. Gay and
                  cheerful as a boy, he had ever some pleasant ancedote or amusing turn to relate,
                  and in all perhaps not one without a moral bearing, not thrust forward, but left
                  to be picked out by the hearer at his leisure. He seemed born to show how great
                  strictness in essentials could exist without the least asceticism in trifles.
                     Any<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7024-00000128"/> thing but a Simeon Stylites in
                  his sainthood, he could go among "publicans and sinners" without the least fear of
                  being mistaken by them for one of themselves. An influence radiated from him that
                  made itself felt in every company, though he would very likely be the most modest
                  man present. More gentlemanly manners and address no court in Christendom need
                  require; his resolute simplicity and candor, always under the guidance of a
                  delicate taste, never for a moment degenerated into coarseness, or disregard even
                  of the prejudices of others. His life, even In these minute particulars, showed
                  how the whole man was harmonized by the sense of being <q>
                     <l>"Ever in the great Taskmaster's eye."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>He died on the 7th of May, 1852, in his eighty-first year, and a public funeral in
                  the Tabernacle brought together thousands desirous of showing respect to his
                  memory.</p>
               <p>Would we had more City missionaries like those we have spoken of! What a change
                  would be wrought, even in our great metropolis, by the labors of fifty such men as
                  Amos Lawrence, Peter Cooper and Isaac T. Hopper! We will not presume to indicate
                  the particular work that each class might undertake, but we see every day
                  something fitted for every hand. No need of seeking the far Indies for a field of
                  noble action. The success of the Five Points Mission, under the indefatigable care
                  of Mr. Pease, is hint enough, though on a scale so small. The marvel is that the
                  men who have made fortunes in the fostering lap of our great and prosperous city,
                  can sit down content without doing something proportionate for the public good—for
                  the benefit of their own children or successors, for a memorial of gratitude to
                  God and man. One would think there were instances enough of the curse that
                  attaches, by a natural process, to wealth unblest, if the sweetness of doing nobly
                  were not inducement enough. May the day be not long deferred when humanity and
                  public spirit will not appear so splendid as they do now!</p>
               <p>"Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints;" precious should
                  their lives be in the hearts of living men. Such lives need little commendation;
                  simple description is their best praise. They cannot be contemplated without
                  profit, let us hope without some attempts-some hope—at least some wish—towards
                  imitation. Well says the prayer book:—"We bless Thy holy name for all Thy servants
                  departed this life in Thy faith and fear." The aroma of such lives is sanative to
                  all around. Preaching may fail, but a good life never; there is something in our
                  nature that must ever respond and thrill under the influence of heavenly charity.
                  With these men, it was no incident, but an object—<emph>the</emph> object—for
                  which they lived. They saw work to be done for their fellows and they did it. It
                  seems on this simple statement as if no man could do otherwise and be a man; yet
                  by the condition of things around us, how few there must be that view the duty of
                  life under so simple and true and wholesome an aspect!</p>

                  <p>"I AM afraid you will educate Mary to death, my dear," said Mr. Austin to his
                     wife, in reply to a long detail of her plans for the perfecting of this her
                     only daughter. "Too much education is as bad as too little."</p>
                  <p>"Too much education, Mr. Austin! who ever heard of such a thing? Everybody is
                     complaining of the want of education among us, and you, yourself, I am sure,
                     often criticise young ladies, and say they are miserably educated. But you are
                     the strangest man! Haven't I always kept Mary under my own eye, and had masters
                     and governesses for her, instead of sending her to a fashionable school, where
                     she would have learned frivolity and nonsense, and given up society that I
                     might never lose sight of her for a moment? Haven't I watched even her
                     mantua-maker, and forbidden her to describe the finery of other customers, and
                     bought Mary's bonnets myself, without even letting her try them on, lest she
                     should become vain? I am sure I don't know what more a mother could do for a
                     child——</p>
                  <p>"You forget, my dear," said Mr. Austin, quietly, "that I warned you against
                     doing too much, not too little. My fears point rather toward Mary's becoming a
                     mere automaton, for want of the habit of thinking and acting for herself, than
                     to any deficiency in the list of her accomplishments. Mary is seventeen now,
                     and might be trusted, I think, to her own judgment sometimes. But you know, I
                     never interfere, my dear," Mr. Austin concluded, as he saw a look of deep
                     dejection settling on the face of his wife. "I dare say you know best, but I
                     thought I would make the suggestion." And the good husband took his hat and
                     gloves and went off to his office, rather sorry that he should have said a word
                     which might grieve or discourage the most anxious and self-devoted of mothers,
                     even for the benefit of the most precious of daughters.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Austin, on her part, was made irremediably miserable for the whole day. If
                     she had a hobby, it was the education of Mary. She had been a theorist on the
                     subject of education before she possessed a daughter on whom to practice; and
                     when she had one, she began on the most profound principles laid down in her
                     favorite books before the child was a month old. It proved no easy matter to
                     adhere closely to rules, for, to her surprise, she found many cases not
                     provided for in any of the books; but she did what she could. When she could
                     not follow Mrs. Hamilton, she tried to find a precedent in Rousseau, and when
                     Mrs. Child failed her, she sought instruction in Mrs. Chapone, or Locke, or
                     Hannah More, or Dr. Gregory, or some one of the good ladies who have given tons
                     of advice to the wives, mothers, grand-mothers and cousins of England and
                     America. And now to meet an implied censure! and from her husband, who had
                     always approved of all she did,<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7024-00000130"/> and
                     contrasted Mary and her accomplishments with universal girldom, so exultingly!
                     It was too much for her philosophy.</p>
                  <p>"Mother," said Mary, entering at the moment when all this and much more had
                     come full upon the unhappy parent; "Mother! shall I wear my new dress
                     to-day?"</p>
                  <p>"Wear whatever you like, Mary," said Mrs. Austin, determined to begin at once
                     to give Mary up to her own control, a sort of despair nerving her for the
                     sacrifice of her cherished supervision.</p>
                  <p>Mary looked at her mother, scarcely trusting her ears. She observed the cloud,
                     and added, "Perhaps, mamma, you would rather I should wear something else?"</p>
                  <p>"No, my dear," was the sad-toned reply. And Mary withdrew in a complete puzzle,
                     not knowing what to do in so trying an emergency. She stood balancing between
                     the new dress she longed to wear, and the old one she more than half suspected
                     her mother wished her to put on, in a most painful uncertainty. The new one was
                     taken up and laid down a half dozen times, and the old one glanced at as often;
                     the time for dressing almost elapsed, and the first master's hour was on the
                     point of striking, and still Mary dutifully balanced. What a relief was the
                     sound of her mother's voice at the door.</p>
                  <p>"Mary, I think as the walking is very bad, and you are going out, perhaps you
                     had better reserve your new dress for another day, but <emph>you can do just as
                        you like.</emph>" And both were pleased—the mother to think she had not
                     controlled Mary, and the daughter that she was saved the new trouble of
                     deciding for herself.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <p>WAS Mary always so submissive? She endeavored to be so, for she was a good
                     girl; but she did not invariably succeed, for she had been endowed by nature
                     with a mind and heart, and such things are apt to assert their rights in spite
                     of education; Habit has a wonderful influence, and makes things easy which
                     would else be intolerable. Mary had never known freedom of any kind. She had
                     always been surrounded with tender restraints, as if by a netting of strong
                     wires, gilded, but impassable. Young companions had been selected for her,
                     brought in with a formal introduction and a command, implied at least, to love
                     and cherish; but these expedients turned out, as such things always must,
                     complete failures, and Mary preferred her books, her music, her flowers and her
                     needle-work, to such unnatural associations. So she grew up a perfect child,
                     without any of those precocious initiations into the ways of the world which
                     are so apt to be the consequence of unlimited acquaintance. She read many
                     books, but they were either books of direct instruction, conned at the rate of
                     a certain number of pages per day, or they were full of erasures, leaves pasted
                     together, and notes of qualification or dissent, the work of the mother who had
                     determined to be taste, conscience, and judgment to her daughter, until such
                     time as she should have arrived at years of discretion. When this important
                     period was likely to arrive it was not easy to say. At seventeen it was
                     certainly as far off as ever.</p>
                  <p>But this hint from Mr. Austin, this cruel blow from a quarter<pb n="256-257"
                        xml:id="VAC7024-00000131"/> whence it was least anticipated, this flash of
                     unwelcome light, which suggested nothing but darkness, changed the whole
                     current of Mrs. Austin's life and Mary's. Such things come upon us with double
                     power when they give force and form to suspicions which we have before
                     entertained but would not acknowledge. An unpleasant sense of Mary's lack of
                     individuality had often, within a year or two, suggested itself to Mrs. Austin,
                     but she had crushed down the unwelcome thought, as a heresy against the true
                     theory of education. That was past now, and her vexation was proportioned to
                     the dissolution of a lifelong dream. Mary must act for herself; and in coming
                     to this resolution, her mother felt very much as she would have done if cruel
                     necessity had obliged her to throw her darling overboard at sea, to take her
                     chance on a single plank.</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                  <p>MARY had never walked out alone in her life; but the time had now come when she
                     must brave the dangers of the streets. Her mother desired her to go down to
                     Stewart's, but fortified her with many directions and cautions, as to keeping
                     on the right side of the street, and looking on all sides before crossing.</p>
                  <p>She was rather pleased with the novelty, and performed her errand very well,
                     though with somewhat of the timid and suspicious air of a deaf and dumb person,
                     who walks in the crowd but not of it. On her return, a beautiful large dog
                     attracted her attention as she was crossing the street, and the next instant
                     stant she was knocked down by a passing carriage, driven at the furious rate so
                     common among us.</p>
                  <p>The blow was slight, but it frightened her excessively, and she was taken up
                     and put into another carriage by the gentleman to whom the dog belonged, before
                     she fully recovered her consciousness. As soon as she was sufficiently
                     collected to name her address, she found herself on the way home, bewildered
                     and amazed, but not so unhappy as might have been expected. It was an
                     adventure, and the gentleman was very gentlemanly and not very old.</p>
                  <p>Arrived at her father's door, Mary, in all simplicity invited her protector to
                     come in, an invitation which he did not fail to accept. Mrs. Austin, who had
                     scarcely yet begun to expect her daughter's return, was confounded at the
                     accident, but yet more so at the sight of the handsome young man. She thought
                     of certain old fables and fairy-tales, in which the very means that are adopted
                     to avert the decrees of fate, only operate to secure their fulfilment. She saw,
                     as in a magic mirror, all the trouble that would follow this unfortunate
                     rencontre, and she could scarcely be civil to poor Philip Wentworth, who looked
                     very innocent and inoffensive, and handed her his card with an air which said,
                     "you see, my dear madam, you have nothing to fear," while Mary related in her
                     artless way the terrible adventure.</p>
                  <p>The protector made his call very short, and Mrs. Austin did not invite him to
                     repeat it. But Mary did, and he promised quite readily.</p>
                  <p>"How could you do so, Mary?" said Mrs. Austin.</p>
                  <p>"Why, dear mother, I thought you had forgotten it," said Mary; "and he is so
                     pleasant."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                  <p>THINGS went on after this, just as might have been expected. Mrs. Austin's
                     worst forebodings were realized. Philip Went-worth continued to visit Mary, and
                     Mary evidently liked him, although she was not the girl to fall in love
                     undutifully without leave. Some young ladies read novels as some old ladies
                     read "Domestic Medicine," for the purpose of studying symptoms, and discovering
                     the true causes of their own "feelings." But Mary had read few novels, and
                     those not of the description of which love forms the staple, so she had heard
                     but little about symptoms, and forgot that she had any "feelings." The
                     education went on very much as usual, since the sad consequences of trusting
                     her out alone had fully convinced Mrs. Austin that she had been premature in
                     allowing her to think for herself. She never went to balls, and not often to
                     parties, and saw not much society of any kind; but when she <emph>did</emph> go
                     out, it was really odd to see how often she happened to meet Philip Went
                     worth.</p>
                  <p>Now any young gentleman who should have shown an especial liking for Mary,
                     would have been disagreeable to Mrs. Austin, at least while Mary was so young;
                     and Philip Wentworth was particularly unpleasing, because he had his fortune to
                     make in the first place, and also, because, secondly, he evinced quite too much
                     disposition to consider Mary as a free agent and to see her act as one. Every
                     possible obstacle was thrown in the way of their intercourse, except absolutely
                     forbidding Wentworth's visits. This step the respectability of his connections
                     and his own unexceptionable character forbade; at least Mr. Austin would not
                     hear of it. There is no knowing what Mrs. Austin might have done if she had
                     followed out her own ideas of prudence. But in the midst of her perturbations,
                     and when she had got so far as to lose half of every night's sleep in
                     cogitations, as to ways and means of preserving Mary from the snares of
                     matrimony, Philip Wentworth was fortunately obliged to make a journey to the
                     far South. He called to say farewell, and Mrs. Austin almost groaned aloud, to
                     see the look of undisguised, regret with which Mary gave him her hand at
                     parting. Mary was an artless child, and she lay silent on the sofa half the
                     evening after Philip's departure, and then opened the piano and played
                     voluntaries until bed-time. Mrs. Austin gave her husband another look, which
                     said as sufficiently as looks could, "you see it is all over."</p>
                  <p>But the next morning Mary resumed her cheerfulness, and after a few days seemed
                     almost to have forgotten Philip. Hope revived in Mrs. Austin's bosom, and when,
                     after a few weeks, Mr. Austin found himself called to spend a part of the
                     summer at the West, and invited his wife and daughter to accompany him, the
                     careful mother felt as if the game was in her own hands. The journey, the new
                     faces, the new world, would do wonders. Young people are always absorbed in the
                     present, and Mary would soon forget Philip Wentworth. She showed no great
                     disposition for the trip, but acquiesced quietly, and took all proper interest
                     in the elegant outfit which her mother thought proper to provide for this
                     peculiar mode of "coming out," the only one to which she meant ever to subject
                     Mary.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
                  <p>On board the lake steamer our travellers found a very charming old lady, who
                     had resided for some years at the West, and who, with the frankness
                     characteristic of that social region, imparted the fruits of her observation of
                     settlers' life with a great deal of vivacity and good nature She happened to be
                     going to the same hotel at Detroit, and as she remained there for several days,
                     the acquaintance had become pretty well ripened before her son came with his
                     carriage to take her home. At parting she gave Mr. and Mrs. Austin and Mary a
                     pressing invitation to visit her in the country, an invitation which they
                     promised to accept before they left Detroit to return to the city.</p>
                  <p>Detroit is an exceedingly pleasant place for a sojourn. Highly cultivated
                     society, a charming situation, amusements of all sorts, music, riding, driving,
                     steal away the hours before one is aware. Yet our Mary, instead of gaining in
                     health and spirits, evidently declined every day. The rosy cheek paled, the
                     bright eye was too much shaded by its pearly lid, the fingers let fall their
                     rings, through loss of their pretty roundness. Mrs. Austin began to fear that
                     the climate did not agree with her darling, and urged Mr. Austin to hasten
                     their return home. But this was not a proper or even a prudent season for a
                     return to the city, and Mr. Austin proposed first a visit to Mrs. Ellery, the
                     pleasant old lady of the steamer. So to Meadowbank they went and found a
                     farmer's paradise—flocks, herds, geese, chickens, turkeys, horses, dogs, and
                     last a good, comfortable, spacious house, well shaded, and within a few
                     moments' walk of the primeval woods. The welcome was in proportion to all the
                     other abundance.</p>
                  <p>Mr. and Mrs. Austin could not but find all this very charming for a day or two,
                     though they were not the sort of people for the country. But Mary! Never was
                     there a creature so happy. It was her first sight of unmarred Nature, and all
                     her troubles, (if she had any,) were forgotten in the intoxication of a sweet
                     and most natural pleasure She rode, she ran, she climbed fences, she milked
                     cows, (or tried to do it,) she fed the chickens till they followed her in
                     flocks. She rambled in the dense old woods with Mrs. Ellery's grand-children,
                     from breakfast time till dinner, in spite of all Mrs. Austin's fears of cougars
                     and rattle-snakes. This was evidently the place for her, whatever it was to her
                     father and mother, and they were reluctant to propose the return for which
                     their souls were longing. Besides how to prolong a visit of those guests, who
                     must consider themselves only chance acquaintances! It would never do, and Mary
                     was desired to prepare for the return to Detroit. Here was a sad affair. Mary
                     cried heartily, she could not help it. The love of trees, and grass, and
                     thronging domestic creatures, is a fountain of pleasure to unspoiled hearts,
                     and to Mary this source of happiness was so new. Fortunately, good Mrs. Ellery
                     needed not the sight of her young guest's tear-stained eyes, to impel her to
                     kind urgency for a longer visit; and when Mr. and Mrs. Austin could not be
                     prevailed upon, she begged for Mary, until Mr. Austin was fain to yield. The
                     idea of leaving Mary behind, could not, at first, be made intelligible to Mrs.
                     Austin. The imprudence, the utter insanity of trusting a child of that age
                     alone, was too great. But her husband, who had observed with delight Mary's
                     spirits and returning roses,<pb n="262" xml:id="VAC7024-00000134"/> reminded
                     her that the child could hardly be considered quite alone, with good Mrs.
                     Ellery, her son, and his wife, and their children, not to mention the horses,
                     cows, pigs, chickens and lambs, with whom Mary was nearly as intimate and as
                     happy. He suggested too, that while she was in the woods she was not near
                     Philip Wentworth; and we rather think it was this crowning argument, which he
                     wisely reserved for the last, that decided the point in Mary's favor.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                  <p>The wild delight of flying about from morning till night palled somewhat, after
                     a few days, and Mary found her chief pleasure in the grand old woods that
                     skirted the ample farm of Mrs, Ellery. Here she would wander, half pensively,
                     "thinking," of course "of nothing at all," or recline on some mossy bank, while
                     the children wreathed her hair with the thousand wild flowers that bloomed in
                     every spot to which the sun found access. So charming was the calm solitude,
                     that she often remained with her young companions in some favorite spot, until
                     the westering sun, and the voice of lowing herds returning to their milking,
                     recalled her wandering thoughts.</p>
                  <p>It was on some such occasion, when a splendid sunset, such as one sees to
                     perfection in the country of the great lakes, detained her later than usual,
                     that she was alarmed by the bounds of what she thought might be a wild animal,
                     which approached from the side next Mrs. Ellery's. In a moment it stood before
                     her, and proved to be only a large spotted dog, very much like<pb
                        n="(Illustration) -263" xml:id="VAC7024-00000135"/>
                     <figure/> the one which introduced her to Philip Wentworth a few months
                     before.</p>
                  <p>"Carlo!" she said, and the fine fellow wagged his tail as intelligibly as a dog
                     could, and laid his head against her hand. Could it be her old
                     acquaintance?</p>
                  <p>"Carlo!" she said again, and bowed her head over him, till the flowers fell
                     from her head in showers on his broad back. "Where is thy master?" But this
                     question was in her heart only, when she raised her head and he stood before
                     her.</p>
                  <p>To describe the blushes that ensued, would require an imagination as vivid as
                     that of Ole Bull's friend, the painter, who heard scarlet in certain tones of
                     the violin. The tones of Philip Wentworth's voice produced a deep red color on
                     Mary Austin's cheeks, but we do not attempt to philosophize upon the fact. Our
                     readers must make what they can of it.</p>
                  <p>"How did you come here!" was Mary's first coherent question.</p>
                  <p>"I came, like little Red Riding Hood, to see my grandmother," said Philip
                     laughing; "but I find you have been beforehand with me, with your pot of
                     butter, or custard, or something which has stolen away her heart, while I was
                     away." And they went home together arm in arm, after a fashion which would have
                     made Mrs. Austin groan indeed, if she had been perched in one of the great
                     oaks, looking on.</p>
                  <p>That evening Mary never thought of writing to her mother, to tell of this
                     unforeseen accident; but with morning came cool reflection, and she sat down
                     and wrote a long, dutiful letter, mentioning, just before the close, that Mr.
                     Wentworth had arrived on a visit to his grandmother, Mrs. Ellery. This she knew
                     would bring her parents, post-haste; and when she had<pb n="264-265"
                        xml:id="VAC7024-00000136"/> thus discharged her conscience, she was not very
                     sorry when Mrs. Ellery informed her that as there was only a weekly mail, her
                     letter could not reach Detroit in several days.</p>
                  <p>We do not pretend to have been present at all the conversations which may have
                     passed between the two friends, thus reunited, when they thought themselves far
                     asunder. We dare say they had many adventures to relate, with descriptions of
                     people they had met in their travels and such like topics. We have reason to
                     believe they learned to understand each other very well; although we will
                     answer for it that Wentworth was too much of a man of honor to entrap the
                     guileless Mary into an engagement without the sanction of her parents. He had
                     been educated by old-fashioned people.</p>
                  <p>"There!" said Mrs. Austin to her husband, "you see, my dear, what your plan of
                     trusting Mary to her own guidance has come to, at last! I told you so! I knew
                     this would be the consequence! After all my care and anxiety, she is gone!" and
                     the good lady dropt some natural tears.</p>
                  <p>"Gone! what are you thinking of, my dear! instead of losing a daughter we have
                     gained a son, and a capital fellow he is, too; honorable, considerate, and as
                     fond of Mary as you can desire. All your care has met with its reward; and
                     Philip will bear witness to the fact a dozen years hence Education has done its
                     part admirably thus far, but now that nature has asserted her rights, it will
                     go on more profitably than ever. Mary will be quite a woman by the time she is
                     ready to be married!"</p>
                  <p>And this was all the comfort Mrs. Austin had from her husband, so unreasonable
                     is the stronger sex.</p>

               <p>AMONG the Fabliaux of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries is a laughable story of
                  the philosopher Aristotle, who is represented as saddled and bridled for the
                  amusement of a malicious beauty, and cantering about a garden under the weight of
                  her slender form, while Alexander, afterwards the Great, the pupil of Aristotle,
                  enjoys the joke from a window. It seems that the sage, having discovered the
                  devotion of his august disciple to the lady in question, had reproved him very
                  sharply for his weak subjection to the tender passion; representing love as
                  incompatible with the study of philosophy, and ridiculing the idea of a man of
                  sense placing himself in the power of a woman, naturally his inferior in the scale
                  of creation. The pupil was a good deal nettled by the severe remarks of his
                  master, but he concealed his vexation, and humbly promised that the
                     fascinations<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7024-00000137"/> tions of beauty should
                  no longer seduce his thoughts from the contemplation of wisdom.</p>
               <p>But he had devised a subtle, we had almost said a savage method of revenge upon
                  his master, and very soon found an opportunity of putting it in practice. In cold
                  blood and with malice aforethought, he managed to place the stern preacher of
                  prudence and self-command within point-blank range of the lady's eyes, and won her
                  over to use, in the service of his revenge, all the powers of fascination which
                  had proved effectual in enslaving himself. The philosopher was of course very soon
                  charmed into forgetfulness of his grand dogmas, for your philosopher is
                  proverbially weak at all weapons but his own. Beauty, wit, grace, were put in
                  requisition with the fullest success; coquetry added her freaks; and, in a word,
                  in a marvellously short time, the wise man became a fool, as so many wise men have
                  done before him under the same circumstances. And thus we arrive at the
                  explanation of the scene with a sketch of which we began. Among the incredible
                  follies which the malicious beauty devised for the humiliation of her awkward
                  captive, was a requisition on her part that he should suffer himself to be saddled
                  and bridled, and accept, for the reward of his obedience, the honor and delight of
                  carrying his goddess about her garden. He only stipulated for a scene closely
                  shielded from vulgar eyes, lest, by some accidental betrayal, his reputation as a
                  teacher of wisdom should suffer, and above all in the estimation of his royal
                  pupil. An inner court of the palace was therefore chosen, and among its flowery
                  alleys did the delighted sage prance with his fair burden. But, in the very midst
                  of his happiness a dread sound—a sound as of unhallowed laughter—struck his ear,
                  and looking upward, he beheld in a window the face of the future conqueror of the
                  world, relaxed to its last capability in keen relish of the joke.</p>
               <p>History wisely stops here, nor strives to express the inexpressible, in describing
                  the abasement of the great teacher and example of philosophy, thus forced to be
                  his own refuter. But we can easily conjecture that from this time forth the pupil
                  was not troubled with any very severe remarks on the absurdity of being in love;
                  unless, indeed, the teacher drew new unction for his homilies from the bitterness
                  of his own experience.</p>
               <p>We see, then, that philosophy began very early to be considered as the enemy or
                  antidote of love. What foundation in fact there may be for this notion, it is
                  difficult to say, so few successful experiments are on record. That it
                     <emph>ought</emph> to be so has always rather been taken for granted than
                  proved.</p>
               <p>Sir Isaac Newton, however, was a man of realities, and of him it may truly be said
                  that science was his mistress. She upheld his spirits, consoled his solitude,
                  brought him recreation, and absorbed his affections. He evidently thought with
                  Milton— <q>

               <p>Newton, however, was not always and at all periods wholly invulnerable to the
                  subtle shafts of the most insidious of enemies. We hold that a man must be
                  thoroughly dipped—bathed, indeed—in self-esteem, to render him proof against such
                  arrows; but the youthful susceptibility of the sage weigher of the planets proves
                  that his immersion had not been complete. History deigns, for once, probably in
                  consideration of the eminence of the subject, to record the fact of his having
                  been, at a certain time, deeply smitten with the daughter of the lady with whom he
                  lodged,—an illustration of the well-known principle, that attraction is so much
                  the more potent as the attracting bodies are nearer to each other. Whether he went
                  so far as to enroll her among the celestial phenomena we are not informed, but the
                  attraction seems to have been proved beyond a doubt, and we have reason to suppose
                  it was on the one side gravity, and on the other magnetism or electricity.</p>
               <p>One would think that love thus founded on the immutable principles of science must
                  have proved an exception to the vulgar rule, and gone on with the precision and
                  harmony of the spheral ellipses. But our philosopher had discovered that, besides
                  attraction, there is another irresistible force in nature—that of repulsion. Now
                  it was his habit to think out every thing; he said in his later days, that if in
                  any respect he had been more successful than other men, it was only by a habit of
                  thinking. Accordingly, we must suppose that he pondered much and long upon the
                  wonderfully curious attraction to which he found himself subject, and speculated
                  as to its probable results. He speculated on the tremulousness which he observed
                  in himself under certain circumstances, as Le Verrier pursued the chain of
                  reasoning which ended in the discovery of a new planet. But one of the conclusions
                  to which his researches in other directions had brought him, was, that however
                  close may seem the approach of any two bodies, there is always an actual space
                  between them, produced by this said power of repulsion. How then could he, a
                  philosopher, be satisfied with the idea of a union in which repulsion as well as
                  attraction was to play its part? Was it not natural to refer the many unhappy
                  marriages which had come under his notice to a want of recognition of this fact in
                  science? How should he ascertain whether, in this case, the repulsive power of the
                  young lady might not overcome her attraction?</p>
               <p>He had spent the morning in his study, laboring to fix his attention on the grand
                  problem of the universe, but surprised and vexed to find it wandering towards that
                  insignificant, comet-like nebula, a young woman,—which no telescope that has yet
                  been invented has succeeded in following rapidly enough to ascertain its laws of
                  revolution. Moore has aptly expressed the puzzle into which an astronomer
                     <emph>might</emph> be thrown: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">

                     </lg>
                  </q> But our sage was too wise to try a telescopic view. He adhered to his old
                  rule of <emph>thinking,</emph> but found hosts of difficulties arise in the course
                  of his investigation. He no doubt tried figures, but they probably ran into such
                  sums as these "Two lips, indifferent red; two gray eyes, with lids to them; one
                  neck; one chin; and so forth." Or perhaps he endeavored to set forth the substance
                  of his thoughts in diagrams<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7024-00000139"/> grams, but
                  found the angles anything but right ones, and the straight lines strangely
                  deviating into the line of beauty. In this perplexity, we may fancy him summoned
                  to the dinner-table, and seated opposite the gentle disturber of his peace, eating
                  a delicate pudding— <q>

                  maiden to a seat near the window, resolved that certainty of some sort shall end
                  this confusion of his geometrical pericranium. Once well placed, with green,
                  waving woods before him, and the soft summer wind playing balmily about his brow,
                  he falls again into his old trick of thinking, and forgets the firm practical
                  intent with which he challenged his lady-love to a private interview. She, poor
                  girl, had found but few defences against the amiable countenance and mild,
                  gentlemanly, serious manners of the young student, and her little heart went
                  pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat, while he gazed out of the casement, she all the while
                  thinking he was but finding fitting words wherein to declare his mind to her. He,
                  meanwhile, has lighted his pipe, and by its aid put on a more deeply reflective
                  air than before. But, alas! the clouds which undulate and ascend so beautifully
                  from the meerschaum, do but suggest to the cogitating astronomer fresh thoughts of
                  the peopled skies. He has forgotten earth, and all earth's daughters; his mind has
                  described a parabolic curve, and alighted on frigid Saturn, the aspiring smoke
                  serving as a Jacob's ladder between the terrestrial and and the superlunary. By
                  and by the fire burns low, the ladder grows feeble; the thoughts do not descend,
                  but they depute a ray of intelligence to renew the aerial rounds. Our philosopher,
                  conscious that something is wanting, puts forth his hand; it falls on the not
                  unready fingers of the patient damsel. She blushes, she trembles, she wonders
                  within herself whether propriety does not require that she should withdraw those
                  poor little digits. But ere she can settle this point satisfactorily to both love
                  and prudence, the youthful sage has decided it by grasping her hand firmly, and
                  raising it—can it be that, in sudden and momentary boldness, he is about to carry
                  it to his lips? That were, indeed, to cut the gordian knot that seemed
                  inextricable. But, no! he stops—he removes the pipe from his mouth, and lowers it
                  to meet the slender fore-finger of the maiden. A moment more—a shriek—and Newton
                  is a bachelor for life!</p>
               <p>And the maiden—did she exclaim, in the bitterness of her heart, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"O star-eyed Science, hast thou wandered there</l>

                  </q> Or did she quietly bless her own stars, that had, by timely warning, saved
                  her from a crazy spouse? As for the lover, being, as Sir David Brewster assures
                  us, "destitute of the faculty of imagination," he had probably understood
                  literally the poetical expression, "ivory fingers," and so concluded that a young
                  lady's pretty little index was the very thing for a tobacco stopper!</p>
               <p>History is defined to be "philosophy teaching by example," but this example of
                  ours must be classed amongst the warnings. Let us be just, however. Perhaps if
                  some Niebuhr should sift the records of an occurrence so long accepted by the
                  world as a<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7024-00000140"/> significant fact, we might
                  come to a different conclusion as to the real cause of the accident by means of
                  which this promised conjunction became a transit, and Newton was self-condemned to
                  an abstract contemplation of the literal, rather than an actual enjoyment of the
                  poetical heavens, while the bashful maiden was lost, like a meteor, in a cloud of
                  smoke. We should, ourselves be disposed to lay the blame on tobacco, and to look
                  upon this story of the philosophic outrage on the young lady's finger as a sly
                  invention of some wag, who, knowing that ridicule is more potent than argument,
                  chose this way of sending forth a "Counter-blast," less ponderous, but more
                  pungent, than the famous one of King James the First, of blessed memory. What,
                  indeed, could more surely enlist the gallantry of the world against tobacco, than
                  the thought that it could so obfuscate the wits of the wisest as to lead to a
                  cruel confounding of animate with inanimate matter under such delicate
                  circumstances! Would any man, "as is a man," as Mrs. Cluppins says, put himself
                  under the influence of a narcotic which may lead him to mistake a pretty girl for
                  a stick, and treat her accordingly?</p>
               <p>It is pleasant to find that Newton, though he thus went off in a tangent, under
                  the influence of a disturbing force, did not wholly renounce his allegiance to his
                  chosen centre of attraction. We are assured that he continued all his life to feel
                  the soft compulsion, and to follow with a quiet, but devoted attention, the
                  fortunes of her who had in youth been his acknowledged cynosure. A tender
                  friendship occupied the place from which Love had been scared; and our hero and
                  heroine, after this momentary' perturbation, became "binary stars," which Sir
                  William Herschel informs us, "perform revolutions around each other, each having
                  its own orbit." The lady's included a husband and children; but the philosopher
                  finished his cycle without ring or moon, a crystalline sphere in the grand
                  empyrean, or region of perpetual serenity.</p>

               <head>AN INCIDENT IN DREAM-LAND.</head>
               <p>IT happened once that Love—proverbially touchy, we all know—took high offence at
                  the neglect of his whilom sworn friend and brother Hymen, who, he declared, had
                  ceased to invite him to his magnificent parties in town. Finding his temper too
                  warm upon the occasion, he sought the cooling influence of rural shades, and there
                  amused himself and forgot his pettish enmity, in sending sportive arrows among
                  groups of simple nymphs and swains, as they raked the new-mown hay in company, or
                  pared the luscious peach or the firmer apple, to dry, in gay festoons, "for
                  winter, which they knew must come;" or husked the golden corn, or bound the
                  lachrymose onion wreath-wise upon its supporting wisp of straw. But. ere long,
                  wearying of such inglorious sport—not unlike that of the royal <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">ennuyé</foreign> who shot from his gilded balcony whole
                  hecatombs of game, so trapped that it could neither fight nor fly—he left the
                  rustic herd, and took his way along the banks of a bright and rapid stream, which
                  rolled its gleaming waves through foliage of every hue and outline, reflecting at
                  times the sun, the snowy cloud, the lamps of night, the leaden hue of storms, the
                  appalling aspect of the tempest—all distinct at intervals, yet at intervals again
                  fused, as it were, into one enchanting and harmonious whole. Love called the
                  stream Poetry, and declared that he would always dwell by its side.</p>
               <p>As he strayed along delighted, leaning occasionally over the living mirror, that
                  he might see how it enhanced the splendor of his beauty, he beheld, reclining in
                  the shadow of a rock, a heavenly form, whose wings, folded in repose, and a
                  celestial halo round his brow, declared him still unchanged by contact with the
                  things of earth. By the radiance which shone through his closed lids, and by the
                  lyre clasped, even in sleep, to his bosom, Love knew the bright visitant to be
                  Genius. He called him with his most persuasive voice—and Love's tones ore almost
                  irresistible—but in vain. The sleeper's head was pillowed on a bed of poppies, and
                  a drapery of deadly nightshade hung from the rock which shaded him from the sun.
                  "I <emph>must</emph> see those rainbow pinions unfolded to the light!" said Love;
                  "of all my claims to immortality, none could be so indisputable as the subjugation
                  of this glorious being to my power!"</p>
               <p>And, selecting one of his keenest arrows, and new-stringing his bow with a braided
                  tress of golden hair, he wounded the unguarded bosom of the slumberer.</p>
               <p>The youth started—opened his eyes, bright and dewy as the first glad smile of
                  morning, and spread wide his radiant wings as if to find safety in flight. But he
                  became conscious of the sweet venom which was spreading through his veins, and,
                  with a glance half-reproachful, half-adoring, he bowed the knee to Love and owned
                  his resistless power, and asked his supreme will.</p>
               <p>"Sing!" said the conqueror; and the blended music of voice and lyre filled the
                  whole air, and, borne along by the<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7024-00000142"/>
                  waves, awakened to thrilling life all the spiritual things that haunted the green
                  recesses of that charmed spot. Love crowned the captive with flowers, showered
                  delicious odors around his dazzling brow, brought honey in the comb white as the
                  foam on the billow, and presented to his eager lip a lily-cup of sparkling wine.
                  Wood-nymphs and naiads, hovering round, beheld their own beautiful forms reflected
                  in the crystalline wings of the stranger, but though various and changeful as the
                  light of parting day, <emph>one</emph> face, and one only, was there seen in every
                  dress, recognized through every disguise. The forms and masks were painted by
                  Fancy,—the one face was the work of Truth. "And now," said victorious Love, "take
                  me to thy own bright sphere!"</p>
               <p>Prompt to obey, the pleased subject tried his glittering wings for an upward
                  flight. Alas! overcome by the too sweet banquet, Genius sunk back upon the roses
                  which the victor had spread around him. The halo faded from his head; his lyre
                  reclined against a myrtle—mute, save when a breeze from the languid south awakened
                  a faint echo of its former power.</p>
               <p>"Sleep then—stupid thing!" said Love, enraged at the effect of his own spells—and
                  he was about to shake over the lids of the fainting captive the baleful dust of
                  Oblivion, when a fearful form appeared from a rugged wood at no great distance.
                  His hair hung in wild elf-locks about his wasted features, and his squalid
                  garments scarce concealed his meagre limbs. His eyes seemed of stone, and in his
                  hand was an iron sceptre, which has often caused even Love to tremble.</p>
               <p>"Ha! Poverty!" said the baffled tyrant, as he flew to the safe shelter of a
                  neighboring tulip tree, yielding the field for the moment to his old enemy, that
                  he might watch the effect of his presence upon the glorious being whom his own
                  arts had reduced to utter helplessness. The flowers drooped; the grass withered;
                  and the breezes which a moment before had breathed of summer, became chilly as if
                  wafted from a wandering ice-berg, With a sepulchral voice did the skeleton visitor
                  call on Genius to arise.</p>
               <p>"Come! let me see these gaudy wings of thine!" he said, with a sneer. But the
                  youth, shuddering, folded their filmy leaves over his eyes, to shut out the
                  hateful apparition. Poverty pushed him rudely with that cold iron sceptre, but the
                  torpedo touch seemed only still further to paralyze his faculties "Thou dost not
                  feel me yet!" exclaimed the fiend; and even as he spoke he took the form of a
                  hideous dragon, whose folds, surrounding the victim, began to narrow upon his
                  shrinking form, and, continually contracting the spiral circle, threatened to
                  crush him inevitably and irretrievably.</p>
               <p>Then rose the noble youth, roused by the too eager malice of his foe; and shaking
                  off alike the poppies of Indolence, and the roses in which Love had enveloped him,
                  he stretched his glittering pinions, spurned the earth with his foot, and soaring
                  majestically toward heaven, looked down with scorn upon scowling Poverty, while
                  the radiance about his brow resumed its power, and dazzled all but Love. That wily
                  god, pursuing the upward flight of Genius, strove again to entrap him by means of
                  certain nets of silk and gold, which he had found almost always successful with
                  the sons of earth, but the heaven-born youth shook them off with a smile of
                  contempt, while he sang to his enchanted lyre a hymn so glorious, that earth's
                  inmost heart thrilled to the melody, and Love, for once, owned himself in turn a
                  captive.</p>
               <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7024-00000143"/>
               <p>Love has been since that time rather shy of attempting to subdue Genius—which we
                  suppose is the reason why so many of our poets are bachelors. Poverty claims to
                  have been of essential service to the susceptible child of Heaven, but we never
                  heard that Genius loved him any the better for it. Hymen still plays his old
                  tricks—forgetting to invite Love to his more splendid feasts, but condescending to
                  admit him when his rich friend Mammon is not expected.</p>

               <head>THE VISION AND THE CREED OF PIERS PLOUGHMAN.</head>
               <p>WE are apt to declaim against the corruptions of the age in which we live, and to
                  imagine that no preceding one has equalled it in all the crimes which might be
                  expected to call down the vengeance of Heaven upon nations or upon individuals.
                  The follies and vices of our own time are magnified to us by the various passions,
                  prejudices and prepossessions which help to make up our estimate of passing
                  events, while we judge of those which transpired long since, with the coolness of
                  abstraction and the charity of indifference.</p>
               <p>But the observation of the witty and wicked Lady Mary, that in all her travels she
                  had met but two kinds of people—<emph>men</emph> and <emph>women</emph>—might
                  serve all travellers and all time. Not only in great affairs can we trace
                  continual recurrence of the same causes with the same consequences, but the very
                  tattle of a village or the jealousies of a household have had their prototype
                  thousands of years ago. Babies cry now-a-days in the very same tones which served
                  little Cain and Abel for the expression of their sorrows; and no less do the
                  grown-up Cains and Abels of our time make use of the very same modes of<pb
                     n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7024-00000144"/> showing their different characters,
                  that we find so strikingly described in the most ancient of all histories.</p>
               <p>The old-fashioned notion of the "dignity" of history has given rise to continual
                  efforts to hide this simplicity or sameness in the true records of human action.
                  It has been thought necessary to dress up and render conspicuous a certain class
                  of events, while another class, perhaps far more efficient in producing the real
                  features of the age, are unnoticed and forgotten. For these we must go to ancient
                  rhymes and homely chronicles—compositions called forth by the spirit of the times,
                  and not encumbered with any character or "dignity" to support; and in their quaint
                  and simple pages we shall find truths that writers of more pretension shun to
                  tell, or perhaps pass over as unworthy of notice.</p>
               <p>"The Vision and the Creed of Piers Ploughman," is one of the most striking of
                  these pictures of the times; and the scarce black-letter volume, to which formerly
                  none but antiquaries had access, is now "newly imprinted," with all its grotesque
                  and arabesque decorations, its vermilion letters, its frontispiece of most
                  original design and perspective—the ploughman holding the handles, and his
                  faithful spouse bearing the goad which is to urge to their duty a pair of the most
                  extraordinary oxen—and, floating over all, the motto—GOD SPEED YE PLOUGH AND SEND
                  US KORNE GNOLK,<ref rend="super" target="#note_003" xml:id="return_003">*</ref>
                   among William Pickering's resuscitations of the treasures of the olden
                  time. To those who love to have the stately and somewhat formal march of history
                  varied by an occasional quick-step, we recommend a perusal of this work, of which
                  we will here offer a short account.</p><note place="foot" xml:id="note_003">

                  </note>
               <p>This curious poem is supposed to be the work of a monk— some say a monk of
                  Malvern, Robert Longlande or Langlande by name, one of the many who quitted their
                  monasteries to advocate the cause of the Reformation. David Buchanan, indeed,
                  claims the honor for a canny Scot, but this is considered rather an instance of
                  patriotism than of critical acumen in the commentator. The year 1362 is assigned
                  as the date of the performance. At this time, England, in common with the rest of
                  Europe, had lately been the theatre of dreadful calamities. Twelve years before, a
                  pestilence had swept off one half the population; but this half being the poor and
                  ill fed, the higher classes, neglecting a warning which did not fall directly upon
                  themselves, became more cruel, oppressive, and licentious than before. But another
                  pestilence, as if commissioned to arouse them from a guilty insensibility, soon
                  after desolated their ranks, spreading mourning and terror throughout the haunts
                  of splendid vice, and leaving the homes of the poor comparatively untouched.
                  Contemporaneously with this plague came a tempest, whose sweeping ruin filled all
                  hearts alike with trembling and dismay.</p>
               <p>At this awful juncture, when the public conscience was, as it were, laid bare by
                  the severity of Heaven, the satirist chose his time. Some Latin poems attributed
                  to Walter Mapes, and a collection of political songs, containing, in small
                  compass, all the chief points of accusation against the different orders of
                  society, preceded the Vision of Piers Ploughman. Those who consider songs and
                  poems as too trivial to be mentioned among the great events of such a period, must
                  remember that one who had enjoyed unusual opportunities for studying the moving
                  causes of human events, said that if he could have the making of the
                     <emph>ballads</emph> of a nation, he would care little who made its laws.</p>
               <pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7024-00000145"/>
               <p>And even in our own unpoetic time we have ample evidence that the fictions of
                  Dickens, the "Rhymes," of Elliott and the songs of Thomas Hood, have told, with
                  marked and most important emphasis, upon the feelings and sentiments of whole
                  nations. Still more potent must such things have been when literature was anything
                  but a drug and a bye-word; and we think those err little who look upon the satires
                  of the fourteenth century as momentous features in the aspect of the time.</p>
               <p>The "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Roman de la Rose</foreign>" had brought into vogue a
                  new species of composition, and it seems to have afforded a model for the style of
                  our author, conveying instruction under the veil of allegory. This circumstance,
                  may, perhaps, be thought to detract somewhat from its merit in a critical point of
                  view; but practically it is really rather an advantage than a blemish; since the
                  natural tediousness of allegorical writing is much relieved by an occasional
                  forgetfulness on the part of the author, which seems to excuse the reader from the
                  close attention required by a long two-threaded story.</p>
               <p>The Vision comes to one who, weary of the world, falls asleep beside a stream,
                  amid the soft and beautiful scenery of the Malvern Hills. He sees a vast multitude
                  assembled in a fair meadow, typifying the whole world of mankind; attracted on one
                  side by the Tower of Truth, the right aim of man's pilgrimage, and on the other by
                  the "Dungeon of Care," the dwelling-place of wrong—more attractive in real life
                  than in this poetical picture: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>A dongeon thereinne</l>
                        <l>With depa diches and derke</l>
                        <l>And dredfulle of sight.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>We cannot follow out the impracticable intricacies of the story; "the fair ladye
                  of leere," the personification of holy church, who offers to instruct the dreamer;
                  the lady Mede, (earthly reward,) who attracts those whose mind is not firmly fixed
                  upon better things to come; Cyvile, or Law, potent yet slighted; Conscience, who
                  is proposed as a husband for lady Mede, but declines the union; Repentance and
                  Hope, who persuade the multitude to set out on a pilgrimage in search of Truth;
                  Kynde, or Nature; Do-well, Do-better, and Do-best, very important personages,
                  figure with a multitude of others whose characters and offices are too complicated
                  for analysis within reasonable bounds. The conclusion of this thronging march is
                  rather unsatisfactory, being one of those "wherein nothing is concluded," but the
                  writer seems to have designed to paint human life as it is; in which case to have
                  depicted a general amelioration of mankind as the result of any efforts or
                  circumstances, would have been as incorrect as the invariable practice of the
                  novelists of our time, who reward virtue with worldly prosperity, in the very face
                  of the daily dispensations of Providence.</p>
               <p>The language of the Vision is such as few can read without a glossary, but this
                  requisite is found at the conclusion of the volumes. Here is a specimen of the
                  very simplest: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"No, quod Pacience paciently,</l>
                        <l>And out of his poke hento</l>
                        <l>Vitallies of grete virtues</l>
                        <l>For alle manere beestes,</l>
                        <l>And seide, "Lo here, liflode y-noghe!</l>
                        <l>If our bileve be trewe.</l>
                        <l>For lent nevere was lif,</l>
                        <l>But liflode were shapen,</l>
                        <pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7024-00000146"/>
                        <l>Wher-of or wher-for</l>
                        <l>Or wher-by to libbe."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The last quatrain is for encouragement—assuring the hungry that wherever there is
                  life, there also "liflode" or livelihood is provided. Unfortunately, the hungry
                  man may reply, as we are told one did since Piers Ploughman's day:</p>
               <p>"Yes, your reverence; but Providence sent the baby to <emph>my</emph> house, and
                  the victuals to <emph>yours!</emph>"</p>
               <p>The work abounds with a sort of quaint wisdom, homely, but genial; expressed in a
                  style half axiomatic, half mystical. The whole tenor is as purely democratical as
                  if it had seen the light only since the French Revolution. Indeed Piers has been
                  called the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sans-culotte</foreign> of the fourteenth
                  century.</p>
               <p>The poem is considered a perfect specimen of the English tongue before grammar was
                  a science, and the study of it is recommended as tending to elucidate many of the
                  real difficulties of the language. It is a fine example of that style of
                  versification which was the only one in use among the Anglo-Saxons in the early
                  times of their literature. Rhyming verse had not yet been introduced into England.
                  The characteristic of the only versification attempted at the period, was a kind
                  of alliteration, so arranged that in every couplet there should be two principal
                  words in the first line beginning with the same letter, which letter must also be
                  the initial of the first word on which the stress of the voice falls in the second
                  line. This kind of poetry is mingled, after the thirteenth century, with rhyme;
                  but in an irregular manner; and purely alliterative poetry was still in use among
                  the lower orders when Piers Ploughman was written. The adoption of it in satire
                  seems to have a political meaning, as referring the grave matters in question
                  directly to the judgment of the common people. The simple, uncorrupted heart of
                  the Ploughman is represented as the dwelling-place of virtue and truth; while the
                  great, with their insolent retainers, appear as practicing every species of
                  injustice and oppression, the merchants every extreme of dishonesty, and even the
                  clergy the ruinous vices of extortion, intemperance and license, not to speak of a
                  total disregard of the duties of the sacred office. And it was appropriate to
                  clothe this unsparing view of the state of the country in the poetry which was
                  alone familiar to that class of readers, who were held up in it as the
                  representatives and guardians of all that was left of virtue and religion, In this
                  point of view the poem possesses much interest as a document of literary history,
                  connected directly with the time at which it appeared.</p>
               <p>An attempt to modernize or rather to translate Piers Ploughman, was made, early in
                  the present century. Here is a specimen, followed by the original: <q>

               <p>This prophecy is certainly remarkable, yet we can scarcely consider it miraculous,
                  since the excesses into which the religious houses had fallen were such as to
                  render it very likely that some monarch, either virtuous or passionate, would make
                  sweeping work with them at no very distant date. If the sufferings of the lower
                  orders, the vices of the great, and the excesses of the clergy were what the
                  Vision describes them to have been, we may marvel that the Ploughman did not
                  foretell a shower of fire which should purify the entire realm as well as the
                  monasteries, since professed moralists are generally not backward in prophecying,
                  and even invoking, the vengeance of Heaven upon other people's sins.</p>
               <p>As to the prophetic part, Philippe de Comines, as far back as Edward IVth's time,
                  says the English were never without some prophecy or other to account for whatever
                  events might occur. These predictions, from the oracular form in which they were
                  delivered, had at least half the chances in their favor—as witness that which
                  threatened evil to Edward IVth—saying<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7024-00000148"/>
                  that one whose name began with G, should succeed him; a prophecy which cost the
                  life of George, Duke of Clarence, but which was considered equally well fulfilled
                  by the usurpation of Gloster.</p>

               <head>A LEGEND OF EAST ROCK.</head>
               <p>IT is many years since an individual of singular appearance took up his abode in
                  the vicinity of a populous town—an unusual choice of place for one whom misfortune
                  or misanthropy seemed to have rendered averse to human society, but not an
                  injudicious one in this case, since the spot afforded the solitude of the desert
                  without its remoteness from succor.</p>
               <p>His humble dwelling, constructed with little skill or care, and scarcely
                  discernible in the tangled thicket, was situated upon a rough hill that rose with
                  picturesque abruptness from the level plain; toward the town rocky and
                  precipitous, but descending on the opposite side with a softer outline. The gray
                  rock was in some places naked to the sun; in others, covered with soil for the
                  most part closely wooded. One spot, in the very midst of the deep shade, was
                  susceptible of cultivation. It was but a strip, but it repaid the rude culture of
                  the recluse with food sufficient for him, and served also to pasture two or three
                  sheep—not doomed to bleed for their master's gratification, but to be harnessed
                  with strips of bark to a little cart, which served him many useful purposes during
                  the Summer, and when Autumn blasts began to lay bare the branches, bore his few
                  movables toward the pleasant south. No one knew where he made his winter abode;
                  but the flitting was regular as that of the<pb n="290-291"
                     xml:id="VAC7024-00000149"/> birds, and when they and the flowers returned, back
                  came our hermit to his hovel on the rock.</p>
               <p>When we first heard of his existence, he was seldom disturbed or intruded upon.
                  Curiosity had subsided, and the determined silence of the recluse was not
                  calculated to induce a chance visitor to repeat his visit. Strangers were
                  sometimes taken to the hermitage, but to those who had associated the flowing
                  beard, staff, cross and rosary with the idea of a hermit, our recluse seemed but a
                  poor representation of the class. He was a coarse, rough-looking person, clothed
                  in a sort of Robinson Crusoe style; and his whole air was one which the most
                  romantic imagination. would have found it difficult to invest with the character
                  of saintly repose which always, marks the hermit of story. A student would
                  sometimes terminate his ramble by a short rest in the bough-roofed hovel, or a
                  schoolboy spend his Saturday afternoon in its neighborhood, for the sake of
                  sharing the contents of his basket with the lonely tenant; and in such cases the
                  reception offered by the recluse was quiet but kind, and the offered dainties
                  usually repaid by the gift of some of nature's treasures, which an out-door life
                  enabled him to procure. He would heat his rude oven, and bake apples and potatoes
                  for his guests, while they gathered berries or rambled through the craggy
                  solitudes. But he scarcely ever spoke, and most of his days were passed in
                  absolute solitude.</p>
               <p>The accounts I had heard aroused no little interest or curiosity respecting this
                  strange being, when I was one day informed that the hermit was in the kitchen, and
                  had asked leave to take—not exactly "the husks that the swine did eat"—but a piece
                  of white bread which had been consigned to that base use by an unthrifty maid, and
                  which had caught his eye as he passed her territory, driven from his wretched home
                  by the pangs of hunger. I had heard that he sometimes asked alms in the kitchens
                  of his young visitors, when from want of foresight he found himself without
                  provisions; I was, therefore, not surprised when I heard of his coming. Quite
                  curious, however, I followed my informant immediately, and found a tall, meagre
                  figure, clad in a sort of wrapper of the coarsest kind of blanketing, confined at
                  the waist with a piece of rope. His hair was "sable-silvered," and seemed utterly
                  unconscious of comb or scissors; and his beard not "descending" but full and
                  by-by, concealed completely the mouth and chin, to which I usually look for the
                  expression of character. So much of his face as could be seen showed little trace
                  of refined sensibility. H's eye was cold and stern, and one found it difficult to
                  believe it had ever been otherwise; yet I fancied—who could forbear fancying
                  something, of an individual so singular in his appearance and habits!—that the
                  deep furrows of his brow were not the gradual work of time, but the more severe
                  scoopings of remorse or regret, and that they spoke of pangs such as only the
                  strong mind can suffer.</p>
               <p>My gaze offended or disconcerted him, for he stepped without the door, so as to
                  screen himself from further scrutiny. I hastened to repair the involuntary fault
                  by addressing him courteously, and inviting him to come in. He neither spoke nor
                  raised his eyes from the ground; so, directing apart that food should be set
                  before him, I left him to dispose of it at his pleasure, for it was evident that
                  he was painfully shy, and that my presence was both unexpected and unwelcome.</p>
               <p>I heard of him occasionally through the Summer, but nothing of novelty or interest
                  until he hoarse voice of Autumn<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7024-00000150"/> was
                  heard on the hill, and the strides of approaching Winter rustled among the dry
                  leaves of the forest, when it was ascertained that the recluse still occupied his
                  airy summer bower, being too unwell to commence his usual migration. Preparing a
                  few of the little comforts of the sick room, I accompanied his young friends to
                  the rock, in hopes of discovering the nature of his illness and being able to
                  contribute to its cure.</p>
               <p>Forlorn mid desolate indeed was the situation of the poor solitary. He had been
                  unable to gather in the produce of his little plantation, and the corn was yet on
                  the stalk, and the potatoes in the ground. The trees, stripped of their covering,
                  no longer afforded shelter to the miserable hovel, and the hermit lay exposed to
                  the chilling wind, warmed only by the poor sheep which huddled round him, having
                  followed him to his retreat for protection from the blast, or for the food which
                  the bare and frozen banks now denied them.</p>
               <p>He received thankfully the provisions we offered, but resisted every proposal for
                  removing him to a more comfortable asylum, or even for improving the miserable
                  pallet on which he lay. He showed no symptoms of any particular disease, but a
                  general decline of the powers of life. His appearance was much altered, and his
                  face of a transparent paleness; but this might well have been occasioned by the
                  want of such food as his feeble appetite required. He felt quite sure he should be
                  better now, and said he had lain in bed only to keep himself warm. Finding him
                  resolute in rejecting further aid, the young people gathered a supply of fuel, and
                  filled his kettle and hung it over a good fire, and arranged the few comforts we
                  had brought on a rude shelf by the bedside, and we left him to himself, feeling
                  that however grateful he might be for intended kindness, human society was
                  evidently distasteful to him.</p>
               <p>It was evident to us all that he was much softened since his illness. He no longer
                  maintained an obstinate silence, nor when he spoke was it with that deep hoarse
                  voice which had been remarkable before. There was more of refinement in his
                  language, and of intelligence in his eye; and I could not help thinking that the
                  roughness I had noticed had been artificial—assumed only to suit the character he
                  had adopted. Our young people now visited him more frequently, and others, hearing
                  of his indisposition, offered more comforts than he would consent to receive; but
                  he declined gradually, so gradually, indeed, that those who saw him often were
                  scarce aware of the change, until one morning he was found dead in his bed.<ref
                     rend="super" target="#note_009" xml:id="return_009">*</ref>
                   No clue to his name or kindred was found among his poor effects; but he
                  had consigned to one favored individual a memoir of his life, or at least of that
                  portion of it which had been passed among men. Other papers there were—the
                  outpourings of a vehement spirit—of a rebellious and untamed heart, which had
                  dared to sit in judgment on the decrees of the Most High, and to draw from the
                  various calamities of life bold and blasphemous conclusions against the justice
                  and goodness of Providence. These were of course committed to the flames; but the
                  short record of his own disastrous career, written apparently in a different
                  spirit, and after he had ceased to "contend against God," is here given, not
                  without a hope that useful lessons may be derived from the errors of a proud and
                  self-deifying heart.</p>

               <head>THE HERMIT'S STORY.</head>
               <p>My father was a substantial farmer. By unremitting industry in early life he had
                  amassed a few hundreds, and these had become thousands by prudent management and
                  rigid economy; so that from my earliest recollection he was at ease as to worldly
                  possessions. His own career having been thus prosperous, he naturally desired that
                  his only son should follow in his footsteps, and with his noble farm inherit his
                  fondness for agricultural pursuits. Though deficient in education himself, he
                  allowed me its advantages, and I was many years at school, with only the
                  occasional interruption of a summons home when haying or harvesting required the
                  entire force of the household. At such times my father spoke often to me of his
                  wish that I should be prepared to relieve him from the cares which his years began
                  to render irksome; of my own good fortune in being the inheritor of such a farm,
                  and of his in having a son capable of carrying out his plans of further
                  improvement—but I was fated to disappoint him. Fated, did I say! Let me rather own
                  that at school I imbibed a love of letters, but not a sense of duty; a high
                  opinion of my own powers, and a secret conviction that those powers would be
                  wasted in the inglorious occupation of tilling the ground. My thirst for knowledge
                  referred only to mental gratification; and I pursued my studies with an ardor of
                  which those who have always had ready access to the treasures of literature can
                  have but little conception. At home I scarce saw a book, beyond the Bible and a
                  few elementary works; and when at college my eyes first opened upon the stores of
                  ages, I became absolutely intoxicated with delight, and rioted indiscriminately in
                  whatever seemed for the moment most desirable to my excited fancy. The result of
                  this kind of reading was anything but advantageous. Mental dissipation is scarcely
                  less injurious to the moral sense than is its ruinous brother, vice. The generous
                  and self-denying virtues are almost as incompatible with the one as with the
                  other. Under the influence of my new-found pleasure, it cost me not a pang to
                  disappoint the long-cherished hopes of my father, and it was with a secret swell
                  of conscious superiority that I announced to him my resolution never to be a
                  farmer.</p>
               <p>His anger and his astonishment knew no bounds. He bitterly lamented his folly in
                  having sent me to college, "although," as he observed, "there was nothing in the
                  nature of learning to make a fool of a boy." This was very true, yet the small and
                  ill-chosen and worse digested amount of it which I had imbibed, had only filled my
                  head with vanity, and my heart with undutiful thoughts. The entreaties of my
                  mother and sister delayed the catastrophe for awhile. My father consented to try
                  me at business, and I condescended to be tried; but nothing but disaster ensued.
                  When not willfully careless, I was ruinously absent-minded, and it was not until I
                  had killed half the cows, by letting them spend the night in a field of clover,
                  and spiked the best horse on the tongue of a stage-coach, while I lay reading
                  Thomson's Summer on the top of a load of hay, that my poor father gave it up in
                  despair. He gave me a small amount of money, a horse, and a supply of clothing,
                  and then, with anger in his eye and grief and mortification in his heart, sent me
                  to seek my fortune where I could find a situation more congenial to my taste.</p>
               <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7024-00000152"/>
               <p>In spite of my headstrong folly, I could not but feel a little misgiving as I
                  turned my back on my home and on the kindest of mothers, and prepared to try the
                  wide world for a subsistence. The "still small voice" that upbraided me with the
                  sorrow of my parents, I strove to silence by a determination to return to them,
                  when I should have earned a name and a fame that should cover the waywardness of
                  my youth, and crown their latter days with pride and joy. As a stepping-stone to
                  fortune, however, it was necessary that I should immediately determine upon some
                  mode of earning a regular subsistence, and my passion for books, not to say my
                  incapacity for anything else, pointed at once to the situation of a teacher, I had
                  no dread of this occupation. I ascribed the various satirical descriptions of its
                  horrors to the incapacity of those who had attempted it. To a teacher qualified as
                  I felt myself to be, I was confident the whole favored district would throng; and
                  I anticipated with delight the astonishment of the natives, when they should
                  discover the attainments of their schoolmaster.</p>
               <p>The first difficulty that occurred when I sought this delightful employment was
                  the lack of proper testimonials. It had not entered my mind that a person of my
                  appearance and acquirements would need credentials among ignorant rustics; but, I
                  found, with no little disgust, that I was required to go through with the whole
                  formula of recommendations and certificates, and prove my title to the honor of
                  teaching a district school by as many papers as would have served to accredit a
                  minister plenipotentiary. A long interval occurred before certificates could
                  arrive from my Alma Mater, and by the time I had been examined and entered upon my
                  new duties, an acquaintance with my patrons and their children had served to damp
                  my ardor considerably. I dropped, by degrees, the hopes of making orators and
                  statesmen out of the materials committed to my care; and contented myself with the
                  more modest hope of eradicating some of the bad habits and ignorant conceits of my
                  pupils—a sad and discouraging task. To write upon blank paper is easy, but when
                  the surface has already been scribbled over, who can expect to produce fair and
                  graceful lines?</p>
               <p>Most of my scholars were the sons of farmers, who had no idea that the whole of a
                  child's time ought to be given to the school. Many omissions occurred, and those
                  who did attend regularly came to the writing-desk or the reading class with hands
                  hardened by labor, or heads preoccupied by more congenial ideas. These
                  difficulties, however, lessened in no degree the expectations of the parents.</p>
               <p>"I expect," said one sturdy father to me, "that now we've got sich a high-larnt
                  master, my boy'll write like copperplate afore the quarter's out; and another,
                  whose son spent a full month in committing the multiplication table, told me, he
                  hardly knew how to spare him for three months, but he wanted he should "larn
                  surveying."</p>
               <p>The proportion of reasonable parents and capable children was lamentably small;
                  but all this I could have borne if I had found what I expected—abundant leisure
                  for reading. But alas! the mornings and evenings, which were to have consoled me
                  for the most laborious drudgery, were not at my command. That odious "boarding
                  round"—a custom which ought to be abolished by statute—gave me every week a new
                  home, if such sojourn may bear the sacred name of home; and every home seemed more
                  uncomfortable than the last. One single fire for the household, during all the
                  morning business, made<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7024-00000153"/> reading
                  impossible in winter weather; and in the evenings, when, children and business
                  being out of the way, I might have had a chance by the fireside, I found myself so
                  fagged by the labors of the day, that even books had no charm which could sustain
                  my drooping eyelids. The comfortable and well ordered home I had left often rose
                  sweet and tempting upon my weary soul; but pride forbade me to confess my error
                  and seek again its sheltering roof. I knew my father would be ready to receive me
                  at a word; but that word I determined never to speak.</p>
               <p>To a temperament such as mine, the trials at which I have but hinted were
                  unreasonably severe. Better regulated minds would have found them much more
                  tolerable; to me they were irons entering the soul, and I felt often tempted to
                  fly from them, as I had done from other and far less evils that had, thwarted my
                  bent at home. I did, however, exercise sufficient self-command to fulfil my
                  agreement; but no entreaties could induce me to engage with the same set for
                  another season: and with the pittance which my winter of torment had earned, I set
                  forward again, hoping to find some nook of earth where the abilities which I still
                  valued, though, at a more reasonable rate, might procure me a livelihood while I
                  was deciding on a permanent plan of life.</p>
               <p>I came just at evening upon a lovely spot—a village lying on a small but rapid
                  stream which flowed through a highly cultivated valley. There was a mill with its
                  busy, pleasant hum; a smith's shop round which the usual number of idlers were
                  collectcd; a neat tavern where there were no idlers at all; one pretty street
                  through which, at this sunset hour, many fair forms were flitting; and, on the
                  brow of a hill which overlooked the whole, a church on whose taper spire the last
                  rays of the sun seemed to linger with affectionate delay. I gazed with delight,
                  and, still as sanguine as ever, decided that this favored spot should be my home
                  for the present. A school <emph>here,</emph> I thought, could not be like other
                  schools—and, as far as my own experience went, I was for once right.</p>
               <p>There was no lack of testimonials this time, and I soon found myself established
                  in a select school, which promised better support and more leisure than I had
                  enjoyed in my former situation. I entered upon my new duties with interest, but
                  had already begun to discover that all schools in the country are alike in some
                  particulars, when an incident occurred which changed at once the bent of my
                  repining thoughts, and the whole color of my life.</p>
               <p>Margaret——, a beautiful girl whose health had from childhood been so delicate as
                  to prevent her from attending school regularly, was now, in her seventeenth year,
                  placed under my charge. Her father, the rich man of the neighborhood, was anxious
                  that Margaret should employ an interval of improved strength in repairing, as far
                  as possible, the deficiencies of her early training, and he requested extra
                  attention on my part, in the shape of private lessons, which brought me every
                  evening to his house.</p>
               <p>My imagination had often dwelt on the lovely beings who rise under the creative
                  wand of the poet, and I had sighed to think that only in books may we hope to meet
                  these shapes of beauty, lit from within by souls yet more divine; but in
                  Margaret——d'd my charmed eyes discover more than poet ever painted. The softest
                  beauty—a clear and most ingenuous mind—and a gentleness which can never be
                  feigned—all the qualities which I should have chosen if I had been<pb n="300-301"
                     xml:id="VAC7024-00000154"/> endowed, Pygmalion-like, with the power of giving
                  life to the dreams of fancy, were united in this fair creature. There lacked only
                  that knowledge which it was to be my blissful task, to impart, and which her young
                  enthusiasm drank in as does the thirsty earth the long delayed shower. How I
                  rejoiced that her mind had been no further cultivated! I would not that any other
                  breath should aid the expansion of this tender flower. And none other did: it was
                  mine to watch its unfolding, and imbibe its fragrance; mine to wear it in my heart
                  of hearts. Lessons which books do not furnish passed between the master and the
                  pupil. Margaret accepted my offered heart, and as frankly gave her own in
                  exchange; and in less than two years from the time when I first saw her she became
                  the dearer part of myself.</p>
               <p>Is not this a trick of the imagination? Have <emph>I</emph>—the outcast of
                  society—the disowned of Heaven—the companion only of the beasts that perish—have
                     <emph>I</emph> ever been the beloved of Margaret—the pride of our parents—the
                  approved and applauded of all within our little circle? Is this cold and almost
                  pulseless heart the same which once swelled with triumph as I gazed on my wife's
                  sweet face, and fed my pride with the thought that if I had tamely yielded to the
                  inglorious lot marked out by my father, I should never have found this—the world's
                  best treasure? Alas! what darkness would have veiled that joyous scene if Fate had
                  foreshown, in the place of the happy bridegroom, the squalid wretch whose
                  appearance now scarcely claims kindred with his species!</p>
               <p>My father, pleased with a wealthy and influential connection, made generous
                  provision for my outset in life. My sister had married, and her husband proved a
                  valuable substitute for an undutiful son. Th's fortunate circumstance conveniently
                  served to quiet those troublesome whispers with which conscience would
                  occasionally beset me. Yet the sadness which had become habitual to my mother's
                  face, conveyed a reproach to my better sense which selfish pride could never
                  wholly disregard. Every look of hers told me that no son-in-law could ever supply
                  my place to her; and that the disappointment occasioned by my cold-hearted desert
                  on had thrown a chilling shade on the evening of her days. But one glance at my
                  idol always sufficed to put to flight every repentant thought.</p>
               <p>Yet the part of my life which I look back upon with the least remorse is the
                  period that immediately followed my marriage. During those four happy years,
                  inspired by the various excellencies in my wife's character, I labored assiduously
                  to correct my faults. I forgot my self-importance as far as possible, and
                  endeavored to promote the happiness of all around me, even at the sacrifice of
                  some of my own cherished inclinations. Imperfect as were my efforts, they were
                  sincere, and with my Margaret, at least, eminently successful. Never was the pure
                  light of our domestic happiness dimmed for a moment, even by the overflowings of
                  that wayward self-will which had so often brought tears to the eyes of my poor
                  mother. How indeed could I have lived to tell this sad story, if to all the rest
                  were added the recollection that I had ever inflicted one pang on that loving
                  heart?</p>
               <p>It was my intention, when I began this record, to have passed over the incidents
                  of my early life, and to have recalled little more than the horrible catastrophe
                  which has darkened the sun and extinguished the stars to my blighted soul for so
                  many years. But with the attempt to say anything of myself, human feelings and the
                  natural longing for human sympathy<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7024-00000155"/>
                  revived at once within me. Recollections of the entire past flooded my soul, and
                  would have vent. Far different have long been my contemplations, and who does not
                  know that rebellious thoughts bring their own just misery with them? The very
                  consolation which I experience in the recital of my sorrows, reproaches me with
                  the insane folly of having withdrawn myself from my kind until I am no longer fit
                  for their communion. But I must not lose time which I feel will be but short.</p>
               <p>My father-in-law had large contracts connected with internal improvements, and,
                  besides keeping his accounts, I frequently superintended the labors of his workmen
                  in the quarry and in the forest. The latter was to me an ever new delight. To
                  explore its tangled thickets, to roam through long branch-roofed vistas until the
                  resounding strokes of the woodman were lost in the distance; and then, amid the
                  hush of noonday twilight, to give myself up to romantic musings or to solemn
                  contemplation, was among the very few enjoyments that could reconcile me to
                  leaving my happy home, even for a day.</p>
               <p>On one of these occasions, when I had strayed until hunger overtook me, and I had
                  begun to think the way home would seem too long, I came unexpectedly upon an
                  Indian wigwam. Its inmates, a young man and his mother, received me with grave
                  courtesy; and, at my request for food, the white-haired squaw set before me
                  corn-bread and succatash, with a calabash of water, which was nectar to my eager
                  thirst. The young man, a tall and well-looking specimen of his race, was one whom
                  we had employed in searching for timber suited to our purposes, and I took this
                  opportunity to engage him to explore a new and wild track for some trees of great
                  size which were necessary at that time. His manner had that cold and stern
                  indifference which veils the fiery soul of his race; but he promised compliance
                  and I left him, having in vain tried to press upon himself and his mother some
                  compensation for my refreshment.</p>
               <p>In consequence of my commission, Indian John, as this young man was called in the
                  neighborhood, came several times to my house, and upon one occasion crossed my
                  wife's path as she was going out. It was then that I learned that Margaret had a
                  deep and unconquerable dread of an Indian. Her family accounted for it by the
                  circumstance of her having been frightened by one when a child. The occurrence, as
                  repeated to me, did not seem likely to have made so lasting an impression on the
                  mind of a girl brought up on the outskirts of civilization; but it proved to be
                  indelibly imprinted on her imagination, and was suppos d to have been the first
                  cause of her delicate health. A country girl entrusted with the care of her when
                  four or five years old, took her one day into the woods near her father's, in
                  search of wild flowers; and, leaving her under a tree to amuse herself with those
                  already gathered, penetrated further, hoping to find some still brighter and more
                  beautiful. In her absence a drunken Indian found the child, and for mere mischief,
                  as is supposed, gave one of those shrill yells, said to be among the most
                  appalling of all earthly sounds. The girl, brought back by the whoop, found
                  Margaret in strong convulsions; and for some weeks she hovered between life and
                  death, and afterward suffered many years from the enfeebled condition of her
                  nerves. Ever since that time she had dreaded the sight of one of the dark race,
                  and I now understood why she had always declined my invitations to go with me to
                  the forest. She refrained from mentioning her secret fears, for she shrunk from
                  avowing what she considered a silly weakness. With her a weakness was not<pb
                     n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7024-00000156"/> a thing to be boasted of, but to be
                  struggled against and overcome.</p>
               <p>But now that I had discovered this tender point, I made it my study to guard my
                  beloved from every chance that could excite such painful feelings. I took measures
                  to put an end to Indian John's visits—declining his services, and forbidding my
                  men to employ him. Still he had requests to prefer, occasionally; and finding he
                  continued to show himself at my door, I represented to him my wife's fears, and
                  foolishly bribed him to absent himself. After this I found he would take advantage
                  of my absence to apply for food and money, as if determined to enjoy the pleasure
                  of tormenting one who dared to cast dishonor on his haughty race. At length,
                  distracted by his pertinacity, I threatened and then struck him. He neither
                  returned the blow nor offered resistance, when I put him forth forcibly,
                  forbidding him ever to approach my doors again.</p>
               <p>But Margaret never was at rest after that unhappy day. An Indian, she said, never
                  forgave; and she was convinced, by the diabolical glance which John cast upon me
                  as I spurned him from my door, that he would only wait some safe opportunity to
                  take his revenge. She thought not of herself—her fears were for me alone; and I
                  readily promised not to wander forth alone, as had been my wont, but for her sake
                  to be ever wary of my exasperated enemy. Yet I often reminded her of the subdued
                  condition of the Indian race. "The white man," I said, "has a bridle on the neck
                  and a bit in the mouth of the savage; he has broken his spirit and bent him to his
                  will. The red man is no longer the untamed and untamable. The deadly hatred,
                  unappeasable but by the blood of the offender, is no longer part of his nature.
                  His vices as well as his virtues have lost their savage strength. The whiskey of
                  the white man has obliterated all that is fearful, as well as all that is grand,
                  in his character. There is nothing to be feared from so contemptible a being as
                  the wretched Indian."</p>
               <p>She heard me shudderingly; for an antipathy so deeply rooted is not to be
                  influenced by reasoning. I found her often depressed, and the paleness which had
                  marked her when I first saw her, began again to encroach upon the roses which
                  health and happiness had brought to her cheek. Hoping, by a temporary absence from
                  the scene of such unpleasant impressions, to dissipate their effect, I proposed to
                  her a visit of a few weeks to my parents, who were always delighted to have her
                  with them, and to whom she was warmly attached. She assented gladly, and we
                  prepared for the journey.</p>
               <p>Visions of my home! how is it that, after all this dreary interval, ye rise on my
                  soul with the freshness of yesterday! That pretty cottage—that trellised porch,
                  with its pendant wreaths and its overhanging roof—the trees which my own hand
                  planted, and which grew to any wish, as if proud to shade the dwelling of
                  Margaret! How often, since that dreadful day, have I stood again amid those fairy
                  scenes, holding that dear hand in mine, and listening, as of yore, to that softest
                  voice; then started from my broken slumber to solitude and wretchedness! Oh! the
                  bitterness of the contrast! Yet were not those gleams of bliss an earnest of what
                  may yet be in store for the reclaimed wanderer?</p>
               <p>Being obliged to be absent for a few hours in preparing for leaving home, I took
                  my wife to her father's, not liking to leave her exposed to any agitating accident
                  in her present feeble state. I told her I would return to tea, and bade her be
                  ready to set<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7024-00000157"/> out for my father's on the
                  morrow. "Ready, aye, ready!" was her smiling reply, as I mounted and rode off,
                  full of spirits and fearless of all ill. When I reached the spot where the road
                  wound round a hill not far distant, I turned to exchange a parting sign, knowing
                  that Margaret would watch me till I disappeared. She never looked lovelier. She
                  stood on the steps of the portico, one arm thrown round a slender pillar, and the
                  rich drapery of honeysuckle mingling with the bright tresses which descended in
                  curls to her bosom. As I gazed, she kissed a, white rose which she tossed toward
                  me, and then waved her hand as if to bid me begone. Why do I describe her
                  appearance in that particular moment, when I must have seen her so often with
                  greater advantages of dress and situation. Alas! it was the last time! I never saw
                  her thus again.</p>
               <p>After finishing my business, at the nearest town, I hastened homeward, and reached
                  my father-in-law's about dark. On inquiring for Margaret, I found she had gone
                  home half an hour before, having yet some little affairs to attend to, in
                  preparation for her journey. I hurried home, but no fond welcome awaited me. My
                  wife had not returned. I stood as if transfixed. A dread misgiving seized me; yet
                  it was so indefinite than I knew not which way my fears pointed. Her maid thought
                  she might have gone for some trifling purchase to the village quite near us, but
                  on inquiry it was found that she had not been seen there. Every house in the
                  neighborhood was tried, and the alarm became general. Her father now joined me,
                  and his first inquiry was whether any Indians had been seen about. Well do I
                  remember the icy dart that pierced my heart at that question. After all my
                  incredulity, I felt at once certain that Indian John was in some way concerned in
                  our loss. This was at once confirmed by the answer of a boy in the crowd, that he
                  had met Indian John on the road, on horseback, with a sick squaw wrapped in a
                  blanket before him; and, he added, that he thought that he had the squire's bay
                  horse. I flew to the stable—the horse was gone.</p>
               <p>We were soon mounted and on our way to the woods. I burst the door of the
                  wigwam—it was deserted. We had now no clue to guide us, but followed any path we
                  happened to descry, by the light of a clouded moon Once or twice we found the
                  clearings of white men, but when aroused they could give us no information. At
                  length, just as the day was breaking, we reached the bank of a river, and a
                  log-hut, the owner of which told us there were wigwams on the opposite side. I was
                  about to dash into the stream, but the man called to me to take his boat. The ford
                  was not safe, he said, though an Indian had crossed it that night on horseback. I
                  left the boat for men in their senses, and made my own way across, I know not
                  how.</p>
               <p>From this moment my recollections begin to be less distinct. I remember the
                  beating of my heart, which shook me from head to foot. I remember, too, that with
                  a tiger-like stealth, I crept to the nearest hut, and looked through a crevice in
                  the side. I see my wife now—as she sat on the ground, propped against the wall—her
                  face pale and swollen, and her eyes so fixed and glassy that I thought for a
                  moment I beheld but her lifeless body. But the Indian too was there, and, as he
                  moved, those death-like orbs turned their ghastly light upon him, with an
                  expression of such terror—I stood like stone—cold, powerless, almost
                  senseless—till he moved toward her—then, with a yell like his own, I sprung upon
                  him—but I know no more.</p>
               <pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7024-00000158"/>
               <p>We were in the boat on the river—they put an oar into my hands, and my wife lay in
                  her father's arms unconscious of our presence, or of any thing that had befallen
                  her. One man steered, and another held the cord with which they had bound the arms
                  of the Indian. My mind was perfect chaos—but one idea stood out clear amid the
                  confusion—that was vengeance. "Vengeance!" seemed the voice of every breath I
                  drew, and all distracted as I was, I had yet mind enough left to plan its
                  execution. I had no weapon for instant action; but the idea of plunging the wretch
                  into the water, as soon as Margaret should be in safety, and holding him there
                  until his hated breath had ceased, feasted my boiling passions, and I rowed with
                  convulsive eagerness to hasten the blissful moment. Vengeance was sure, and
                  already I seemed to roll the sweet morsel under my tongue, when the Indian,
                  bursting the cord, with one bound sprung over me, seized Margaret, and, with a
                  yell of triumph, plunged with her into the water. I followed, but rage blinded me;
                  and he easily eluded my grasp, darting off whenever I approached, and always
                  keeping his helpless burthen under water. At length, casting toward me the now
                  lifeless corpse, he made for the farther shore. To others I left the care of my
                  beloved, while I pursued her destroyer. I overtook him as he gained the opposite
                  bank, grappled with him, and snatching his own knife, buried it in his heart. He
                  fell dead, but my hatred still survived. I continued to plunge the weapon again
                  and again into his abhorred carcase, until my fiery strength failed, and I sunk
                  exhausted and insensible upon the ground. The efforts of those about me recalled
                  me to a brief sense of my misery, but fever and delirium followed, and, before I
                  recovered my reason, the form I had so idolized was forever hidden from my
                  sight.</p>
               <p>From the time that I once more awoke to the knowledge of my utter desolation, my
                  mind has never possessed its original clearness, until now that the light of
                  another world seems rapidly opening upon it. Yet I remember the slow return of
                  reason, and that the first use I made of my powers, was to crawl to the window of
                  the room, to look at my once happy home, I had been carried to my father-in-law's,
                  and nursed with all the care that cruel kindness could suggest, to preserve a life
                  which could be but a burthen. My illness must have been of long continuance. The
                  fields were bare; the trees were in the latest livery of autumn. The little brook,
                  bound in icy chains, no longer sparkled on its way, as when Margaret, and I last
                  stood on its green banks, and spoke of its sweet music, and of the old willow
                  which shaded half its width. Death seemed stamped upon all things. When my eye
                  rested on that beloved roof—the window where she sat at work so often—the arched
                  gate at which she used to wait my alighting—I expected to see a funeral procession
                  pass down its leaf-strewed walk. When I last saw it, all was repose and beauty
                  without; all love and happiness within. Now—but who can enter into such feelings?
                  Let me hasten to a conclusion.</p>
               <p>When my strength returned, and I was endeavoring to form some definite plan for
                  the wretched remnant of life, I was informed that a trial would be necessary. A
                  trial! It was but a form, they said, but it must be submitted to. I was
                  passive—dumb with utter misery—yet I must undergo an examination, and I did endure
                  it; I remember the tearing open of my yet bleeding wounds—the coarse handling of
                  those who could not conceive the torture they were inflicting; and I was told that
                  I must be ready to answer yet again. From that time I<pb n="310-311"
                     xml:id="VAC7024-00000159"/> brooded over the means of escape from this new
                  suffering—not only for my own sake but for that of others. I shudder even now at
                  the recollection of my feelings toward the unconscious questioner; for the madness
                  of grief was yet on me, and the rude falling up of the image of my lost love,
                  pale, dying, as I had last beheld her, brought also the blind rage of the moment,
                  till I longed to clutch again the reeking knife. It was too much. I left the roof
                  which so kindly sheltered my wretched head, and rushed onward without a
                  plan—without a hope for the future. I need not dwell upon my unhappy wanderings;
                  upon the cold, the hunger, the bitter suffering, which assails him who roams
                  without money and without friends. The wants of the body were disregarded until
                  they became intolerable, and then, if some kind hand did not give what nature
                  required, I dug the earth for roots, or climbed the trees for nuts, like the
                  scarce wilder denizens of the forest. By day my thoughts wandered in aimless
                  misery from my past happiness to my present condition, too often mingling with
                  thoughts of woe, blasphemous murmurings against the Author of my being. In dreams
                  the last dread scene was a thousand times repeated. Again I grappled with the
                  destroyer of my peace, and felt his warm blood in my face; or endued by a
                  revengeful fancy with supernatural power, and no longer limited to such puny
                  retribution, whole tribes seemed given to my revenge. I hunted them to the brink
                  of precipices, and hurled them headlong down; or, kindling forests, and enclosing
                  them within the blazing circle, I gloated upon their fierce agonies, unsatisfied
                  even then. After a whole year of wandering, during which I endured more than words
                  can describe, I bethought me of this wild spot. I had visited it once during my
                  college life, and knew it was too difficult cult of access to be thought worth
                  cultivation. Here I built this rude shed, and none noticed or molested me. One
                  winter I had passed in the half-roofed hovel, but at the return of the next I left
                  it for a warmer clime, but hastened back in the spring, in time to plant for the
                  support of the life I loathed, yet might not, unbidden, lay down. These
                  journeyings, the tillage of this hard soil, and the daily wants which belong even
                  to savage life, occupied much of my time; but I had still many hours of wretched
                  leisure, in which to brood over the past, and to lift my daring thoughts in
                  impotent questionings of the justice of God.</p>
               <p>The change that has come over my feelings, though one which has turned darkness to
                  light, and blasphemous murmurings to humble praises, is one which, with all its
                  blessedness, I am unable to describe. I know not when it was that I began to be a
                  new creature; but I know that the first proof of it, to my own conviction, was the
                  longing desire to return to my parents—to throw myself at their feet, and ask
                  their forgiveness for my early fault. But, alas! I had thrown my life away. Not
                  only were my habits such that I could now scarcely endure the sight of my fellow
                  beings, but the years that had elapsed since my mad flight, left no hope that my
                  parents were yet among the living. I must carry this sorrow with me to the grave,
                  in humble hope that my late repentance may be accepted. Having been found of Him
                  that I sought not, I wait with a calmness beyond my hopes, for that happy moment
                  when, in His good pleasure, He shall dismiss me from the scene of my sins and
                  sufferings, to an union with the loved and lost.</p>
