WITH ILLUSTRATIONS  BY HENRI LOVIE, AND CHARLES BAUERLt.

And the slave, where'er he cowers, feels the soul within him climb To the awful verge of manhood, as the energy sublime Of a century bursts full-blossomed, on the thorny stem of time."-LOWELL. SLAVERY, with its manifold evils and wrongs, is becoming more and more the theme of the statesman, the divine, the poet, and the writer of fiction. It matters little in forming its estimate, whether there has or has not been exaggeration in describing the details of its workings, as it concerns either the master or his bondsman. It is sufficient to know, that it origin- ( ii )  &#xD;<pb n="iv-v" xml:id="VAC7097-00000003"/> PREFACE. ated in and is sustained under, a very low estimate of the value of man as man, and that the exalted Christian idea of the brotherhood of the race can be but dimly discerned by any one, who is willing for one moment, to own a human being. It follows, therefore, that in a system where contempt for humanity unites with irresponsible power, the most vivid imagination may fail to delineate truly all its horrors. As the material globe which we inhabit, was originally spoken into a rude and imperfect being, its thorough completion being left to humanity, that, by becoming co-workers with God, we might be brought more and more into union with Him and his wonderful designs, so does Society expand and perfect itself by little and little, in unison with it. We may lament over its dull perception of truth, its slow growth towards perfect maturity, and the worldly and weak in faith, will be ready to despair of its eventual freedom from bondage to evil. Not so does our Maker, who knows the abundant resources of his creation, and the fitting time when each material shall best adapt itself to its highest and most appropriate use. When the waste places of the earth have been subdued by the energy and force of the stronger races, and the rude powers of nature are trained to do their bidding, when by the aid of machinery, men are set comparatively free from the harder drud- gery of life, then, to those who, by fidelity in duty have earned the high and glad privilege, there comes the play-time of their being, when the higher faculties which adorn and beautify life, will be in the ascendant. Then come up to the surface of society, those who have been regarded as inferior elements in  its construction, even those little ones in Christ's kingdonz, in whom the feminine, the graceful and tender, the imaginative and artistic qualities are largely mingled. Then, woman will be freed from the chains which enthrall her, and will step forth as she is, the subtle, spiritual genius, to impel to high deeds the   PR EFAC F.            v "Iord of creation." Then the African, child of the sunshine, in whom is wrapped up what we, in our country, have as yet vainly looked for-poetry, music, high art, and the full reflection of God's love as revealed through our Saviour, will take his true and blissful position.                 The worldly and selfish will, for a time, scoff and disbelieve this, as they laugh at the struggles of woman to reach her high destiny; but the unwelcome truth will be, at last, forced,upon them, that they have been acting out the fable of the drayman towards Pegasus, on a fearful and monstrous scale. It is time that the world should know of the glorious appointment which God has in store for these his children upon whom his hand for the ages has been most heavily laid; for, from the laboratory of every imaginable calamity and woe, the fitting alembic through the action of his divine chemistry for his choicest productions, there shall spring up and bloom the loveliest, the most celestial, the most sky-scented flower of humanity, which the world has yet seen. On them will devolve the supremacy of the ages, and it will be their joy- ful degti-ny tUo CvTe liOh3t B1t of da&amp;ne33 tw wind -P the horologe of the present, and set it to the musical dance of the hours of the approaching Future. And to one whose soul's eye has become couched to, discern this high lot of the fem- inine element, all apology seems futile for offering to the pub- lic the following Tale; for, as the winds of Heaven scatter the leaves of the trees when they are ripened for the fall, So, through a strong conviction, do the thoughts drop from the pen, and they are scattered wherever they fird a soil fitted to vitalize them. And with faith in the welcome which words expressed from a full and glowing heart will receive, do I offer it to all generous and truth-loving Americans, whatever may be their nativity or race.

THE story of Zoe Carlan, a young colored girl, of the little Danish island of Santa Cruz, js a pathetic illustration of the false position into which a refined and educated na- ture may be thrown, by the fierce prejudices of caste and color. Her father, George Carlan, was a native island, and originally a slave. His ( i &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7097-00000006"/> 10   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. ancestry on the father's side for two generations had been whites, so that with his light complexion, he combined much of the energy and restiveness under despotic rule of the Anglo-Saxon race. Slavery under the Danes had some mild and alleviating features. Schools were supported by government, in which the rudiments of knowledge were taught the slaves, with a view to their eventual freedom, and provisions were made, by which it could be purchased by those who would employ the requisite exertion. George so diligently used these means, that at the age of twenty-eight, he stepped forth under the clear vault of Heaven, a free man I He could but imperfectly read and write and cast accounts; and he reasoned thus with him- self. "Here I am, with none to rule over me but my God and my King. Independence and influence I will have, but how to gain them is the question. I am too old to educate myself; but rich I may become, and rich I will be. I will take my stand beside the haughty whites, and what- ever consideration and power may be mine through wealth, I will attain." Through his industry and perseverance, he had become a successful merchant; and at the time when this story commences, he was living in the enjoyment of not only the comforts, but many of the luxuries of life. On attain- ing his freedom, he married a young colored woman, of much gentleness and native refinement of character, and one child, the little Zoe, was given them, to be the light of their home, and the object of all his aspiring hopes and desires. But the free blacks and colored people (for that distinc- tion is very carefully made in the islands), though expe- riencing much favor from the Danish government, and sometimes even preferred to the proud and discontented white colonists, when indulgences are to be awarded, have no position in society. In the first place, the latter are,   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    " for the most part, the children of illicit connections, and where is the community where the odium of such sin falls not upon the weaker party and her innocent offspring? Then the people of color are a continual source of conten- tion and trouble; they are restless, discontented, aspiring. For every step they advance higher than the full black, they cast behind them a glance of indifference or of scorn, while they are ever looking upward and striving to plant their feet side by side with the whites, if not in advance of them. This is met with unflinching opposition by the dominant race. In all spheres within their control, they omit not to give the most scathing demonstrations of their contempt. In social life they seldom meet, of course. It is, however, the custom for the Danish governor-general to hold levees, from time to time; and to these the chief mu- lattoes are invited as well as the whites. Gladly would the latter excuse themselves from the honor of attendance, knowing the odious companionship to which they will be subjected, but it is well understood that an invitation is equivalent to a command, and policy, perchance safety, forbids a refusal. There is by no means a very cordial feeling between many of them and their rulers. The population is a mixed one. Many of the old and more wealthy families are of English descent. Their religion is only tolerated, the Lutheran being that of the State. Almost all offices are held by Danish officials, often un- scrupulous and grasping, and the Creoles are made to feel in numberless ways, that they are but step-children to the mother-country, and that their interests are ever second to her own. Then, more than all other causes,of jealousy, is the slackening of their control over the blacks, by the measures of the home-government. They see in it their humiliation and ruin; and as prudence forbids a very open expression of their outraged feelings to their rulers, they display a temper all the mote bitter towards the immediate cause of them.  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7097-00000007"/> 12   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. In this scene of unrest, ambitious striving, and corroding sentiment the little Zoe was born and lived until her seventh year. It was then that her father felt that the time had come to carry into execution the idea which, from the first moment that his eye rested on the face of his infant child, had been as fixed as if the fates had commanded it. This was, to send her from the island to be educated. It was a common custom of the white Creoles to do so; but few, who had the means, were willing to confine their children to the very slender advantages for culture, which the island afforded, and though the temporary exile was fraught with much peril and heart-sickness, it was sub- mitted to as a painful necessity. For through most of the forming period of their children's minds, they were given over to the care of teachers too distant from them to exer- cise much superintendence, while the intercourse by letter even was too infrequent to retain a very strong hold over their affections and characters. To this fact may be attri- buted very much of the feeling of exile which the Creole carries about with him to his grave. Seldom is the island spoken of as a home, but that endeared appellation is given to Denmark, Germany, England, the United States; and this use of language is imitated by those who have never stepped beyond its boundaries. George had often spoken of his intention of sending Zoie to Denmark, but the distant idea of it always distressed his wife so much that he delayed the final announcement of it as long as possible. She had but little of his proud, ambitious spirit or intellectual thirst, but lived chiefly in her affections. She was but a child in mind, and while her heart could lavish its love upon her husband and child- while she could wander with them through her favorite haunts and breathe in the luxurious sensations imparted by the delicious climate and gorgeous nature around her- she was happy and contented. One evening, as they were seated in the verandah of   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    13 their dwelling, which overlooked the Caribbean sea, the refreshing trade-wind gently waving the leaves of the tamarind tree, and the delicate odor of the star-jasmine wafted to them on its breath from the abundant blossoms over their heads, George was aroused from the abstraction into which he had fallen by a laugh from his wife. "See, George," she said, " how oddly Zoe's goat looks with that wreath of flowers which she has tied about its face! Is she not like some old, withered belle trying to look young and pretty?" and Nanny, as if aware of her ridiculous appearance, suddenly flung herself away from the child, turning her a somerset, as she did so, down the slope. "Yes," said her father, but not joining in the mirth; and then more to himself than to his wife, he added: "Zoii is very fond of the animal. It shall go with her on the voy- age; it will serve to divert her, and besides will furnish her with milk." "What voyage? what do you mean?" said Sophia, seiz- ing his arm and gazing eagerly into his face. "Now, Sophia, be calm and listen to me," said he, " you know what my desire and purpose is, and I want you to look at the matter as I do." "I cannot. O George! I know you have spoken of sending her away, but I never believed you would have the courage, when the time came, or," she added, in a lower tone, " that you would be so cruel to me.- "Heaven knows what it costs me," throwing his arm tenderly around her, " even more on your account than my own; but do you wish her to grow up like Mahala and Jenny-your brother's daughters-ignorant and impure, with no higher wish than to be the mistress of some white coxcomb? No, I would see her die first." "But she will not: am I like them? You saved me from that fate, dearest, and will not your own child, with you to instruct her, with my eye ever upon her, be even happier and more worthy of her father than I am?"  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7097-00000008"/> "   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. "I teach her," said he, bitterly, "who, (thanks to my slavery for that) know nothing myself!" "But you do know a great deal," said she, brightening a little, and casting a proud glance at his handsome face; "I have not told you what I heard the American merchant say to Captain Sturd, yesterday, while I was standing in your counting-room at the store." "Well, what was it, dear?" said George, willing to divert her a moment from her grief. "He said that there was not a more gentlemanly fellow, nor a better business man on the island than yourself, nor one that he liked to deal with so well." "I dare say," said George; " but I know just what such compliments are worth, coming from a white man, and I value them accordingly. But what has that to do with Zo&amp;es going away, if not this, that if I have risen above my people in any respect, so much the more must I see to it, that my child does not grow up good for nothing but a slave's degraded life, though she may not literally be one? No, Sophia, life is too dark, too hard for me with my igno- rance and sense of humiliation, not to wish for our darling a better fate. She shall be educated as a lady, and who knows," said he, his eye gleaming, " but the tables may be turned a little before she comes back, and people be seated a little more according to their deserts?" "It frightens me to see you so ambitious, George. Why not be contented and happy in us, as we are in you, and let the world go on as it will?" "Well, love, I will. You and Zoe are my life. Will you not, with me, make a sacrifice for her best good, and prove to me your love by being happy with me alone for a few years? Were we not happy together the three years before her birth? and shall we be less so now? You are not like me if your love has weakened with time. Has it, Sophia?" and he drew her toward him. These words, and the sad and tender tone in which they   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    15 were spoken, by one not very demonstrative in his feelings, quite subdued her. She leaned upon his shoulder and wept, but softly and without bitterness. cHer, husband's love-the good of her child," these were the open Sesame to her heart's most guarded treasure, when against the claims of intellect or ambition she would have turned a tiger's resistance. O man. thou hast no lore in woman's nature, it matters not of what clime or color, for it is one and the same in this, if thou hast not learned the very point of the rock which is to be smitten for its waters to gush forth for you. "Her husband's love! The good of her child!"  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7097-00000009"/> was now busy preparation with them for the little girl's departure. Captain Heiliger was to return to nad been spending the winter in Santa Cruz, very willingly consent ed to take charge of her. The Captain had many business transac- tions with Mr. Carlan, and great good-will had grown up between them, and he was very glad of an opportunity of reciprocating some favors which he had conferred upon him in the way of trade. (16)   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    17 Many were the tears shed by Sophia as she diligently stitched upon Zoeis wardrobe, but George saw that she struggled hard to be reconciled to the separation, and he redoubled his affectionate efforts for her happiness. As for Zoe, childlike, one hour she cried at the thought of leaving her parents and going alone among strangers, and the next, was impatient for the day to come when she should sail upon the great ocean, and see all the wonders of the country far away, of which her friend the captain, often gave her glimpses in his narrations of northern life and scenes. It came at last all too soon for Sophia, and no less for George, whose sterner nature was first put in action by his own firm resolves, and by the necessity of conquering his wife's opposition to the plan; but, these victories won, the strong man betrayed the tender heart underneath all this bravery, and, at the last, turned to his wife for the courage and support which had come to her through patience, submission, and disinterested love. Once on board ship, the first agony of tears over, the busy preparations for sailing going on, holding Nanny, the pet goat, by the brightest ribbon her mother could find in Frederickstadt, Zoe stood, interested and quiet, if not happy. She reserved her next burst of sorrow for bed- time, that fearful hour, when, if there is a grief in a child's heart, it surges up and breaks over all the bounds within which deference for others, or passing sports or occupa- tions had temporarily confined it. Sleep, blessed friend, comes at last, to relieve the inconsolable one, and no less the impotent, unhappy sympathizer, who ranges the hea- vens and earth and the waters beneath for some antidote in the shape of story, suggestion, or joke, to allay the tem- pest. When all hope is failing, and the hands are folded in mute despair, lo, more welcome than the friendly sail or life-boat in a storm at sea, is caught the first glimmer of relief in the drooping eyelid, and soon the occasional 2  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7097-00000010"/> 18    ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. sob is all that tells of the dark clouds which had so shut in over the (' Heaven of its infancy." Zoe found no lack of employment or of friends on board. A child on ship is a god-send, for in no other so small a compass, do you get so much variety and freshness com- bined to break the tedium and monotony of a voyage. She was soon at home in every part of it; knew the exact lati- tude and longitude of the kitchen, pantry, cowhouse, hen- coop, and especially did she make minute investigation into Nanny's quarters, to see that all was right with her favorite. She became an apt pupil in learning the terms in use among the sailors, and larboard and starboard. main-sail and top-sail, stem and stern, were soon familiar lore to her. For the child is your true democrat. The world is all before her, free from the conventionalisms, which build such high walls between her elders, and love and com- panionship go where natural affinity leads. Greater/than a sovereign, too, does this Heaven-directed freedom /make her, for all hearts become willing subjects to love, and there is no smack of worldly policy or thrift in the service which such love wins. Sophia would have been frightened enough to have seen her child threading her way through what would seem to her, very dangerous places, now running up and down the steep gangway, now leaning over the railing, now mount- ing up into the binnacle, and anon, down in the engine- room, with the sooty Vulcan himself. But apart from the self-reliance and sureness of foot gained by being suffered to depend somewhat on herself, " there were angels in c i'rge over her " wherever she went. At one time, it was a lonely papa, who as he took the little hand to help her up a step, did it all the more tenderly for thinking of his own cherubs far, far away. At another, it was an in. valid lady, who in saving her from a fall, sighed that   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    19 before the weary weeks should bear her to her own blue-eyed darlings, she might be sleeping beneath the waves. And again, it was an honest tar, who (' sooner than see harm come to such a trim, pretty little craft, shiver his timbers-he would be blown himself, he would." And nothing of interest in sea, sky, or ship, was thought to have fulfilled " its order of entertain- ment," until she had enjoyed her share of it. The cry was, "Zoe, see this whale spouting in the distance;" or, "' Zoi, look at this troop of horses galloping through the sea," and surely it took two or three good glances with her bright eyes to see that they were only porpoises, jumping and floundering through the waters. Then the silvery flying-fish, with its brief spasmodic soarings into the blue ether, engaged her attention and sympathy too, when it was told her that it was impelled out of its natural element for the moment only, to escape the jaws of some pursuing monster. But her greatest delight was to lean over the guards at evening, and watch the phosphorescent light upon the waves, which the ship parted in its course. Its silvery sheen, now brightening, now fading, and flow- ing about the keel like grains of molten sunlight, had a fascination for the child which she did not willingly forego. Undaunted by warnings of dampness and chilly evening winds, she would beg that she might be permitted to look "just for one hour,^ and if she could not persuade my lady to come from the cabin and share with her the sight and her fur cloak together, why, she was just as happy and comfortable too, under a corner of Tom's pea- jacket at the forecastle. Zoe was neither a very beautiful nor a vivacious child, but she was interesting from her gentleness and grace, arid thoughtfulness for others. She was too diffident and shrinking to show fondness excepting to the long-known, but she had many unobtrusive little ways of testifying gra- titude and affection. She had that delicate touch in  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7097-00000011"/> 20  O: ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. smoothing a sick one's pillow, that instinctive knowledge when any little service is wanted, which made her like a ministering spirit to the languid and sea-sick, and when she found that her goat's milk was considered a luxury, the largest share of it was sure to be transferred to where it was most wanted. She was of the grade of quadroons, and her features were pure and intellectual in their contour. One skillful in such criticism could see that there was a mingling of the African in her physique, but nevertheless she was a fair and agreeable-looking child. Her hair was black, wavy, and abundant, her eyes soft and dark, her face oval and delicate in its form; but over it there was that mysterious pensiveness quite common to her caste, and visible even in the face of the full African; a peculiarity which may be explained by those who imagine he is insensible to the evils of his condition, and would fain delude themselves that he is joyous and happy under its hardships. Does the difference of expression arise from the greater fragility of constitution said to be inherent in the mixed race, or is it a prophecy or a fulfillment of the bitter struggle of the spirit which in all of them is to be wrought out by groans and tears, but in the full black may be somewhat relieved by a naturally happier temperament? The favor in which she was held on board was not stinted on account of her race. The few passengers were Germans, Swedes, and Danes, and it is well known they are comparatively free from our aversion to the African. When living with them in the islands as a Pariah race, they are not proof against the influences which slavery always engenders in the irreligious and sensual, and in conse- quence learn to regard them with a degree of contempt, which would be entirely unfelt were the black elevated to his rightful condition; but the individuals who go, from time to time, to Europe to be educated, are petted,and a vail of fancy and romance thrown around them which   Naz-    XZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    21 raises them rather above the common level in the esteem of their fellows. With the quick wit and freemasonry of childhood, Zoe soon learned who her best friends were, and especially with Carl, the man at the wheel, did she establish an inti- macy, for, besides a kind smile and a merry or pleasant greeting as she approached him, she found he had a rich storehouse of tales to narrate. Though somewhat broken and disjointed by his duties at his post, she could gather from them rich store for her world of day-dreams. Carl was perfectly at home in elf-land, for he told her he was a "Sunday child," which gave him great privileges with the little people dwelling there, and the elves of light and the elves of darkness he knew like a book; for to all Sunday children they were visible. Often in herding his cows in Denmark, just at evening had he seen the good little white elves playing hide-and-go-seek among the leaves of the trees over his head, or dancing in the elf-dans; that is, the brightest and greenest spots in the meadows. But with the little black elves, who lived underground and under houses, he had to put on his best manners or there would be trouble enough, ay, and his good wife, too, must see to it, that her house was kept cleanly and neat or she would have plenty of tricks played upon her. Her butter would fail to come, or the cows would hold up their milk, or more vexatious than all, when she tried to spin her linen thread, it would snap as if the fire had touched it. But if every- thing was in good order, they were sure to reward her. Sometimes in the morning she would find her nice cream- cheese all ready pressed without her having to put a hand to it, or her clothes would be all washed and laid out on the dewy grass, or the table all laid for supper, if she stepped out to gossip a little with a neighbor. But he had to be very careful not to let his cattle graze where the elf-people have been, for they have one bad tan  habit-they spit.-and if the cows should graze there they  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7097-00000012"/> 22   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. would die, unless his wife had been prudent enough to raise some John's-wort, saved on that saint's day, and it was near at hand. However, he had learned that when he went to the pas- ture, if he would but say, "Thou little Troll, may I graze my cows on thy hill?' no harm ever came to them, not even if the great blue cattle of the elves came out to feed with them, for they only wanted a little deference from others to be civil in return. But better than all, did she like to hear about the Hill people who were not elves, neither were they human, but half between; although when they appear, they are like handsome men and women. As their name denotes, they live in the caves and hills, and he had often put his ear to the ground and heard their music. It was very sweet and lively, but if any one was so cruel as to breathe a word of doubt about their ever going to heaven, the singing would cease; and there would be such weeping and lamentation as to quite break his heart to hear it; for through all time they carry about with them a longing, but faint hope of salvation. "O Carl!"Zoe would say, "God will let them go to heaven, won't he? What have they done, that he should not?" "I don't know, I hope so; but don't cry about it, little maiden, or I can tell you no more about them." She hastily wiped Away her tears and begged for another story. So he went on: "One evening, just at twilight, I was sitting in my door-way with my old wife, resting after my day's work, when I heard the sound of my neighbor Johan's fiddle. Now Johan was a rare fiddler, but somewhat given to mischief, and he had often said that he knew how to play the elf-king's tune, and that he meant to try it some day. Johan,' said I, ' thou hadst better not, for thou wilt rue it if thou dost.' But sure enough, when I heard his   ZOE; OR, THE QUADR1OON'S TRIUMPH.   23 ?',- fiddle that night, I knew that he had acted upon his threat. Down the road he came, playing as if he were the elf-king himself, and with him a crowd of men and women and little children, all dancing as if they were mad; for when that tune is played, all who hear it must dance whether they will or not. Up jumped my poor old wife, who had not taken a step for many a day; and such antics as she cut up were a sight to behold. But no need for me to laugh at her, for though I had much rather have gone to bed than to join the whirligig, I could not be let off, but was forced to join the crazy crowd. And. that was not the worst of it, for out came my wife's spinning-wheel and up jumped my plow, and then the tables and chairs set to flying, so that it seemed as if the world was turning topsy- tulvy altogether. 'Play the tune backward, you evil carl! I shouted to Johan, but the good-for-nolhing fellow had forgotten it; for if he could do that, he could then stop playing. So we whirled and capered until the breath was nearly gone from us, and Johan himself was as red in the face as his jacket, when I bethought me to take my knife and go behind him and cut' the strings of his fiddle. If I had not done this, or if Johan had not bethought him how to play the tune backward, we should have danced till this time. And that was the last, I think, of Johan's trying to play the elf-king's tune." "Carl, was that a really true story, or did you make believe it so?" said Zoe. Carl hemmed and cocked his eye, and said, " there were a great many more wonderful things than that in the world," and gave the wheel a vigorous turn, singing, as he did so, a snatch of a Danish ballad. So Zoi had no lack of entertainment to her liking, and her appetite was insatiable. Her favorite hour for the feast was just at evening, when the captain would permit her to lead Nanny out for an airing, and after running a race with her up and down the deck, she would take her  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7097-00000013"/> 24    ZOE; OR, THE QADROON'S TRIUMPH. stand near her friend, her arm thrown around her goat's neck, her eyes upturned to Carl, while Nanny, meantime, seeming pleased to serve as her support, chewed her cud- the two making as pretty a contrast as need be seen of contented animalism and earnest mind. Carl had to draw pretty largely on his invention to satisfy her cravings, for, although his stock of the legends and superstitions of his country was ample, such an extrava- gant draught might have exhausted even that. But he was seldom at a loss, for, although to look at his rough, weather-beaten, stolid face, one would as soon expect to find a white lily growing out of a cabbage, or ottar of rose exhaling from a rough oak knot, as fancy or imagination in him, yet he had both. These northern nations of Europe, Germans, Danes, Swedes, etc., are a queer people--a strange blending of sour-krout and nightingales' tongues, lager-beer and nectar, mercury and lead, soot and sunbeam, or any other com- bination of the most incongruous elements which might be suggested to the imaginative. Here is Carl's story of the Enchanted Lady, or the little Flying Fish: "One evening at twilight, as I was standing at the helm, the new moon just over my right Shoulder-where I like to have it-with no voice about me but the washing of the waves, as the ship parted them in its course--for the pas- sengers, with their noisy gabble, had gone into the saloon--I heard a splash in a tub of water near me. This tub Jack had brought and set in an out of-the-way place, to be ready for him to holystone the deck with, bright and early in the morning. Well, as I was saying, I heard something splash into it, and I looked and saw that it was a beautiful little silvery flying-fish. Thought I to myself, you have made a lucky hit that time, my little heartie, for if you had landed on the dry deck, if you had not broken your head, you would have been rather out of breath by this time, for this is   ZOE'; OR, TtIE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   25 thinner air than you like. I gave but little heed to it, but let it stay, knowing that the poor little thing would, at least, be, out of the way of its enemy; the dolphin, though it was rather snug quarters for- one that was used to having the sea to range in. By-and-by it was Tom's time to take the helm, and I turned into my berth to get a bit of sleep, and did not come up again till six bells sounded in the morning. "As I stood tending the wheel with one hand, and rub- bing my eyes with the other-for one needs a little sun- light to wake up easy--I thought I heard some one call my name. It was not like a common voice, speaking low, but the tiniest little grasshopper one, calling as loud as it could. Thinks I to myself, I must be in dream-land, for who ever called ' Carl like that, in the wide-awake world. So I scratched my head hard, and pinched my arm, and tossed up my cap in the air, to be sure that I was up and dressed, but seeing nobody I went to my post. A second call, and this time, a splash in the tub, and then I remem- bered the flying-fish. I thought I must be mistaken about the voice, but said to myself, 'the little thing is discon- tented, and no wonder; I'll e'en put it into the sea again.' As I was taking it in my hand, it cried out; 'Let me stay, Carl, I want to talk with you a bit.? ss"' That's it, is it?' said I. 'Who ever heard of a flying- fish spinning a yarn? But what shall I do; I can't leave the wheel, for where do you think the ship would drift? and my old ears are too thick to hear your little fairy speech at this distance? However, I'll pull the tub nearer the helm. There, now: what on earth are you? And wfiat can I do for you?' "The little flying-fish squeaked out: ( I am an enchanted lady, and my name is Skada. I am the wife of the great giant, Krymer, who lives in Jotunheim, away up toward the north-pole among the eternal snows and icebergs. Ile is very grim and imperious, and with him I led a bard and &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7097-00000014"/> 26   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. slavish life. I was the daughter of King Olaf, and was haughty and proud. I was handsome and witty, and liked to be seen and heard-and who had a better right, being a king's daughter? I could not abide to stay at home and nurse the children, and cook my greedy lord's fifty fishes, and three reindeer, and five turtles, and one white bear, which he consumed every day at dinner. I thought myself as great as he, being a princess, and with as good a right to share in his rule over the dwarfs, who were his subjects. And this I told him; but all the answer I got from him was, ' Can you lift my hammer and throw it like that?' and away it flew and took off the whole top of the mountain Utgardelok, which fell plump into the sea, throwing so much water into the air that it rained for five days. I had to confess that I could not; and what was the use when the ground was so moist already with the melting snow that nothing would grow, and I told him so. 'Can you shout as long and as loud as I canP And with that he raised such a hideous yell, that the trees all fell flat, and my poor little flowers, that I was trying to nurse into life and beauty by gently blowing upon them with my warm breath, all shrunk back into the earth, thinking that the safest place for them. 'No,' I said, and the less noise the better, for then something would be done, or at least, there would be less destruction.' "'Have you courage to go through Utgard, and contend with Loke and his three evil children, Fenris, the wolf, Jormungandur, the great serpent,-and Hela, the queen of death? "'No, and why should I? If I keep clear of them, they will never trouble me. Let them have their dark kingdom to themselves.' 'Then you are not fit to rule,' said Krymer, which did hot convince me, being no reason at all. So one day I took the sceptr, arfd was brandishing it about when Krymer 7- came in. He was as angry as the north-wind in a tempest,   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    27 and without waiting a moment for his wrath to cool, turned me into a flying-fish and threw me into the sea, where I am compelled to live for a score of years.' "What a cross, cruel, ill-tempered husband," said Zoe; "but did not she tell you what she saw down deep in the sea?" "O yes, you may be sure she did, I thought she would never be done talking of the mountains higher than any on the land; of the green meadows which lie at their base; of the waving forests; of the huge ferns a thousand feet long, with their brilliant foliage of crimson and purple, and the beautiful pink and green turf, and sea-weeds and lichens, which they overshadow. And she told of the vast monsters-the whale, the huge kraken, the sea-serpent, and countless hosts of smaller tribes, who dart and gambol, or pursue their prey a mile below the surface of the sea; of the myriads upon myriads of salmon and mackerel and herring, which migrate from one side of the world to the other, disturbing the current of the mighty ocean itself. But more beautiful was what she told of the wonderful working of the little coral insects, who patiently pursue their labor from year to year, forming their delicate and frost-like sprays, blooming at their summits with insect life, which become the basis of great continents and islands in the midst of the waters. "But many a sad sight too, was beneath the briny ;?I  waves; noble ships, with their untold treasures of gold and silver, and rich merchandise, and what was sadder still, beautiful women and children clasped in each other's arms, and strong men with the marks of the death-wrestle still upon their faces." "Please tell me no more about that," said the child, heaving a deep sigh, "but what became of the little lady flying-fish?" "Well, after she had spun her yarn, and a pretty long one it was, she said that it was time for her to go back ,!;4} Ih S. &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7097-00000015"/> 28,   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. again, for she was afraid if Jack should see her when lie came to clean the deck, that he would seize and cook her for his breakfast. So she begged me to give her a lift over the side of the ship." "I will, my heartie,' said I, ' but in return for making the night so short with your pretty talk, I want to give you a word of advice.' "'O yes, by all means,' said the fish, fluttering her fin a little, by way of a courtesy, ' what is it?' 'I When the time comes for you to go back to the old giant, don't seize the scepter again, for it is an ugly, heavy, old thing, and you will stagger under it, and it would be a sorry sight if it should trip you up before your subjects and throw you flat upon the ground. But if you are indeed a princess and no sham, your rank will shine out. though you are dressed in cat skins instead of sable, and you will share the rule, for the dwarfs know who is who, and you will get rid of the trouble of the heavy scepter. Let the giant keep it if he wants a plaything, you are not a baby. Will you heed what I say?'  "'Ay, ay, and thanK you. I can take a hint and act upon it too. It is stupid old Krymer, whose skull is so thick, that he thinks that it is only a leaf falling when Thorns thunderbolt comes down upon it.' "' Tut, tut,' said I, ' little lady, be a little less free with your liege lord, when you speak about him.' "'Never fear, I shall remember what you say; I only want to make his ear burn once like fire with my sharp words, for turning me into a flying-fish, and then I will ever after be as mild as a May morning, and docile as a dove.' "The little fish spread its gauzy fins, laughing as it did so, at its own merry speech, which sounded like tiny silver bells, until it darted out of sight under the water." "Thank you, Carl, that is the funniest story you have told me yet, all but that about the mothers and their poor little babies;'" and Zois eager glance was dimmed as it   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    29 turned upon her own world of dreams, and she was lost for the time being to the one about her. Thus the time sped on, and even a long voyage comes to an end at last; and there was hurry and bustle on board ship again as the city of Copenhagen loomed up in the distance. To Zoe, accustomed as she was to the perennial verdure of her own sunny isle and to the low style of architecture which its exposure to hurricanes rendered necessary, the sight of the brown earth, the leafless trees (for it was now March), the high buildings and tall steeples, was a great subject of amusement. She knelt upon her berth to look out of her port-hole, as it was too cold to stay on deck, while Norna, the servant of Mrs. Heiliger, packed her trunk and dressed her in readiness to go to the city. When she was arrayed to the girl's mind, Zoe took her hand to go and bid that poor invalid good-by, as the lady would immediately take a carriage to ride ten miles to her residence in the country; her mother's heart yearning to embrace her children, from whom she had been separated for six months. She kissed the child and told her she had been a good little girl and had given her no trouble, but on the con- trary, had been a great comfort to her in many little ways, and said if she was unhappy in her school or wanted any aid, she must let her know it, and that in the summer (if she were living, and she sighed) she should come out and spend her vacation with her own little girls, Adelgunda and Freya. Zoe, impelled out of her accustomed iimidity and reserve, flung her arms around her neck begging her, as she did so, to take her with her. "Not now, my child, you know your father's wish was that you should be taken directly to Miss Ingemannis, and it will be easier for you to be left among strangers now   &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7097-00000016"/> 30   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. than if you first went home with us. You will go cheer- fully, dear, will you not?" She hesitated for a moment, then nodded her head by way of assent, and ran to get Nanny. That grave individual now had its beauty set off by the addition to its wardrobe of an old sack of her own, the sleeves projecting each side like budding wings. She had insisted that she must suffer from the cold, as they came into higher latitudes, and in this she was probably right, as the Santa Cruzian goats have scarcely a sufficient modi- cum of hair, it would seem, for home use much less for colder regions. Nature is not negligent in adapting her children's supplies to their needs, yet she has for so many ages accustomed herself to do her work in her own quiet, moderate way, that she is hardly up to our fast times, when steam transports us from the extreme heat of one climate to the no less extreme cold of another before she has time to get her manufacturing apparatus in order to suit the con- flicting demands upon her. Zoe was leading Nanny across the deck when she met Rolf, one of the ship's apprentices, a lad of seventeen, who, as boys are very apt to do, expressed the interest which he really felt in her by teazing her on every possible occasion. He found an especial charm in this entertain- ment, as Zoe was inclined to take very literally all his jokes and absurdities. She was, moreover, rather irritable, and when thus fretted, would disown all friendship with him, then and forevermore, at least two or three times a day only to return soon to be better friends than ever. "What are you going to do with your goat, Zoe?" said he. "I am going to take her to Miss Ingemann's with me," said the child. 'Going to school is she? hey! I doubt if with all the   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    31 old lady's teaching she gets her beyond ba-a-a-a!" imitat- ing her bleating to perfection. "She is not going to school," said she indignantly; "she is going to play with me and give me milk." "There is no room for goats up there, you silly child, unless you can make a crib for her in your bandbox," said Rolf. She was going to retort again, but for the first time it flashed into her mind that he might be right, and that she should have to give her up. She looked anxiously at him and said: "What must I do with her, then?" "O! throw her overboard; let her go to Loke's (the devil's) kingdom. She is one of his people anyway, you know." "You naughty, wicked boy!" said Zoe, stamping her foot. "It is no such thing. She is a great deal better than you are;" and with that she quickened her pace to reach the captain, whom she saw in advance of her. She asked him, with a very downcast look, if she should have to leave Nanny behind with that ugly old Rolf, who would throw her into the sea to live with Loke. "O no! my little girl," said the kind-hearted captain, "she shall have no such dreadful fate as that. How should you like to have me carry her to my country place, where my little girls will take good care of her, until you come in the summer to visit them?" Zoe was delighted, and on those terms was reconciled to parting with her pet, with whom, however, she took most sentimental leave, murmuring over her every imagin- able term of endearment and promise of everlasting re- membrance; and then went back to triumph over Rolf for Nanny's happy fortune. He soon found means to appease her wrath, and, although two or three times in as many minutes, he nearly provoked it again by his quips and cranks at her expense; yet, at the last, they exchanged   &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7097-00000017"/> '32   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. keepsakes, and wished that they could both go back to Santa Cruz together. Over Carl's rough shoulders she threw the ribbon with which she had adorned Nanny in her gala hours, and told him to wear it when he went to Valhalla; and if he were ever so old and gray she should know him by that, and she would come and sit by him to listen to his stories. Good Carl!   "Most musical-most melancholy."-.MJITON. boarding-school into which Zoe was now admitted, was kept by a lady who had gained great reputation as a teacher of young girls. She was of noble descent, but inheriting from her parents more of rank than of wealth, and scorning dependence, she had resorted to education as a means of support, and had gained an honorable repu- tation thereby. Tall and stately in her mrien, with the clear blue eyes, blonde hair, and light complexion of her country-women, with decision, high thought and power of command in every lineament of her face, and movement of her figure, Miss Ingemann might have been taken for a Volkyria, and, indeed, her pupils could not have held in higher veneration her character and acquirementsilad she (33 )  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7097-00000018"/> 34    ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. shown them, in legible handwriting, her certificate from Odin, that she had been of his court. She received the little girl kindly and listened atten- tively to all the directions which Mr. Carlan had intrusted to the captain, as well as to his own fatherly injunction that she should have careful attention, and after his departure, seeing her look tearful and forlorn, she directed an assist- ant to take her to her room, to the companion who was to share it with her. This was Hildegund, or Hilda Strophel, as she was called, the daughter of a Danish gentleman, who two years before possessed a large plantation in Santa Cruz. He married a Creole lady of English descent, and for a time lived in great state and splendor in the island. His lands were very productive-sugar, the principal article of export, brought him large profits, and he spent his im- mense income in the rude magnificence, once so common among the planters-in dinners, wines, horses, equipage, rich plate, and last, but not least, in gambling. His house, large, airy, and commodious, was open to his friends, scores of whom he would welcome to his hospitality for days and weeks together, at which time his halls would echo to the sounds of music and revelry, until the night waned into early dawn. But this was not sufficient for his ambitious and pleasure-seeking wife. She was beautiful and proud, and would fain be presented at court. She, therefore, sought and easily gained her husband's consent to spend a year at Denmark. Here the gayeties and excite- ment of high life completely engrossed her, and when the time appointed for their return arrived, she urged delay. The idea of going back to little, contracted, quiet Santa Cruz and its limited range of social life, was dreadful to her. She pleaded one reason, and then another, to induce her husband to remain. First, her health needed the bracing air of the north, and afterwards the children must be educated; and how could she leave the darlings among   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    35 strangers? although no scruples of that kind prevented her banishing them to the mercy and to the exclusive care of servants for days and weeks together. In vain did her husband insist that his affairs required his oversight, and that he should be a ruined man, if they pursued their pre- sent course much longer: she could not be made to believe it, and so long as the money for her expenditure was forth- coming, she drove care to the winds. Her stronger will and greater force of character overruled his prudence and apprehensions of evil, and so they swept on in their wild career. This false and reckless state of things could not, of course, last forever. His manager was a crafty and rapacious man, who had an eye only to his own interests. He bribed the attorney left in charge of Mr. Strophel's business, to further his plans; so while they sent fair accounts of the great profits the estate was yielding, and money enough to blind him to the true state of things, they were exhausting the land, wearing out the negroes by cruel usage and lack of care, and in fine, feathering their own nests with the riches of the poor, simple bird who had given himself up as their prey. So one fine winter's eve, when my lady was all appareled to wait upon her Majesty, news came that he was bankrupt. What to do now was the question? Return they must, to gather up the fragments of his once splendid fortune, but how were they to live? It happened that he had influential friends at court, through whose efforts he obtained a lucrative office, just left vacant in the island, and in a week they were on their way to Santa Cruz, with many a bitter re- gret on the part of Mrs. Strophel, that her gay and brilliant life was comparatively at an end, The little Hilda had just entered her sixth year, and her they left with Miss Ingemann, until her school educa- tion should be completed. She was a bright, gay little sprite, and her rosy, dimpled face and laughing blue eye reflected every emotion of her changeful spirits, so that  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7097-00000019"/> 36   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. Miss Ingemann, when particularly gracious and conde- scending, would designate her as Mademoiselle Aprilis. When Zoe entered the room, she was giving her doll, nearly as large as herself, a lesson in waltzing, scolding her in the tone and phrase caught from her dancing-master, for her imperfect attention: "Toe out, toe out. Doesn't she mean to take the steps right? Does she wish to go into the black-hole?" At her first glance at Zoi, she stopped short, and stood in speechless amazement. She was but two when she left her birthplace, and had no recollection of the blacks or colored people, her nurse dying soon after her arrival, and although they were occasionally seen in Copenhagen, she had never happened to meet one. Zoe was no darker than many a white Creole, and she was entirely free from the most peculiar and repulsive African indications; but there was a marked difference between her countenance and that of the other girls, which struck and interested Hilda, and although thrown off her guard by surprise, she felt that, compared with the rather common-place and inexpres- sive features of many of them, the little stranger certainly had the advantage. Zoe's heavy eyelids lifted, and her face brightened, as she looked at the human sunbeam before her, and after gazing straight into each other's faces for a full minute, much to the amusement of Miss Holberg, they exchanged smiles, an omen of their future friendship, and then Hilda ran off to find some of her schoolmates. "O! if we haven't got the funniest, little dark elvo now," said she, as she danced into the general sitting room of the pupils, where a dozen or more were collected "the new scholar, whom Miss Holberg told us was to come from away off in the West Indies. Her hair is as black as jet, and all wavy; her skin is dreadfully tanned and her eyes are so mournful. I wonder if she is not ont of the little Hillfolk, who never expect to go to Heaven   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPI.    37 But she has a beautiful sweet smile. I know I shall like her; I feel already that we shall soon say thou to each other; I am so glad she is going to room with me." '"O yes, Mademoiselle Aprilis, and how long will it be before you quarrel, as you did with Rinda, and have to be separated?" said Elize; "I should advise you to be a little less hasty in getting up your romantic friendships." "Well, I cannot help it, if Rinda will fly off the handle like an old jacknife that is loose in the rivets, at every word that is spoken to her. I am ready to love her again, when she is not so cross and fretful." "Who would not get out of patience with you, you little bumble-bee, buzzing about one's face and ears all the time, and such an everlasting talker too? She said she could not study, nor read, nor sew, nor do anything, you tormented her so." The idea of being a bumble-bee struck Hilda as so comical, that she laughed loud and long, and forthwith began to act in the character of that demonstrative insect, flying about the room with her arms extended, with abuzz equal to that of twenty of her tribe, giving this girl's cheek a tap, and that one's nose a pull, and pinching a third by way of a sting, and poking her fingers through still an- other's hair, until there was a general uproar and indigna- tion meeting, when fortunately the door opened for some one to enter, and she whizzed past in a bee-line towards her own room, to see the new comer. She found Miss Holberg engaged in unpacking and arranging Zoe's clothes, while giving an occasional direc- tion to her about keeping them in order; she, in tho meantime, sitting passive and silent on a stool, watching her and nodding assent from time to time to hler sug- gestions. "And Zoe," she said, as Hilda bounced in, ' you will keep your closet and drawers very neat, dear, for it is a very good habit to grow up with, and besides, with so  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7097-00000020"/> 38   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. many little girls to see to, it would give us great trouble if you did not." "Zoe! is that her name?" said Hilda to herself, " what did her mother call her so for? It is not half as pretty as Gunhilda or Thora." Here was a sphere for my little ladyship. She was a real Anglo-Saxon in character and mind, as well as in descent; energetic, expressive in action as well as in word; inventive, decided and managing. She was soon deep in the business of the hour, loading herself with Zoe's frocks, until she looked like a moving mass of drapery, when her laughing face and voice would peep out and resound from between the folds; or, finding odd corners and shelves for shoes and the various knick-knacks of femininehood; or passing judgment upon the child's wardrobe; or laying down the law to Miss Holberg herself, bustling about and talking all the time, and altogether as busy as " a hen with one chick." O, I like this! I wish there were clothes to unpack and put away all the time; it is a great deal better than to sit still and study or sew; and is not this little nook a good place for the parasol? it is so nicely out of the way. But what are these gauzy things? I guess her mother thought it was as hot out here as in Santa Cruz. I may as well fold them up and put them in the very bottom of her trunk, for she will never use them till she goes back. And, Miss Holberg, don't you put those stockings there, for it is my own especial corner, and I can't spare it; here is a place- lay them there, please." Every now and then, too, she would look over to Zoi and smile upon her in a very protecting way, and when she came near her in her revolutions around the room, she would give her a hug; but though its spirit evidently pleased the child, she winced under the act. At length all was neatly arranged, the last package paper picked up and put away for incendiary use, and   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    39 the trunk moved into the most out-of-the-way corner; and what more could Hilda do to show her good-will to the stranger? She thought of a box of sugar-plums, which she had treasured up for her next feast, when Freya and Adelgunda came in with their dolls to play visiting with her. She ran and opened it and poured out the larger half and held them out to Zoe, saying: "Here, you may have them." "No, I thank you," said Zoe. O, but you may! I have got a plenty besides. I don't wish for them at all." "Neither do I, thank you, I don't care for sugar-plums." "But you shall have them, I had rather you would than not," and suiting the action to the word, she put her hand up to press them into her mouth. Miss Holberg, who through all these scenes had had her eye upon the children and was forming her own opinion upon them, now spoke out: Hilda, my child, what are you doing? Come directly to me." She stood before her. "Look straight into my eyes and listen to what I say." She obeyed. "You know, Hilda, that I have told you before, that you are too managing-too commanding in your disposition. I see plainly that if you do not put a check upon yourself, you will ride directly over this passive, gentle little being with your rough, abrupt ways. Do you not see that she is different from you? (a very decided nod of assent from Hilda). Then do not force her to like just what you do. Let her work and enjoy herself in her own way. You do not wish to be a tyrant do you? daying a contemptuous emphasis upon the word) and make Zoe miserable and cause her to dislike -and fear you?" Hilda had a noble, generous, candid nature, and when a truth was plainly presented to her, never flinched from its  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7097-00000021"/> ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. avowal, even though it told against herself. She looked very serious, and said: ' No, ma'am." "Will you remember what I have said?" "Yes, ma'am." This timely rebuke, earnestly uttered, ever after acted as a restraint upon Hilda, and as a defense for Zoi; for, excepting in occasional fits of exuberant spirits, when the former, like a whirlwind, would sweep clear away all obstacles to her dominion, making one grand hurly-burly, the latter, bending low until the blast went by; it required her only to say, "Hilda, dear, you remember what Miss Holberg said? Let me enjoy myself my own way," and she would pretty soon desist from her attempt to rule. It would be well for Anglo-Saxondom throughout the world, if some wise school-marm could thus put an extin- guisher .upon her propensity to force her government, creeds, customs and tastes upon nations and people who do not like them, or who are not yet prepared for them. The two little girls were now left alone. "Do you think you shall like here?" said Hilda, whose tongue was seldom still. "I don't know," said Zoi. "Everything is so strange, and it seems so close," looking around at the shut doors and glazed windows. "Close! why, are you too warm?" said she, opening the door. ' I thought you came from a country where there was no winter and that we never should be able to keep a fire large enough for you?" "Yes, it is very warm, but the doors are always open, and we have no glass in the windows, and there is a breeze all the time; it seems as if I could not breathe here, all shut up," and she drew a long breath as she walked towards the window. "What strange trees! Ours have beautiful, shining green leaves on them, and flowers, too," said she.   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    41 "So have ours in the summer. As soon as the warm days in spring come back, they burst out in no time, and it is just like walking from one world into another-the change is so great and quick." "; O, that must be beautiful!" said Zoe, brightening up. "Yes," Hilda went on, elated that she could make her look more cheerful; "and then we have such splendid times! Miss Ingemann takes us into the country, and we climb the hills and ford the brooks, and see the peasant women make their butter and cheese, and play with the calves, and eat our dinner out of doors, and, and-" "Do you ever see the little elves that Carl told me about on board ship, and the Hillpeople, and hear their sweet music?" No--o," said Hilda, disappointed that she could not go on in her triumphal march, " but I think I shall next sum- mer, I shall look for them. They are very little, you know, and I don't care very much about them, I like to gather strawherries better." Zoe turned to the window again. "Where does all this cotton come from?" said she, looking up at the large snow- flakes, which were falling thick and fast. "Cotton!" said Hilda, clapping her hands-" good, good! Why it is snow, ha, ha, ha!" "What is snow?" "Why, it is rain that freezes away up in the sky and comes down in this way." Zoe looked up disconsolate, and thought, that if the rain froze so up near the sun, what should she do down on the cold bare earth; and she shivered, and sat down on the stool by the fire, shrugging up her shoulders, and leaning her hands on her knees, and looking quite the picture of desolation, while Hilda danced the Schottische around the room. "Come, let's dance and play a bit," said she, holding out her hands to her. 4  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7097-00000022"/> 42   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. Zoe hesitated. "I won't plague you; I'll remember what Miss Holberg said." "I wasn't thinking of that," said Zoe; " but mamma told ne to write to her when I got to Copenhagen, and I ought to do that first, for the captain said, that a ship would go back soon." "So I would," said Hilda, " and I'll help;" but the image of Miss Holberg coming up, she said, " should you not like to have me draw up this small table for you near the fire?" "Thank you," said Zoe, and went to get her little writing-desk, which her father had given her and furnished with all needful materials. "You are little to know how to write," said Hilda, as Zoe spread her paper and took her pen. "I can't write like men and women, but I can print a little, and mamma said she could puzzle it out, if it was not written well, for she loved me so much;" and she brushed away a tear and began: "DEAR MAMMA:--         - "I am going to write you a letter." "O, don't crowd your words so," said Hilda; " if you do, your mother will never be able to read them in the world-I mean, I would not if I were you," she added in a very deprecating way. Zoi began again, and this time the letters were separ- ated twice as far as they needed to be. Hilda was about to exclaim against this mode, but recollecting Miss Holberg's injunction, she pinched her fingers hard and bit her lips, and thinking she should be more out of temptation to do something besides watching her neighbor, she seized a book, and seated herself by the fire, and was soon absorbed in Hans Christian Andersen's story of the Ugly Duck, which he had given her the day before. b    ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    43 ZOE 'S LETT R . "MY DEAR MAMMA:-- "I am going to write you a letter. Do you miss me any- I had a good voyage, and Carl told me a great many funny stories. Does papa miss me any? Nanny is gone into the country to live at the captain's house with his two little girls. I like Miss Holberg-that is one of the teachers; she is very kind to me. I shall go and see Nanny in the summer; the captain said so. There is a very merry little girl in the room with me; her name is Hilda; I think she tries not to manage me, as Miss Ilolberg called it. She told me about the leaves coming all out on the trees in the spring. It is very cold here, and the air has a great many snows in it; that is, rain frozen up in the sky and coming down like feathers. "FROM YOUR OWN ZOE. "Ever so much love to papa and you." Seeing Zoe closing her desk, Hilda got up and went to her.                     4: "What a pretty little desk you have got! T wish fiad one like it."  "You may use mine whenever you want to," said Zoe. ' You are a dear, good little girl," said Hilda, "' and I know I shall like you. We will say thou to each other, will we not?" "What does that mean?" "O, when people love very much, they say thou, when they speak to each other, instead of you.? Here Zoies timidity and self-distrust came up, and she said, "I  am afraid you will not like me so well as you think you will, and if you left off saying it, I should feel so bad; I had rather wait a little." "What an odd little thing," thought Hilda; "sure enough, she is different from me. I think as Miss elolberg  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7097-00000023"/> "   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. said, I may as well let her do things her own way, and we will see what comes next." Hilda's curiosity coming into play was a great saving to her fingers and lips, for she never afterwards had to bite or pinch them so hard in order to keep them in their proper places. i L------ 4 * iS-Pi g---   YU "Thou little child I yet glorious in the might Of heaven-born freedom on thy being's heightl Why, with much earnest pamis, dost thou provoke The years to bring the inevitable yoke, Thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife?

Shrinking  and  timid as she was, her first introduction into a school of forty girls was painful and awkward. Some stared and nudged their next neighbors to look at her; some smiled upon her as if to re-assure her; some said and did their prettiest things to draw forth her admira- tion; while the older ones either were, or affected to be too much absorbed in their occupations to observe her at all.

Holberg-either visible as she busied herself with the pupils, or invisible in the shape of her earnest rebuke, seconded by the shy manners of Zoe herself, which pleaded to be left in quietness and obscurity. Her childish lessons were easily learned, and she obtained her share of the little prizes awarded by Miss Ingemann to the best scholar in the different studies. In no way did she seem very un- like the other children either in study or play or in the little household occupations which her teacher, true north- ern woman as she was, required each in their turn to share; only that she seemed of a more indolent tempera- ment than the Danish girls. This prompted her to retire from their active sports sooner than the others, and disin- clined her to long and steady occupation; in fact, as was the plain speech of the school, she was rather " lazy." "Come," Hilda would say to her, ; put on your furs and hood and let 's go skating. See how bright the sun shines and what good sport the girls have! Ha! ha! there goes one down and another on the top of her! But what is that? "It is Rinda," said Zoe; " she said she was going to be the Snow Queen, that Mr. Andersen told us about. You see she has dug her a palace in that great drift--look at the icicles which she has hung from her curls, and she has got a snow-baby in her arms! U-g-h! It makes me shiver to see her," and she left the window and crouched down by the fire. Hilda screamed with delight as she saw the Queen, with the light snow stuck to her lips and a long icicle for a scepter in her hand, run round to kiss her subjects, who shrunk from her cold embrace and chilly sway. "Come, come, there 's rare fun there. I'll be the rein- deer and upset her throne with my branching horns, and you, with your black eyes and dark skin, may be the little robber-maiden with the warm muff to warm our hands for us. That will suit you, won't it?"   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    47 Y-e-s," said Zoe, and not liking to disappoint her play- mates, she suffered herself to be dragged out to the Snow Queen's palace, from which, however, she soon stole away half-frozen to build one in her own way, of feathery tama- rind boughs and waving palm leaves, with a tropical sun glistening through the shining leaves, and the blue and violet sea stretched out before her, while loving faces and gentle words filled up the scene and made its fitting music, "I wonder," said she to herself, "if our Father in Heaven, who mamma says, is our best friend and knows what is good for us, told my papa to send me away off to this cold country, where everything is so strange to me There is the sun; it shines bright enough, but it does pot warm me much, and how naked the world looks here' Hilda says, that it is prettier in the summer, and she tells me the truth about things, I know, so I believe her. 1 am sure I shall be glad to walk into the new summer- world, when it comes. Doesn't God love the white people as well as he does us, that he gives them snow and ice and such cold weather? But what a good warm fire this is! How it crackles and blazes! I must move my seat back, for it is too warm. O, now I know, God gives them plenty of wood, so as to make a sun for themselves when his grows cold. Isn't he kind to think of it? and Hilda likes snow and says she has the best fun in winter. So I suppose, it is all right; -I must take my furs off too. How soft they are! O yes! and God gives them too, as well as the great wood- fires-I mean the animals they grow on. Yes, they seem well taken care of; but I can't help wondering, whether he meant that I should come; but I ve got to stay here now, so I may as well be contented," and she drew a long sigh. "Have you got your lesson in geography?" said Hilda, as Zoe sat listless, one morning, with her books in her lap. "Yes," said Zoe, "I 'e learned the words, but I don't understand nor care about parallels of latitude and longi- tude, and exactly the spot where people live. If I only  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7097-00000025"/> 48    ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. like them, and they have a pleasant country for a home, why then I'm very glad." "But don't you wish to know whether they are north or south of you, or which way the points of compass are " "No, I don't. I like to learn, whether they live in a warm or cold country, and what they have to eat and drink, and what kind of people they are, and such as that; but I don't understand why it is that Miss Ingemann said she could not be contented in a place till she knew just where the east was. If the sun will only rise warm and burst the little buds which Miss Holberg showed me were wrapped up so nicely, and the pretty flowers will bloom, and I can feel as if I could walk about without shrugging up my shoulders so because I am so chilled; it is all of the points of the compass I care about.?' "What a droll little thing you are," said Hilda. "But we must learn about these things if we don't like them. Miss Ingemann says that all little girls ought to. Come, it is school time and she has gone in;" and hand in hand these children, so opposite, and yet already so assimilated as to be chosen companions to each other, entered her presence. This lady, in many respects, was admirably adapted to her part as a trainer of young minds. In the first place, her character was high-toned and truthful, in an eminent degree. Nothing mean, unjust, or indelicate could stand the test of her clear eye, or indignant protest. She was not merely ordinarily truthful in speech, but in thought, in manner, in her judgment of people and passing events, did she strive after and attain to a wonderful degree of integrity. As the crown of her high qualities she was sin- cerely religious. Her faith was not worn externally as a holiday garb, as it were, but entered into the warp and woof of her being, and was the secret spring which regu- lated her intellect, her affections, and her life. Common- sensible and earnest, she sought to fit her pupils for the   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    49 duties and enjoyments of the world they lived in, by de- veloping their powers in just proportion, rather than by encouraging any idiosyncrasy of mind or character. Her mode of culture and personal influence was happy and beautiful upon most of the minds in her charge. Under her genial and affectionate care Hilda had budded and was blooming like a rose. They were greatly alike naturally, courageous, high-spirited, with minds in which the under- standing predominated, direct in speech and decisive in action. Clear in her reasoning, exact in her knowledge and conscientious in her investigations after the truth; with her imagination under due restraint, the mind of Miss Ingemann was like a grand and spacious storehouse, free from whatever was unseemly, with various generous-sized parcels, all neatly arranged and ready for instant use, while a clear, steady light pervaded the scene. So that though one might at first ask, what more could be wished for in an educator of youth? the answer might be-scarcely anything in intention, yet time must test her ability to deal with a nature so opposite in its tendencies to her own as that of the little Anglo-African. 5  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7097-00000026"/> "G In the clear heaven of her delightful eye, An angel guard of loves and graces lie; Around her knees domestic duties meet, And fireside pleasures gambol at her feet" MONTOOMERY., s g.'.S\ joy,' said Hilda, bursting into their common room one morning, " it is holiday you know, to-day, and Mrs. Kirner has sent to know if you and I may go to her house this afternoon and play with her little boys. O, I like her so much, and Mr. Kiirner is the best and the fun- niest man that ever was. All the children call him the kind gentleman. Aren't you glad?" ' Yes," said Zoe, to whom the idea of some change was grateful; " but I am afraid to go to see strangers." "O, you need not be. They won't be strangers to you five minutes. Everybody is at home at Mrs. Korner's- Miss Holberg says so." Accordingly they were neatly arrayed, and after a short walk, were admitted into a plain, but cheerful-looking mansion, and conducted up-stairs to the nursery-a good- sized room, comfortably furnished, and ornamented with engravings such as would interest children, with here and there marks upon the tables, sofas, and chairs, made by the collision of toy carriages and horses, and the various implements of a children's play-shop. They were greeted kindly by a bright, handsome, happy- looking woman, with Carl, the youngest hope in her arms, (50    ZOE; OR, TIE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    51 by Frederick, a black-eyed boy, of Hilda's age, and Emile, a little stammerer of three. "Come, Hilda, let's play at draughts," said Fred, in the summary way in which youngsters go into subjects, leaving complimentary greetings very much to their elders. "You may have the white men and I will have the black, and we will play the giving-away game." "Well, said she; "and what shall Zoi do?" who was standing timidly by. "Please give me my playthings, mamma," said Emile, in a mode of speech guiltless of many letters, especially consonants, familiarly known as baby-talk. "O, yes," said Mrs. K6rner, "and this little girl may help you set up your town and build castles with the blocks. Will you, dear?" Zoi liked nothing better than this amusement, which gave scope to her fancy; and she and the gentle but merry little Emile were soon good friends. "Make me a castle as big as that, please," said he, stretching out his arms to their full width. ' I don't know how; but I will try to make my papa's house that is away over the great seal said she, at which promise he was pleased, watching her progress and handing her the blocks as she built it upon pillars, con- nected by arches, with a veranda all around and steps to ascend it. "Build it higher," said he, as he saw her putting the roof over the single story. (I must not," said she;' "the hurricane, that's a high wind that comes sometimes, will blow it over." "You must put a chimney to it," said Fred, whose attention was drawn away from his game by their talk. "No," said Zoe, " we don't have chimneys." How can you cook your dinners?" said Fred, who was fond of creature comforts. "Don't you eat anything but oranges and pine-apples?"  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7097-00000027"/> 52   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. "Yes," said she, ' but the kitchen is a little house out- side." "That's queer; how should you like, mother, to have to go out-doors to another house to make your puddings and tarts for dessert?" "Very well," said Mrs. Kirner, " if I lived in a warm country, because it would keep the heat from the house." At this Hilda, who had become impatient at the interrup- tion of the game, said, "Come, it is your turn to move." Fred was moderate in his movements, and remained with his eyes still fixed upon the house-building, where- upon Hilda gave the board a push against him to attract his attention, but with such force, that he burst out crying, and said, he would play no more. Hilda, partly provoked and partly sorry, tried to make the matter fair to Mrs. K6rner, by saying, " she did not mean to hurt him." "Stop, stop crying, Fred," said Mrs. Korner, and then added, with a brightening manner, "Who wants to go into the yard, and see my little white rabbits?" There was a general rush for the door, Fred's last tear being hastily dashed away, and Zoe even following with alacrity, to see the household pets. After due admiration of the timid, long-eared, pink-eyed specimens of living natural history, and seeing them in repose, eating, jumping, in every attitude possible to rabbit capacity, Mrs. Kirner, Zoe, and Emile returned to the house, leaving Hilda and Fred to romp in the yard for a while. But the spirit of management which slept in Hilda, under Miss Holberg's eye and was kept in abeyance with the gentle, non-resistant Zoo, became rampant, with the vigorous, strong-willed, self-indulgent boy Fred, and when he tried to force her to play in his way, she only pulled him the harder towards the fulfillment of her plans, until he, quite out of patience at her presuming to have a de-   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    53 cided preference of her own, and not only that, but insist- ing upon it that her will should be his, gave her frock a twitch, making a bad rent in it. Hilda's bottle of tears was very near her eyes, and if anything went wrong, out came the cork, and to one more self-restrained, there seemed a great waste of feeling; but this time, she was sure there was sufficient cause, not only for crying, but for chastisement of the wicked Fred. so she inflicted a hearty slap upon that young gentleman's shoulder. He was never above weeping and lamentation when occasion offered, so that there was presented to Mrs. Korner, the next moment, the spectacle of two mutually in- jured and enraged young humans, with flashing eyes and burning cheeks, and four great rivers running down from as many eyes. "What is the matter?" said that lady, with the manner of one ready to listen to complaints, and award due justice, and by no means thrown off her balance, as if it were the first belligerent case upon her docket, and she were to give her maiden charge. "He pulled me first," said Hilda. "She struck me, and real hard too," sobbed the little lord of creation. "My little Hilda," said Mrs. Korner, "you know I have three rough, strong boys who have no little sister to make them gentle, and I want you and Zoe to help me to do so, will you not?" Hillda paused a moment, as if a new idea had dawned upon her, but her wrongs came up again, and she cried, "Ho pulled me first!" She had no business to strike me," murmured Fred. "Go into the bath-room and wash your tears away, and you will feel better," said his mother; " your papa will be at home soon, and I want him to see happy faces." This was the "expulsive power of a new affection" to them, and with the cold water it banished every trace of  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7097-00000028"/> 54    ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. ill-temper, so that five minutes after, they were playing as if their life's sea had never been ruffled. The door-bell rang, and the shout went up, "There's papa;" and a glad "Hurra," was heard from a manly voice in the hall, and quick steps upon the stairs soon brought a brave beaming face to their view. The baby clapped hands; Fred climbed up his father's perpendicular with a little help, till he crowed from his seat on his shoulder. Emile looked at Fred, and tried to do and say just what he did. Hilda jumped up and down and pulled him at every point by turns, while the little Carl looked and stretched out his arms towards him, his strain- ing eye, eager even to painfulness, pleading for notice, as if here was his " kingdom come," and he must rush into it. "How are you, my dear?" said he, shaking hands with his wife. Zoe sat smiling placidly upon this noisy greet- ing, and hoped the kind gentleman would speak to her by-and-by. "And who is this?" said he, disrobing himself gently of the children and stooping towards her. "It s Zoe," said Fred, " and see, she has built a house, such as they have in Santa Cruz where she lives." "How do you do, my little dear " said he, putting on his spectacles, for he was near-sighted; "and how do you like Copenhagen?" "I like some things very well; but it is cold, and there are no flowers, and I am afraid I shan't get all my lessons well to say to Miss Ingemann." Yes," said he, " but it will be warm soon, and then we will take you to ride in the country, and Fred shall hold the reins and Emile the whip, and we will cover you all over with flowers; won't we, Carl?" said he, tossing him up and down and handing him to his mother: '"and as for the lesson, you must say to it-you old hard lesson, do you jump right into my head and there do you stick, and   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.     55 if you ever get out, I 'll, I 11 pound you in," and he squared at an open book on the table near, and brought down his clenched fist hard upon it. The children gazed admiringly at his valor, and all laughed at his threatened assault, when the tea-bell rang and Mrs. Kurner directed Fred to lead Hilda, and Emile Zoe; while she followed, arm-in-arm with her husband, to the dining-room below stairs. I The next morning ZoI was awakened .by the entrance of Hilda into the room attired in cloak and hood, as if re- turning from a walk. "Where have you been?" said she. "To Mr. Kirner's, to carry back the dice of the back- ganmmon board, which I found in my pocket. I was afraid Mrs. Kirner would hunt for them, as she did once before after we had played. Did we not have a good visit?" "Yes," said Zoe; "I like them all, and I do not feel one bit afraid of them; they are so kind and Emile is a little darling." "I like to fiolic with Mr. Kirner," said Iilda, " he lets me do anything to him I want to." "But I think he had rather you would be gentle though he is so lively; for he looked tired when he sat down, as if he had worked hard all day." "I did hear him say to Mrs. Kirner softly when I was pulling him hardest: ' What a little catamount she is!'" said Hilda, "but he was in fun, I guess; for don't you think, when I went there this morning, I ran directly to the breakfast-room where they were at the table, and as soon as he saw me he took up the newspaper and read: "'Found fighting in Mr. Korner's yard by the police, Frederick Kor- ner and Hilda Strophel. They were taken to the watch-hous-e and kept during the night. and this morning carried to Court; where their mor- tified parents and teacher plead for their release, which, after paying five dollars and costs, was granted them.'

O! I never know when Mr. Korner is serious or when he makes-believe-he is so droll. "But do get up, Zooe, how lazy you are! The breakfast- bell will ring in ten minutes, and I am afraid Miss Inge- mann will scold you if you are not ready."   "O'er wayward childhood wouldst thou hold firm rule, And sun thee in the light of happy faces; Love, Hope, and Patience-these must be thy graces, And in thine own heart let them first keep school."-CorErIDEs. MS^$ SM(i@     XAlS ffhad a few clear and true prin- ciples by which to judge of human nature and character. She was fond of its study and proud of her shrewdness in its interpretation, and seemed to consider it a legitimate gym- nasium in which to exercise and sharpen her intellect. Her skill and knowledge stood her in good stead with most of her pupils. Such a development in one of them went for so much and must be encouraged or repressed, as the case might be. Such an expression indicated this or that tendency and must be dealt with accordingly. With the frank, open Danish girls, who could bear any amount of direct scrutiny into their natures-for so much in harmony was hers with their own that they appreciated her kindly motive and dearly loved her-her plain, abrupt method answered very well; but with Zoe it was different. Her first feeling when led into the stately presence of Miss Ingemann, was admiration. Left for the first time without some one familiar to her to lean upon, she longed for the love of the beautiful white lady, whose blue eye shone so brightly upon the little girls around her and who all seemed to live in the light of her kindly smile. But when she fixed her clear, intellectual gaze upon her as if to read the soul within, that world where from infancy she had been wont to retire and revel in silent delight, not without ( 57)  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7097-00000030"/> 58    ZOE; OR, TIE QUADROON'8 TRIUMPH. misgivings of a failure in truth and duty in so doing, she shrank timid and frightened within herself. Like the tamarind leaf of her own clime, which closes at the rude touch of one who would read its hidden mys- tery, so when most yearning for sympathy and companion- ship she involuntarily shrank from her teacher's direct man- ner and intellectual attempt at her analysis, though she knew she was disposed to be her kind friend. To Miss Ingemann she was at first an enigma, but as days and weeks went by, and she developed nothing remarkable, she set her down as a gentle, well-disposed little girl, with but little energy and less frankness; with no decided tastes of any kind; wanting in earnestness of character, and governed more by a love of approbation than by anything else. She had no complaint to make of her; she performed her tasks well, but the lack was too general a one for her to reach- a moderate capacity and no real enthusiasm for anything. It needed no words for Zoe to read this sentence as she advanced in years; every sense and nerve revealed it to her and she assented to it all. And yet there was within her the eternal questioning and unrest of a dissatisfied, imprisoned soul. Her face, pensive and mild in its expres- sion, was a poor index to the want of harmony between her inward and outward life, and it wore, in its almost unvary- ing calmness, the natural defense of a reserved and keenly- sensitive spirit, which would hide from every eye its struggles and griefs. As the two children grew apace, it was interesting to note the broad contrast in their persons, manners, charac- ters, and minds, and, at the same time, the beautiful har- mony between them. Like the soprano and contralto in music; like light and shade in a picture; like pathos and humor in fiction; like tender sentiment and triumphant expression in poetry; like joy and plaintive sadness in life, did they blend and divide in its daily anthem, till one became necessary to the full contentment of the other, and   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    59. there was evident on each the indirect influence of a com- panionship salutary to both. Hilda, the elder by a whole year, was the taller and fuller in figure, with the clear red and white which the keen breath and tempered ray of a northern wind and sun paints, and not for a brief day only, upon the cheeks of her fair ones; with blonde hair, so light and silky that the faintest breeze would set it afloat, and with a blue eye that would kindle and brighten, throwing a flood of light over her whole face, like the sun rising from the ocean depths and spreading his radiance over sky, earth, and water. Her step was quick and elastic, and when suffered to act out her impulses, her modes of locomotion were a bound and a spring, dancing a few steps forward, turning around as in a waltz, swaying back and forward a la schottische with an ordinary step or two in advance, to be continued by a movement of original composition. Her mind was as active and as versatile in its operations as her body. At one time she would be absorbed with her doll, dressing and undressing it; washing or altering its wardrobe; teach- ing it her own various exercises; telling it over and over the rules of the school, with additions a la Hilda, and espe- cially enforcing them by occasional punishments, so that the school-girls, who all had reaped the benefit of Miss Holberg's rebuke for her spirit of management, had great amusement in seeing how the safety-valve was let off in the direction of poor dolly, who, as they suggestively said. had "to take it," since they were somewhat relieved. When once settled down to her studies, her acquisitions were rapid and correct, provided she understood them per- fectly; but she took few things on trust, nor believed much in any subtle, hidden meanings, but if everything seemed clear and reasonable, she easily mastered it. In character and-feelings she was like an April day, as her nickname denoted. For story-reading she had an insatiable appetite, preferring the true, but swallowing fairy and goblin tales,  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7097-00000031"/> 60   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. too, though with some wry faces, and much demurring at their hard digestion. Strong-willed and decided, only to a firm, wise mind and cheerful spirit would she submit, and then only through much struggle with herself, which would often vent itself in loud weeping and complaining at her supposed wrongs; or, when desperate and under the eye of one in whom she stood in awe, only in inarticulate ejacula- tions to herself. But when most severely punished, and subdued to quietness, her teacher would begin to relent and question herself if she had not been too hard with her and thus- crushed the tender young spirit, who now, pas- sive and serious, was gazing apparently at vacancy, she would start up and say: "O, look, Miss Ingemann, at that funny old man formed by the coals in the fireplace! What a great pack he has got on his back, and how he turns his long nose up!"She would then, forgetting her dreadful in- juries, throw her arms around her neck, and exclaim upon her beauty and her own love for her, overwhelming her with kisses till she had to cry for quarter and beat a retreat to her own apartment. She was her teacher's pride and joy, as she developed beautifully in mind and person, under her fostering care, and she looked forward to a brilliant and happy future for her favorite. Miss Ingemann's birth, mind, manners, and character being of such elevated stamp, she sustained a high position in the society of Copenhagen. Her pupils were from among its best and noblest citizens, and her companionship was sought by the enlightened and titled of the land. To Hans Christian Andersen, she had been a friend and early patron, and to him her doors were ever open in hos- pitable welcome. And from the children of her school he always met a glad and noisy reception. Hilda would run to him with outstretched arms and beg for a feast from his "nice cupboard full of stories," and no fond mother was ever more generous in giving food to her children, than he in   ZOE; OR, TIlE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   61 their distribution. Simple they were, yet full of poetic life; quaint and humorous, yet shedding sensibility and sym- pathy for -the poor and struggling from every point; and what gave them their deepest interest was not their genius merely, for that was but the instrument by which he poured forth to the people, each one of whom was a dear brother or sister, the vailed experience of a tried, but disciplined, true and devoted life. He would sing to them too, most sweetly, and Zoe loved him better even for his music than for his tales. His dramatic power was at their service also, in a way which they best liked, for his childlike character and love for their young spirits made him deem nothing unseemly, which would furnish them a pure amuse- ment and. a happy hour. The girls would collect their dolls, old, young, middle-aged, handsome, ugly and odd, and he would marshal them into a dramatic corps, imagine some play which would hit off their several characteristics, and lead them through it with such nature and spirit, as to entrance not only the children, but older spectators. Hilda's doll in particular, which rejoiced in the full age of a cen- tury, being an heirloom in her family, was made to play a conspicuous part. Tall and rigid in her figure, wearing on her brow the scars of many a life-battle, with a firm pursed up mouth, which, if she could open it, would only berate the degeneracy of the times; a' square, practical nose, with an iron-colored tip, the effect of many a snubbing from her young duenna; black, staring eyes, which never looked within, but forever spied out and speared the world's sur- face faults; chin and cheeks expressive of entire self- satisfaction, two fixed spots of red upon the latter, as if defying old Time, and saying, " put me down if you dare," with no line of beauty but in the eyebrows, and they were such a thread, that they gave but an iota of character to her face. She was dressed in the fashion of the olden time, with here and there a scrap of modern finery stuck on her by Hilda, and her flying hair and crumpled cap  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7097-00000032"/> 62   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.. gave evidence that her ungrateful descendant (for she called her granny,) was getting tired of her, and thinking that it was almost time for her to be out of the way. This image, Hans Christian made full use of, especially with reference to Hilda, whom he understood like a book, and so criticised and belabored her through her ancestor as to make her almost afraid of her, and she would say to Zoe, . after his departure, 's I am going to lock up my old doll in the closet, and she shan't come out for a whole week. I wish Mr. Andersen would not make her so cross, for I shall certainly hate her, and as she was my great-great great-grandmotherls, and mamma told me to be careful of her, I don't want either to burn her or cut her up, or throw her into the street for the naughty boys to laugh at. Isn't it too bad?' By fastidious critics among his countrymen, with whom his simplicity and purity of mind and beautiful genius went for but little when weighed against his awkward figure and manners and proneness to egotism, he was said to '" carry his heart on a waiter;" but Miss Holberg thought that he might reveal himself still more to his friends, and yet retain within much more wealth of thought and feeling than his uncharitable judges had in their whole stock in warehouse or trade. The great and good Thorwaldsen, to whom Art revealed herself bright, lovely, chaste, severe and sanctified as she is, whose countrymen have it not to reproach themselves with that they were blind to his worth, was also an honored guest at the mansion, and to him Zoe bowed lowly and reverently in her secret heart. To Hilda and herself, un- like yet loving as they were, he always gave attention. He called them his c"Night and Morning." For the one, jocund and wide-awake, soaring on rapid pinion through the empyrean, scattering roses on her way, and lighted by the flambeau of joy, he had a merry greeting or a playful jest; but for the other, who with folded wing and half-   ZOE; OR, TIIE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.  63 closed eye, drifted slowly wherever the breeze might waft her, with her young thoughts and feelings asleep and pressed closely to her breast, and attended by the 'grimn and ominous bird of night, screeching anon of evil to come, his tenderness gushed forth. His gentle tones and soft hand pressed caressingly upon her head, were a healing to the pain which she felt, but knew not enough of herself to reveal, and a hope to the sadness which moaned within her, but which she was too much a stranger to happiness to note. "Come down into the drawing-room," said Hilda to Zoe, one evening just at twilight: " the great sculptor and Mr. Andersen are both there, and Miss Ingemann and Miss Holberg have walked out. Mr. Andersen has promised to tell me a story, and Mr. Thorwaldsen asks if his little Night has drawn so dal'k a shadow over her as not to be visible. Come with me and I will chase it away as we enter his presence, so that he may catch a glimpse of you." They entered the room, Hilda in advance, when just as she approached him, she stepped aside, and, in mock- heroic, school-girl style, with a wave of the hand towards her friend, repeated: "Lo, evening flieth upon the steps of day," and then went to the window where Hans Christian was standing. Zoi stood by her honored friend, for, at the ma- ture age of nine she thought herself too old to sit upon his knee as formerly', and besides he was very infirm. Htilda begged for a story from Hans Christian. "Which of my tales do you like best?" said he. "The seven stories of the Snow Queen," said she; "but Zoi reads the Ugly Duck most, and says she thinks she is like it." "Only that I never expect to become a swan," said Zoe. ," We went yesterday," said Hilda to Thorwaldsen, " to see your works of art, sir, in the different public buildings,  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7097-00000033"/> "   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. and the last place was the cathedral, where are the Saviour and the twelve apostles." "And which do you like best of all of them?" asked Thorwaldsen. "6 O, my namesake, Morning, and next the Three Graces. Those are beautiful." And "she imitated the attitude of one of them, lifting Mr. Andersen's hand to have him per- sonate another. "No, no, you cannot make a grace of me, that is very certain; but you must balance my homely mouth against my stories which you say you like; my one sided nose you must set against my little dramas; and as for my forehead, why my music need not be very much ashamed of it, though it retreats a little as if it did not care for it as much as my little friends do. But where are you leading me?" said he, as Hilda pulled him along towards the door. "To see my new doll, which is sitting in the armchair in the hall. I got tired with the scoldings of old granny, and have put her away. This new one cannot pucker up her pretty mouth to scold, if she tried, or if you do your best to make her." "It will depend on yourself," said he, " whether she talks to please you. I can make her give you a hard les- son if you are not good, even if she were as beautiful as the new moon." Zoi was left alone with Thorwaldsen. "And which do you like best of what you saw yesterday, my little Night?"' said he, tenderly laying his hand on her shoulder. For the first time since she left her mother's side was she won to complete confidence, by the serious but mild eye and deep inspiring voice of the artist. "The Christ," she said;" and I dreamed last night that I saw him passing by, with a covering upon his head suited to the drapery he wore, and there seemed to be written all over him: ' Venite ad me omnes,--' come unto me all.' I'   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   65 rose to follow him, but I remembered that he could read my thoughts, and I dared not go." "But, my child, you have no thoughts which you fear to hide from him, have you?" said he mildly but solemnly. "I am afraid so. I make-believe a world within myself, and I fear it is like telling an untruth. I always say when I have asked Hilda not to talk, because I am going to think, ' now this is making-believe, or supposing so and so,' but yet I do not feel quite right about it. I hope it is not wrong, sir?" "Not if you do your little duties in the outer world, and love real people better than your ideal ones," said he. "Ah, that is the trouble. They are not so pretty or so good as they are in my mind-world, where everybody does what is beautiful and right, and that frets me, and worse than this, I am not the same myself in Miss Ingemann's school that I am in my thought home, and that vexes me more than anything; and if I do not speak cross, I feel so, and am often very unhappy, and the minister says that only good and blessed people are in heaven, and I am neither; so I fear I shall never go there." ([       ,' "Come to me all,' the Christ says, Zoe, which means that we must be and do and think and feel as he would if  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7097-00000034"/> "   ZOl; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. he now lived and worked among us. Remember this, my child; obey his commands. Take, as it were, hold of his hand when you pray to the great Father, and the right and true will be plain, and happiness will come to you through following these when you seek it not." She still looked dissatisfied. "But what is right? Is it always doing what we dislike to do? And is it wicked to do what we most like, what makes us happy?" "Tell me what you like to (o and I can answer you better." "Nothing which Hilda -and the other girls do. I soon get tired of play; I do not like my lessons, nor my sewing and knitting, nor any other work. I feel afraid of people too much to wish to visit them. Even the poor, which Hilda likes to work for and to teach many little things, trouble me so much with their dirty houses and clothes and stare at me so that I cannot go to them any more." "But this is what you do not like. Now tell me what makes you happy." Zoe looked down and struggled hard with her natural reserve, then gazed a moment into Thorwaldsen's eyes and answered: '"To make-believe myself the great, good, kind queen of the whole world, and to think of all that I will do to make its people happy and gain their love. This is all I like to do, and O! it is so foolish," and she burst into tears. Thorwaldsen paused. He remembered the dreams of his youth and how God had enabled him to fulfill them, and he reverenced those of this timid and aspiring yet humble child. "Zoe," said he, "when a boy of your age, I too dreamed of being the greatest sculptor of my country, and raising the world to a higher and purer taste for Art. God has enabled me to do so, and for it I daily bless his holy name. But to be great and to do good, we must not merely dream but labor and suffer and wait patiently upon his   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    67 will. Daily must you take up your cross, and in his own good time you shall wear the crown which he sees to be fitting for you." "But how take up the cross?" said she, " never, never to dream but do everything I do not like-is that the way? O! life would be so hard! Did our Father in heaven in- tend it should be so?" Children ask puzzling questions, and even Thorwaldsen knew not how to answer her directly. "'My child, I cannot say, but this is sure; obey your conscience, read your Bible, let the Christ be your pattern and guide through life, pray to the good God to be your friend. Learn as much as you can of the works of his beautiful world, and be not anxious for anything else-all will be right with you. Will you do this?" "I will try, sir," she said, and as the ladies entered the room, she turned to leave it but with a firmer step and brighter eye than ever before, for her life at that moment was invested with an aim, which she was never to lose sight of wherever it might lead her. "Be gentle and forbearing with this little girl," said he to Miss Ingemann, for she had before alluded to her dull- ness of apprehension and want of interest in her studies; "( for time and patience may reveal some hidden power of mind and character which may surprise and delight you. Hers is no common spirit, I can assure you." The next day Miss Ingemann sharpened her mental gaze as she studied Zoei from her elevated post of observa- tion, till her victim writhed as if her teacher's ,eye were a cold steel point probing her flesh, and when she could not escape her keen metaphysical scrutiny, she instinctively threw out a darkening cloud in the shape of an un- accountable impulse or eccentricity. That lady became doubly certain that she was right in her judgment of her, only that she had given her credit for more gentleness than she deserved, and she wondered how so clear and  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7097-00000035"/> 68    ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON;S TRIUMPH. true a mind as Thorwaldsen's could suffer a fancy to mis- lead him. O! when will it be seen that for no jugglery, nor even at the rap of the clearest understanding will that sacred thing, the human soul, reveal itself, but as deep answereth only unto deep, so to the spiritually enlightened, sympathetic and pure, to the little child in Christ's king- dom alone will it give forth its most subtle odor and its sweetest music. "A vail is lifted-can she slight The scene that opens now?"   "He hath awakened from the dream of life."

"I thought he seemed ill and languid last evening," said Miss Holberg, " and as he bade us good- by, I was startled by his wan look and tottering step; I feared he was not long for this world, but could not bear to dwell upon the thougtht."  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7097-00000036"/> 70   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. Zoi quietly dropped her knife and fork, and her dinner remained untasted. It attracted but little notice, for her appetite was not an eager one, and her teacher would some- times say, *" that if she would even eat with the relish of the other girls, she should have more hope of her, for it might serve as a clue to other capacities, if she had any distinctive ones, but with such a dead level of a nature as hers, what could she do?"' After dinner, the child retired to her room, and seated herself by the window which commanded a view of the artist's house. Hour after hour, she sat with book in hand, but not once read, and watched the signs of his ebb- ing life. She saw one physician after another hurry up the steps with anxious mien; the little child checked by its nurse in running noisily before the door; the servant with open handkerchief wipe away his tears as he quieted the restless, growling dog who strove to go to his master's room, and the friend who came out for a brief moment to stand with folded arms and serious thoughtful face against a pillar, and then rouse himself and step hastily back as if he would not lose a single breath of the dying Christian artist; and over the whole scene, there was that mysteri- ous, sad quietness, unexplained by reason, but real to the feelings, such as one is sensible of on entering a vacant room, and knows that a friend is gone from the house by the still air of the chairs and tables. By-and-by there were other movements. The two physicians last called in, came out together talking of the case, each one having his own thought of its treatment, and well satisfied that he was called in too late to save his life. Then the family medical man with slow, thoughtful step, and face with no remorse of aspect, but mournful, as if "Would God I could have died for thee, my best friend and benefactor!" were written in every line. At last the window was raised, the shutter drawn and she knew that the form of the dead was corn-   ZOE; OR, THE qUADROON'S TRIUMP II    71 posed decently to his last rest, and that the spirit of him who had given a hope to her life, had ascended. Hilda ran into the room. "Why, what is the matter, Zoe, you look so sick?" "Thorwaldsen is dead." "Why, no, he is not. Miss Ingemann sent in at three o'clock, and he was a little better then, and they had hope of his life." "He is dead," said Zoie. Hilda gazed wonderingly at her for a moment, and then broke into a loud cry. " O! he must not be dead; I cannot have him die; the good Thorwaldsen, who is always so kind, and I love hini so much; O dear! what shall I do," and she ran weeping into the school-girls' sitting-room. "Thorwaldsen is dead," she exclaimed, between her sobs. "Who told you so?" said half a dozen voices at once. "Zoie." ' O, the little raven! It is no such thing. I'1 engage she has not been out of her room this afternoon, and strange as she is, I do not believe she has second sight,l' said Rinda. "He is though!" said Hilda, wiping her eyes, for the slur upon her friend was fast diverting her grief from her loss. '"He is, for when Zoe says a thing is certain, it always is. He is dead," and she again wept aloud. The day of his funeral came, and he was to be honored in his burial as no subject of any realm had been before. The king in deep mourning, was to receive the body at the entrance of the church, and the crown prince, as President of the Academy of Fine Arts, at the head of its members, followed by the royal princes, and the principal officers of state were to walk after the hearse. Troops, processions of the different guilds, and orders of citizens were to form the train of this national ceremony. Miss Ingemann's school was to attend 'her to the church, habited in white, with a scarf of black crossing the  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7097-00000037"/> 72    ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. shoulder and hanging down the side. One is not curious to know how much the preparation for this pageant alleviated their sorrow. It is sufficient, that from the oldest to the youngest, there were love and veneration for the departed, and the sad sense of loss was really felt according to each one's character and capacity. Zoei watched the preparations, and with Miss Holberg's help arranged her wardrobe, but with a strange feeling of unreality, as if it were not for herself. The idea of doing something to honor her friend, were it but sewing a straight seam in her most skillful manner, was grateful to her, and her imagination pictured a thrilling adoration, a deep and manifest woe, as a necessary accompaniment, and a lasting inspiration derived from the recital of his greatness, and goodness. She was too young and inexperienced to know that human power is so limited in this life that though profound senti- ment may first suggest the ceremonial, yet when we are doing the most to honor outwardly the departed, thus spreading our feelings over a large surface, we are for the time dismayed at their comparative shallowness. It is well that it is so, for to give -beauty and richness to life there must be symbol and ceremony, and the various ex- pressions of deep poetic sentiment; and let the mind-be sufficiently engrossed by them to have them fitting and beautiful, though at the time they may seem to detract from the ethereal essence of feeling. But when the duty is done and every untoward and vexatious circumstance is softened to the memory or haply fades away from it entirely, then rises the Phoenix of holy and beautiful poetry firom the ashes of what may seem to the mistaken a too material and meaningless rite. "For thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness," and to him who simply and reverently obeys without questioning the dictates of nature and religion, the great alchemnist will in time reveal the reward.   ZOE; OR, THE QtADROON'S TRIUMPH.     73 Zoe sat by herself and mourned silently for her loss. Too young to reason much, constitutionally sentimental, early thrown into circumstances which favored reserve, not understood by her teacher, she was fast growing morbid and unnatural by a one-sided development. Like the pas- sion-flower torn up by the roots and planted against a wall of ice, the tendrils of her soul spread hither and thither striving instinctively to reach some support. With the elements of a self-sacrificing, aspiring life prematurely developing, of a nervous and anxious temperament, she had found relief and hope through confiding in Thorwald- sen, and at night she scarcely slept for the joyful visions which visited her. The great artist was her friend. He, too, had dreamed like herself, and to him she would go to slake her yearning to be loved and feel that she could look straight into his eye without being repelled by a wonder- ing, critical stare. Now her hope was cut off. With this painful experience adding a long term to her life, she was again thrust back upon herself, and her feelings at first stuvnned, now gushed forth in uncontrollable weeping. "How foolish I am!" she said to herself; " as if a little girl of nine has a right to be so sorry because this great man, whom all Denmark and the world worship, has died. He never said much to me and I less to him, and Miss Ingemann always seemed afraid lest I should trouble him when I stood by his knee. I would not have her know that I was crying so for him for the world. I will wash my eyes that she may not see my tears. But O! was not his soft hand upon my head like this cold bath to my eye- lids? I never, never shall feel it again!" and she burst forth afresh. "But I must control myself, as Miss Inge- mann calls it. 1 will go to the window and look out and think of something else. There sits a poor tired man in the street, and two little children are giving him some- thing, and he stretches out his hand and pats their heads.

O, I never shall hear him tell me again of the Christ and make me feel as if I could be like him! What, what shall I do! I am afraid the feeling which made me so happy will leave me;" and she clasped her hands and looked up as in earnest entreaty. "But hush! some one is coming. No, the step has passed by; but I must get ready to go to the funeral. How the crowds begin to pour along! how eager they are to get a place where they can see the parade well! This is their way of being sorry, I suppose. But can I walk in the long procession, with the bright sun shining into my face so that people can see me, if I cannot help crying? And how can I help it when everybody has lost a friend, and I the most of all! And they will say: 'The great and good Thorwaldsen is dead!' And the organ will play so mournfully, and that I cannot bear up under. I shall certainly groan and cry aloud. O no! I cannot go to the funeral. I must stay by myself. I must, I must;" and she threw herself upon the bed and hid her face in the pillow to still her sobs. Miss Holberg came into the room-"Come, my dear, I will help you to dress before I make my own toilet." "I cannot go to the funeral." "Not go to our friend's funeral!" But seeing the child's swollen eyes, she guessed the cause, and she knew her well enough to speak gently, but not to go to the deep- est springs of her nature to console her. "Yes, dear, I see. We all loved Thorwaldsen, and feel very sad to lose him; but we must submit to God's will and do our best to honor his memory. You wish to do that, do you not?" "O Miss Holberg! let me stay at home; please, please, do! I feel as if I should drop down in the street. Do ask Miss Ingemann to let me!" She really looked so sick and miserable and her step tottered so, that knowing she was not strong, she feared she would not sustain the fatigue, and therefore, went to Miss Ingemann and reported her state.   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    75 She was disappointed to have her arrangements dis- turbed, for the brunette and blonde were to form a pretty contrast in the procession, and really sorry that the child should have one of those troublesome headaches so mal- apropos; but she was too busy to see her personally, and directing that some simple remedies should be given her pupil, she accompanied the others to the church. So Zoe lost the opportunity of regulating her sensibilities, diseased by solitude, and her idiosyncrasies of tempera- ment, by the healthy influence of contact with other minds and right participation in a becoming pageant; but she sat alone exaggerating the grief of the audience, and the desolation caused by their loss, till a morbid impression was fixed in her mind by an event which might otherwise have been presented to her under such inspiring aspects. For this born peasant, but nature's noble, from humblo poverty and a frigid clime had worked his way upward to a post which kings looked up to, and had drawn from his calm but burning soul, images of beauty, sanctity and power, which the world has caught glimpses of enough to honor, but which are to inspire and lead the human soul far in the distant future. And now, that the drapery of mortality had fallen from him, he stands revealed as two great lives, one upon earth so vailed as not to startle, but to allure to excellence; the other, " where no eye hath seen, nor ear heard, nor heart conceived "- the glory which shall be revealed to the lovers and doers of the good! Poor Zoe! her young heart was only too alive to the power and beauty of the first life; and what 'a light is quenched, when a great and pure nature bids adieu to it! But to balance this premature sensibility, there were needed a deeper and more inspiring mode of consolation, a clearer insight into the other, than her teacher gave her, and she suffered accordingly.  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7097-00000039"/> "The law's delay." 6O  TII(mQ: , here is Mr. Ernest's gardener, with your plants which he promised you. Shall I ask him to carry them into the yard?" said Fred Korner, one bright morning early in the month of May. "Yes, my boy, and say, I thank Mr. Ernest, for his kindness." As soon as that bright notable lady had finished her house- hold arrangements for the morning above stairsdusting here and there a bureau or table in her bedroom, smoothing a wrinkle left in the counterpane, picking up the threads from the carpet, she went into the parlor. Before one could count twenty, there was a general overturn of the furniture; sofas were wheeled from one corner to the other; the great chairs had an easy hob-nobbing squint given to each other, as they were stationed at opposite angles; and she mentally resolved, that on the first leisure day she would pull up those set-looking bookcases by the roots, and let them know that they were not to stand still all their lives in this age of progress. They should change sides like the poli- ticians all over the world. Here was little Denmark all in a fuss and fury about Schleswig Holstein, her husband's birthplace. She hoped it would have its own way for his sake, and had she not read the American newspapers, which Mrs. Stephenson, the minister's wife from that country, had lent her? (76)   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   " She had borrowed them at first to improve her know- ledge of the idioms of the English language, but there was such life and fun and information in those New York papers, especially in one called the Tribune, that she must read them weekly. "No, no, her bookcases should not be old fogies, they should march with the times; and if some day she cotuld catch her brother-in-law, the Lutheran minister, whose church she attended, and who doted even on the odor of an old book-no, she believed on the whole it was a new one-would not they have a good time in making a thorough -revolution among them? And those old pam- phlets, they should make a bonfire unless the parson wanted them, which he no doubt would. What a saint his wife must be to suffer so much old lumber about! Poor victim,' she thought (" on the whole she would not offer them to him, but for her sake put them into the fire at once." After giving the last touch and turn to the ornaments about the room, to make them look as unlike to themselves as possible, she went into her little yard. It would not be called a large territory by a country- man, but for the city, it was not to be despised by any means, and with the contributions of her different friends, especially Mr. Ernest's, and what the seed-store afforded, and the hot-house plants from Mr. Hoffman that he had just brought her, which would give the last touch to its glory, she already saw in her fancy quite a little greenery around her. so Yes, her house, with its surroundings, should be a real home to her in the best sense, and it should 6e a resting- place to the soul of ller beloved when he returned each night fi'om his labors, and her children should have sweet and lovely associations through its beauty with their child- hood; and how easy it would be, through the springing grass and blooming flowers, to lead their thoughts and affec- tions-to the good Giver of all this enjoyment!" v  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7097-00000040"/> 78   ZOiE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.

I should ask 'our Father' when one asked me for it whom I did not know about, if I should lend to him, and I should try and learn about him or her, and whether it would be right and useful to them to have it; and if I made up my mind that it would, I would lend it till they could pay it again--just the sum that I lent them and no more. But if I thought that it would do more harm than good, 1 would say, 'No, you must not have it;' and as I should feel sorry to disappoint them, I should look and say- so, and perhaps that would do a little toward making them better, and as soon as God was willing I would let them have it, and I don't think he would make me wait till they were perfect seeing that none of the rest of us are, not even Miss Ingemann.'" "O Zoe, darling!" said Hilda, throwing her arms about her, "I wish that you would try to do just as our teacher wishes you to do, so that she may love you dearly as she does me. She is so kind to me, and I am so fond of her that my only trouble is that you don't seem to understand each other, so she gets angry with you and you look so sad, or if you do laugh and frolic, it seems like fioth and foam on the surface of the deep moving sea, and it makes me feel worse than to have you sit quiet, as you do so much of the -time. I try to explain matters to both of you and make it appear that you neither of you are in the wrong, but both mean the very best; but it is of no use, and it makes me very unhappy." And she kissed her and began to arrange her curls while she hummed a F   little tune. "No, Hilda! it is of no use," said Zoe seriously; "Miss Ingemann does not like anything about me. I am  not clever, like you and the other girls, about my lessons. I get them by rote, she says, and to-be-sure I do, all but my  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7097-00000047"/> 92   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. natural theology and grammar and rhetoric and my Bible lesson. I like them, and when Miss Ingemann wishes to show me off she does right to question me in those studies." "But there are other matters that you trouble her about; your hair is not always arranged neatly to suit her, and your shoes are sometimes down at the heel and your hose are too much darned, and then you sometimes lay your sewing implements and books about, and as she is very particular and nice it tries her; and it is not all for that either, but she really wishes you to grow up a tidy, sensi- ble, intelligent, and elegant young lady." "Yes, Hilda, I know it, and you need not think that I don't thank her for it in my heart, though I don't kiss her and tell her so as much as you do. But I know this too, for though I am a little dark-girl, I can see through a cloud when the moon shines through it, as well as Miss lnge- mann or any other bright person. She wants me to be sensible in just her way, and intelligent in just her way, and elegant in just her way; and if I am not, she won't own that I am at all. Now that is not what God intends, else He would have made me more like her. She does not like my curly hair, and when she wants to show that she is particularly kind, she takes both her hands and tries to smooth it and she says, ' Zoe, my dear, put on your bon- net and may-be your complexion will improve;' or, Zoe, you see how straight Adelgunda sits, I wish you not to lounge so;' or, ' Zoei, look! Freya has knit this pair of stock- ings in two weeks, you must be industrious like her;' or, 'Hilda has an excellent mind, she is so quick in her algebra;' and then looks at me as much as to say, 'you have not .?" "Why how you talk, child! what an imagination you have!" "It is not imagination, it is plain fact; and though Miss Ingemann is very good and knows almost everything in   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    93 books and all about the great people who have lived since the flood, and is ' au fait,' as she is always saying, ' to the conventionalisms of society,' there is one of'our Father's' little girls about five feet high, that she knows precious little about, and it is a pity since she pretends to teach her." "Aren't you funny?" said Itilda, laughing. 4 It may be fun to you, but it is anything else to me; when my mind is in such a hurly-burly state and I only know that I must be made for something, but I don't know what, and if Miss Ingemann would go the right way to puzzle me out and then tell me, I should be much more thankful to her than I am while she distresses herself about whether I am dark, or white as a piece of chalk with two strawherries stuck on it, or my hair flax-colored and as lank and straight as a tallow candle, or black and curly as my own, or whether I bend a little before the cold north wind always blowing upon me, or take it all as firm and erect as if I were a piece of Thor's ramrod set down here on the earth. Leave these things to ' our Father' who made me, and teach me something of more importance, I say."' "Good,: said Hilda, ;' I like to see you so, because your face has some spirit in it. \ But you can't deny but your habits of study and behavior are of some importance." "O yes! But what if j do set my thimble by my plate while I dine; she need not look and speak as if I had smashed Moses' two tables of stone with all the com- mandments upon them; or, if Freya does knit like a steam engine, the globe is not kept together by it, as I know of; or, if 3you can reckon a million, that does not redeem all the souls in the world, does it, my own best Hilda?" "O no, indeed, I hope not. Save me from any such awful responsibility. I am afraid mny own will fly away into space some day I am such a giddy thing; but do, Zoi, wear clean white skirts, and nice fine hose all the time, to please Miss Ingemann and me, too, dear! wont you?"  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7097-00000048"/> "   ZOEi; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. "'Now that is just like Miss Ingemann; and you, too, Hilda dear! you say so to save me from disgrace with her; but she has always had money enough all her life, and, besides, only associates with a few elegant, tasteful people as fortunate as herself, so she does not seem to think but that everybody may dress as well as she does. Now my father is not rich, and he has many poor relatives whom he helps in their living, and it is very expensive keeping me here, and though he is generous, yet I know he wants me to be economical, so I am, and--I wish Miss Ingemann would turn her sublime gaze to the stars, and not look at my stockings." "But at any rate, as she says, there is water enough in the river and your skirts might be clean." "How, without great expense in this filthy, smoky city, I should like to know? Look at the piles of dirt in the street, and see that great chimney belching out a column of black smoke. I wonder if it is the evil deeds of the proprietors ascending to the bar of heaven to be judged in that form! And don't we bury ourselves before our time every walk we take. To be really and thoroughly decent as I like to be, for I am as nice in my taste as Miss Ingemann, it would take all my allowance money for my washing, and I can't spare it, when I must have new clothes once in a while; and that is just the way she judges and teaches me. No, Hilda! I had a teacher once, and in five minutes he pointed out to me the way to walk through life, and to me it seems so simple and plain that I wonder when I attempt to keep in it that all good people do not bid me God speed! and take hold of my hand and help me on- wards, instead of making me turn aside into their by-paths. I do not say that they are by-paths to them, but when I try them to see if they were made for me, I feel so wretched and away from home and the sunlight of God's favor, that I shrink into myself and begin again my ceaseless ques- tioning.1'   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    95 (A voice calls Hilda.) "Dear Zoe! I must go. You are better, O! so much better than I am, and I love you dearly! I only say these things to you because it frets me not to have Miss Ingemann see you as I do, and if some little things were altered in you I think she would." "No, Hilda! I am not as good as you. It is so easy for you to do just what you were made for, that I admire and look up to you all the time, and you are so kind to let ime lean upon you, and you cover up my failings so beautifully when we go abroad together! But I am nothing but one cluster of interrogation points, always longing to do my duty but not knowing how, throwing the past behind in disgust, having no life and interest in the present, and yet what am I fit for in the future of such a world as this? But go, dear!" (Zoe alone.) "' Obey your conscience; read your Bible; let the Christ be your pattern and guide; take, as it were, hold of his hand when you pray to the Father to aid you; learn of the works of his beautiful world; love him for his goodness, and all mankind, because le loves them; and be not anx- ious for anything else.' Yes, these were his words. And have I fulfilled them? To the letter I have tried to be faithful, but something is wanting. I reap no reward of self-satisfaction. They speak of the approving conscience. I know it not. My life is one great feeling of deficiency, my soul nothing but an altar of sighing and supplication. Whither shall I turn for light?

Yet I can say nothing, for I am but a little girl and know not how to argue, only to feel, and then, worse than all, this unrest and dissatis- faction with myself weakens my words when I would dis- sent from my companions. O! my mother! my far-away mother! would that I could be folded in thy arms while I say I Our Father!  and then, perhaps, He would answer to her call and mine. For is it not a cruel thing to tear the young bird from its warm nest, or the tender lamb fi'om the sheepfold, to wander in the snow-mountains alone? and how can it be that a little girl could find the right way through the cold, hard world, to the warm, sunlighted heaven above, without her mother to guide her?"

Not less did this feeling influence her, than heretofore, when the little, dark-browed West-Indian was left to her management and fostering nurture. To us, Americans, slaveholders, or abet- tors, excusers or tolerators of slavery, who are buried ten thousand fathoms deep under the prejudices, convention- alisms, false, unnatural and wicked feelings superinduced upon the soul by the existence among us of this great sin against God, and foul wrong against his humanity, it seems almost impossible, that Zoe should not from the first, have been looked upon by both teacher and pupils with distrust and aversion, when she came to claim as an equal a share in -the privileges of this " home of education." But it was not so; on the contrary, she was instituted immediately as both the lion and the pet of the school. But her nature was a shrinking one, and she recoiled from the pedestal upon which, not only Hilda, but all her schoolmates, at first strove to place her. And who that knows anything of the world of children, no less than that of men and women, is not aware that, for immediate success in life, one must not only accept willingly all the honors it proffers, but claim 9                  (97)  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7097-00000050"/> 98   ' ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. even a little more as its just due, in order to keep a posi- tion fairly equal to its deserts, in an age when might makes right, and among a people, admirers of coarse, rough, obvious power. For our modern material civilization has but little insight into the value, beauty and latent power of a soul, true to its natural instincts, refined and strength- ened by growing up into a perception of, and sympathy with God's revelation through the ages, while it is kept ten- der and pure, and at the same time, is glorified in intellect, affections, character and imagination, by a walk and- com- munion with the Infinite, through Nature, no less than the spirit, principles, precepts, hopes and promises of his Holy Son, our Lord and Master, the beginning of a new spirit- ual creation, and the Leader through time and eternity of all who put their trust in him! So that the child was soon as readily dropped as she desired to be, into quietness and retirement. It followed, as a natural consequence, that she ceased also to be the favorite, except with a very few; for there are not many so true, loyal and self-sustained that they do not require that their judgment of men and things should be reflected from the smiles and respect or haply worship of others, in order to insure them that they are not making fools of themselves in their opinions or choice of friends and associates. But other causes operated with Miss Ingemann, to place her in unhappy relations with Zoe, to lead her into mistake, perplexity and discouragement, and at length into injustice and mutual injury to each other's characters and lives. In the first place, she was an Anglo-Saxon, with the physical courage, energy, self-reliance and practical power of that predolinant race. She believed in its " manifest destiny," which by the majority is supposed to involve a superiority to the rest of the world, and as a natural infer- ence, its final rule over the different nations. / Zoe belonged to a different division of the human family. Her strongest characteristics were a fiery temperament,   Z()E; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUM11'    99 imagination, strong affections and religious aspiration. With these were combined a nervous organization of the most delicate cast, warning her at every point, of her want of sympathy and adaptedness in physical, mental and spir- itual constitution to the sphere into which she had been transported. By a strong natural instinct, acting upon her like a fate, she unfolded herself only so far as she could find a response to her utterances, either in action or words. As the spider, who, sociably inclined, approaches the do- mestic circle, and puts out one antenna after another to attest its welcome, when lo! a start, or a scream, (if haply it is not crushed altogether by a rude and daring foot,) warns it to use its mysterious instinct, by feigning death, until it can scramble away discomfited, and then it com- pensates itself by ascending on its self-woven wing to a height above the scene of its trial, where it spins itself a world according to the beautiful laws with which its Crea- tor has inspired it; so Zoei, finding in her teacher's staid, bare practical world no home for her glowing fancies, un- worldly fashions and aims, and enkindled hopes, sat like a stone, in the midst of the noisy life and glittering but chilly brightness about her, and as soon as she might, buried herself in her chamber to call about her the spirits of a clearer ether and intenser being. In the second place, Miss Ingemann was of noble birth and dated back from a long line of titled ancestors. She be- lieved in privileged orders, and though intending to be strictly just in her estimate of her pupils, this idea made the scale waver a little against those who were not, of which Zoe was one. Then she had the true Anglo-Saxon mode of estimating power, as before indicated, in an age of action and invention; its obvious, clear, striking manifestations she appreciated, and where this was exhibited in full blaze, no prejudice in favor of rank or title prevented her for a moment from owning and bowing down to its sway. So to the charms of simple goodness as exhibited in ways  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7097-00000051"/> 100   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. familiar to her, she was fully alive, and wais absolute in her requisitions of its first importance in her friends, associ- ates, and pupils. But enslaved by conventionalism, ever fearful of overstepping the bounds of female propriety, as laid down by society; gifted with but little imagination or passion, she frowned upon all manifestations of charac, ter which indicated a rebellion against existing opinions and customs. With no broad sweep of sympathies which would make her one with every tribe, nation, and kingdom under heaven; ay, and lift her to companionship with the realms above, and carry her in pity and hope into the under-world beneath, but confining her familiar intercourse very much to a choice clique of the wise and good, ignorant from actual witness of the obstacles, disadvantages, and dread- ful temptations through which the multitudes struggle upwards to the light, or which haply prevent their ascent, she was often stern and intolerant in her judgment of the imperfect and erring, or else ignored them altogether. Not by such narrow rules did he who knew what was in man gain such insight into his depths, and it may be doubted whether with the aid of miracle itself, this nature would have unfolded itself to his gaze, had he separated himself from the people by virtue of his royal descent and sought only the companionship of Simon the -Pharisee, and such as he, or even of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus. But the great, over-mastering cause of her failure in edu- cating Zoi, was the falsities of her creed; for these she was but partially accountable, for it was the result of the spirit of her age, which was compounded in part of Christian ideas, it is true, but with a large infusion of the errors of the past, the crude speculations and skepticisms of the present mingled with the worldliness, licentiousness, and hypo- crisy, ever the attendants of a decline of faith in the simple but sublime truths of God, written upon the human soul in its purity, revealed through his messengers and daily   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    101 hung out to the gaze of the world in his wonderful works. Strange, strange that these verities should be forsaken or be held but feebly, to cling to a soiled, misshapen, parch- ment credendum, scribbled all over with characters written in blood, partly by the Pagans of the anti-Christian world, in part by the half-enlightened, self-conceited philosophers of the times of, and after the Apostles, with the continual accretion with which mistaken men, loving their own blind opinions and fancies better than the truth, have covered over or deformed their majestic beauty. Had Zoe's mind and character been like Hilda's. for instance, ready to be moulded according to her own fixed notions of culture, all obstructions to a happy development of her nature, at least to a certain extent, would have been spared her. For so much greater than any creed is the human soul that in quiet, unexcited times when the false- hoods of society, like lions and tigers asleep, scare not mankind into unnatural attitudes and induce them to build around themselves ugly walls of defense, and force not the guardians of society to utter hideous shrieks and magnify the danger at hand, thereby frightening it into deformity, it may grow beautifully under the genial light of God's sun- shine and grace, though it may not reach the height, breadth, and depth of expansion that it would under the most favorable circumstances. But the Anglo-African was a new specimen, a lusus nature of humanity, and her teacher knew not what to make of her. Her sense of re- sponsibility nullified all feeling of curiosity, all desire for entertainment in the exhibition of a nature so different from her own, and her love of sway and fixed ideas of the culture suited to all human beings alike kept her on the alert to check any of her eccentric demonstrations. Her want -of success in calling forth her powers at first bewil- dered, next discouraged, then disgusted her, and year after year she treated her with increasing coldness and dignity. These different feelings she expressed to her  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7097-00000052"/> 102   ZO'E; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. friends and associates, with a few of whom Zoei was a favorite and who saw in her more than appeared to Miss Ingemann's prejudiced eye. These took up her defense warmly, and by injudicious comments in favor of one and against the other, enlarged the breach between them. Then came to her mind the false philosophy which she had somewhere read of, that the Africans were a race cursed by God in early times for the unnatural scoffing of a son at his patriarch father. Next, clustered around it the infidel notions that its degradation was insurmountable; that God intended it for the lowest rank among his people, and mercifully denied it the Caucasian powers; and as these opinions were warmly combated by the majority of her acquaintances, resentment was awakened which re- coiled on her pupil and darkened her to her mental vision more and more, till she became utterly incapacitated from judging her in any point correctly. This result ZoO, with her almost supernatural perceptions, felt in its full force, and it threw her more and more back upon her vivid ima- gination and burning sentiments. It remains to be seen what was the natural effect of this concentration upon herself. Not that she knew distinctly of these speculations, for they were not repeated to her by any one, and if she had ever had a clear consciousness of her distinction of race before she left home, which is doubtful, it had faded from her mind as her soliloquizing about her mother has indi- cated. Her differences of person from the other girls she attributed to a West-India climate, as also her love for the hot summer sun and aversion to the winter's snow and cold. She knew only too well that Miss Ingemnann disliked her, and that she was hurt and offended that she could not make her what she wished, yet she was sensible of no will- ful opposition to her desires and efforts. She studied hard the lessons given her, and seldom dissented from her wishes ostensibly. But there was the perpetual cry of   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPtI.   103 resistance of her nature within to many of the tasks im- posed upon her which would not be appeased. She would rush from her abstract studies into the open air of the garden, which surrounded the house, and clasp the trees with her arms as if they were conscious, sympathizing friends who would rescue her from her thraldom. ShI would throw herself upon the ground by the flower-beds, and brood over the lilies and violets, for she seldom gathered them, and say, 0O, my beautiful angels! they need not say that ye are without life like me, for I feel it in every breath of your fragrance. Ye tell me in that, that ye are sorry for my woe, for Ah, my sweet flowers! ye know well that they are not kind to the little dark-girl as to you; for here in God's beautiful sunshine ye may ever dwell, and be wet by his dew, and sprinkled by his showers and bloom, O, so beautifully in the light of his smile, while I am chained to dark, bewildering words, and mystic crooked characters in the prison-house of my soul's bondage with the fear of frowns and sneers, if I do not love them and make them my own. But O! lily, queen of my heart! they speak not to me as thou dost, when I ask thema whence, why am I and what does our Father wish me to: do. Thy voice even is not clear to me yet in answer to my ceaseless request; but it may be that when I have more and better studied his holy Word, my mind will be pure and still enough to hear distinctly your revealings. So bloom on, my lily and violet, and when your leaves fall and mingle with the dust, and your breaths ascend to heaven to take to themselves more glorious and lovely representations of God's beauty and love, O, then plead with Him when ye are blooming at the foot of his great white throne, to tell me more plainly when, where and how I am to do his holy will! Farewell, my flowers, until I have wrought out my tasks, and then I will come again and seek my reward in the odor of your incense, and the radiance of your sheen.1:  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7097-00000053"/> 10o   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPII.

"It may be breaking the rules to the letter to go and talk to the flowers between nine and twelve in the forenoon, but at any rate my head is clearer and courage greater than before I went out, so my lessons will not suffer by it.

What more can I do for her than I do? I try to explain, and explain mat- ters between her and our teacher, but it is of no use.

He was constantly dissatisfied that his pupil did not finger her piano with more agility and force, but could appreciate but very feebly the occasional bursts of melody which in the simplest manner would gush from her at times, when the clouds would momentarily roll away from her spirit, reveal- ing the glory behind.

"What, my dear lady Disdain, are you yet living?*" SHAKSPEARE. ONE bright morning, Mrs. Korner walked into the study of Mr. Liebenhoff, her brother-in-law, the Lutheran minister, where she found him preparing his next Sun- day's sermon. Her sister, also, with portfolio in hand, was scribbling at a rapid rate, while several sheets of copy were piled up before her. "What a long letter you are writing, Lisbet! Who is to be favored with such an elaborate epistle? "No less a personage than the public, Lina, if it will receive it. I have been intending to tell you that I was turning authoress, but really secrets are such troublesome things to keep, that I'did not like to burden you with mine." "Why have any great privacy about it?" said Mr. Lie- benhoff. 4 I'm tired of secrets; there is sure to be false- hood growing out of them. -They are confided to two or three or more, intimate friends, and from them they are sure to spread, and then comes the questioning and cross- questioning inflicted upon such simple-minded individuals as I am for instance, by one and another of your sex, and it is more than I can stand under; and I am determined to have nothing to do with them any more. My dear, do be frank, and put your own name to your book." The two ladies looked at each other and smiled, for they (1ll4)   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    115 were reminded of some precious little confidences of their own, which they had shared with him, under promises of his everlasting silence, but failing to make him feel their importance and awful magnitude as viewed by themselves, he had repeatedly shocked and discomfited them, by bring- ing them into conversation at exactly the most unpropitious time, as mere matters of course. They were never able to convince him that these denouements were of the least consequence, excepting as it hurt and sometimes offended them, bat as he was very sensitive to their reproofs, he had got to have a nervous dread of anything which squinted in the least towards secrecy;-therefore his remark. "Perhaps I shall; I have not quite made up my mind upon the subject, but at least, until I have nearly completed it, I prefer that my friends should not know it, for quiet- ness is so necessary to the free and propitious working of. my mind, that i do not wish it broken in upon by the curi- osity or observations of any, one.) 6"I am very glad you are writing and I doubt not that you will be successfill. What is the title of your Tale, for that I suppose it isl said her sister. "Yes, and I shall call it ' The Way.' It is to deal with an interesting question of the day, the subject of tyranny; and as you know it is a law of my nature and development to view everything in the light of Religion, it will take its principal tone from that. To the young at least, I hope it will be acceptable, and I shall try to make it as entertaining to them as I can. You shall see extracts from it when you are at leisure, if you would like to." "Thank you, very gladly; but this morning I have run in for a moment, to invite you both to tea. Mrs. Pendle- ton, the newly-arrived American minister's wife, with her two young lady friends, Miss Hale and Miss Ingalls, are going to be with us, and I want you to come and talk En- glish with them.

It is well that you, thanks to your facility in acquiring languages, and that I through my intimacy with Mrs. Stephenson, and my acquaintance with Mr. Phillips, can communicate with them in their mother tongue, as it is all in all to them. Will you come?" "Certainly, we shall be most happy to do so; shall we not, dear?" turning to her husband. "O yes, thank you, Lina. Who else is going to be with you?" said he. c' O, Miss Dahl and Miss Holberg, and the usual set you know, and Miss Ingemann, I suppose, though I must say that I am rather out of conceit -with her, for I really think she treats poor Zoe Carlan very shabbily, who is a great favorite of mine. I can see that her own character is de- teriorating in consequence of her prejudice against her. She is not so successful in her education as with her other pupils, so she dislikes her. I used to think her a'model of a high-toned lady, but I have seen her unjust and un- ladylike in spirit, and even in manner towards the poor child, which has lowered her in my opinion very much."

She has been so retiring, and I have so many demands upon my time, that I have neglected to get into familiar relations with her; but I see she does not look happy. I will send for her to- morrow, and try and win her affections and confidence," said Mrs. Liebenhoff. "  Do, dear,?" said her husband, ",I know she will suit you. She has great delicacy of organization it seems to me, and needs some kind, strong friend to lean upon. She keeps aloof from me very much, and I know her better through Hilda, than in any other way.

Do you think, I was walking in the -glen yesterday, and I heard a tinkling laugh, and who should have waded into the middle of the brook but she; and there she was dashing water all over herself, without the slightest regard to drenching her garments, and when she saw me, instead of running to hide herself and her drip- ping habiliments, she filled the shell which she held in her hand with water, and threw it towards me. She is as in- nocent as a child of five years old, instead of being a young lady past seventeen, but she certainly needs a good deal of taming." C She is Miss Ingemann's pet, and presumes more upon her indulgence than any of the other pupils," said Mrs. Ki'kner; " and she is a most enticing creature, I don't wonder she is fond of her." "She will make smashing work among the beaux, when she comes out into life, but really she ought to have more check put upon her manners," said Mr. Liebenhoff.  The evening came, and with it Mrs. Kirner's guests, Mr. and Mrs. Pendleton, Miss Ingalls, and Miss Hale, all fair specimens of American citizens, who dwell in, and hold a prominent position in New England villages of the highest class, Mrs Liebenhoff was the first comer. "Lina, what sort of people are these Americans? Are they Goths and Vandals, dressed up in magnified French style, without the tact which would tell them when and where not to load on their finery; with great pretensions and many vulgar short comings, or--d 'O no, not so, I will assure you. You will like them because you are accustomed to mingle with all sorts of people, and appreciate nature and spirit. Besides, they have real cultivation.

What can you expect but that they should be prematurely shrewd and knowing, and forceful, and lack a little some of the graces of life? You will enjoy them, for you resemble them. Somehow you have found out the secret of being mighty universal in your sympathies, Lisbet. I have been ready to think at times that you lagged behind in your private ones, but only let the time of need come, and I find that your heart is in -the right place." The guests entered and were soon made to feel at home, by hMrs. Korner's cordial, bright manner and abounding hospitality. "Have you got settled at housekeeping, Mrs. Pendles. ton?' said she. "Yes pretty well. Of course I have not gathered about me all the comforts of my own home. That I should not 'expect so soon."  "No, my friend, and don't look at all for that consumma-  tion," said Theresa Ingalls. "Cooks like Sally and waiters like Richard, ready to run to the ends of the earth for you five times a day, and concoct all imaginable delicacies at your artistic suggestion, do not grow on every bush, much less here in this Lilliput," said she aside to her friend, as Mrs. K!3rner ran to lift up her youngest who had fallen upon his face. "Don't, Theresa, get into hot water with these Danes the first thing, by your criticisms. Do smooth over matters a little, and what you can't, with truth, why, let it go and say nothing," said Jenny Hale, laughing a little but at the same tire looking somewhat anxious for the next remark Theresa would make.   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   119 Why, what now! Is that so very awful! Well, (draw. ing down her mouth) will that-do?'" Mr. Pendleton and Mr. Ko/rner entered. Mrs. Lieben- hoff drew her chair near the former-a thoughtful looking man, quite a contrast in person to his brilliant wife, rather absent in manner, but when roused from his own thoughts, his face lighted up with sympathy and interest, and he bore in a very quiet but just and sensible way his part in the conversation. 4"I have been reading Emerson's Essays to-day," said she; -"do you know your distinguished countryman?" "Not much, personally; but we all know of him of course? He has lectured for us and we always like to hear him." "He has much insight into life, I think; is a true inter- preter of nature from his point of view, and is a pure, high-toned moralist. You have great reason to be con- gratulated for the possession of such a mind in your new country." "Yes; I donkt understand all he writes, but I think he is more practical as he grows older, or at any rate his mind adapts itself to the wants of the times very well. When we incline to run too much into the vein of a material philosophy, he is what we call transcendental; he sits apart and utters his oracles which seem nonsense to some, and infidelity to others, and the distilled truth of the gods to the initiated. When we grow corrupt in our councils and high moral truths need to be sounded abroad, then he is found at hispost, and no one is listened to by the more advanced portion of our people with greater interest than himself. I sometimes think he may be a specimen, or rather an indi- cation of a higher order of beings, which may in future exist among us, but I don't know." "The fault which I find with him is," said she, "that from being so much imbued with classic lore, he is Grecian in the working of his intellect, and the expression of his  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7097-00000061"/> 120   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. feelings, more than Hebrew or rather Christian, which is synonymous with universal. Taking that point of depar- ture more than the New Testament, or at least keeping it in sight too much, not seeing with sufficient clearness that the principles of all literature, science, art, and life culmi- nated in Jesus, that he is the central sun from which is to radiate light, heat and inspiration by which the past is to be truly and satisfactorily read, the' present interpreted and guided, and the future gazed into with clearness of vision and brightness of hope, he loses the proper perspec- tive of truth and speaks of the Vedas, Zoroaster, Confu- cius, and Socrates too much as if they were on a level with our glorified Master and his concentrated, complete, and unadulterated truth." "Yes, I think so. He is in a condition of reaction from Calvinistic superstition, which, perhaps you do not know, stalks about in its grimmest and most unnatural guise in my country, and one of its saddest effects is the warping of our most free and truth-loving minds too far in the direction of a cold rationalism. But Emerson is essentially Christian after all. The Puritan parson was born in him, and he can't help looking like one, and his mind is so fair and his judgment so calm that if a higher truth were pre- sented to him with clearness and simplicity, he would accept it gladly." "Yes, and I would have him utter with manly, fervent, inspiring tones his convictions of the sublime verities of the Christian faith, and his eternal obligation to its inspired Revealer; for it is by going back to first principles, by ever renewing our first love, by confessing from time to time our first faith in our Adorable Leader by word, act, symbol, and ceremony as well as life, that we keep him in sight in in our way through the world, or can hope to be united to him in our triumphal march through the eternal ages." Mrs. Liebenhoff and Mr. Pendleton were sitting aside- during this conversation, and as it paused they heard Mrs.   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    121 Kvrner say, "Well, it is of no use waiting longer for the gentlemen, I will have tea brought in. Young ladies, I was mindful in giving my invitation to you of your proper accompaniments, but they are delinquent, you perceive, which I am sorry to say is not unfrequently the ease in these faltering times. Our knights are getting to be rather unre- liable in social life; the claims of business, and if the truth must be told, the coarser pleasures which exclude us, are. so peremptory." s"It is what we are used to," said Theresa, it in New England. In the first place, our beaux are not to be depended upon very much; and in the second place, there are next to none left to us poor widowed maidens, for they emigrate to California or the western States, as soon as we begin to have some hopes of them, and the few that remain wrap themselves up in selfish old bachelorhood, which is more hopeless, you know, than all the rest." "I am surprised," said Mrs. Liebenhoff; "I supposed that young people in pairs, twin souls, as the cant of the day is, designated for each other by heaven from birth, were the natural products of your virgin soil, and that you were free from the wicked, unnatural conventionalisms which divide such or haply prevent their coming together at all in our country." "You, are greatly mistaken, madam, if you think we are thus unsophisticated," said Miss Hale; " we are getting to be apt imitators of Europeans in this regard. Our young gents and ladies, too, are very old in the ways of the world, I can assure you." "Should you like a rapid sketch of our young American gentleman of the present day?" said Theresa. "Nothing better," said Mrs. Korner; ' pray give us one."

"The provokingly worthy class, who are more trying than any other; for you cannot help it, and they really deserve scolding at, and yet they are just good enough to give one compunctious visitings for saying a word against them. They rise early in the morning, say their prayers, I have not the least doubt, eat a temperate breakfast, go to their business like clock-work, never make a mistake in life or manners, can be trusted with untold treasures in any shape or form, are very agreeable, gentlemanly, intel- ligent companions when they vouchsafe their presence in our midst, but dear me! any machines could be made to do as much, you know. What they want is life, moral enthu- siasm, and what is to our purpose especially-devotion to us. You understand?" "That is what I complain of in some of my gentlemen friends," said Mrs. Korner. "Do they take young ladies to ride and skulk out of town through the back streets, lest they should be suspected of some tender designs upon them before they are sure of success?" said Jenny, " and hover round them, weighing every look and word to see if it will do to risk an offer; and when impatient at such timidity, and disgusted at such want of valor, our faces express the feeling that cannot but be roused--' well, if you are so cool and calculating   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    123 as all that, a fig for such love.

"In the third place, there are ' the young elect, who have got beyond ritual,' who are too far advanced to value the Bible much, too enlightened for the church, (having supped that orange, as one of their number profanely said,) but cry aloud and spare not in literary clubs, anti-slavery, odd-fellow, free discussion and temperance societies, are the special champions and abettors of the emancipated ladies, and in short, thrust a finger into every reform pie that the public concoct.

But no, Narcissus-like, they fall in love with themselves, and their conversation is interlarded accordingly with a very egotistical letter of the alphabet. These worship in the woods, poetize in a weakly way, have interesting fits of absent-mindedness, affect a few high-strung authors and fewer friends, paint pictures sans soul, sans life, sans fit- ness for anything but a chimney board, are musical in a slender, hypercritical style, fall in love in a dilettante way, with some different fair one every summer's vacation, and, in short, with talents and acquirements which they use just enough to make you regret that they have any to cover thus with a bushel, are nobody, nowhere, and nothing at all.

Verily, the times are out of joint, when such are the caressed, admired and gazed-up to as the geniuses and seers of this nineteenth century.

"Yes, there is young America par excellenwe, Sam, as we call him now-a-days, often rude, extravagant, ostenta- tious, impulsive, but generous, bold, energetic, chivalrous, romantic, very faulty, sometimes very wicked, but with great capabilities.

At that moment Miss Ingemann and other ladies entered the room, and after the introduction, Mrs. Pendleton crossed over to where Theresa was sitting. "Now, ladies, I beg you not to believe everything which this satirical young friend of mine has said about our American gentlemen. I know a great many of them well." "Excuse me for interrupting you," said Miss Hale, "but Mrs. Pendleton is not a disinterested umpire between us, for, as you perceive, she is so fascinating as to withdraw the attentions which should be rightly ours (being in most need of them) to herself. She has nothing to complain of, while we are set aside just enough to make us cool and impartial judges. I would not insinuate any conscious treachery, but she and her house and garden have such a hospitable, taking way with them as quite to eclipse any humble pretensions of our own." "Now is not that ungrateful," said Mrs. Pendleton, "when my aims and efforts in placing myself, my house, and last, but by no means least, my studious husband and quiet-loving daughter at your disposal so much, is just to advance your interests and happiness. Shame on you!  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7097-00000064"/> 126   ZOE"; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. And now I will tell the whole truth as a proper retribution for such thanklessness." "May I be resigned," said Theresa, casting up her eyes, "for I know well that there is no mercy to be expected from you, when your war-horse snuffs the battle from afar."  "Now," said Mrs. Pendleton, for all moral, religious, selfishy sentimental delinquencies, and I own that they have a plenty, I am not going to offer any excuse, for if people have the New Testament, with its faultless precepts and perfect example, that is sufficient; there is no reason that they should be shipwrecked upon these sands. But so far as their want of gallantry and devotion to the sex is concerned, there is some excuse, on account of their short- comings in character and mistakes of education. The fault of the present day, with our best women, is, that the intellect is cultivated unduly at the expense of the health, practical ability, and tenderness, grace and beauty of char- acter. In short, we have sharpened understandings, in- stead of beautiful, loving souls; acute critics in place of sweet Charities, striving with their soft mantles to cover the deformities they cannot remove; eager, squinting specula- tists, instead of the strong-eyed Faiths, who pierce the heavens and become inspired at the visions that dawn on them as they gaze; fierce satirists, and confident denunci ators and not the bright, beaming, inspiring Hopes, that ever smile and point upwards, through the thickest gloom and discouragements. Now, you young ladies, must be less like the heathen goddesses, somewhat faded and passe and more like the Celestials of our Master's spiritual dispensa- tion before your age of triumph begins. You must quaff the elixir of life from the well which he opens for every one who desires it, and then you will not be growing old at twenty, complaining that the illusions of life are vanishing, leaving nothing but a void; that the bloom is rubbed off from the peach, and that life is exhausted of its sweetness   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   127 and exhilaration, but it will never cease to be full, rich and harmonious and will irradiate your whole inward and out- ward being, and then you will have no lack of adorers," "Mrs. Pendleton, that is all very fine; but I ask you the plain question, if we are not now too good for any young gentlemen-of our village, for instance? Don't ask us to get any farther in advance of them. They would lose sight of us altogether." "No, not if you advance in the right way, rising into the ether like Beatrice, but ever casting a gentle, holy, winning glance behind. Her influence drew her lover upward, higher and ever higher, and so should yours. As it is, I grant you excite admiration at a distance; but, dear me! you have so much more the spirit of carping and ridicule than of love and forbearance, and generous appreciation of the inner spirit of humanity, when divested of some of the ornaments of life, that the men are afraid of you, and no wonder! I am, too. I am always on the look out for some prick of your stiletto-intellect, sharpened by ever- lasting reading and study of modern literature, and Ger- man philosophy and mathematics, to the exclusion of nature and your Bible, for the young men do not alone neglect it." , Well, Jenny, I suppose we must reform them. Have you any spare hair-cloth for vests for us, Mrs. Pendleton, or peas to fill our shoes with? If you have, please leave them at my door to-night when you retire, for I shall com- mence my humiliation forthwith. That floating, alluring Beatrice quite takes my fancy. I shall practice ascension from this time forward-that is, after a few turns with the hair-cloth and peas," said Theresa. Miss Ingemann sat by while this conversation was going on in pretty loud, animated tones, as is a common custom with the excitable American women, and thought it was rather free talk, especially for young ladies. Mrs. Pendle- ton's loud tones, with her occasional resounding laugh, at  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7097-00000065"/> 128   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. length quite disgusted her, and when in a very audible whisper the latter lady asked Mrs. Korner, with a little mischief in the expression of her face, if she (Miss Inge- mann) was not a countess, it was altogether too much for her dignity to bear with its usual imperturbableness, and her tip wore a very scornful expression. Afterward, Theresa was speaking with great affection of her mother and of her father's lively interest in life and its. events, though advanced in years. 1"Why did they not accompany you?" said Mrs. Korner. "My mother is too precious goods to be toted away here," said she, '" and the last time I went to Niagara with my honored papa, he bothered me so by anxiously watch- ing me, while I stood at the end of the cars to look out upon the scenery, that I told him I should leave him at home the next journey I took; so I was as good as my word, you see.' This was altogether too much for Miss Ingemann, who rose to go, excusing herself in a cold, lady-like way to Mrs. KIiorner for retiring so early, and only bowed very stiffly to the strangers as she left the room. Theresa saw that her doom was sealed with at least one member of good society in Copenhagen, and turned to Mrs. Liebenhoff. That lady sat very quietly, making her observations. Feeling nervous at first, as Miss Ingemann began to manifest displeasure, she made one or two attempts to mediate between their understandings, but concluded on the whole, it was of no use, so resigned herself to the enjoyment of the scene. "Have I done or said anything so very shocking?" said Theresa. O no, certainly not! I enjoy it and hope for a better acquaintance. I like to see individuality and spirit. I will suggest to you, however, that as you are a stranger, and of course wish to conciliate good-will and the favorable opinion of those whom you are to dwell among for a time,   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIIUMPH.     129 that without losing these, a delicate sympathy and tact will suggest when you encroach too much on our favorite modes of speech and action. But you will acquire that by experience. We can all learn of each other, you know." "Thank you! You are a woman of good sense, and I hope you will let me come and see you." "Most certainly," said she; " do so often. The parson- age has open doors for all, and especially for those after my own heart, as I see you are, with some comparatively trifling reservations. I want my husband to know you all." "Where is Mr. Liebenhoff all this time, Lisbet? I hoped he would come with you." 6"O, at the church! the failing, tottering, gasping church! There is another adjourned meeting to-night to talk over whether the old one shall be repaired or a new one built; and he has gone to say a few encouraging words upon the latter plan." "Do the gentlemen have adjourned meetings in Den- mark as well as in America? How provokingly alike people are all over Christendom! I did hope' that three thousand miles would transport me to some rarities in cha- racter and manners, but it is very much the same old story I see, with the exception of a few unimportant exteriors. O for a little novelty in this humdrum lower sphere!" said Theresa. "Yes," said Mrs. Liebenhoff, " adjourned meetings, in which people dole over the difficulty of a little self-sacri- fice and discourage each other into doing nothing and being less, if possible, in our Lord's kingdom. They seem to be thought the legitimate substitutes for Christian inte- rest, a prompt submission to the requisitions of our glorious faith, and zeal in advancing it among men, so they meet again and again to tell each other how little they will give for his cause, and adjourn to withdraw mayhap their' intended  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7097-00000066"/> 130  ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. pittance, because forsooth another gives less than he ought or than he supposed he would for the same object." "Yes, that is the way. What is to be done in such a state of things?" said Mrs. Pendleton. "What each one thinks right, my dear madam," said Mrs. Liebenhoff; "I1 know what I am going to do." When all equipped to go home, and while making their prolonged adieux to Mrs. KJrner, who the strangers said seemed to them like an old friend, they met Mr. Liebenhoff upon the steps. He exchanged a few words with the company, and then taking his wife's arm within his, walked homewards with her.   "Is Saul also among the prophets?" HEBREW PROVERB. s WB'EAU. sort of a meeting did you have?" said Mrs. Liebenhoff, as they entered their dwelling. "A pretty discouraging one! Out of a multitude to whom notices were sent, only a handfill were present, and the conclusion is, that it is impossible to build." "I see no reason why; surely it is not for want of means, prosperous and abundantly rich as they are. They have no good excuse, but their backwardness to engage in the work is simply a want of interest in their religious faith, and a low style of character, which is the natural consequence." "Of course," said he, "but how to rouse them to a higher life is the question? O, if men would not look upon everything which they do for Christianity, which has done so much and would do everything for them if they would receive it in its fullness, in the light of a hard sacri- fice, as a charity which they may or may not bestow; but as they make their homes graceful and beautiful for their comfort, the satisfaction of their tastes and the repose of their hearts, so should they with joy and thanksgiving, as if from a glad necessity of their nature lay the foundation stones of their temple of worship, which shall be to them the home of their souls, the altar from which shall arise their purest hopes, desires, and aspirations, and where (131)  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7097-00000067"/> 132  ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. Heaven shall pour upon them its richest treasures of for giveness, consolation and love." "Yes," said Mrs. Liebenhoff, ' but that is a point far beyond ,them as yet; not but that there are many, many excellent persons in our parish, and I love them for what they are, and still more for what I see lying wrapped up within them unused. But they are as yet in the beggarly elements of a material philosophy and life, quick to discern the coarser characteristics of intellectual power, ready to sympathize with the subordinate wants of the moral and physical man, and that to be sure is a good deal, showing an awakening mind, and some sense of obligation, but of tile higher spiritual functions of the soul, its close com- munion with the Infinite, its development into a complete, beautiful and harmonious whole, through obedience to the laws of its being, as taught by the Christ, resulting in the glad liberty, strength of will and all-conquering might of its varied powers, they seem as yet not cognizant. And to one, who step by step has toiled up the way to this Pisgah height of contemplation and glad experience as you have, their life seems narrow and groping, and the very air is heavy and dim with the lack of this celestial electricity." "But how shall I inspire them with this higher life? I am getting discouraged, and really feel that I am not fitted to be their pastor, Lisbet." "And are you impatient for the world's idol, success?" "Not vulgar success; but why may I not see that I am doing something, and not week after week, be weighed down with this feeling of responsibility, uncheered by tokens that my prayers, labors and unceasing thought for them are not like water spilled upon the ground!" "O, thou of little faith! but such feelings come from a constitutional deficiency of what is a large element of my nature, hope, never dying, but ever springing, triumphant Hope, and it whispers to me now, that disjointed, freezing,   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    133 unfaithful, unsympathizing as a society, the members (each one of whom individually, is a kind, good friend to us,) are, that when the new and inspiring word is spoken to them, they will be all the more ready for their lack of present organization and order to combine into a living body of-not pure, individual Christians merely, but into the true, free, and glorious embodiment through his ap- pointed church, of the universal and heaven-inspired spirit of our Lord." "You are enthusiastic, my wife!" "Less so than you are blamably faithless, at this mo- ment. But cheer up; don't think of the ugly, falling ruin of a church. And let the people go to perdition, I say, where they seem to tend so evidently." "My dear, don't be wicked." "I am not wicked. I don't wish them there, but if you like it better, I will state the matter as a plain fact. They are already there. Such deadness is perdition; the very dreariest of the mansions of the under-world, in which people grope in darkness, and wander about dead to all the higher and more inspiring attributes of their being, while at the same time, they hug themselves with self- satisfaction for their cool wisdom and acute intellectualism which saves them from the quivering sensibilities, the flights of an imagination which abides not in their harsh, frigid councils, and the a'wakened hopes which are ever on the wing, soaring higher and higher towards the Infinite Good." "Yes, and to bring them into this state," said he, " they must do something for themselves; and the first and sim- plest and most obvious thing is for them to unite to build a church. A common interest in this most worthy and neces- sary object may be an entering wedge to a higher and bet- ter communion between them. But somehow I have not leadership enough to marshal them into working order." "I am glad you have not, for harsh guardianship, coarse  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7097-00000068"/> 134   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. generalship we have had enough of in Christendom. Let us, at this late day, come to the full knowledge of the higher spirit of our Lord, whose kingdom is one of liberty of action and equal responsibility for all, in proportion to each one's powers, opportunities and means, and that the pastor is but the teacher, inspirer, and guide of his flock, pointing to the living pastures of perennial truth, the sunny paradise of affection and high and pure sympathy; or perchance, the brave, disinterested and faithful shepherd who shall venture into the wilderness after the lost ones and bring them forth redeemed and penitent, for others of the fold to rejoice over with him, and protect and bless them so that they will not desire to wander from it again. Ministers now-a-days seem to feel that the salvation of every soul in their parish depends upon them though there are so many other means of enlightenment and guidance. While it is so, you may be sure the people will drag upon them with their full weight, it is so much easier in idea to be carried into heaven like a babe in one's bosom than to struggle upwards into it, step by step, like a true disciple of Jesus. Unfold your arms then, let them hang down- wards their full length that they bear up no such lazy souls, and wear no robe, as friend Geiser would say, to which the unfaithful may cling and thus be smuggled into the courts above; for if they can show no title but such selfish dependence upon their wasting, yet faithful, untiring friend, they will surely be banished thence by their judge and yours." "Well, I hope all will come right; I feel that if I could be the instrument of rousing them-not a few of the rich and mature in years and experience merely, but each and all, young men and maidens, the poor and the struggling to do this holy work, as an expression of their faith in, and love for God and their Saviour, that I should be satisfied to with- draw and leave them to the councils of one who could bet- ter express for them their wants and aspirations."   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    135 I' Heaven knows who it would be or whether they have any. But yes, they cannot be devoid of them as I know they are real men and women, and not phantoms, most certainly they are too prone to earth for that, and they seem outwardly to possess all the characteristics of human be- ings. Yes-O yes, certainly they must be human, for, as I before said, they are our dear kind friends in private life; but now I have it, they are under the spell of some wicked genius, who, the moment that the great words- God, Christ, Religion, the Soul, the Bible, are uttered as to a society, are changed into 'spirits of the vasty deep,. whose senses are so deadened by the element in which they are condemned to live that they hear not, and therefore come- not up, as a matter of course, when the sweet music of your heavenly piety vibrates upon the air. They need the thunder, and lightning, and earthquake, those coarser ministers of God's dispensation to men to reach them in their low estate. They are the stern law, and let it rule them if they would have its for not even the refreshing rain which follows the war of the elements, which is like wisdom to men's minds, can they recognize, much, much less the celestial dew, which is his love, dis- tilled in this most gentle and ethereal form. Such is the utterance of Christian truth by you in your most natural and legitimate way, for to this elevation have your faith and obedience lifted you. Had you stopped short in the first, the Xantippe plane, you would be called great; for in this is the world chiefly, and that of course is mighty in its eyes which expresses themselves in a slightly ideal form, but if ever you were in that, it was in the pre-existent state if there was one, but not in this. You have climbed up through the second period, and the benign spirit of Wisdom has become one with you, and men see her not because she stalks not about nor cries in the streets. But hand in hand with Love, the heavenly pair modestly wait upon you and point you ever to 'the well undefiled' of crystal Truth,  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7097-00000069"/> 136  ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. and you draw from it and dispense to those who are so many fathoms below you, that so few of its drops penetrate to their souls that they are not impressed." "What a rhapsody! but I shall not dispute you. What husband loves not to be praised and idealized by his wife! You are my parish, my church, my-" "Thank you for nothing. I'l be neither, I've long been jealous of both, and now you shall set them aside and admire and be at leisure, and make love to me in a more individual manner, and not as a necessary part of this provoking, stupid parish. Do you know that all this heart-ache and these disappointed hopes come from your false, unnatural notion of living for humanity and not for me?" , My dear Lisbet, what do you mean? Are you turning tempter to warp me from the high duty to which I early dedicated my life? God first, and humanity next, has always been my motto. Then come other claims; the me must have the next share, else how could I accomplish the first, and then my own loved wife, and have I been remiss towards you, dearest?" "Now you doubtless expect, after my rhapsody as you call it upon you and your preaching, that I shall most duti- fully answer, 'O no, my liege lord and anointed husband! I am only too thankful for the droppings from the sanctuary of your divided heart. Shiver it into as many fragments as your swollen sense of responsibility sees fit; I receive the smallest iota of it with the most gentle and satisfied sub- mission.' But no! I say again, I subscribe to no such falsehood of creed or unfaithfulness of life. You are quite in the wrong about this matter. My instincts have always rebelled against my position in your life's category of interests, and now my whole nature is up in arms to contend against it. I have spelled it all out and now I amn going to give you a sermon from these words of your brother divine slightly paraphrased; 'God has hid away the   ZOE; OR. THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   137 human soul in a woman's form that in finding it we may rediscover our alienated and forgotten nature and rejoice over the one that was lost more than the ninety and nine who went not astray.'" "What do you mean, my love?" "Only that you are a tyrant and a hypocrite and a - no wonder you stare, my archangel, who, all the women pro- test, is the most beautiful, the most amiable, the most agreeable, the most saintly, in short the most immaculate of all mankind on this floating globe, and that I am the most fortunate, the most blessed, the most ought-to-be-lhank- ful little woman, who is all but drowned in the ocean of her husband's perfection! Pshaw! did they not serve old Aristides right, whom all fools surnamed 'The Just?' 1 wish I had been at Athens to throw in my shell of ostra- cism with that single wise man who had got tired of hear- ing him perpetually praised. He had doubtless been to his wife and asked her how he was at home, and she had told him some truths about him. Banish him, I say, and that crabbed old Socrates, parading round with his impu- dent questions and prosy old saws. Xantippe knew how much they were worth, and she scolded him as he deserved. I wish she had boxed his ears when she was about it, hard enough for the tingling to come down the ages through every husband's ears, seeing that most of us are restrained by the idea that it is not ladylike to perform the deed, from doing that same thing. Give him the hemlock, I say-the hard, quizzing, conceited, tyrannical husband, who wickedly married for the very worst reason that he could. O thou, so called god, Esculapius! to whom the weak, mistaken, short- sighted man sacrificed a cock after all his pretended advance before the age, why could ye not have gone to the rescue of that much injured and scandalized Xantippe- wife of his I will not again insult her by calling her- and given her of your skill to mingle with her libation some potion to soften his hard understanding for a true 12  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7097-00000070"/> 138   ZOE ; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. idea of her to penetrate, that through his, thus enlightened mind, there might flow into his heart a pittance at least of the love which was her right, but which his philosophico, coldly moralistico, anything but tenderly spiritualistico nature denied her! O Xantippe! most injured, mjost to- be compassionated woman! here I erect a statue to perpe- tuate your wrongs, and thy delinquent husband shall kneel for thy pardon for his injustice and tyranny towards thee, and as thou wert a woman, and in that word dwells the very soul of forgiveness, when thou seest him thus humili- ated and repentant, thou wilt raise him even to a higher level than thyself, that then, without injury to thy delicate sense of right and truth, thou mayst revere, as thy nature ever craves to do, him who when humble and tender, and not until then, becomes truly exalted! And so endeth the first head of-my sermon; the moral of which is, that as your wife is a part of humanity, and God said when you married her that you should forsake father and mother and cleave unto her, saying nothing about parish and church, as you see; next to your own culture and salvation are you to devote yourself to her happiness and welfare, and in this way only can you twain become truly and emphati- cally one, and thereby be in harmony with God and his beautiful universe." '"Well, my dear, what am I to do? kneel for forgiveness or-- "Wait, until I have finished my sermon. Pretty well too, for a minister, to speak in meeting! But I must ask you, however, if that is not well done? Now that is what the people would call great. Why can you not preach so to them? I am sure they deserve it enough." "I will exchange with you the next Sunday, and you may add a little different collar and wristhands, as we preachers say to an old sermon, and give it to them hot and strong." "Well then, I must go on to the secondly, and by way   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    139 of rehearsal, will imagine myself in church. And seeing that I wandered from my subject, (' an uncommon event for a woman;' said Mr. Liebenhoff,) on account of the imperfect education which tyrant man awards to her, there- by condemning her to lamentable scatter-wittedness, I will again return to the forcible text: 'God has hidden away the human soul in a womams form, etc.' And, my breth- ren, as she, the least sinful portion of society, through your generous regard for her moral and spiritual welfare, and especially that she might become a meet, obedient and adoring subject of her lord and master, has by means of books, pictures, conversation and the ministration of the word applied especially to her, as also by the laws and in- stitutions of our country been happily reduced to a very submissive condition; I will address my discourse entirely to you, hoping that you will be equally docile in the re- ception of this great truth, as she has been in listening to the homilies daily afforded her by your disinterested sex." "You are getting personal, my dear! They will tell you, as they did me, that you will break up the society." "The same answer is not yet worn out, " let it break up then, if it is made of so flimsy materials." "And, first, I need not dwell upon this basis of all reli- gions, the great and sacred idea of a Supreme, Intelligent and Parental Spirit, except to remind you that as of old it was reiterated again and again, that it dwelt not in idols made of wood and stone, in either the human or animal form, so neither does it any more, when converted into banks, ware- houses, or any of the forms into which business is trans- acted or money made, nor even in any great man, whether Pope, Emperor, Noble, or Genius. Therefore I will pass on to the next clause." "Secondly, Hidden, etc. A very significant word, my hearers, informing you of what you have not sufficiently considered, that a woman may possess more than what you with your pre-occupied attention and narrow judgment  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7097-00000071"/> "O   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. of her duty and destiny had thought possible or necessary, and therefore indicating that she was created for some wider and higher purpose than simply to be the minister to your pleasure or honor, or even comfort and solace under your heavy labors and responsibilities in the great cause of doing good. For, my brethren of the priestly order! of whom I see some among you, did it never occur to you that while you are dispensing the bread of life to multitudes of souls outside of your homes, and being the sympathizers, guides, and chief laborers of society in matters pertaining to their moral and religious welfare, indeed their willing drudges and servants of all work, from the chosen one of expounding to them the Holy Word and leading them onward to the celestial gate, to every imagin- able secular errand which they may impose upon you; did it never occur to you, I say, that while spreading your sympathies over creation, and calling upon her likewise to keep even pace with yourself, that her Innermost in the meantime either remained unawakened and sterile, or else became preternaturally excited without being justly re- sponded to by you who have all humanity to cater for? She therefore goes moaning and shrieking through life till her intense and bitter cry for the natural and necessary food of her being has caused even the angels, who dwell in the nearer presence of God, to stand aghast at her cry." "A pungent discourse! Spare me, I beg," said Mr. Liebenhoff. O don't take it to yourself! Pass it to your fellow- hearers as is the usual custom." 4 Thirdly; 'The human soul in a woman's form.' My brethren, we feel no disposition to deny you the possession of intellectual strength; that element which is sometimes called talent, that power of fixing the attention upon truth, of holding it up as if it were a crystal before the mind's eye; viewing it on every side deliberately and patiently, until you have drawn from it all its possible deductions.   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    141 Nor do I deny you the practical power of subduing to your dominion all the ruder forces of nature and making them subservient to the well-being of man. But to the feminine soul, my hearers, must be awarded par eminence, the pos- session of genius, that divine inspiration, which enables her at a glance to pierce to the very heart of the truths which, by diligence and hard labor, ye slowly attain unto; and though from time to time, this faculty may show itself in full blaze in your sex, it is because that they are invested in a larger degree than is common with the feminine ele- ment. But the woman's soul, when nurtured by holy love, nourished by truth, led and imbosomed by nature, made strong and faithful and tender by obedience to the Christ, and ever bathed and invigorated, and inspired by com- munion with the Infinite, stands forth with no peer, call me not profane, but I repeat, with no peer, as the most glorious and beautiful representative of God in the world; for through her plastic, docile, and confiding nature, He is able to reveal, if not with more clearness, yet with more graceful and winning beauty, than through the more self-sufficient and unyielding man, his designs in the development of the races. And when, as the mother of infant humanity, she moves among you, mild, tender, and gracious, do jus- tice to your better nature and give her your tenderest ven- eration; for even the angels clasp their hands and gaze reverently upon her and say: See how, under her loving care, the bud of immortality will bloom sweetly and fairly until it is garnered with us into the paradise of our God!" "Any more, my dear? for I am sorry to say that I grow sleepy." "You always do when you don't preach yourself, and some say that you are a little drowsy then, you know; so you must bear with my first imperfect effort. Courage! I have got fully half through, I do believe." "Fourthly; 'That in finding it we may re-discover our alienated, and forgotten nature.' Upon this head it is  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7097-00000072"/> "2   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. necessary to say but few words; for it is very evident that man cannot lose sight of the divine in one large 'portion of creation, and that so important a part as its better half, and blasphemously imagine that he is to appropriate its precious wealth to his trifling or injurious tastes, or at best to his selfish consolation, encouragement, and use, without fearful deterioration and loss. For all God's children rise or remain in limbo, or fall together through the mysterious sympathy which binds them in unity; and when one suffers physically, intellectually, or spiritually, all creation groans aid agonizes with it. Therefore, my brethren, listen to this, my asseveration, ponder it and let it sink deep into your hearts, and thenceforward have a radical, perceptible, and most potent influence over your principles, sentiments, characters, institutions and laws, that woman has an indi- vidual, independent, and responsible soul, subject only to the God who created it, worthy of the highest, broadest, and most delicate culture which may be brought from every part of the universe, to aid in its perfect and harmonious development. And by means of this essential and heaven- ordered work you will arrive, my poor, ignorant, and pur- blind brethren, at this very evident and joy-inspiring truth, written upon your own natures it is true, and repeatedly revealed more distinctly all through the six thousand years of the world's existence, but which, lacking the clear glance of her genius, and still more, her obedient will, you are yet in doubt of, or practically, at least, deny altogether that you also are the possessors of the same great gift which I here announce in the loudest tones awarded to me, that man as well as woman has an immortal soul. "Fifthly; 'And rejoice more over it than over the ninety and nine," etc. Yes, my brethren, when this glad truth is once and forever established, then will the world begin to stride with long steps in the march of advancement.

"Pretty good for a first attempt! You will improve if you practice." O!

M V own Zoe, how neatly you are dressed and how sweetly you look," said Hilda one afternoon, as she entered their apartment just as the former had completed her toilet; "are you going out?" "Yes, to my dear Mrs. Liebenhoff's; she told me to come and see her wtvenever I liked to, and that I might run up directly into her room, and if she were gone out I might make myself at home among her books and mnedal- lions and pictures until she returned; and J know she' meant every word she said, for I can tell t The true soul very well, Without book or bell." "And it makes you happy, don't it, love? Well, I am glad you have found another mate to rest your sad eyes upon once in a while; for mine, I well know, are such dancing, twinkling orbs that yours don't get from them much of the repose they plead for. I shall not be at all jealous of the quiet parsoness. She will be a nice little cushion for you to lean against; but when you want life, enthusiasm, and love of the strong order you will come back to me." "You don't know Mrs. Liebenboff, Hilda, for-" (144 )   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   145 "Bless me! don't fire up in that way for a trifle, for I give you fair warning, my Titania, that be duped as you may, you shall not lead me to believe there is a beauty or a heroine of romance in that ordinary little face and figure. Fall in love with her as much as you please and rhapsodize her high qualities, I see nothing in her but a nice little minister's wife, very quiet under the heavenly influence of my dearly beloved. friend, her husband, who is a great deal too handsome and interesting and learned and every- thing else for her mediocre passivity. (She takes both her hands and lifts Zoe's face towards her own.) I see I have swept you into the indignant mood and objective case, to be governed by none of my analysis of her style, type, sentiment, or covering. But, my precious pet of a bru- nette with the sweeping, silken eyelashes, and the raven- winged hair, how pretty and fresh she looks!" and she stooped and kissed her forehead. "Yes, I am trying to save my soul by what seems a prime article of Miss Ingemann's creed--a clean white skirt every other day, faultless gloves, and gossamer hose. It is rather a hard way of climbing up into the third heaven of her affections; 1 have very little faith that I shall suc- ceed, for so far it is scrambling up two steps to fall plump down twenty, as I did to-day." "Why how?" said Hilda, looking anxious. "I thought you were getting rapidly into' her good graces for the last fortnight. Do tell me what has happened." "Well, my best Hilda, after your remarks about mny dress and habits, I determined to make an effort to be very orderly and proper, and as papa about that time sent me some money, I purchased some necessary articles of appa- rel so as to be as new all over as that figure in the shop- window up town, who every morning as she turns by clockwork, seems to say with a smirk, ' See how handsome I am, please to copy me and look as stiff and unhuman as I do.'" 13  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7097-00000074"/> "6   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. "That you intend for me, because my dress stands out so full to-day, but this hair-cloth will yield in time. I don't want to look like a Grecian statue, you know, which is pretty in a book, or in a gallery of the fine arts, but not in  life, it has such a draggled appearance." "I know, I have made no complaint. The greatest in- convenience of it is, that one has to circumnavigate the globe to get around you, which seems a waste of time and steps you know, when one goes for a glass of water or a pocket handkerchief; but that is not to the purpose. To return-" "I could not afford to have so much washing done, so I thought I would do some of it myself before the family rose in the morning, and I asked Annette, the cook, if she would be so kind as to allow me to do so. She is very good you know, and she told me that as I was not strong, that she would do it for me; but I could not consent to that, because she has to work so hard. So I told her we would change, if she pleased; I would make her breakfast cakes and she might be my laundress." "And those nice muffins, and fritters, and other goodies were yours then'? I wondered that Annette's genius should flower all at once in the culinary line, for she is wanting in skill usually. But how did you learn, pray?" 9 "It requires nothing but common sense, care, patience, and a cook-book to make good cakes, and if one has a de- licate sense of taste and smell, it is all in one's favor. "Affairs went on very smoothly for some time; I had a nice, funny hour with Annette in the kitchen-yard with the  fresh morning air blowing upon me, and her to crack jokes with, and to pet me as nobody does, in this cold north world but you, Hilda, and I shone out like the sun in my freshness and cleanliness as you so often tell me now-a- days." "And have you smoothed down your hair with the sad- iron, my roly-poly, or what has come over your ebony   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    147 locks to quell them to such becoming obedience? They really look like smooth and dutiful Christians, and not like Pagan fury-emblems, darting at one from every point, as they used to do.' 6"Don't you see this tamarind seed band, which my own devoted, loving, ever-thoughtful mamma, daughter of the sun and southern cross, sister of the trade-winds, and wife of the earthquake of the tropics sent me by the last ship? That is the Delilah which has subdued them to such docility, my friend, nothing else would have had 'such power."             "Save me from its magical influence," said Hilda, throwing up her hands and starting back with affected -terror; " you were such a witch before, that I had thoughts of getting Mr. Liebenhoff to bring his Bible and prayer- book and attempt to lay you. But now, I am afraid you are beyond the power of them all." 6"The Bible! that is my wand, my horoscope, my talis- man as you ought to know by this time," said Zoe, taking a small copy of a Testament from her pocket and pressing it to her breast, and looking upwards. "Lay me, do you say? it rather carries me to the heaven of heavens, where I ever, ever thirst to be dwelling.'"And she remained rapt for a moment. Hilda looked on with a mingled expression of awe, anxiety and fun. The latter prevailing, she touched Zoe's chin with her fan, saying, c"Please to descend to the his- tory of batter-cakes and clean hose, for you left them both in limbo, and it is but common justice to release them." "Well, as I was saying, matters went on very well until yesterday morning, when I discovered by Miss Ingemann's conversation in an adjoining room, that she had learned from Annette all about our bargain. She was not angry, but on the contrary, I caught enough of her conversation, (for I was taking my music lesson, and had to be a listener against my will,) to know that she thought she had found  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7097-00000075"/> "8   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. out what I was fit for, and that it was a pity to spoil a good cook by laboring so hard to teach me the studies and ac- complishments of a lady, and that she was goingto encourage my becoming an adept in the business, by permitting me to spend more than my usual two hours a week in household occupations. Then at dinner, (you were away and did not hear it,) she smiled upon me most graciously, and praised in an undue manner, some tarts which I had made; and the tea-cake last evening, and in short made me feel so all over like a little pastry-cook and nothing else, that I was angry, mortified and overwhelmed with confusion." "You should not be so sensitive, child! Miss Ingemann meant to be kind to you then, why could you not love her for it instead of feeling so badly about it?" "It is the last time she will be kind, I think, even in that way," said Zoe; "for this morning as I wished my  white Josey to be clean to wear this afternoon, I went into the kitchen again, and while Annette was doing it up, I  made a 'Charlotte Russe' for dessert, and thinking over my mortification, I forgot some of the ingredients, and not having my wits about me, I had no skill, and such a mess as I prepared was a sorry sight to behold. Miss Ingemann ordered it away from the dining-room before the family assembled and cast a glance at me, as much as to say,  'You spiteful creature! you did this purposely,' and I verily believe she thinks I did, in revenge for her praising me, for she saw that I was not pleased when she did so." "O no, darling! she can't be so unreasonable. But do let her praise you, Zoe, even for such things. I like the article so well that I shall never quarrel with it, not even with downright flattery if it is laid on ever so thick. I flourish under it like a green bay tree, you see. To-be-sure, if it were not for my adorable saint, Zoi, to whom I ever kneel and look up to, as my patroness and example, I know I should be spoiled, but with her image ever in my heart to shield   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   149 me from evil, I gather in the good gifts of this wicked world and make the most of them." "O Hilda! I wish I were good for anything for your sake, but I am not; and if I ever for a brief hour forget it, such praises and such cutting rebukes, as Miss Ingemann gives me, bring the sad truth back in full force and utterly discourage me. O! what am I fit for in such a world as this, where everybody seems strong and happy and at home but me?" and she leaned her head dejectedly on her hand. 4 Come, my willow, let me tie upon your topmost bough this rosebud of a hat, which will brighten up your drooping pensiveness a little. There, puff! (fanning her with force and at the same time blowing upon her), away, flutter into the arms of your paragon friend, the Liebenhoff feminine. You are welcome to her if you leave me my 'Aladdin,' my 'Correggio,' my spiritual 'Frithiof Saga, ' the Minister of the children of the Holy Supper,' the Liebenhoff mascu- line. I wonder you do not fall down before him; he really looks so much like the Christ that hangs there before us." "Hilda!" said Zoe. "My dear, don't suppose I confound the conception of some, I have no doubt, very human artist with our Saviour himself. It is not wicked to speak so of his work, espe- cially if I do it with a very sorrowful face, is it? my apostle, (drawing down her features). Good-by, I will come at twilight and walk home with you." "I don't like to hear such trifling reference to anything connected with our Lord; but good-by, I will wait for you." (Hilda alone.) "The shadows deepen around her when I had flattered myself they were clearing away a little. What is to be done now? I am tired of being a 'medium' between heaven in the shape of Zoel, and the world in Miss Inge- mann and people in general. Our dear Lord must see  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7097-00000076"/> 150  ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. something more of good in me than I have ever been able to discover, to give this precious little soul- so much into my keeping so far as to shield her from utter misery on the world's side, or on the other to prevent her dissolving into the heavenly sphere before her time. But as she grows older she is too much for me in both directions. I am not ready yet to be transfigured and find myself behind the vail at merry seventeen, I want to enjoy myself in a lively, human, coquettish way with flesh-and-blood belles and beaux, so when I find that she is carrying me into too rare an atmosphere for such sinners to follow, I lift up the valve for the gas to escape, and down my balloon falls. Then on the other side, I am so tried by our teacher's prejudices and the girls' mean notions of Zoe, caught from her, that I don't know but my temper will be spoiled, and that would be a pity, seeing I am such an angel. Heigh-ho! I know well that I was made to be as joyous as a butterfly all the day long, and if the wicked world chooses to spoil the handiwork of my Maker, by making me sad and anxious by their treatment of Zoe, why they must take the awful consequences, that is all. But one gleam of light there is in the direction of the minister; for I rely more on his wise and kind friendship than on anything his wife may do. So I desire to be thankful for so much."' When Mrs. Liebenhoff returned from her walk in a dis-  i tant part of the city, she found Zoei reclining on her couch looking very intently upon the face of a Sybil, which hung on the opposite wall. She presented so perfect a picture of luxurious, dreamy, passionate orientalism, redeemed from its sensuous character by the pure Madonna-like ex- pression which was natural to it, that she paused in the doorway to gaze upon her. Finding that she was utterly absorbed by her own reverie, which might outlast her capa- city of standing, fatigued as she was, she advanced and stood over her. "And can you really find it in your heart to pardon me   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    151 for walking into your air-castle and shivering it into atoms as I have done? It was a beautiful structure, was it not? And now that it is demolished, how very bare and uninter- esting the world and all of us who remain on its site look! Come, my little architect, lay aside all your moonbeam im- plements, and gossamer frame-work and spider's-web mate- rials generally, and let us have a good, sensible chat together," said she. "' Pardon me for my freedom in lounging thus. I fear I exceed the bounds of your kindness," said Zoe, rising and smoothing the pillow. Mrs. Liebenhoff tenderly bade her welcome. " O no, no, dear," said she, i" the couch is not damaged at all by such indulgence, nor by making it the scene of your subtle masonry; for twenty castles, no heavier than the one you were constructing, would not injure it at all by their pres- sure; but are you quite sure that your innermost retains its integrity as well after this intoxicating occupation?" "I don't know-I fear not; but I am ashamed to say that I am good for nothing besides. I am different from every body else, and-and-the fact is, I don't like the world as it is-I never did, and I don't think I ever shall-so I just build and live in one of my own. If I were made like you, my dear madam, and could do everything in its season, and be contented and happy all the time, I should be so glad, for I really do not know what is to become of me in this practical world. You know that I am of Oriental de- scent, for I have lately discovered that fact, and I have a right to,be dreamy." "Zoe, it is not because I am so unlike, but that I see in you the reflected image, as it were, of my youthful self, that my deepest heart yearns towards you as it does. I seldom speak of my interior life, for it has ever been so hidden with God and his Christ, that it answers not to the call of any feeble or faltering sympathy; but for you, my darling, who are approaching that perilous period, 'the  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7097-00000077"/> 152   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. parting of the ways,' which divides childhood from woman- hood, I am impelled to reveal to you some of its story, hoping that it may serve as a kindly hint to you." "O, thank you, dear Mrs. Liebenhoff; how favored I am!" "I, too, am an Oriental," said she, "in temperament and mental tendency, and formerly I marveled, that with the breath of the Sirocco wind sweeping through my soul, with every pore of my nature thirsting like the banyan tree for the dewy moisture and copious showers of sympathy, affec- tion and intimate companionship, I should be planted in the  snowy north, where the pulse beats to an even tenor, and a preponderance of physical life saves from the intensity of existence within. But as I grow older and interpret more clearly that wonderful human nature with which God has invested us, and glance with steadier vision into the life within life, soul within soul, of this great universe of his planning, and my being like that same plant of multi- tudinous unity from its center spreads out indefinitely and roots itself in the common soil, only to spring up again and  again to absorb the all-enlightening sun's rays, and drink in the fertilizing offerings of the clouds, I seem to myself no longer peculiar and solitary, but as one most emphati- cally with the great company of my sex all over the world. i The chief distinction is, that through God and the myste- rious ways of his Providence, there has been burned into  my soul a deeper impression of its wrongs, a wider know- ledge of its character and its wants, and a higher sense of  its aspirations, than is awarded to all. And as these would  but consume me by their excess, and burst my very being i asunder by the cry which they bring up from its depths, I did I not utter what is in me, it seems an intimation that I  should do so in the ways which seem truest and best to  me, though I yield with the deed the most precious privi- - lege of my life. For to the shrinking soul of the true woman, publicity is ever most painful, and nothing can   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPII.   153 compensate her for making merchandise of her thoughts which have been a highway only between herself and the In- finite, but a purpose which is paramount to a merely selfish advantage and enjoyment, though these may be the greatest and purest of which we are capable." "And are you going to write a book, dear Mrs. Lie- benhoff?" "Yes, and I cannot but hope that it may be an aid to you, Zoe, in the discipline of your mind, which, in its chief characteristics, seems so much like my own." "O I know it will; but in the meantime, please tell me more about yourself, just to me, a little simple girl you know, who likes her own secrets kept too well to betray any of yours;" and she nestled close beside her as she said this. "Now I am not going to begin as the biographers do, I was born in such a place,' etc., but shall rather take you for the subject of my story, and I shall point the moral," said she, throwing her arm around her. "I am so disappointed," said Zod, " for it can't be enter- taining with such a foolish, uninteresting heroine, with no beauty even to recommend her. Please skip the story and give me the moral." "What an uncommon young woman, to prefer prosy moral to a pretty story! I have great hopes that it will be interesting with such an original subject to deal with. Here it is. ' Far, far away, away from over the great ocean, there once came to this land a little sun-browned Ethiopian, with the touch of the same artist hand upon the waves of her hair, and with teeth, of which, the elephant, kneeling to her mamma before her birth-day, begged her to carve some for the Zoe which soon was to be. For, by that name, which means life, said she, shall my darling be called, for, from the life of our Father in Heaven, its father on earth, my life and the life of the universe, shall she be fitly created. And so one bright morning there was joy in %  -     .  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7097-00000078"/> 154  ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. the household, for Zoe had descended from the Heaven on high, and to their eyes the ray of light which was its car, justly provided, still- rested above it. O, sweet were the a visions of the blessed young mother! O, tender the glance of the dark, thoughtful father! And gentle her dreams of the lisping companion, who should fly o'er the sea-beach with feet like birds' pinions, and gather with her the bright shells of the tropics. But big were the hopes of the strong, manly father, that she should honor his name by her beauty of character, and the lore which could only be gathered afar. "And so one strange morning, when the rain deluged the household, though a star in the East shone brightly  above, which the father interpreted to be Zoi, returning in her lovely young womanhood, she set sail for the land of her exile and discipline, which was to give her the glory I which was to gladden their souls.            : "'Our Zoe, weird-being,.grows apace, with two magni- fied eyes, one which looks backward and homeward, strain- ing to catch glimpses of the emerald isle of the blue Carib- bean, with its perennial life and deep-dyed vegetation, of its quivering sun, love-smitten with its beauty, and wedded for aye, to this Saint of the Cross. "'But more eagerly than all, does she pine for the arms of her own loved mamma, to inclose her with tenderness and for the lullaby song of her father at even, to hush her to rest.  "' The other glance is upward to the heaven of heavens for its light, which but dimly is granted to her impatient expectations and feverish cry. "' But Zoe, my darling, drop your eyelids and strain not your orbs to pierce the blue vault for the-- Thus saith your God,' to be written upon it, nor listen for the audible summons to the work of your life, and still your heart- yearnings for the dear ones at home.

I' '; Thank you for the lesson, and for my birth history which I knew not before. I will write it to mamma in my next letter, it may be new even to her. And now for the moral!" "6 O Zoe, if you would only remember and heed it, how glad I should be, but I see in your eye, that your imagina- tion more than your reason and sense of danger are affected by my Tale! Nevertheless, you shall have it, and though you are too much preoccupied by your gaze back- wards and forwards and into the realm of fancy into which you have grown, to regard it, yet like the seed sown by the wayside, it may some time spring up and give new life to your being." "For this is its essential truth, that woman needs strength as well as beauty, and tenderness, and aspiration. For lacking this, she is like the ship in full sail upon the wide and fearful sea without a helm to direct or ballast to steady her motion. Like the eagle soaring to the gates of heaven with an eye that can gaze without blinking upon the centre of Infinity itself, and yet without the sure-guiding foot and the weight acquired by the mingling with the earthy and  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7097-00000079"/> 156   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. commonplace, she will turn over and over with absurd gyrations in the atmosphere, causing the groundlings by turns to wonder and adore, only to laugh and deride all the more when, draggled and torn, her wings lie soiled in the dust and her clairvoyant eye is dim in bewilderment or death. And this saving force, this power over the imagi- nation and fancy, those beautiful but perilous pinions of the soul, can be gained only by patient toil, watchful care, and self crucifixion. Give up the reins to them and you ! are lost, perhaps for aye. Keep them in check, bring up the conscience, the reason, the power of labor, the sense of awe and love of the Infinite and of humanity into har- monious correspondence, and no eye of earth is strong and clear enough to see into the future glory, even of your ter- restrial being, while Vestal and Sybil, prophetess and seeress were but meagre types in the ancient times of the celestial glory of womanhood, thus exalted by the complete action of Christian truth and the self-discipline it enjoins. The genius of her tender, imaginative, sensitive soul re- quires the sweep of all the choicest of creation to nurture it, and when these come at her bidding through daily exer- tion in gathering the wealth of the past and present, con- templation and glad conformity to all the higher laws of our Creator, like the flower which blooms into loveliness and fragrance by a higher will than its own, like the coral which builds its worlds by a law superior to itself, though through its obedience it is permitted to bloom in instinctive and conscious life at its summit, so does she go gladly on in the way of his appointment, and Poetry, Painting, Music, and Sculpture, ay, and even Philosophy and the orator's gift become but playthings in her power." "O glorious!" said Zoi; 6" how can I be all this? It is the ideal of my life, the more than wildest hope of my brightest day-dream." "Not simply by dreaming and aspiring, nor even by purifying your nature at the perennial fount of truth, :   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    157 nor even by the prayer of your most saintly hours, but by hard labor, by dutiful performance of every duty which is nearest you, through every season of your life." "The great Thorwaldsen told me as much when I was a little girl. I have never forgotten it, but it seems as if I were disobeying one law of my nature while obeying another, to do all the duties which Miss Ingemann imposes- upon me, so I get puzzled." "4 What do you mean, Zo e?s said Mrs. Liebenhoff. 4 I know that your teacher is of a rather stern nature, but 1 had always supposed her a woman of high principle." "O0 yes, she is most truthful and conscientious. We have grown up under her care with a hatred of everything false and unworthy; but she is very rigid in her decrees towards every one alike. For instance, she thinks mathe- matics a prime discipline of the mind, and we all have to take such awful doses of it. To Hilda it comes natural to calculate, and she says it has done her giddy head-piece, as the dear girl calls it, a deal of good; but I have no talent for it, my head aches, my heart is discouraged, and I become utterly frantic over my hard problems, and Miss Ingemann I verily believe thinks I am non compos, and I can't but think treats me accordingly. Did you like to study Algebra, ma'am?" "No, my dear; it would be a sight to see the regiment of artillery, cavalry, and dragoons who could conquer the citadel of my tower of intellect and hang upon its bruised and battered walls, as I am sure they would be, a banner with a problem in Quadratic Equations well solved, for a symbol of victory. No, no, judge my mens by its capacity for algebra, and I am minus altogether." "That is really encouraging. I wish Miss Ingemann knew it. We should get on much better together if that study was permitted to go by the board, for I am a dread- ful trial to her in this respect, and she to me no less, to tell the truth. I dream of her some nights as a guide-board to  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7097-00000080"/> 158   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIU PH. heaven, with puzzling sums all over her, which I am to   work out truly or lose my chance of salvation." "I will speak to Miss Ingemann," said Mrs. Liebenhoff;  "or rather, I will request my sister, Mrs. Korner to do so,  who is a favorite with her. I have never got into her good  graces, not being prononcee enough for her taste, I believe.  A few words of suggestion from her, will perhaps influ- L  ence her to change your studies a little. She knows that I Lina has always loved you." "Thank you," said Zoei, looking rather doubtful how-  ever about the result of this interference. "Do you- like history, Zoe?" continued Mrs. Liebenhoff: "I like to pick plums out of it, here and there, in the shape of the rare characters of men and women and striking events, but I hate accounts of wars and battles which make so much of the history of the past, and in fact, I think there is a great deal too much said about very stupid, un- interesting, and very wicked people, whom I think our Lord would have put quite in the back-ground in his esti- mation had he known them," she answered. "Yes, the chief thing which interests me in history, is what is called its philosophy-the showing as it were, the thread of God's Providence running through all time, with the light of his loving care resting over and working with the affairs of .men, ever bringing good out of evil, and causing all changes and revolutions, no less than the more slow and silent weaving of the warp and woof of events together, to tend slowly but surely to the accomplishment of his benevolent and harmonious plan in creation. If a historian aims at this as a chief end of his labor, and espe- cially if he recognizes in Christianity the great moral and spiritual power which is to solve all the difficult problems of humanity, so far as they can be solved in life, and to bring light out of darkness, I am placed in sympathy with him at once; but if he merely piles up masses of facts without recognizing these truths, I may find his book a   ZOE; O1, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    159 useful granary to gather needful materials from, but the man interests me but slightly, and I have not full trust in his work. "Have you any more moral to my story for my edifica- tion?" said Zoe, looking up archly at Mrs. Liebenhoff. ," Please give me the whole of it."5 'I think you need it, for. you are not converted yet to my unpalatable doctrine, so I repeat: repress your imagi- nation until your other powers are strong in proportion to the elevation and extent of its flight; for, Zoe, we women need to throw out every anphor that we have, to save us from drifting into the whirlpools that would swallow us, or upon the strands where we should bleach out our lives, like the ghost-flower, and only in dying reflect the faintest rays of the descending sun. For no Gospel is truer than that she may be born in that securest of retreats, a home in middle life in a rural district, under a father's eye apos- tolic and yet fitted by his sagacity and purity to guide her, with a mother (how can one speak worthily of her tran- scendent worth?) gentle, pure, and loving- in the highest sense simple, far-sighted, and wise, in the very centre of a circle of brothers and sisters most kind, disinterested, and affectionate, with but few incidents to vary life's serene monotony, making but one pilgrimage into the high world of conventionalism, affluence, and comparative luxury, and that one relieved, ay immortalized to her mind and charac- ter forever, by contact with exalted excellence, dignity, high intelligence, and beauty-with a marriage of affec- tion, in which the most generous freedom allowed her is only equaled by the joy with which every fresh develop- ment of her powers is received; childless, it is true, but this scarcely regarded as a want by one to whom quiet in the inner life and the opportunity of unoccupied com- panionship in all his pursuits with the beloved one, is so indispensable; with friends and objects-of interest sufficient to employ, enrich, and beautify her life above the common  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7097-00000081"/> 160   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. lot; and yet, Zoe, and yet so much greater is the soul than its accidents, so exacting has God made it, in at least the feminine form, that, while it falls short of one good of its own being, and from its out-look sees the majority of its sex, wandering bereft and forlorn, miserable by their expo- ! sure and ruined by their fall into sin, shame, and delusion that, Niobe-like, at one time she is turned into stone and anon the shrieks of the Pythoness and the wailings of the I prophets express for her all too feebly her sense of her ; woe, until she sees that, under God, she is to be an instru- ment of their relief and uprising, when there rushes through her being such a full tide of bliss as is known only to the elected of God. O Zoe, trust not to the uncertain, deceitful imagination, but labor, strive, pray for the strength which is needed even more for the perils of its seasons of joy than of its sorrows." "And you never dream, madam, though from what you say, I know it is your nature to do so?" "Listen to my teaching and ask not for my practice, that is your part, dear. It is hard to expect me to do both, and you neither," said she, laughing. "Ah," said Zoe, " and you are one of the false preachers who cry aloud and point for the people to go up the stony hill-path, while they turn aside into the opposite flowery one. O fie!" "I will at least say this in justification of myself, my little accuser, that through the whole year I do my best to act up to my own rule, while spreading my life over the thousand objects of care and interest which come within the sphere of a woman's life whose husband lives for the public weal, and I take only now and then a flight into the beloved, fancy-world, though through all its toiling hours and busy scenes come up visions of this same couch at this luxurious time, when our few, fervid days of sum- mer give me a fitting excuse to shut the light out to the point of mystery, and I lounge and revel in dream-land   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    161 for a brief time, as it is the thirst of my nature to do And you need not think that I have not my reward; for the little grub which lieth patiently at the base of the earth- pyramid, working out in silence, amid scorn and a sense of degradation, but with patience and trust, the appoint- ment of its Maker, is rewarded at last with its beautiful butterfly being. Slowly and tremblingly she creeps up over one green leaf and orange flower to another, until at last she reaches the summit of the shaft, when gladly she opens her purple and starry wings to the light, and what is so bright and so gladsome as she? For it is with no vain presumption that I say it, that after a childhood weighed down by unnatural mental anxiety and premature care, fol- lowed by a stormy and perilous youth, at times nearly ship- wrecked among the floods, then scorched by central fires, and anon withered and seared by the sterility of the arid deserts of life, through all of which I strove to be faithful and true, I am now, not rewarded, Heaven forgive me if I ever, for a moment, conceived the idea of such ingratitude, but inconceivably, immeasurably, unmeritedly blessed with childhood, youth, and middle life in one, and through his abundant aid who endowed me, I have the control of every faculty of the nature he has given me." "There comnes Hilda!" said Zoe. "Good evening, madam," said she, as she entered. "Pardon me if I interrupt you. The servant directed me to your room." "Welcome to my sanctum; you are already familiar to my husband's, I believe." ,( Yes, madam, I have that privilege. Is Mr. Liebenhoff at home?" "Yes, and here he is; come to give an account of himself, I ween, for disobeying me.

"But I will try and not be too savage towards the wife, lest I should alarm and disgust these young marriageables with the holy bonds." "Marriageables! Heaven forbid for these eight or nine years at least," said she. Spare them as long as possible  from miserable servitude like mine.

The girls laughed, and then said that as twilight was deepening they must return home. After affectionate   f adieux and repeated invitations to come again, they de- parted.        ; "How funny Mrs. Liebenhoff is," said Hilda. "She is so different from what I thought her. O I shall like to visit her. Let's go next week again." "Yes, we will," said Zoi. "But I like her for other rea- J sons than her fun."  And she became silent and thought-  ful, and heeded but little the continual chatter of her   friend as they walked homewards.

You will go, dear, will you not?" "I cannot, I am sorry to say; I have much to do about this church matter you know; our vacation comes soon, and I wish to have all settled before that time. Go you and enjoy yourself, and my play shall be by-and-by." "And after that moving discourse of mine, you can find it in your heart to tell me all this without a blush! I see you are just like other sinners of the common clay of the world. You agree that the preaching is all very good, and you mean to repent and be converted-O yes, certainly, nothing else, but not until you have committed the very last sin, which seemeth good to the perverse nature within you. Pray heaven, it may not then be too late to turn from the evil of your ways," and she looked upon his pale face with solicitude. "6 What a crooked stick of a husband she has got, has she not? I wonder how she happened to take him to lean upon; does she not repent of her bargain, the little wife?" "Too little crooked is the difficulty for this naughty world; I thought I had proved' that to your satisfaction in my memorable sermon. Why, I do believe you have for- gotten it! How discouraging to be a preacher! But, as I was saying, if you walk through life so erect, like a tall white pine tree, you will blow over, or break off, or be torn up by the roots in some unlucky gale or other." "You are not a willow precisely; your sap has too much exhilarating gas in it for that, for though you may droop once in a while, before I can get across the room to com- fort you, ten to one, you have played some trick upon me, and are ready to meet my condolence with a laugh in my face."

How unhappy I am to have such an ungrateful wife!" "O, of course you must eat something under all these inflictions, else you might fail of strength, and flowers and shells, and pictures, and such things, I am going to live upon in the future; I don't believe in eating, we think too much of creature comforts. Thank you, my dear husband, for everything of beauty you give me, and they are not a few; each leaf, petal, and full-blown flower, and tint of the shell is suggestive to me and nourishes my higher life. And as for pictures, they are my quartos and folios now- a-days." "I am afraid you will grow willowy upon such ethereal food. Pray put this doubtful nutriment, for the corpus at least, between good, substantial slices of bread and butter, by way of sandwiches, you know; I really cannot spare you yet." "Well, anything to please you; but don't be alarmed about losing me, I am going to be like the yew tree, that grows and grows until it seems to be past living, and you are on the point of cutting it down as a dead incumbrance, when lo! it makes a crook and out it shoots again all as fresh and new as ever, and thus it does indefinitely.

But it is bed-time, especially if you go into the country to-morrow.'? "Yes, tighten the reins, please do; I want more op- portunity of curvetting and prancing than you give me. Wouldn't I show my paces?" The next morning, bright and early; the little lady was up, spreading bread with butter for sandwiches, cutting cake, and collecting from her storehouse the various dain- ties which northern women make a great point of accumu- lating for special occasions, if not for daily use. To see the generous provision she was making, one would incline to dissent from her assertion that she was going to eschew creature comforts; and her husband, as he passed her on his way out, hinted as much, adding that the source of the- new shoots of the yew tree was no longer a mystery. "A truce to your insinuations," said she; "Zoe Carlan is my especial charge to-day, and I am going to try to add some pabulum to her physique, or she will go off some day in cloud and vapor. She is the most dreamy little thing ever inclosed by mortality. I thought in my zeal I could make her common-sensible and contented with life in one or two interviews; but no such thing. I believe I have so far had exactly the contrary effect upon her, and that is not the worst of it either, for she carries me back to my foolish youth so completely by her great weird-like eyes, looking over, as they do, into I Borrooboola-ghal continu- ally, that ten to one, I shall find myself there with her, careering over the desert upon my Arabian steed with Abdallah by my side, telling me of his feats with his forty thieves, and whispering of our evening rest on the oasis by the side of the fountain, under the cocoa-nut palm-tree and-- "Whist! the little wife, what is she talking about?" said he, stooping towards her and raising her laughing face to his,   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    167 O just giving you a hint that I am a part of your parish that needs looking after a little as well as the rest. Good- by," said she, tying on her bonnet, and taking her basket on her arm. "I told Zoe I would call for her on my way to the public conveyance. If we don't return before mid- night you may know that we have dissolved into thin air, and to-morrow morning when you visit your favorite Cala- canthus you will find me there before you, in the shape of a heavy dew. Until then, adieu." Arrived at the carriage-station, they found Mrs. Korner and her children, Miss Dahl and Miss Meldan, friends of hers, the two American young ladies, Miss Holberg and Mrs. Castonio, a favorite friend of Mrs. Liebenhoff, who, with Zoo, Hilda, and herself, including baskets of every shape and size, bursting with refreshments, filled to some- what more than the point of comfort the well-sized vehicle. Just as they were leaving the city, Mr. Kvrner's bright face appeared at the window. "Here you all are I perceive. Success to you! Good- by, darling," said he to the youngest, who, with outstretched arms, was petitioning for his attention. "You will come, dear, will you not towards evening?" said his wife. "If I can; but don't expect me too confidently, I have so much to do. Fare ye well," said he, kissing his hand to them as they drove away. "' Widows indeed, if not widows in name two-thirds and a half of the time!" said Mrs. Korner. "I have got a plan for making a general conflagration of the notaries' offices in the city. Will you each turn out with your torch on the occasion, my friends? The signal shall be: 'Down with business; up with reasonable and religious good works."' "You are fortunate if you have no religionists who put a technical meaning to that term," said Jenny Hale, "and cover with opprobrium, as they do in my country, the sect to which I belong, for believing in their importance."  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7097-00000085"/> 168   ZUE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. "What do they believe in?" said Miss Dahl, " bad ones? Then their cry would be-Down with Odin; up with Loken!" "I must do them the justice to say," said Jenny, "that they would not own to that watchword, but that is really the practical effect upon our countrymen. Loken is let loose in every direction, as every morning newspaper shows in black and white, and I attribute his rampancy to the domi- nant church and self-styled evangelists keeping him before the people so continually in their sermons, putting him too nearly on an equality with 'our Father in heaven,' horrible to say! and especially insisting upon it that we are all his subjects-that we are made so that we must obey him whether or no, unless a miracle is wrought upon us to pre- vent it-and that our more than probable destiny through eternity is to burn up forever, without consuming, in the bottomless pit. Now, if that would not have the effect to exalt his pride, his expectations, and increase his power over us, if his black majesty really does exist, at the same time that it tended to make us powerless against his arts, I leave it to the true, simple-minded, sensible and devout, to determine." "Come," said Theresa, "I put my veto upon this doc- trinal talk; I have too much of it at home; I am tired of the very sound of anything that smacks in the least of Cal- vinistic dogmas. It is blasphemy in the worst sense, their Druidical belief. 'Belay that,' as the sailor said to Father Taylor, in his chapel, when he was dealing it out in a somewhat mild form on a Sunday, 'give us something about Napoleon Bonaparte,' or anything else as opposite as possible." After a pleasant drive of five miles, the party arrived at the wood where they were to encamp for the day. It was composed principally of pines, hemlocks, and firs, although beeches, oaks, and other forest trees were intermingled, forming a full and grateful S}ade from the fervid heat of   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPI..   169 the sun. For his summer's reign in this northern latitude, though short, is powerful, and all the more yielded to by the inhabitants from being so distinct from the nature of his sway at other seasons of the year. There they met a party of their country friends, and after the first friendly greetings, the chief object seemed to be for each one to make herself or himself as comfort- able and happy as possible. Mr. and Mrs. Pendleton soon arrived in a britzska. "What a lovely spot!" said she, ashehe alighted. "These fragrant pines, and this assembled group, with their cos- tumes fitted for the occasion, remind me so much of home, only with this important difference, I did not, as is my-cus- tom there, get up at four o'clock in the morning to prepare for it." C4 Veterans in the service of society always get their re- ward if they wait long enough," said Jenny Hale. "Please make the most of this respite from your long campaign in the warfare between chicken-salad and chopsticks, your flowers and the Floras, to say nothing of ice-cream and screamers in the. shape of all the children in the neigh- borhood." "O horrible!" said Theresa. "Save us from such de- testable puns, I beseech you." "Bad enough to be good, are they not? But you should kindly encourage my first attempt. I will seat myself by Miss Dahl. She will have a fellow-feeling for me. She must have made a beginning sometime though she shows such facility now in this species of wit." "What a beautiful piece of embroidery that is you are working!" said Mrs. Liebenhoff to Miss Meldan. "Yes, it is a traveling-bag for a young friend, who is to be married soon; I am willing, so far, to weave a thread into the destiny of the fair creature's future.

"Then you don't believe in match-making any more than I do," said Mrs. Liebenhoff. ' No indeed, I have seen too much trouble from such sources to attempt so dangerous an enterprise. Let each couple pair themselves, I say." "No one but the Highest is equal to it in my opinion. He who has tempered each of his children according to his own sense of beauty and fitness, alone knows the adap- tation of one to the other," said Mrs. Liebenhoff. "Then you believe that matches are made in heaven?" said Theresa. "All true marriages are," said she. "All might be in the best sense if we would have it so, but there is great infidelity on this point as well as everything else connected with our highest life." "How is a body to know?" said Theresa, "if her mar- riage is ordained? I desire light upon this subject, for I have a feeling that I am fated to be dreadfully taken in, in this awful business. The very thought of it makes me frantic. What is your rule for knowing? Do you find it written in the Bible, chapter and verse? or are you im- pressed, as the spiritualists say? Do tell me, for pity sake." "I have no rule for any one but myself. Mine worked well for me, but it might not for you; so you don't get it with all your urgency. That is my own secret, but you cannot convince me that my marriage was not ordained above. There are quite too many rules of life in the world and too little of acting up to the highest spirit of our na- ture and God's requisition. The great thing is to reach an elevated plane of thought and feeling, and then most of the perplexities of life would be solved. But where is Zoe?" "Wandering off alone," said Hilda; "shall I follow and make her return?'"   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    171 "No," said Mrs. Liebenhoff, "I will walk with her a few minutes." She found her standing perfectly still, looking at a large spider's web, which was woven from branch to branch on the dead limb of a tree above her head. She started on seeing Mrs. Liebenhoff, but was reassured on finding it to be no other than her friend. "What strange creatures insects are!" said she. "They seem to me a sort of revelators, if I may so speak, of our fortunes, and in consequence, impress me with a kind of awe." "And what does ' Mrs. Hairy-leg spinner ' deign to an- nounce to you of your experience or destiny? That you are to be very industrious and practical; that you are to build your own house, and keep the larder well provided?" "O no; but, that as she sits solitary and despised in the centre of her world, so am I alone and peculiar in the sphere in which I am thrown; and yet God alone knows if we are not equally with others living truly according to his will." "I think, dear, if the spider could speak, she would tell you that you informed her of that fact quite as much as she you. However I am not quite free from superstition, as it would be called, about a thousand such things. I have not made up my mind about them, and perhaps never shall in this world at least; for, in a universe of infinity, how can finite beings expect to know everything? Much must necessarily be indefinite, and here comes in our glad privilege of trust, faith in God and his Providence, which is much better than going to spiders to have your fortune told. And, Zoe my love, pray combat this idea which I see is fixing itself in your mind that you are peculiar. It is pernicious every way. You will, through it, grow mor- bid, unnatural, and unhappy. I don't like peculiar people, they are so self-conscious and disagreeable.

"I dislike to, they stare at me so; I look so different from them one would think I was an ourang-outang, to see them i gaze upon me. It is as much as I can do to prevent play- ing some odd trick or other when their eyes are all upon me. And I must tell you that one sunny day, just at the opening of spring, Hilda and I walked to the outskirts of the city, and while she ran aside for some purpose, I sat down on a stone to wait for her. A group of children gathered around me, and there they stood with staring eyes and open mouths. I had just eaten an orange and had cut the rind round into strips. I put one of them to my eye for a quizzing-glass and grinned at them with all my might. i You would have laughed to see them run. ' It is the queen of the dark Elves,' said they, 'run, run, or she will carry us into her kingdom under ground, where we never shall see our mothers again!' I thought Hilda would have died laughing, when she returned just in time to witness the fun.  She actually rolled upon the ground, and she had her best pelisse on too." : "Well, we are never satisfied in this life," said Mrs. Liebenhoff. "It would be a  great convenience to me to have a  more distinct character than I have to my face; then I should not, so often as I do, have the trouble of telling my name. To my butcher, my baker, my grocer, and the shopman, I  repeat it over and over again, when I direct ; packages to be sent to me. Latterly, I have formed the   - habit of saying, when I enter the presence of persons that H I  have not seen for the last six weeks, 'Mrs. Liebenhoff, ladies, how are you? and to gentlemen, who have sat at my board and received, with the utmost graciousness, every- thing in the way of hospitality I can grant them, when they meet me abroad, a  bare portrait, without the setting of my house, and to my cordial greeting, answer, with an indiffer- ent look, 'You have the advantage of me, madam; I don't recognize you,' I simply say,' O, ay; I suppose so,' and : pa-ss on.'"                        :.I   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   173 "I should. have known you, after my first introduction, if I had met you in Timbuctoo," said Zoe. "I have no doubt of it dear, simply because you have another style of measurement than the superficial one in vogue. But here is a new arrival." "Do you know all these people?" said Zoe. "Yes, more or less, enough to bow to them, though some of them would not say the same of me for reasons aforesaid. That full-faced gentleman is Mr. Calthrop. I have called at his house when riding into the country with mutual friends; I just bowed to him and he looked won- deringly at me, as much as to say, 'Who is that common- looking woman2  She could not have bowed to me.' However, that is his affair, not mine. It was proper that I should be civil to one whose hospitality I had received." "Who is that sweet-looking woman near him, talking with animation to Miss Meldan?" 4"It is his wife, simple, artistic, and loving. They rise each morning after a twelve years' marriage to a prolonged honeymoon, and as they wander, hand in hand, around their beautiful grounds, they drink in with appreciating eyes the beauties of shrub, tree, cloud, sunlight and shadow, and thank the good Giver of their varied blessings, with pious -and grateful hearts. If they are in fault, it is that blessed with wealth, culture and health, they feel too little their obligation to return in the direction of their fellow-men the benefits which flow to them from God. She says she feels nearer to Him through communing with nature than through humanity. It may be so; we need to bathe our spirits in the silence, solemnity, and loveliness of its beau- tiful scenes; yet it should be but at intervals, only to return more fresh and enthusiastic, to labor for the world's good; for only in proportion as we do our full part towards its renewal and advancement, are we saved when in our re- tirement from an aimless dilettantism, or a selfish, or per- verted life.

"It is Mr. Keutsch, an influential man at court." "I observed he looked as if he expected you would     greet him farther than by a passing bow. Do you not know  him?" "Yes, he has been at our house, but I shall not trust to ' his memory to recollect me. My bow was for his speaking  I manly and courageous words for the independence of  Schleswig Holstein, which so few of our noblemen dare to do; I honor him for that." "Who is that gentleman walking with Miss Carden?" "It is Mr. Henshom.

When I  find that to suit me, I am rather blunt in my per- ception of inferior faults. Many a young Miss in her teens has overthrown and ridden right over me, when    ij mounted upon her exegetical pony and running a   tilt    igainst the religion, learning, science, and art of the past ! and present times, besides crowning one author with im-   I nortelles and completely extinguishing another in the    I   WUWY I WvLrW JLr ai Y"N1-,d      I IIJ same breath.

"Do they visit you?" "O yes, Miss Carden is my friend, earnest, intelligent, and religious. - She only needs to see more clearly that the study of books is not the sole enlightenment of life, but that when one has accumulated such stores of know- ledge as she has, and acquired her discipline of mind, that if there is a different sphere from any which she has yet occupied, open for her, it is the very one most assuredly which her soul needs, in which to bring up its flagging, more passive power, so to speak, and lay to its proper level the watchful, critical, exacting intellect.

I wonder if when he goes to his home far away, he will sit down by his beloved mother and say, ' you taught me to be good when I was a little boy, and the same instructions, hallowed as they are by every thought and memory of you, dearest mother, stand me in good stead in my manhood; but as my mind grows, there are opening upon me vistas through which I look, half fearful and half joyful and dimly discern, as I think, higher truths than have been familiar to me of yore, in the dis- tance-and now, my best friend, tremble not for your son, if with prayer, with the Scripture, and your counsels to guide me, I venture into what may seem to you dangerous paths; for, through Christ, I trust to be guided safely to the light and seize, through a high conviction, upon these glorious verities, and bear them as trophies of my soul's warfare with intellectual blindness and error to your feet, my mother; when together we will bless God for that great good of our being, a pure, unadulterated conception of Christianity.' In this enterprise may heaven speed you, my old, middle-aged, young friend." "How bright and well Mrs. Petersen looks to-day! I wish she liked me; I think I should love her so muchf" said Zoe. "You must speak to her frankly and cordially when you meet her, my dear. You do not often see her, and then you are so shy that she has no opportunity of knowing you, occupied as she is with her children and many other ob- jects of interest. But her brightness and willing sacri- fices for the pleasure of her friends, are not the true gauge by which to measure her physical vigor or her soul's equanimity, for she has had a great sorrow and has heavy cares; and though, to the superficial eye, she may seem to pass through them unscathed, yet there are abysses in our nature which, young as you are, Zoe, you are fast learning, may be stirred to their deepest and blackest ex- treme, and yet convey no echo of the hoarse and fearful   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TR1UMPH.    1" roar, which rises and swells and subsides in the hearing only of the Infinite, revealing to mortals the tumult below only by the brighter -rainbow hung over the spray of its floods.

Is it not a pretty tableau opposite-the ladies with their fanciful costume, and the children with their heads wreathed with leaves, dancing on the green?" "To say nothing of the grave relief to the butterfly scene which the gentlemen present," said Miss Holberg. "Yes, but I am falling mightily in love with women in these days. They seem beautiful to me, in verety way, and I have many, many questionings with myself about their position in society as it is." "Unfortunate for me to come upon you in this particular mood of yours, as it is of one of the other sex I wished to speak to you. I hear you are taking lessons, in one of the oriental tongues, of a Hungarian Jew. Does he speak the German language correctly, think you? We wish for a teacher in our school." "Yes, so far as my ear informs me, he does; besides, his character inspires me with so much confidence that I do not think he would attempt what he cannot do very well; and it has been his chief medium of intercourse with his countrymen since childhood."

"Does he know Kossuth?"  "6 Yes; he is his intimate friend and profound admirer. He says, rising as he does so, and with emphatic tone, that he is the noblest being on the face of the earth. He jour- neyed at an inclement season, over a long and tedious way, to apprise him of the traitorous designs of Gorgei, gathered from his own observation, and begged him, for the sake of Hungary, to concentrate the power of the kingdom more in himself. But Kossuth, true to his Christian and repub- lican principles, refused to appropriate to his own person a dignity and rule which, to his high ideal, was inconsistent with strict justice to his compatriots." i"And so Hungary fell! I think he had better have been a little more commonplace and sensible, and done what most generals would not have hesitated to do in his place." "So Mr. Seiill thinks under the circumstances. But 1 do not; and the world will yet see that, as there is a Su- preme Arbiter above, such unflinching devotion to a high sentiment, though apparently it may result in disaster at the time, will bring about in the end a higher good than any that could be gained by a most conscientious departure from it."

He was   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    179 prime minister of David, and privy counselor to Solomon; but in the reign of Hezekiah he broke out in a new place as Isaiah, and I will just add that he says that he did not exactly describe our Saviour in his fifty-third chapter. That had special reference to the Jews in their captivity; but this he knew through his prophetic foresight that some- thing very great and good was to happen to the world, and that it came in Christ and his religion." ("What form did he assume next?" t"That of Jeremiah, and uttered his memorable Lamen- tations over Jerusalem. Next he was in gilded captivity with Daniel, till, for his disobedience to the wicked com- mands of the king, he was thrown into the den of lions; but being master of the magnetic art he put them to sleep, and was taken out the next morning unscathed, to be made more of at court than ever." "What next?" 6"He was John the Baptist, and prepared the way for the coming of our Saviour; which mission accomplished, he magnanimously confessed the superiority of the Messiah to himself, and was, you know, put to death by Herod for his moral boldness in reproving him for his sin. Soon after this he appeared again on the earth in the form of a little Jewish boy. He was early left an orphan and sub- jected to the cruel guardianship of a miserly Pharisaical grandfather; was educated first for a rabbi, and was deep- dyed in the superstitions of the Talmud, but broke loose from the bondage only to fall in the course of ages into the no less Gentile superstition of Calvinism, through which 'wild woods ' he groped his way to the light partly by the aid of German theology and philosophy, but much more through the pure truth of the New Testament, till after all his peregrinations and transformations he stands forth to the world as John the Baptist again, but of the more spiritualized and glorified dispensation of our Lord.

I doubt whether his eye is yet opened to the view of his glorious destiny; but I know it, and rejoice that it is so. Do you not think I am fortunate in the choice of my teacher?" "Perhaps you can bear up under such a marvelous his- tory and experience, but I fear that he would set the girls crazy, especially Zoie here. He would just suit her fancy, but I should fear for her sanity under his adminis- tration." "O do engage him, Miss Holberg! I  know I should learn of him faster than ever before. Try me, please," said ZoO. "I think you had better," said Mrs. Liebenhoff. "I have noticed that he has a very father-Abrahamic way with young girls, and a distinguishing characteristic of his is moral force, and power of inspiring his pupils with the same, which, with his fidelity, and last, but not least, his very natural and true method of instruction in the languages, insure him great success." "I will tell Miss Ingemann, and she must do as she pleases; but I must say I have some misgivings with regard to some foolish little heads," said she, pressing ZoE's to  her face affectionately.

"O, I am so glad," said Mrs. Castonio; " now we are more than ever sisters, having a like interest to occupy us. Do you love to write?" "Yes, it is a great pleasure as well as relief; but the publication is the worst of it. Awful, is it not, to see frag- ments of one's most precious self, flying hither and thither, and gossiped over and laughed at and picked to pieces by the self-styled wise?" "Yes; but one always has the hope of doing good and conferring pleasure, and that compensates for such annoy- ances." "Yes, certainly; and I have made up my mind to put the finishing touch to the salvation of mankind by my Tale; that and the Bible are to be the books henceforward. None of my friends seem to believe it; they speak of it like any other common work, Guethefs, Schiller's, Oelenschlager's, etc. Only to think of such presumption! But never mind, that makes no difference. We shall see what we shall see;"' and they laughed at her ambitious designs upon immortality. There was much merriment over the multiform repast, especially the Gammel cheese made among the mountains. Mrs. Pendleton liked it, and resolved to carry some home on her return; while Theresa said it was hateful, from the strong taste of the yellow flower of which the cows ate abundantly, in the season of its manufacture, and which imparted its flavor to the milk; and as for carrying it home, she should not permit it to go on board ship, lest some Nipon, or Loken, or the king of the dark Elves, or some other one of their heathen deities or sprites, should smug- gle himself into it and sink them all in the deep.  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7097-00000092"/> 182   ZOOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. At the beautiful hour of twilight they turned their faces homewards, with many expressions of thanks and good- will to those who had contributed to their enjoyment by their assiduous attentions, and as the shades deepened, they sank into the silence and thoughtfulness which so well befits this holiest season of the day, the dividing line between busylabor and anxious care, and the rest and hush of quiet, holy evening.

A  few days after the event of the pic-nic, a group of the pupils of Miss Ingemann's school were together in one of the recitation rooms, from which their new German teacher had just departed, leaving them at leisure for the rest of the afternoon. "Have we not caught a Tartar now?" said Adelgunda Heiliger, who was given somewhat to indolence. "We shall have to tread the exact line with him I see, or there is no knowing what will come to pass. Dearee-me, where is my book? It frightens me to think how I shall have to study to come up to his high ideas of what can be done." "Yes," said Freya, " and the cool way in which he says, ' you will read so far for the next lesson, and in six more you will have finished this; and in three months you will be able to do so and so,' is quite admirable for simple maidens to behold. It actually takes away my breath to think what a race in learning we are to run, to say nothing of my neck's aching at gazing upwards at such a moun- tainous height of superiority.

I wonder that Miss Ingemann should employ such a person. I do not think my papa will wish me to take lessons of him. He is very particular about my associates in every respect." "A despised Jew!" said Zoe; "how strange to speak so contemptuously of that nation of which the most perfect being that ever walked the earth-our adorable Lord-was one, to say nothing of lawgivers, prophets, and apostles, who gave glory to the race! I don't understand it." "Did not the Jews crucify Jesus, and don't they deserve all the contempt and punishment that can be heaped upon them?" rejoined Rinda, in a coarse and angry tone. "Our Saviour said, ' Father, forgive them, for they know not what they-do,' before he died, and even while suffer- ing the death-agony; and it is not being much like him for men to harbor revenge and heap obloquy upon them eighteen hundred years after they committed the deed," said Zoe.  "C Jew, or Christian, or Hottentot, I care not," said Hilda, "he is a splendid fellow. His forehead, eyes, and mouth are quite faultless. His nose,to be sure, might be -chiseled a little more like Apollo's and not suffer in appearance." "That is the remnant of the Jews' stiff-neckedness. It comes out in this shape, you may depend upon it," said Zoe. "Cosmopolitan as Mrs. Liebenhoff says he is -in his sympathies, attainments, and power of adaptation to differ- ent circumstances, he can't surmount the strange prepos- session the race have for that peculiar nose. For the rest, I have seen many pictures of the Christ, with a much lower ideal of the high-toned and spiritual than a copy of his face, when illuminated by its best expression, would present."

' I suspect you are too I loud a thinker,' dear Hilda, to suit precisely the young brave by your side," said Zoe. "I should fall into his own mood more naturally.

Give me the Indian, and you take the Jew. I think you are the very one foreordained for our teacher." "He would not think so," said Zoie, " for he would have to hang his harp upon the willow again and sprinkle ashes upon his head anew, and wail for Zoi as well as Zion. No, no, I never shall marry." "What absurdities are you dealing out?" said Rinda. "I should think you were both moonstruck. I declare I will tell Miss Ingemann if you don't hush." "Come," said Hilda, "let us go to Mrs. Liebenhoff's. You know she wished us to do so before the arrival of her friends from Iceland, and this is the last opportunity we shall have. You go first, Zoei, please, while I finish prac- tising my music lesson, and then I will follow you. I know you will be glad of a tete-a-tete with her." Zoei hastened to the parsonage. "Please to walk into ' my ladies' chamber,' " said Mrs. Liebenhoff from the window, as she ascended the steps and entered the room. "How are you, dear? you look pale."

"No, ma'am, I requested her not to. The fact is, my pride has been aroused of late by finding that my teacher was making up her mind that my fit destiny was to be a cook, as she found accidentally-that I had some native skill in that way, which, added to a little care and patience, made me successful in preparing a few trifles for breakfast and dessert, and I was determined to show her that I could do something in the line of her mathematical exactness; so that algebra, geometry and I go into a pitched battle every day." "Which is the victor?" "O the Chaldean and Arabian of course; how could it be otherwise, seeing that I never was made to fight with a parcel of ciphers and circles and triangles! Let them be conquered by those who need them; I do not. I feel that my warfare-if I have any- is to be a moral one, with the evils of the world, and, therefore, I must furnish my- self with moral weapons." And her face began to assume the rapt and contemplative expression common to it in repose--" but (rousing herself,) I was determined to show Miss Ingemann that I could do something besides cook,'" said she, contemptuously. "The culinary art is by no means to be despised," said Mrs. Liebenhoff, "for on that depends very much our soundness of body, and through that, our health of mind. Besides, in middle life at least, and I will say in every sta- tion, no one can be a lady-and that in my view, compre- hends very much, even a high Christian character, with its troop of sister virtues; a culture in every direction, commen- surate with our opportunities; and manners, the natural expression of a mind thus enlightened and a soul thus en- riched;-I repeat, no one can be a lady who has not the self- possession and grace which a command of the general prin- ciples, if not of all the particularities of her menage gives her.

No, Zoe, despise no useful capa- city, my child, however humble." "But one does not wish to be praised for such things," said she. "I don't object," said Mrs. Liebenhoff, " though I crave the privilege of modifying the kind compliments of my friends, for when they tell me, as they sometimes do, ' you make the best cake and pastry in the city;' then I say to myself, 'behold your reward for struggling with your dreamy and indolent temperament, which would have led you to lie hour after hour, with your head resting upon your hand, looking at a Sybil.'" "Ay, ay," said Zoe. "Longing to be one, and yet squandering the time and neglecting the means which would give you more than her mysterious power.

"Come, my little penitent, we will wait till you sin more than I know of before I become your father confessor. You shall be shriven, however, when that time arrives, I will warrant, so don't be despairing, Let us go into the garden." They sat down under the shade of a tree in the little inclosure and resumed their talk. "Don't you think it is very hard to get used to the world as it is? I really am afraid I never shall." "6 Yes," said Mrs. Liebenhoff, " and more than that, I never intend to. My struggle has always been to preserve my principles and sentiments intact without bigotry or vain- glory; to lead a true and natural life in a very artificial state of society, and in the midst of mean and false cus- tQms, where a low standard of life and manners is set up; to walk with a pure and affectionate spirit among imy fel- lows, with my eye fixed with unfaltering gaze upon the banner in the skies, upon which is inscribed, ' Liberty, Holiness, Love!'  But it is a weary way of traveling! through life. One has too little company on the road, and I thirst more and more for the sense of companionship in my  highest thoughts, plans, and aspirations.

But blest with his society and guidance for twenty years, naturally contemplative and retiring, it cannot be but that by snatches in my busy life, I have seized upon scraps of the intellectual wealth which is floating all around me. And while occupied with a thousand familiar cares, there has been good time for it to be assimilated into my own being, and through the broad sympathies which a docile and appreciating reception of Christ's teachings gives to us, all the past and present seems gathered to a loving embrace in my soul, and the future, through the power of our faith, is, O! so glorious to me, Zoe, that I pant for the time when the good God shall vouchsafe to reveal it more clearly to men, for then would they never cease to adore and be led by him."

God has worked her way to the light, peace, and trust, of believing in, loving, and adoring Him, in closer and more constant and familiar communion than seems common in this cold, intellectual age. One friend tells me, on reading what I have already written, that it will be suited only to the more refined and cultured classes, that the majority will throw it aside for the flashy tale of passion and intrigue. But I do not believe it, for I have an instinctive dread of cliques, which is strengthened every year by every principle and high conviction. I was born among the people, I have ever lived and been familiar with and loved them. I know them, I trust them. I see between the poorest, coarsest, and most uneducated, and the most favored only the differences which circumstances create, and often I long to fly from the gilded surroundings of the one to the lowly hovel of the other, for the comfort, sug- gestion, and hope which I find not in satin and gold, or in her who puts her trust in their superficial splendor. So that in my heart of hearts, I have an earnest that even the most ignorant, degraded, and wretched will be brought into sympathy with me through my pen, and will find in its flow some solace, support, and strength to relieve them from their woe. And if it can, like Ithuriel's spear, touch the great heart of struggling, suffering, aspiring humanity, crushed and bleeding as it lies under the hoof of the spoiler, and it shall start up, it may be, in its ugly naked- ness at its thrill, O! then will I plead that, like maniac of old, through the spirit of Christ which it is my life's aim to paint, it may become clothed in the garments of virtue and holiness, and conscious of its restoration to its right mind evermore sit at his feet. And if the lowly and faint- ing ones find in my tale some nutriment, enjoyment, and inspiration, then am I sure of an audience with the stronger and happier, for life is ever in an ascending series.

Slowly but surely, it is elabo- rated, expanded, and beautified, until trunk, branch, leaf, bud, and flower attest to his wonder-working hand in crea- tion, and his goodness in spreading it so fairly for 'the healing of the nations.' In like manner, as God rears high its structure and transfuses its sap into the rude bark- covering as into every delicate vein of its flower-petal, so will I utter the best that is in me, either of mirth, of sad- ness, or high contemplation, and send it lovingly forth to the great multitudes all over the world, nor be impatient and distrustful if it makes its way slowly among them; for this I know, that even 'a cup of cold water' tendered in the spirit of our faith, refreshes and purifies, and thus yields its reward; then how much more the very spirit of one's best life's experience, hopes, and aspirations poured out of a burning souls "Mr. Liebenhoff encourages you, I know.? "O yes, I never fail of sympathy from him; yet very wisely, as he thinks, he puts a check upon what he regards as excited hopes, for fear perhaps that I should grow elated and proud; and another friend thinks I need the discour- agement of some ' hardhearted man of business' to mode- rate my expectations, so he very properly gives me his plain opinion. But how little do we know of each other here. Afraid of my being proud! Why, I have eaten little else' than humble pie all my life, so that I am one great slice of humility! But in this condition of lowli- ness, Zoe, I have learned to see clearly that God is to be glorified and man exalted by ministering as we may, to the best good of mankind, and when we have been led by one path or another to the altar of self-consecration, and experienced the blessed fruition which flows from it; you 17  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7097-00000098"/> 194   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. may as soon look to see Orion smiling with vanity ex- pressed in his twinkling orbs, or the moon covering her face through a weak self-consciousness, or the sun striding through the heavens-with a step of haughty pride, as vain- glory in such a one. For when we are led into full com- munion with Him, then reposes the soul upon the. will of the Most High, without care for its destiny, whether it be to be blighted like an untimely flower, to bask like the ephe- meron in the sun for a day, or like the sturdy oak to stand firm against the varied fortunes of centuries. For to know that we are in his hands is sufficient. I have but little anxiety for my story, but I know it will go." "I trust it will not be like many books that I attempt to read. It seems to me that their authors have a great many crude ideas, which they think much of and very recklessly express. Another person dislikes them, and gets angry, and sends forth another book in a very unchristian spirit to oppose the first, when ten to one, his own ideas are not any truer; and so it goes," said Zoe, "Yes, criticism, criticism is the spirit of the age. We have got beyond our soundings upon some most important points, and need to plant our feet firmly by the side of Jesus upon the shore of the great ocean of truth, and take our reckoning anew, and then we shall live in and give out the positive, and not forever deal in negations." "It puzzles me to hear the philosophers and theologians talk about what they call the essential doctrines of religion. I don't find them in the precepts of Jesus, and they seem to me very contrary to nature," said Zoo again. "So they do to me, and most injurious also, as turning menis attention aside from the pure, and holy, and bene- volent life of the author of our faith, and subverting his faultless rules which are to be our guide. And to one who, when young, acknowledged the authority of tlese, and has ever found that they enabled one, as Jesus said they would, to be like the house founded 'upon the - ockl upon   ZOi; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    195 which the storms of time might beat in vain, the discussion upon these knotty points seems like the talk of the demons in Pandemonium, of whom the English poet writes, when they reasoned Of providence, foreknowledge, will, and fate, United fate, free-will, foreknowledge absolute, And found-no end, in wandering mazes lost; Of good and evil much they argued then, Of happiness and final misery, Passion and apathy, and glory and shame, Vain wisdom all, and false philosophy." "One evening last week, there was a long conversation between our German friend, Professor Henschall, and Mr. Lias. Mr. Liebenhoff, who has but little interest in the subject, chimed in, however, with his modifications, and Mr. Pendleton described to us the extreme ground which the prevailing sects in his country took upon these vexed questions. I sat and listened to the account of these abor- tions of the mind until the air about me seemed to become blue and imbued with a sulphurous smell. Flames of fire enveloped the forms 'of our friends, their tongues were like- fiery serpents, and their eyes gleamed like coals from the furnace of the bottomless pit, in which their thoughts seemed determined to dwell. I fancied my garments were becoming scorched, and I trembled lest they would draw me into this terrible vortex. I rushed out and never was the sweet air of heaven or the bright stars on high so wel- come to me. 0' beautiful universe!' said I, 'ye elder scriptures of God! roll on in your majesty and loveliness, and may our ears be opened to listen to your daily and nightly re'velation, for the written Word has become dark- ened and deadened to the eyes of mankind.

O horrible doctrines! O unfortunate world! O wretched, bewildered, and orphaned mankind, wander- ing through space, (if we believe their words to be true,) demons by birth, nurtured in corruption and sin, and des- tined to eternal damnation! O my soul, come not into their counsels again!" "But these are considered the great men of the age, are they not?" "O yes, strong thinkers they are called; too strong alto- gether in their love of one particular figure of the New Testament, in which fire and brimstone are prominent. To us Orientals, Zoe, it seems very stupid in these mighty Anglo-Saxons to make their creeds out of our favorite tropes and metaphors, which are so abundantly scattered through the Bible. That comes of making metaphysics all in all in the exaggerated culture of the understanding, which is the order of the day. They will have to come round to our ground and acknowledge that the soul is something more than a sharp iron spike, christened intel- lect, to pry into things with. They have made a pretty mess of creation with their narrow way of dealing with it, and with human nature, that emanation from the Divinity. Anything is invaluable to them that shines, if it is nothing but a piece of old carbon, brightened up by staying under ground a few centuries. No matter what a theory is, if it is only brilliant and ingenious. Is it to be wondered at that the deep, crystal well of truth undefiled, hides itself from their shallow inquiries? And yet the most subtle results of the mind are like a dead mass of matter with- out it." "But there are a great many seekers after, and teachers of truth in these days, I should think," said Zoe. "Our new master speaks of the benefit he has derived from the   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    197 study of the German philosophers and theologians of the present day." 4' O yes, if people will get into the ' wild woods ' of dark speculation and skepticism-through their dullness, disobe- dience, pride and self-conceit in this late day of our Lord's kingdom, it is well that there are moral Hercules to ven- ture in and drag them out by the head and shoulders, all bruised and battered, and slay the hydra-headed moxnster in whose grasp they are struggling. Yet in a family, that is not considered the best child who, like a fool, is always running into mischief through rebellion; nor he the most agreeable member of it, who does nothing but drag him out of it and sour his temper, may-be, by continued castiga- tion; on the contrary, that one is best, who buds and flowers gracefully, as God intended it should, through the pure counsels and example of loving and enlightened parents, who, through his docile obedience, are at liberty to leave behind the beggarly elements of our. religion and go on to higher and still higher attainments in it. So in society, it seems to me that our Father loves and approves more of those of his children who receive, with a meek and docile temper, his instructions to them through his Christ, his greatest, truest, and purest messenger, comprised principally in his sermon on the Mount and his parables, believing implicitly in the good which he says will result from them, than those who stick in the crude thoughts of the heathen, who lived before his time, or who overlay the mind with the corruptions which crept into his church after it. For the Beatitudes are the nutriment which Jesus elaborated from all that was choicest and loveliest of the fruits and flowers in the moral and spiritual universe of which we are a part, and them he places before the ages, and by his life of benevolence and love, pleads with us to grow up into their sublime, and tender, and holy disposition, and live everlastingly. And where in them do we find the so-called 'essential doctrines of Christianity?l The spirit with  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7097-00000100"/> 198   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. which he walked among men, from childhood to manhood, which shone out in his obedience to his parents; in his zeal in the search after knowledge and light; his true sense of the use, which he was to make of his mighty powers; his humility, his affection, his patriotism, which embraced the widest philanthropy; and his philanthropy which in- closed as its nucleus the most heart-melting patriotism, when he foresaw his country's doom; his submission to his inevitable fate, and his martyr-death, crowned, as it was, with the clustered virtues of filial love, confiding friend. ship, forgiveness of enemies, disinterested regard for the penitent, resignation and trust-this spirit, I say, is the more than nectar, of which that of the gods was but a fee- ble type, which, by drinking of it fully and freely, will make us sublime and godlike as himself. And where in it do we find the assumption, the bigotry, the narrow policy, the corrupt yielding to the sins of the times, the misera. ble fear and distrust of God, the low ambition, hypocrisy, deception, cruelty, and fraud of multitudes, in the so- called churches of Christendom? The eye of the world is not couched to see all this; but I have a living proof of the truth of my sermon, which I fear has wearied you, in my beloved husband; and here is a letter from that same. Thank you, Carl," said she, as she received it from the hands of the lad who brought it. "I have not told you, Zoe, that he is absent for a few days.

"i shall have a merry time I know. I am so surprised to find the little parsoness so full of fun. We laughed and chatted together on our way home from the pic-nic in the public conveyance, and I mean to have a second edition of the frolic.' Full of this intention, she was running towards the house when she caught a glimpse of Mrs. Liebenhoff in the garden. She ran towards her and found her with her hus- band's open letter in her hand. "Ah,I have caught you in the very act, have I not? Is it so very charming to have a lover, which one has to meet by stealth and send messages to by craft, and in short to pine after in secret-the fascinating Cicisbeo?" "What do you mean? what has come over you?" said Mrs. Liebenhoff, looking at her in amazement, really fear- ing she had lost her wits; but she saw only the water- sprite with her laughing, innocent, happy face, who seemed (199)  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7097-00000101"/> 200   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. marvelously unconscious that she was saying anything offensive. She looked at her as if she would penetrate into her very soul, until Hilda was sober, surprised, and seemed as if she were ready to cry. i Ah, I see," said her friend, " you have been reading. some naughty book or other, which has sent your wits and sense of right astray. What is it, dear?" "Only ' Indiana,' by George Sand." "'Indiana!'" said Mrs. Liebenhoff. "Where did you get it? Does Miss Ingemann know what dangerous fiction has superseded her matter-of-fact class books?" "No, ma'am. Rinda brought it this -morning from her home. She says it is one of her elder sister's favorite books, and she lent it to me for an hout or two in which I could very well run through it. Where is the mighty harm, pray? 2 "In its leading you to trifle, as you have just done, with the most sacred feelings of womanhood, if in no other way, my dear Hilda. Read this sentence, and then talk to me of a Cicisbeo if you can. (She holds the letter so that she may see it.) 'Together have we borne the trials and quaffed the joys of our youth, each day made happier, and I trust holier by each other; and now that from the height of full middle-life we cast our horoscope anew, whatever may betide, whether sickness or health, prosperity or ad- versity, we know that we can, by the beautiful experience of the past, ever repose more and more upon each other's truth and affection, which shall be God-ministers to point to the virtues and joys of the heavens above.' " 1"But IIndiana ' had an old, cross husband who made her very wretched, and so she accepted a lover. Very wrong I know, but was she not to be pitied and excused, partially? Of course, ma'am, I was only in fun in speaking thus to you." "O yes, I know, and I agree that Indiana, and such as she, are to be pitied, who, for a loving protector and guide,   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    201 find in their marriage only a jailer, harsh, coarse, and repulsive. But our fortunes are not altogether in our own hands in this world. Indiana was under God's care and discipline no less than her husband's rule, and only he should have severed the bond between them." "4 Then you would bear everything from a cruel, heart- less tyrant until God saw fit to take him out of the world?" "I do not say that. There is a cause which annuls all obligation, because first broken down by the guilty husband; and it is vain to seek to keep united a one-sided bond. It is a contradiction in terms; but whatever betide, the wife is to keep herself true. What do I say! It is only for lawyers and courts to speak thus coldly and juridically of this delicate connection, or of aught that can sever it. To the pure and religious wife it has been formed by 'our Father.' It was He who saw how his child needed to be tempered, and trained, and through what trials or joys she was to weave -her wings for the skies. If he judged her strong and good enough to place in her keeping one of his most faulty ones; it was that through holy marriage he too might become meet for his presence. You can decide, Hilda, whether she fulfills her trust when she abandons him for a lover. And what was he, pray, this fascinating Cicisbeo?" , Why, a vulgar, vicious, disgusting fellow to-be-surel Yes, yes, I see it was all dreadful, and I am ashamed of myself and of speaking thus to you. Will you forgive me?' "When through marriage," said she, kissing her, " my Undine has a tender and more thoughtful soul breathed into her gladsome life, she will know better than to ever whisper to herself or her friends of Cicisbeos. But have done with preaching! I have already sermonized Zoe and sent her away for relief. Run and find her, dear."

"How do you like my new hat) ma'aml" said Hilda, untying it and laying it aside. "Very much," said she. a I noticed it the first moment you came, and thought it very becoming." "Then if you are a pious minister's wife, you like pretty things, I see." "Why not, pray? My eyes are set in my head very much like other people's, and I profess to have as good a taste as my neighbors. I always dress just as pretty as I have the means to, and always intend to." "So do I," said Zoe. "I wish I could be clad as prettily as the violets and lilies are. God adorns them beautifully, and I do not want to be a blot upon fair creation in my person more than in my mind and char- acter. I have become quite converted in this respect lately." ;' That is right," said Mrs. Liebenhoff, "only do not let dress encroach upon higher duties and tastes; and the more the latter take the first rank in our regard, to the well-balanced mind does external ornament seem appro- priate and harmonious." "I am delighted!" said Hilda. a I am going to dress well even when I am very old," said Mrs. Liebenhoff. "I shall not wear four caps and five shawls about my person, like a certain old lady I heard of the other day. It is more than my share, I should take up too great a proportion of room, besides looking like a formless heap of linsey-woolsey and cotton lace; and if I am a minister's wife, I am not one to ' wear a green ribbon and look very thankful? not I." "How old are you, Mrs. Liebenhoff?" said Hilda, with all simplicity. "What a daring question to ask a lady of my age!" said she. "That is one of the legitimate secrets of a woman past twenty-eight. The idea of my revealing it, indeed! What crooked fairy possesses the little girl this blessed   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    203 afternoon? But rather than disappoint your curiosity entirely, I will deign to inform you that I have arrived at the ' everlasting now,' which Carlyle tells us of. I am ashamed to have been so long in coming to this desired haven, but here I intend to fast moor my lifeboat and never be drifted away from it. My sister, Katrina, who is a dis- ciple of Spiritualism, says that there is no time in the heavenly sphere, and I see no reason why there should be here, especially to ladies of my nmature years. My soul is a great deal younger than when it was born into this murky time-world, because now I really begin to see daylight ahead, which is quite rejuvenating in its effect, I can assure you; so I am just of no age at all." "Good!" said Hilda, "only alas for the birthday gifts if that era never comes round!" "O, I get presents, I can assure you, notwithstanding that I live in eternity. Do you see this beautiful opal ring, my husband's last present, given me not to tell of his in- constancy, but that with the changes of life our love will only shine with a more varied lustre? I like jewels, they are so suggestive. My whole pearl, for instance, which the little fish forms to cover up some harassing, injurious, foreign substance, inserted by accident into its shell. What a lesson to me to envelope my troubles with the covering of a beautiful resignation, which will enable me to float through life, injuring no one by my harsh contact, but to give out the gentle radiance of this precious tribute of the sea!

"O intensely brilliant and sparkling and transparent, like the great lights of the present age, but with too little depth for me! Give me the pearl which has more soul than it displays to the shallow penetration of the day! ' Sour grapes,' you will say, as I. do not happen to have one. I used to try to get up great admiration for the dia- mond, thinking that it had been elaborating since time was, in the lowest strata of the earth's formation, but when I read that it is found in the sandstone, and of course is the- result of less time and cost, I lost my interest in it somewhat. Very splendid it is of course, but I can live without it- and if I were as rich as Croesus I would not give the foolish thousands for it that some do." "I met a lady in the street as I came here, who I am sure rouges; her cheeks were so delicately rosy, and I have seen her when she looked very sallow," said Hilda. "Perhaps she was flushed with heat," said Mrs. Lieben- hoff. "I never saw more than one or two in my life whom I suspected of having an artificial color. Did she look as if she were masked?" "No; I think it made her prettier than without it," said she. "She used rather too much powder. To be artisti- cally put on, it ought not to lie in lines but be suffused, so as to have the face look somewhat like a ripe peach with the down on." The two other ladies laughed. "Let me study yours," said the elder, "so that I may adopt your style, as I suppose you have got the right medium, being an artistic judge. Well, I shall take you for my model rather than Miss Lias, who puts so much on her cheeks as to make -them stand out in quite bold relief, while her eyes, surrounded as they are, with a dark circle, are cast into so deep a shadow, that they look as if some one had dealt them a heavy blow, forcing them quite back-   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    205 wards. I wonder if they are receding to look after the lady's brains. At any rate her process of beautifying her- self has a stunning effect upon me, I can assure you. O, Hilda! my fresh, fair and frank-hearted! give to the winds all thoughts of the paint, plaster, pomatum, and powder, for which young ladies in these days exchange their deli- cate natural beauties, only to disfigure and destroy them with these counterfeits. You are pretty enough without them. I take the responsibility of flattering you thus much." Hilda rushed impulsively to the little fountain near, and dipping her hand in the water, soon washed all traces of the powder from her face. "( Good-by to the first gay deceiver which has had the art to take me in; and I mean it shall be the last," said she. "I have not told you the news," seating herself, and beginning with fresh zest upon another subject. "Mrs. Gylich's wedding was yesterday. Only think! her husband has been dead but eight months. To be sure she married an intimate friend whom Mr. Gylich loved and confided in. She was truly inconsolable when he died, for they were warmly attached, and she was perfectly devoted to him; but she is very affectionate, and is one of those who always require some one to lean upon, and that is the reason she married so soon, I suppose." "And could she not wait even one little year," said Mrs. Liebenhoff, "and devote it to honor and cherish his mem- ory, and thus blend anew their separated, yet more than ever united lives; for when the death-vail divides them from earthly vision, who knows but a purer and closer union grows up between them, even while they walk to the com- mon eye so differently ensphered? And shall another presumptuously step between these two souls, who were everything to each other here, ere they adjust themselves as God would have them, to an experience of a higher and  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7097-00000104"/> 206  ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH, more celestial sympathy, growing out of the earthly and lasting for aye? Nothing would make me doubt so much whether this friend were fitted to succeed him in her affec- tions, as his appreciating no better the holiest and tenderest feelings of a woman's nature than to thrust himself thus early between them." "Zoe," continued Hilda, " says she cannot bear to think of second marriages at all, especially for a woman. She seems to consider it an unpardonable sin in her to contract one. Now there may be cases when it would be very natural and proper in my opinion. For instance, Indiana, who married an old, disagreeable husband, not because she loved him, but because her parents made the marriage for her, I think if he had died, and she and her lover wished to marry very much, they might do so, rather than for her to remain a forlorn widow all her days. Or, I will say, even if her husband were kind and she had loved him ever so much, if he chose to leave her and go to heaven, where, as everybody says he would be a thousand times happier than she can be here, marry again or not, I don't think he would be so selfish as to wish her to remain weeping till old age over his grave, while he, perhaps, was careering through the universe, seeing all the ibeautiful sights and hearing the delightful music with, perhaps, some fair young lady-angel, who knows? Now confess the truth, Mrs. Liebenhoff, could you not possibly be induced to marry the dear friend, and give the excuse, if you chose, that you were so lonesome, as they all do? Say, please." "My dear," said Mrs. Liebenhoff, "we will drop the subject where it is. It is one upon which I am accustomed to shun all personal reference. I am satisfied with my present destiny, and I have no wish to make any future reckoning upon this point." Hilda looked crest-fallen and Zoe disappointed, but after a pause the latter insisted with more confidence than was usual to her: "You said the other day, dear Mrs. Lieben-   ZOE'; oR, THE qUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   207 hoff, that you were accus tomed to live through many scenes to which we are liable in life, by imagination and sympathy, and that thus you had often prepared yourself for great emergencies. Why not this for our benefit?" -Well then," said she, with a rapid utterance, "who am I, to say that I would surely do or not do this or that in the future of a world in which God notes 'the sparrow's fall' and numbers the hairs of our heads? I have long since learned that such presumption is rebuked, by having done exactly contrary to what, in my impetuous youth, I avowed I would, and yet at the time, it seemed God's will. It might be the same in such a case. But of this, I may venture to be sure, that I never would link my life with another, divided as it would evert be to me, unless he had a nature broad enough, and a culture elevated enough to share with me each high and holy feeling, awakened by the changing experiences of life. Unless he would say in spirit, if not in words: ' I ask you to cover up for me no precious memory, or crush no natural wish to blend the name, and spirit, and deeds of him on high in meet and loving harmony with our own most consecrated acts. Together will we stand by his grave, and as I see your faithful remembrance of him, I gather fresh surety that you will be' true to me, and as you have done your full duty to the deceased, so no shadow shall be cast from his tomb, and no lament come sighing from over it to darken our marriage-day, or blend its discord with the sweet music of our bridal fete.' For when nature, religion, and love combine to weave themselves into a flower-garland and crown the brow of the true woman, there need be no fear that the different spheres of her earthly life will jostle against each other in rude and painful collision, but her heart will be more than broad and generous enough, and her soul too full of melting tenderness for him to fail of finding in its smile the heaven he pines for."

She had heard her last remarks. "A fresh breeze from the west!" said she. "Welcome! and brush away some of the cobwebs which are sticking about these little girls' brains this afternoon. They really are too much for me with their astonishing surprises and unexpected questionings. I should think you had been dealing with them. At any rate, I will pass them over to the strong-minded young American, for they quite upset my equilibrium," and her face assumed an anxious expression unusual to it. "You don't pretend to say that you find any man, living or dead, worthy of all that sentiment, do you? I think less of the German and Danish gentlemen, if possible, than I do of ours. Indeed I think I shall be ready to fall quite in love with them in toto when I go back; they seem to me so much more chivalrous and truly wise and refined, and in advance of yours in their judgment of us. To decide by what I have seen of a woman's life in Europe, it seems to be considered that, in general, she fulfills her mission when she cooks, sews, keeps the house, and tends the children; or if there is especial magnanimity and great desire to award her her full rights, she is to have a privi- lege commensurate with the whole length and breadth of her capacity, viz.: to make herself as pretty and agreeable as possible for his supreme and selfish plea- sure, or if he happens to get into trouble (of course she never does) he gives her full liberty to devote her life to his comfort and solace. What wonderful condescension!" "I know it is very much so among the majority; but the time will come when it will be seen that a woman's clear insight and quick moral sense are to serve as a barometer to warn society against corruption and sin; that her venera- tion and trust are to be the weather-vanes to keep the proud, speculative intellects of men in the direction of clear and starry skies; her charity and love are to enfold   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   209 and keep warm the heart of the world, which otherwise would be forever imbittered, estranged, enraged, crusted over with selfishness, or blackened by tyranny and wrong- those dragon's teeth from which horrible seeds spring up the armed demons which ravage the earth-and her artistic genius is to be the element which is to beautify, enrich, and glorify life. This is to be done first through her own ascendency of soul, and then by its natural action within the sphere designed for it by its Maker. In accomplishing this, her legitimate work, she will indeed include in it every proper and needful household duty, but above and beyond these, there will be spheres for her occupancy, which will save her from a weak and degrading dependence upon man, whose love, and protection, and sense of her value to him are not up to the requirements of her nature or the commandments of God.

"Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth Unseen, both when we wake and when we sleep.'"--IITON,. qM J   island of Iceland, of which Mrs. Liebenhoff was   I a native, was discovered by Naddod, a famous No wegian pirate, who was driven   hither by a tempest about the year A. D. 860.  Just before this period, Harold, the Fairhaired, had extended his dominion over all the petty kingdoms of Norway, and deprived the inhabitants of that liberty and independence which they had previously enjoyed. The consequence was that multitudes of their  best and bravest emigrated to the various islands in the     i neighborhood, but to none so much as to the more distant     i and larger one of Iceland. Here they hoped to be in security from the rule of the oppressor; nor were their hopes disappointed.*  In little more than half a century the Icelanders formed  themselves into a  regular republic on principles of the most perfect liberty, making a wise distribution of the different powers of government, enacting laws admirably adapted to the peculiar circumstances of the nation, and by their natural genius and love of liberty combined their interests (210) For these facts, see Henderson's Iceland.   and energies in support of a political system, at once cal- culated to protect the rights of individuals, and inspire the community at large with sentiments of exalted patriotism. For four hundred years they maintained for the most part this state of freedom, and when, at the end of that time, they became tributary to Norway, and afterwards were connected with Denmark, they were still permitted to retain the spirit and the government of a free people. The remote ancestor of Mrs. Liebenhoff, who emigrated to Iceland at its first settlement, was head officer of one quarter of the island, which was divided into prefectures or sheriffdoms. He was at the same time, as was required that he should be, a minister of religion, and upon him devolved the care of the temple and preservation of due respect for the rites of worship. His descendants had, with more or less of intermission, occupied the same, station, and her father had retained it, with great satisfaction to the community, for a period of nearly half a century up to the time of his death, which occurred a few years before. Thus born and nurtured among a free and religious peo- ple, she grew up breathing insensibly their best spirit, and in a home where narrow means contended daily with wide opportunities for the judicious and benevolent use of large ones, in which the dispositions and habitudes of both her parents harmonized much more with the dispensation of what is commonly thought sufficient by the more affluent, than with their own small yearly pittance, it followed that the most rigid economy in deed, though seldom alluded to by word, was the order of the household. To meet the various exigencies of such a life and preserve an honorable independence from pecuniary embarrassments, the child- ren, a goodly number, were inured to hardy toil and a careless freedom from reliance on any of the luxuries, which by many in the same station of life were considered indispensable. Living in a rural district, she shared the employments,  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7097-00000107"/> 212   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. the sports, and the means of culture of the country people, and in a severe climate where the greater part of the year the inhabitants are confined within doors, she grew up studious and contemplative. It is well known that the advancement of the Icelanders in science and literature has been of no inferior character. At a period when the darkest gloom was spread over the horizon of Europe, they were cultivating the arts of poetry and history, and laying up stores of knowledge which were not merely to supply posterity with data respecting the domestic and political affairs of their native country, but were also destined to, furnish very ample and satisfactory information on a great multiplicity of important points connected with the history of other nations. To this a wonderful combination of cir- cumstances proved favorable. The Norwegians, who first went over to Iceland, were sprung from some of the most distinguished families in the land of their nativity. They had been accustomed to listen to the traditionary tales of the deeds of other years and had frequented the public assemblies where they saw the value' and importance of knowledge. Their mythology and the wonderful scenery of their native land were favorable to the cultivation of poetic genius. The art of writing was for a long time little practiced, and in order to transmit to posterity an accurate knowledge of important events, history assumed the garb of a poetry peculiar, underived, and national in its character. The fame of the Skalds or poets of Iceland was not confined to their native country. They visited the courts of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, where they were re- ceived with the highest honors; and the Edda, which com- prises their most important poetry, and the Sagas their his- torical compositions, chiefly reliable for their truth, though occasionally wreathed with beautiful fictions, were dealt out to the admiring ears of their entertainers and reaped from them a rich reward.   ZO E; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    213 Thus, though the native of a bleak, barren, and frigid island, scarcely noticeable as the eye runs over the map of the more extensive and prouder countries of Europe, Mrs. Liebenhoff, it may be seen, grew up encircled by no mean environments. Naturally of a poetic and imaginative cast of mind, she found no lack of excitement for these pre- vailing traits in her quiet and secluded home in the liter- ature of her own country, no less than that of other lands which flowed in from time to time at the call of eager seekers after knowledge among the more cultured of her people. The natural wonders of the island, too, had a powerful effect upon her training. Here were burning mountains and eternal glaciers, rivers of lava, boiling springs and floating fields of ice, bringing from regions far to the north their intenser cold, and their wild, strange animals, where the sun is too feeble in its rays to dye their furs. Here was displayed also on a grand scale, the Aurora Borealis, those mystic heavenly lights, now flashing out in the horizon, -with a more weird-like lustre than the lightning, to disap- pear and be seen anew, blazing far up in the zenith, ex- tinguishing the north star's steady light, and putting to the blush the fervid planet Mars by their blazing stare into his face, and their eccentric whirligig around him. And when the dogs would howl and moan at the ghost-like music which accompanied their wondrous dance, she too would bend low with her protecting arm about their necks, and feel a suffocating sense of awe and dread, which made -her cling to them in strange companionship. For, to the gentle, loving woman-poet, the sublime and the awful are soon wearisome and overpowering, and she longs for the warm sunlight and tender shade, and sweet dews of even- ing, which may bring to her senses the distillation of flower, fruit, and tree, and hush her spiritual nature to the repose of silent communion, in which she can hear the 'still small voice" of God in the holy of holies, Thich be has !^             t      ^  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7097-00000108"/> 214   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.         - fashioned within all outer courts, even in the sanctuary of her own soul. But where in her cold clime, in which sum- mer is but welcomed ere it is flown, where nature seems in chaos, whole regions lying blasted as it were, by the scorching fires of some evil demon, and where centuries must roll on before they put on the garments of loveliness  which reflect the benignity and mercy of a God of these attributes, could she find the home of her yearnings? The occasional terrible devastations by volcanoes and ship- wrecks, and the various hardships of life in a rude and sterile country kept her sensibilities painfully upon the stretch.  Lacking the energetic,demonstrative qualities of  the other members of her family, who were ever efficiently  employed in deeds of useful benevolence, in which, it is true, she shared, though only in the quiet way suited to her disposition, she all the more sought for refuge amidst gentle scenes, and for a scope for the longings to do good consonant, at the samne time, with a generous nature and very retiring habits. To the Bible she resorted for the glowing home she de- sired, and the perfect ideal of her youthful aspirations. There she found, not only her way of duty and the path of peace, which comes from the sense of forgiveness, and the hope of eternal life through the knowledge of God and im- mortality brought by Jesus; but besides all these, the most subtle and satisfying food for her poetic being, the richest storehouse for her gorgeous fancies, and the fullest treasury of feeling with which to feed her craving, impassioned  nature. So that it came to pass, that in the usual cate- chetical exercise of the Sabbath morning, when, dressed in their simple best, the children would gather around their  pastor to answer his questions from the Scriptures, with  her brief reply to "I who was the first man, and where was he placed," there welled up images of living, paridisaical scenes, and of lovely innocence expressed in the perfect form of the first man and woman, which painted themselves   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   215 all the more enduringly upon her ardent artist-soul that they never were expressed. With Noah, she entered the ark and swept with the floods over the wreck of a drown- ing world. With Abraham, she sojourned; rejoiced with Sarah, and wept with Hagar over her sense of injury and desolation. With Moses, she led the Israelites through the wilderness towards the promised land, and shared with them their varied fortunes through the ages, as conquerors, as rebels from Jehovah, and captives in a foreign land, as freed from bondage, and as, with mingled feelings, they builded the walls of their temple anew. And with their history came breathing over her, even during the most chill and dreary Icelandic winter's night, the waving of palm-trees and of the cedars of Lebanon, the gurgling of the fountain, more precious than the gold of Ophir to the weary, dusty pilgrim of the desert, and the savor o f manna to her hungry nature. And with each inci- dent of historic life, and every scene of nature fromn the hallowed East, came blended as of yore the "Thus saith the Lordf to the acts of her present life and her dreams of the future. As she flowered into her full youth out of a many-sided, interior experience, needless to dwell upon, and Jesus, the faint ideal of her childhood, became the fixed pole-star of her maturity, little by little came out in full relief the perfection of his character, in which no quality stood out too prominently, leaving others only indicated, but in which all were in just proportion, making the whole full, round, and harmonious. As one great man after another rose and set in history or in society around her, wielding power for a brief period by some one over- grown development, she clung the more closely to the Leader of the ages, understanding through others' de- formities no less than his own transcendentsuperiority,the reason of their imperfect appreciation of him, and why, by some he was deified, and by others denied. Then came the resolve, which grew stronger and stronger with years,  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7097-00000109"/> 216   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.         / first to live out her own conception of him as revealed to herself, and afterwards through her imagination and cul- ture, to represent it, weaving into her fiction thoughts upon the position, and wants, and destiny of her sex in the civil- ization of the day; for in the uprising of the feminine element did she foresee the restoration of the world. Married as she was most happily after the period of her early, stormy youth to a man of an intellect, character, and heart rare in their truthfulness, enlargement, and tender- ness, she found in him the guide and example to aid her in her secret life-wish, and deemed herself blessed in a com- panionship with him through a broad range of her being, though into its intenser life his calm, and clear, and equa- ble soul was never spontaneously led, and of which, there- fore, on account of her reserve on points where she was not instinctively met, he had but little cognizance. Mrs. Liebenhoff and Mrs. Kotrner were now in the happy reception of a visit from their relatives from Iceland, two sisters and a  brother-in-law, with their children. After some playful dispute between the sisters, the parties were finally arranged to the satisfaction of both, and a pretty equal division made of the guests between the two mansions. Mrs. Hansen, one of the guest-sisters, the next older to Mrs. Liebenhoff, between whom there had ever been a strong affection and sympathy, though in some respects very different, had lately become deeply interested in the subject of Spiritualism. This wide-spread delusion, if such i it can be called, had taken its rise in America, but as spon- taneous movements among masses of people are almost always simultaneous in different regions, showing the magical sympathy ever existing between the great family of humanity, so in Europe it was beginning to attract much attention. Mrs. Hansen, a  woman of a strong, healthy mind and physique, with no predominance of imagination, but with an exact, practical intellect and of a high-toned, deeply religious character, had been led, by curiosity in   ZOi$; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   217 the first place, to investigate the subject. After a few ex- periments, too well known to be repeated, to bring herself, as is supposed, into communication with the spiritual world, she had been astonished at the developments made to her inner life and its increased wealth and enjoyment thereby. As the two sisters were sitting together the day after their arrival, the subject was introduced. "It surprised me," said Mrs. Liebenhoff, "to hear of your being a subject of this mania, with your sound judg- ment to keep you right." "Do not call it a mania," replied Mrs. Hansen; " for it seems to me the only true life, this close intercourse with the spiritual world, which is granted me." "u I do not feel disposed to deny its truth yet, any more than that of many other subjects which come up at the present day. I simply wait for further data and a stronger light thrown on it thereby, before, I determine its reality. But this much I must say, that we are very ignorant of the nature of our minds, and still more in the dark upon the subject of Inspiration, the way in which we are influenced by the great Spirit of the universe; and as yet I have seen or heard nothing well authenticated which convinces me that a new mode of communication is opened between us and heaven." "How can I account then for my power of writing invo- luntarily of what had never before entered my mind, and of receiving from different spirits, from our brother's for instance, information which I knew not froth any other souree V "Have you never had any false or mistaken information given?"

"Have you always communications from the good who have departed?" "No; one evening I was conversing with your friend, Helenor, and I was telling her of my high estimate of her character while on earth, and the good I had derived from it, when my arm was sensibly twitched. I turned, and was addressed by a low spirit who rebuked me for flattering thus, saying, it would make her vain. ' And who are you, friend?' I said. He spoke the familiar name of Heinrich, who died soon after our venerable father. He said he had through all these years, been wandering in the lowest sphere, and knew not how to rise. ' Can you notsay, God be merciful to me a sinner!' 'That is it, that is it,' said he exultingly-and so much power have these words had upon his state that he has already risen to the third sphere." "I do not think you gain much by enlarging your so- ciety, if he is a specimen of your spirit-acquaintances. We all know the blessed effect of penitence without such a revelation." "That is an exception to the general rule. But it is impressed upon me, that I must write." She takes pen and paper, and in an unexcited manner, writes a page and reads it to Mrs. Liebenhoff. At the con- clusion, she said, "Now these thoughts are new to me. I never even dreamed of them before. They are not mine, but your friend Nora's." "And yet, they are in perfect harmony with Katrina Hansen's mind, character, attainments and usual mode of expression. It would require a warping of my judgment to believe these thoughts the product of any one but your- self, guided in the usual mode by the good spirit which is ever about us, helping our infirmities. One may easily be deceived upon this point, until we have much self-know- ledge. Our thoughts come to us we know not how, or from whence.

"I am disappointed. I looked for sympathy from you, Lisbet." 1"And you have it, my beloved sister. Heaven forbid that it should be wanting in any experience of your life, when yours has ever been so full, so generous, and more than appreciating for me. But by keeping my judgment cool and uttering my distinct convictions, we both gain more than by any weak, yielding sympathy. I O0, certainly; and now what theory contrary to mine have you to offer me, for you may'be sure of its receiving my full attention. Your remarks just now do not convince me." "I must commence with a few words upon what I con- sider the connection of the Supreme Being with our spirits, if it will not tire you." "No, certainly, H wish to know the result of your own thoughts upon this engrossing subject." "I feel that the union of our souls with God, is regarded too much as a technical and narrow thing. It is thought that he at one time, inspires more than at another, and that to some persons, he is partial in the bestowal of the great gift of his spiritual influence; arbitrarily endowing them with a clearer insight into the glorious working of his uni- verse, and a closer intimacy with his divine counsels. But this seems unworthy of his greatness, and a reflection upon his goodness. To me, God is the Sun of the moral and  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7097-00000111"/> 220   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. spiritual universe. His beneficent light pervades all space, and his parental love is the warmth, life, and fructifying power by which all creatures live, move, and have their being. In nature one object absorbs and another reflects the rays of the natural sun, according to their essence and quality, and nothing on the earth's surface remains unaf- fected by its radiance, in a greater or less degree, accord- ing to its capacity of reception. So with humanity, ac- cording to each one's obedience to the laws of his being and the requisitions of the spiritual universe, is he a recipi-  ent of God's light in his soul. If that temple for its in- dwelling is marred by sin, or darkened by ignorance, or contracted by the vail drawn across its portals by bigotry,  intolerance, or narrow prejudice, and incrusted by pride, selfishness, vainglory, and Pharisaic self-satisfaction, then  but an imperfect enlightenment reaches the spirit enshrined within, and it gives out in consequence but feeble, flicker- ing beams for its own guidance or the world's advantage. But if through our fidelity in using God's abundant means of grace, we, who are made to reflect his image, keep the portals of our souls wide open for the reception of his inspiring spirit, then are we blessed with its full flow, for his measure of its gift irs stinted only by our self-inflicted inca- pacity of receiving it?" "Then you think the inspiration of Jesus differed in degree only, not in kind from that of other beings?"     "That is all. In his pure soul there was no obstruction ! to the true light as it came from God, and therefore he is i the enlightener of the world. No other one has shown a like obedience to the conditions of this inspiration; there- fore the mingled light and darkness of men's counsels." "But what has this to do with communications from spirits? These ideas of yours annul no such possibility. , No, very true. As on earth we gather suggestions from other minds of the past and present, so there seems to me no impossibility that we may from the spirits beyond the   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    221 vail. Provided the great fact of spiritual influence is established, and men waken up from their earthness and vice, the medium of that influence, if it be good, is com- paratively of. small importance. This however is my own experience.

Do not think I complain of this; I simply speak of it as a fact. rhe capsule which incloses and ripens the seeds which are to perpetuate its life, may be long in maturing, or in finding a fitting soil in which they may germinate; but it bides its time, and finally it opens, and the ripened germs are scattered far and wide, where every element stands ready to perfect its life-work. Thus with me. But in this half isolation, weighed down at times by imperfect fellowship, think you I would seek to slake my longing, even at the fount of an archangel's pity, or a seraph's sympathy? No, no. By the great privi- lege taught us by our Christian faith; by the sublime power we have of mounting to the Infinite himself, where alone the soul may find its home, its refuge and its inspiration, I am led to desire no lower revelations. When weary of the world's babble, and sick at heart of its folly and blindness, I fly to solitude and God, shall my most sacred moments be broken in upon by some vulgar spirit's interruption? Excuse me, Katrina; but we are accustomed to speak plainly to each other." -"Yes, but if you could be useful to it!" "If it heed not the greater light which we are accus- tomed to think floods the higher sphere, I should distrust the timeliness of my interference. But you always were a missionary of good to the unhappy here, and if you have found a new sphere of doing the same work, my sister, I would be the last to throw cold words upon your enter- prise."  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7097-00000112"/> 222   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. "How do you account for the strange phenomena con- nected with this subject which we hear and read of on every side?" "I cannot explain them. There are some strange mani- festations from all accounts, though I have never seen them. But this I know, that there is great ignorance, as I have said, prevalent upon the philosophy of the mind, its natural workings, and its union with God. The imagina- tion, too, has great power over the multitudes; and besides this, it is a subject fruitful of opportunities for fraud and charlatanism, and there has been an abundance of these connected with it. It is interesting to me chiefly from its showing so conclusively that the spiritual nature will vindi- cate its supremacy, though at first it may do it in strange and awkward fashion. I trust that more light will be thrown upon this interesting subject, and that through this upward movement of humanity, when explained on rational and Christian grounds, the age may take a long stride in the march of true progress. I have a set of subjects which I call the indefinites. I cannot decide upon their truth or falsehood in my present state of knowledge and character. So I patiently wait, leaving my mind open to what truth may be granted to my candid inquiries. This is one of them. I neither believe nor disbelieve the wonderful things I hear, but making great allowance for extravagances in this new theory, I feel that'it is to lead to some truth relat- ing to the spiritual connection between all beings of the past and present, and with our Father in heaven, which we have yet not fully understood. And for the rest, I trust in the progress of the human soul, and will not seek to tear open untimely the bud of God's events, but wait for the natural method of the flowering of his truth on earth. For your calm, well-balanced mind I have no fear of fanaticism, but hope that through it some light may be elicited, which may be serviceable to us all."

"4 I am most happy to hear it; only keep your mind open to new convictions and nothing but good can come from it. But the danger to the masses is that they materalize heaven by low conceptions upon spiritual influence rather than exalt the present. Fanaticism is always dangerous, for it burns the soul with the unholy fire of earthly passion, while the subject thinks himself within the very gates of heaven. Then we do not need new mediums between us and God, so much as to take to heart the teachings of Jesus, which ever point to direct communion with him. The world is prone to idolatry. At one time, it deifies one set of ob- jects and then another; it is so hard for the human Inin to soar to the centre of Infinity itself, and yet from thence alone shall we bring home our choicest blessings. Pray heaven this Spiritualism be not the Fetichism of the nine- teenth century, but may lead on to a higher development, and to'a more natural and universal union with God and his'Christ than the world has yet known?  "Here is your manuscript, dear Lisbet," said Mrs. Hansen; "I have kept it concealed as you desired, only showing it to one or two persons in all these years. On looking over it of late, I have felt that you must have writ- ten it under spiritual impression. Good morning for an hour! I will call on Lina as I promised her.?'

I had forgotten almost its every incident, and now I see it was but the embodiment of rules I laid down for my life's observance. (She reads.) Pretty well,  Lisbet, written as it was more than a score of years ago, and I am not so very very old even now. Why verily, the  doctors of divinity are still groping in the muddy waters of their dark theology, while a simple country girl worked her mind clear of the dross of dogmas, and pierced the very core of Christian truth, and fed upon its marrow! And has not my soul thriven by it? Read the early and the later Tale, and which is the more youthful in tone and spirit, though a greater acquaintance with life, literature, and character gives to the last the varied and dramatic life, which the other so much lacks. What a sermon!  The story but a thread to hang grave thoughts upon, but its principles laid down for a life-guide, not less condensed and clear than my maturer life could furnish. I rather beg pardon of the aforesaid doctors that I did not publish it for their benefit; they plunge and wallow still in such dark., muddy pools. I will lay thee tenderly aside, for thou wert the healthful dewdrops exhaling from my soul after the exhausting, gory sweat drawn from it by its life-battle with the powers of evil without and the grim fancies and horri. ble fears, magnifying the errors of its youth within, con- jured up by the so-called Christian, but in fact heathenish theology, whose malaria lurks even in homes whose inmates strive to attain and teach the perfect truth of Jesus.

Shall I dedi- cate it to my young class of girls, who gather around me on every Sabbath, and thus give it to the world?

It may be that to many a young heart working out life's problem, it may hint of the reward awaiting the faithful and patient laborer. But no; I shrink from this effort of my timid, fluttering youth being thrust scornfully by or sneered at by critics, who measure by superficial rule and Gunter. For the work of my maturity, I care not; but thou at least, my firsthorn, pale, spring floweret, shalt have a gentle euthanasy, and therefore I, thy mother, consign thee without a sigh to the shadows of oblivion!" During the visit of the relatives at Copenhagen, the two sisters visited with them the different objects of interest in the city, and among others, for the gratification of the child- ren particularly, the museum. There they met an unfor- tunate woman, an attendant, and it may be, a part of the show, who called forth their sympathy and interest. Mrs. Liebenhoff, who had a nervous dread of monstrosities, tried to evade her, but hearing her, in conversation with her brother, utter the sentiments of a pure and resigned spirit, she conquered her repugnance and approached her. The woman fixed her eyes upon her and asked if she wished to have her fortune Itold? Impulsively she answered yes, then hesitated and half refused; but at length crossed the Sybil's hand with the required piece of silver and seated herself beside her. She took a pack of cards and slowly passed them through her hands, reading at the same time the number upon their surface, and as she said, the book of Mrs. Liebenhoff's experience. She suggested to her her prominent traits of character and mind, and also some of the most striking events of her past life, and then looked into the future and told her of its destiny. She did not insist upon the truth of her prophecies; spoke of the art as an entertainment to herself and others, and ended by saying; 'If the events of your future life prove my words true, you will remember and think kindly of her who foretold them."

Her friends gathered around her again, for she had not permitted them to be present during the interview. "Good luck, Lisbet?" said Mr. Hansen. "O yes, plenty of money, that is good fortune, is it not? and I shall not have to ask my husband for it either," said she. "Children in flocks, I suppose?" "O yes, of course; twins and all, more than I can manage." 4 What did she tell you, dear?" said Mr. Liebenhoff. "A wonderful fact! how could she have known it; that my husband tenderly loved me? She must be a conjurer truly to learn that!" 4"But, joking aside, did she really startle you by any unexpected revelation?" "Truly then, she did. Events in my life which I have not thought of for years, she spoke of in the most matter- of-course way. When I asked her how she performed the art, seeing her do nothing but read her cards in a dreamy manner and look with some attention in my face, she touched her head and said, ' It is partly in my brain.' " "And you consider the gift as a compensation for your misfortune, do'you not?' said I to her. "'Yes,' said she, 'it brings me near my kind, and they remember me with tenderness;' then looking again intently in my face, she said, ' You have a lively mind, full of fancies, and you love women.' "'Shall I write a book?' said I. "' Do you wish to?' "O yes.' She read her cards. ' O yes,' said she,' you will write three.' 6"The poor unfortunate public! thought I. 'Will they be read?' said I, anxiously, ' for I never like to lose my labor.'   zoE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TtIUMPH.   227 "'I told you, said she with a tone slightly impatient, 'that you had a lively fancy,' as if that were a sufficient answer, and then began to count the money; five hundred, nine hundred, and so on, until she seemed tired, and then ended with, ' You will have plenty;' and then, but with no leer, she added: 'And you love men too.' She then played with my bracelet as a child would do, looking confidingly into my face from time to time, when I left her to rejoin my friends, she at the same time going out, each looking back to find the other gazing at her until out of sight." "Is that all?" said Mr. Korner. "All that I shall tell you now," said she, thoughtfully. "It has given a new phase to my thoughts at any rate. Was it through magnetic sympathy that she possessed her- self of floating images which, at some period of my life, have been in my mind? If so, it is wonderful enough; or does God impart to her, through some peculiarity of consti- tution, the power to read futurity? Verily, ' there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our philosophy ." "She was impressed, no doubt,' said Mr. Korner, with a sly glance at Mrs. Hansen. "What is the world of women coming to?"' , Two of them, to say the least, are getting quite off my track," said his wife, with a face of solicitude. "Lina, my dear, do not be anxious about Katrina, so as to enjoy her visit to us less because she is investigating this subject of Spiritualism. Who of us are calmer than she? ,If she is mad, it is with a method most serene and self-possessed, and I promise you that I forswear all means to place myself in communication with ghosts, black, white, or 'gray. No, no, there are enough of stupid, impracticable people on this earth-sphere for my equability of temper, and I find it rather doubtful whether one falls among better ones in the other. So you need not fear me? "I am told," said Mrs. Hansen, " that the air of your  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7097-00000115"/> 228   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. city is so impure that the highest order of them cannot breathe its impurities." "Heaven defend us from the lower ones, I say!

To him I commend myself rather than to the dainty spirits whose interest for us is graduated by more or less of carbonic acid gas. That is too much like our petty aristocracy, in their decisions of who are good enough for their refined companionship. Save me from such contracted sympathies, say I."

He approaches the door which is wide open, and she is standing directly in front of it with her eyes upon him, but w at which he nevertheless knocks and stands until he is bid- den to enter, when he bows profoundly.   it The lady aside: ,r Truly a most oriental mode of enter- ing the presence of the royal sex! But it is all very well. As women are henceforth to take the lead in life, I am glad : that one man's manners are on the whole up to the idea." ' Good morning, ma'am; I come to you in the sublimnest possible mood. After my wanderings of ages and the mul- tiform experience of fifty centuries' existence in which I  have ever, with a child-like eagerness, clung to some fond dreams of personal happiness, I have resolved to cast them  to the winds and live for Truth alone."  "A very sensible and pious resolution, and I rejoice that resignation, that plant, it would seem, of tardy growth  in the harsh soil of a man's nature, has at length flowered  in yours! With women it fructifies almost spontaneously; the soil, if not so strong, being more mellow and pervious to skyey influences.  Nevertheless I congratulate you. Better late than never." "But lo! a  strange phenomenon attended the stern sacri-  fice! As with a struggle such as divides the soul from our    corporeal part, and with a gasp of agony I flung them from me; amazed I saw come trooping towards me the angels of Hope, of Joy, of Peace and Victory, bearing in their hands their different symbols, and attended by cherubs, scattering from golden vases the flowers and perfumes of the heavenly sphere, so that where I looked to travel henceforth in the rugged path of self-renunciation, I found -it strewn with roses, and the sweet, heavenly company awaiting to attend me." "O yes, that is of course the natural result of yielding up one's blind, selfish will to the guidance of the wiser one of the Supreme. Plod on patiently five centuries longer, and I have no doubt that then this truth will be thoroughly stamped upon man's nature; that God never intended that we should live in an exhausted receiver, but in this living, boundless universe, every part of which will minister to his health, happiness, and highest good, pro- vided we journey through life in parallel lines with his harmonious appointments. Now that you have schooled yourself to submission to all evils which may await you in particular and the universe in general, it may be the most fitting time to announce to you the painful intelligence that I shall for a time deprive you of the felicity of admin- istering to the stupidity of a preoccupied mind. I relin- quish the study of Hebrew for the present." 4I cannot listen to your determination for a moment, madam. Allow me to use the privilege, which my position as an instructor gives me, and earnestly insist upon your continuance of the study." "Your urgency is of no avail, sir. I have sublunary reasons sufficient to determine me, and besides this, I am bidden through a friend by the spirits beyond this time- vail, to keep my mind perfectly passive. I wonder if they think to impress me against my will? I defy them. So I shall relinquish the study." He fixes his eye upon her and says emphatically: " You  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7097-00000117"/> 232   ZOE; OR- THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPEH. will please read these four pages; you will have no diffi. culty in doing it. Keep your mind passive, and this tongue of Eld, the great medium of God's subtle influence over the ages, shall enrich your life by its possession. And what a mine of wealth does it unfold to the waiting soul! Not through the vulgar, school-boy notion of plenary inspi- ration, as if each line and word were a magic spell to keep the darkened, timid mind in fetters that it go not astray, leading it into idolatry of ink, parchment, and letter-press, no less gross and still more crushing to human nature than that which deifies the elements, the fruits and flowers, the sun, moon, and planetary bodies, and the ideal of man and woman; but through its spirit, which is in perfect harmony with common sense and reason. As in my passage through the ages I paused in Greece and Rome, and took 'note of their Deities-Jupiter, Minerva, Mercury, Juno, Bacchus, and Venus-and thus saw these their thoughts expressed to the eye in their almost living, breathing works of Art, though to worship such seemed most unmeet to me, to whom the one true God has been revealed, yet was I glad that to any people it was permitted to reveal in its perfec- tion the wondrous handiwork of God, the human form, the living temple of his image here on earth. And as I gazed upon the Muses, beautiful representations of poetic woman. hood, to whom is given in keeping some great Art to teach and to transmit to coming humanity, I rejoiced that such ,broad glimpses were permitted to these early times of her high mission here below. Surely, thought I, when cometh the brighter light promised to my people, men will see clearly that those earth-gods are but the types, the reflec- tions, the imperfect embodiment of the great idea of a universal Father, all-wise, all-present, joyous, beautiful,  and loving. And when the truth of the Messiah shall flower in lovely woman, a tenderer grace shall sit upon her brow than any that adorned these Muses; for endued with the true Christian spirit, home, through her affections and   ZOE, OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    238 always be a sfhadow cast over every enjoyment. But with- But appealing to Zoe, as had always been her wont in her psychological questionings, she reflected long enough to have the conviction take ,root in her mind, that God has such ever-watchful and tender care over us that he kindly places guardians to defend us from pride and presump- tion-those giant enemies of the soul-through a painful inner experience, or by the chafing of some outward cir- cumstances against it sufficiently to keep it quickened to the point of unrest in the present, that the futute good may be the more eagerly sought for. Another cause of solicitude to Hilda was Zoe's interior life as well as her outward prospects. She understood pretty well now, how she would be looked upon in the con- ventional. state of society they would find in Santa Cruz. But besides this, she iead in her friend's face-and manner, that the excitement under which she had written her Tale, was passing away, leaving her prostrated in health and deeply dejected in mind. It was true that a terriblb revulsion was taking place in Zoe's whole being. She was of a highly susceptible, ner- vous organization, which had never been taken much into account in her training, so that imperfectly disciplined as she was, in the practical and common-place departments of life, it combined, with her vivid and ever-active imagi- nation, to distress and perplex her. Her health was suf- fering, first from being overtaxed in her studies; and now by the transition from a temperate to a tropical climate. Like the balloon- of fragile texture and workmanship, which carries within :it, at the same time, its own propel- ling force and its sure cause of ultimate, destruction, so Zoies soul flamed up and flickered hither and thither with every movement of its' delicate car, threatening to consume the latter and dissipate its sustaining, ethereal element to the, four winds of heaven. She understood not yet the intimate connection there is 20  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7097-00000118"/> 234   ZOiE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. between the, corporeal, the mental, and spiritual constitu- tion, therefore, when her spirits sank to a lower, tone than, ever before, in, proportion to their late elevation, she thought it must be from some perverse' sinfulness in herself. The work, which, subdued in its tone as it was, had been a lyric to the Most High, now seemed mean and dull, and filled her with disgust. In vain, as she approached the termination of her voyage,  did she strive to rise above her depression. How could she meet the parents from whom she had so long been separated, who had sacrificed so much for her, with heavi- ness of spirit and the inanimate expression which revealed but too plainly her want of interest in life, or anything that pertained to itl But the greater her struggles the more signal was her spirit's defeat. A mountainous weight set- tled upon it, a heavy pall folded itself over her, unaccountable even to one whose life had ever been so unjoyous as, hers. -In this mood, her eye fell upon her manuscript. It glared upon her as if it were the ghost of every fast-fleeting vision of her childhood and youth. "And this is all that my whole life's aspirations have been able to make real! Fool, fool that I am, to separate my mind from the actual, until I feel strange and-forlorn in the world in which God has placed me to be useful, and among my fellows, whom it was intended that I should benefit, but- whom, by my presumptuous dreamings, I cannot now bring within the sphere of my possible influence. You, at least, deluding cheat, will I sacrifice to the manes of every hope and de- sire of the future, which I but too plainly see, are never more to revisit me." She seized it impulsively, and tying it to an orange which Mr. Stephenson had given her, was on the point of dropping it into the deep. "What are you doing, Zoe?" said Hilda, startled from her reverie, for even she could dream now. Your manu-   2ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   235 script! you are crazy ' and she threw an alarmed look at her friends face, while she caught hold of it. 4 Less than ever before, Hilda, for now I see what an idiot I have been all my life! As if Icould write anything fit to read. Give it me, dear; I never want to see it again." ' No, no, indeed! Give it to me, Zoe.' "I am afraid you will show it to some one." "No, I will not. Only give it to me." ZoE felt too little spirit or interest in anything to contend about the matter, so her infant production went away not only from the gaze of the world, but she who gave it birth, after a whole lifers throe of untold agony spurned it froit her as a poor, worthless, unacceptable expression of her love for her Master, and with sinking despondency, saw no other way in which she could glorify him. They were now within sight of Santa Cruz. The emer- ald green of its fields of sugar-cane, the deep verdure of its forest trees came out gradually to the eye, and their aroma to the scent, as they approached, and now the low- roofed, veranda-circled houses, the clusters of negro huts, and then the barracks and custom-house, with its arched oriental-like entrance, stood before them. The boat was lowered, the luggage secured, a few strokes of the oar given to the gentle waiting Caribbean, and its' child, who had so tenderly and tearfully yearned for it in her exile, was borne lovingly upon its waves to the shore. The passengers first went to the custom-house, to submit to the examination of their luggage. Hilda and Zoe were standing at the door, looking around for a hackman, when a dark, grave man sauntered in. He started on seeing the two girls, looked admiringly at Hilda's tall, elegant figure and animated face; then upon Zoe, and exclaimed, "My child, can this be you?" and the next moment she was folded in her father's arms! O susceptible, sensitive, thrilling soul of woman! giving  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7097-00000119"/> 236   ZOE; OR, -THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. to thy sympathetic, fleshy envelope hundreds of, eyes, myriads of ears, and the power of reading the inner thoughts and feelings of the world about thee, and of -returning to it from the 'fountain within thee, either an inspiration to high endeavor and strength to accomplish mighty deeds in the inner and the outer life, or Circe-like, alluring to death, or, what-is worse, to the spirit's bondage to sin and evil! Heed wells the power invested in thee, and it shall be a ministry -to lift thee and thy fellows heavenward-neglect or pervert it, and it may drag them and thyself down to the lowest Erebus! Through this subtle magnetism of an etherealized spirit, Zoe read in her father's, eye, in his somewhat constrained Bpanner, and his brooding brow, that he compared her un- favorably with her brilliant companion, and, that he was disappointed in the result of his life-long labor and sacri- fice for her. This, of course, only threw a deeper shadow over her spirits, and unnerved her for the meeting with her mother. Hilda and she separated at the custom-house, the former saying, as she bade her good evening, "I shall see you to-morrow:" and in a few moments she was folded in her mother's embrace. This, my child, was dead and is alive again; she was lost and is found!" said Sophia, in the rapt language in which she now often expressed herself.      , Zoe's life had been one of yearning and unrest. In her outpourings of sentiment, she had always coupled her mother with the cravings of her deepest nature; She had felt that, if she could but once be pressed to her bosom*, new life would be given her, and that she should start up quickened as from a second and conscious birth. How different from the letter was the reality! She had but just strength to totter towards her, and, for the first time in her life, swooned entirely away. [       "God did anoint thee with his odorous oil, To wrestle, not reign."--ELIZABETH BARRETT BIROWNING. SiB  o B (T3BP)3-3L, was surprised at the arrival of Hilda thus prematurely, and delighted to see her beau- tiful development of person, and self-possessed, dignified carriage. Mr. Strophel was too infirm in body and mind to notice tier with very warm and continued interest, but asked her repeatedly, "How she left the health of their majesties in Copenhagen." Alice, the younger daughter, looked wonderingly at her, and divided her attention between her newly-arrived sister and her spaniel, for an hour, and then ran away to have an undisturbed frolic with her pet. In the evening, her. two married sisters, who resided in Fredericstadt, came in to greet the new comer. One of :them, Mrs. Warrington, who had been educated in Eng- land, 'thus living away from her home for many years, seeming to, understand what Hilda's feelings would natu- rally be on coming home to so many stranger relatives, seated :herself by her side, and caressed, and spoke to her in tones of endearment and warm affection. But the great subject of interest and never-ending talk was the insurrection, the conduct of the blacks, the advent of the Spanish soldiers, their departure, together with dis- contented references to the conduct of the governor-gene- ral., So that Hilda soon gained the impression that this beautiful Eden, which had risen to her vision from the ( 237 )  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7097-00000120"/> 238   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. waves of the azure-tinted sea as she gazed upon it, was made the abode of discontent and strife by artificial usages, false and barbarous customs, and the lack of the life- inspiring influence of the pure and simple religion of Jesus, freed from heathen admixtures. Before she retired, she communicated to her mother her attachment to Mr. Stephenson. She was minute in her inquiries of his parentage and standing in society, his fortune and his prospects in life, and the result of her conversation with her daughter was her expression of satis- faction at her future prospects. The next morning on rising from breakfast, Hilda said, "I must go and see Zoe." "My dear," said her mother, "I hope you are going to drop your acquaintance with George Carlan's daughter." Mamma?! said Hilda, reddening from sudden excite- ment.  "Of course, you will not continue your foolish school- girl friendship with that lowhorn Quadroon. I don't like it  very well,.that Miss Ingemann permitted it. Did she think that my daughter was worthy of no better companion?" (' Zoei is a lady!" said Hilda, " and more than that, she is the most precious soul that ever lived; and dear mamma," she continued, with enthusiasm, 4" she is my beloved and most valued friend!' ' "Nonsense, Hilda, what will be thought of you, if you are seen among the colored people on any terms of equal- ity? I can't permit it, and there is nothing more to be said about it "-and she went out to give directions to her ser- vants. Hilda obeyed so far, as to say no more about the matter, but went immediately to Zoe. She looked ill, and she knew that she was sad, but was evidently trying to make herself at home with her father, and to interest herself in her mother's occupations and little family arrangements. Some of her cousins came -in to. see her, and them she   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    239 received with great sweetness, though Iilda knew how painful it must be to her affectionate nature, to find among them none who could give her companionship, excepting in her most trifling hours. She mentally resolved to .be more to her in the future, than she had ever been. Towards evening, Zoe and her mother walked upon the sea-shore, and had it not been for the weight of disappoint- ment, at the non-fulfillment of her religious dreams and aspirations, her deadness of interest in the present, and her growing anxiety for the future, both in this world and the, next, she could not but have drank in with delight the charms with which a tropical sea, sunset and perennial verdure enriched the landscape around her. She was not disappointed in her mother. She was simple, affectionate, pure and a true and ardent lover of Nature, and she longed to be able, as she laid her head on her breast, to unburden the woes of her soul. But that she could not do, even to her, for she felt that to her parent's circumscribed mental vision and comparatively narrow imaginative outlook, the revelation of the dreams, of which she was compounded, so entirely had she blended her whole interior life with them, would' make her' start back aghast; or, if she should reveal her disappointment and consequent depression, it would be the means of sep- arating them heaven-wide apart, through the natural re- buke she would give her. So she labored on with that heaviest and most discouraging burden, a sick, weary and remorseful soul. With her father, she felt under continual restraint. He was superficial in his philosophy, worldly in his aims and desires, and narrow and one-sided in his judgment of human nature and character. He was a dis- appointed man, because he had looked for the uprising of himself ahd his race, through external power and worldly advantages, instead of through the patient, steady growth of character and soul. Even if Zoe had appeared in her most favorable light, he would not have been satisfied, for  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7097-00000121"/> 240   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. he- wished her to be a showy, striking, handsome person, with-obvious energy and force of character, and that lofti- ness of demeanor which impresses the shallow, and com- pels outward adherence and a show of respect, though the inner spirit may all the time chafe, curse, despise, and slily use all possible means to evade its influence.: Zoe strove to-be social and lively, but this was harder than all besides, for as it was not in accordance with her darken ed spirit, she shrank from expressing what, she did not feel. She reflected more and more upon the failure of'her hopes, more and more did her self-respect leave her, more and more glaring did her lifelong mistake weigh down her whole being. Thus week after week passed away. It did not matter to her that she was not received into the social circles of the whites. Had she been so, it would not have enlarged her estimate of herself--that she was ignored by- them did not change her opinion of her own deserts. To God, she had always looked for approval and impulse-from Him, she had hitherto received a full measure of inspiration and encouragement.  Onlie only, did she show the least symptom of resent- ment'at the prevailing prejudices against her caste, and its disregard of justice in its blind adherence to the floating surface of things. She had made the acquaintance of a Santa Cruz lady at Mr. Liebenhof's, to whom she had brought letters of in- troduction, and it had so happened, that she was able to pay her many little attentions, and give her, in several instances, valuable aid in settling herself comfortably for a summer residence in Copenhagen. Hilda, on the contrary, not taking a liking to her, and being occupied with her own affairs, paid her scarcely any attention. Now, however, Zoe ascertained that Mrs. Orlandsen had given her blonde- haired, pale-complexioned friend, letters of introduction to her wealthy relatives in Bassin, who were most assiduous :      /   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   241 upon me. The laws and customs of society war against the natural love of tender hearts. Was not Jesus lenient to the poor, lost woman, while he rebuked her accusers, no doubt steeped in the same guilt themselves, but, as now, mean, base, and profligate enough to seek to cover their own shame by exposing and scorning hers? But in the Holy One she found a friend; and shall not I in this my life's extremity? "And so she falls low, lower, lowest in the scale of our humanity. O woman, flower of the earth, if virtuous, fruit ripest for the skies, whom, if wicked, thy keen, wounded sense of the ruin of the angel in thee drives to demoniac madness and fierce desperation! let me un- ravel for thee, my poor, tempted, deluded sister, the tan- gled skein of thy troubled, flying, fascinated thoughts, and in few words point to the remedy. "But what is this strange feeling that steals over me, as if my being were parting asunder? Can it be death, and I in fullest health but now? Or can it be that the weird man has dared to throw over me the subtle influ- ence of magnetism; me who have shunned all drugs of narcotic and alleviating influence, so that my spirit might be free and natural in its workings?-over me, whom min- gled disgust, pity, and indignation have long since driven from all haunts in which its daring votaries exhibit to the gallping multitude-some, their power over the individual will, and others, their wfeak submission to those who wield the powerful element. Let me bethink myself. Yesterday, in the absorption of our lesson, I recall to mind that, for a moment, my robe came in contact with his arm. And could he thus transmit the potent fluid? And in the after- noon my half houris siesta was so profound that I seemed to have slept through ages. I remember, too, his frequent calls upon my husband; some strange tale to draw him to his dwelling; some cabalistic secrecy attending it; some unwonted questionings of my tale-telling. Has he dared to 21  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7097-00000122"/> 242   ZCE;; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. exercise his magic on me, God's child and nature's protege, whose principles and whose instincts alone have guided me since the first day they laid me in my mother's arms within this earth-pale, sealing upon my infant brow their baptismal mark, the blazing star? Has he dared to attempt to mingle his being by the mesmeric touch with that of my husband's wife? Does he know how much this means- my husband's wife? Even this. Of all men on the wide earth, he is the only, only one whose love, whose due sense of power and of my right, whose claim upon my affection and obedience have been so justly balanced that I have been allowed a true development, and thus with only him I could have lived in wedlock and not be prostitute. This I learn through the marvelous power of a sympathy with other minds, known only to her, reposing in nature's loving arms, who, while she broods over her as the dove over its young in cooing accents, tells her her secrets, while mother and child bathe in the eternal, benignant smile of 'our great Father.' "I tread upon your power, thou impotent conjurer! get thee behind me, Satan! you offend me by your pretensions and miserable attempt at despotism! I'll breathe the open air. Come, ye breezes, and blow from the top of Le- banon's mount and cleanse me from the unwelcome gift forced on me by thy country's degenerate son! I tear my robe from off me, and cast it into the purifying waters fathoms deep, that it drown out its sinfil participation in the deed. I faint--I die. Come, my husband, and fold your protecting arms about me, and let me sleep against your heart-pulse that it may hold your own away from the Death-angel's grasp, whose chilly breath comes faintly to me through the portal, half-opened by that tampering Jew."

"It is the truth. Ask me not the, nature of my disease, for I mistake me, or ye know it well. Confess, sir, that you used the mysterious influence, you wield, to mag- netize me." "I did. There are different temperaments so naturally attuned, that by the influence of the subtle magnetic fluid strange harmonies may be awakened, so that two beings become blended into one. In our sentiments, and tastes, and life-experiences, so far as different ages justify, there seemed a wondrous unison, and for a reason which now I will not name, I sought to ascertain the extent of our dual unity. But some resistance has come between us, unac- countable to my weird vision." "And you dare to confess all this to me, your equal, ay, your superior so far as a teachable spirit which gives clear insight into the laws of life can make me so? You, who have fought for your country's freedom, who plead the captive's cause, and defend the oppressed, can stoop so low, it seems, as to seek to caist your spell over a trusting woman's soul and person, and try to read her secret thoughts by a mean trick of jugglery!" "I stand condemned; what farther say ye?" "I grant ye an intellect, critical, inquisitive, and subtle, an artist-eye, and a poetic soul, with learning gathered from the deeps profound of eastern science and western schools of rare and curious knowledge, and an insight into the souls of men with power to wield their sympathies sel- dom attained; but into that of woman ye have read no farther than the alphabet, and one, who claims the title to be Psyche of her sex, pronounces you a hypocrite, inasmuch as ye in the same hour seek to enlighten and to darken, to free and to enchain, to awaken her to larger views of nature and its Author and to drown her in a sleep imposed by your unlawful tyranny.

I wait to see if your errors be not the consequence of a defective training, of an early, supersti- tious faith, the brambles and briers brought from the 'wild woods' of false theologies, sticking even to one who strives for the highest truth; but if ye ever repeat the attempt to subdue my will, to reveal my mind to your too curious scrutiny in this unhallowed way, and above all, to make my pure, noble, and loving husband the puppet of your capri- cious will in this design, I 'll scorn you like an imp of hell. For I would as soon clasp hands with a fiend and turn my face straight towards the under-worldy as carelessly to join myself by means of magnetism to one whom I had not, by long and tried companionship, read through and through, who did not use the power invested in him with the same holy sense of responsibility with which the Christ per- formed his miracles. And know this, O presumptuous man! that for the amusement of a passing hour ye may wield an influence given you to bless with, as a temptation and a curse to some one who, sad and solitary, climbs up a steep and stony way; who in glad innocence may yield a hand to one who seems able to lead her across lifers pre- cipices, but who, instead of replying to her confidence, throws her among the lions. Beware, beware of the evil that lurks, as it may seem, in flowers and music, and may, like ravenous beasts, tear your own soul if not another's.' (He moves with sad and repentant aspect towards the door.) "I leave you. Forgive the injury, forget the lonely wanderer who, from no baseness, but a pure desire for a spiritual friendship hitherto denied him, sought through a means, by God appointed as I deemed, to win the blessing from you.

This I found in you. Mother, sister, wife are all denied me, and miserable that I am! this more ethereal boon I have now lost by a too eager grasp. Farewell!" (She rises.) "Do we understand each other?" "Ay." "And do my words seem just and reasonable to you?" Even so." "Then we will give the usual sign of friendship, (clasp- ing hands), and you will be a brother in the same great cause to which my husband and I have pledged ourselves, a safe inmate in our family, a friend to rely upon, not a wizard to guard against." "I pledge myself." "And now we know the meaning of a spiritual friend. ship, which shall liken us to the angels of God in heaven A common zeal and mutual labor in the great cause of humanity and truth; sanctifying all life's aims, labor, men- tal culture and beautiful tastes; holding in unbroken unity and awful sacredness, the ties of husband and wife; super- adding it may be a third, companionship in open faith avowed and with his full approval, in which each shall draw from the other all that is loveliest and rarest from our souls, while the triennial chain shall never rust in either link, but grow brighter and brighter unto the perfect day, when there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage, but all are as angels of God in heaven."  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7097-00000124"/> Tis to create, and in creating live A being more intense, that we endow With form our fancy, gaining as we give The life we image, ev'n as I do now:" (Mrs. Liebenhoff alone.)

And seeing ( 246 )   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   247 that my larder is unfurnished with dainties for your refresh- ment, shall I give you a tit-bit from my romance? or are you not in the mood for it?" "O yes," said all at once; "pray give it us." "I like to see your progress; go on, you will be read, never fear," said Mr. Korner. "When are we to be immortalized, dear Lisbet?" said Mrs. Korner, " for I see your fashion is to serve us up for the benefit of the public." "Yes, I am acting upon your motto,' make your friends useful as well as ornamental.' Do you feel damaged thereby?" "O no! I like myself very well, idealized as I am. But are you sure that every one you dress up in this way will?" "I have not asked them. They must get used to it. My revelations are nothing to what will be made of them at the day of judgment, when we shall know as we are known. Won't that be a glorious time?" "Ha, ha! a woman's heaven that, where her curiosity will be fully gratified. But why don't you imagine charac- ters, or take them from a greater distance? Novelists usually do, I believe," said Mr. Koirner. " you and a few others are good enough for me; only tip you off with a little glory here and there, excepting you, however, who do very well just as you are. But paint people at a distance! What a question? Did you ever know an artist stand a thousand miles off from the subject of his sketch? You think I am a witch, do you, brother mine? Imagine, create characters! What a wicked thought! God only does that. What are you thinking of? I must use for my story what he has made for me, and be very thank- ful that he allowed me to be born and to live with such interesting people. So you may consider yourself as pre- destined to shine in this way from all eternity; for I am compelled, by the exacting spirit that strives within my little person to write a book, so here you all are."  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7097-00000125"/> 248  ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. "What you just now said reminds me," said Hilda, " of what Miss Ingemann told us yesterday, that women were not creative in the character of their minds, only imitative; that men were the inventors." "Worthy of Miss Ingemann's farsighted wisdom! Ex- cuse me, Hilda. She is not the only one in these hard times whose cold, steel point of an intellect pierces the eyes of their souls out so that they live and grope about in mental and spiritual blindness. Is not that a paradox? There is a certain volume somewhere, which says- 'that men have sought out many inventiona' and don't speak of it as much to their credit -either. I agree, they are very inventive. It is enough for the women to imitate, combine, arrange, group, and show off to good advantage, by the gift of their idealism and common-sense, the materials which a good God has strewn abundantly around in life, history, and nature, and in that way they stick to the truth, which is what we were made to live for in this universe. Men want to build a world of their own, and so they set about inventing, and they make poor work of it, seeing they cannot fly out of themselves, or get entirely away from the rule of their Maker, try as hard as they may; but they have contrived thus much, to turn the world topsy- turvy with their abortive attempts at creation. But the women will set it all right in time; let them have free scope." "But when is this happy revolution to be made? for I suppose you date it from the publication of your book." "O! of course. That depends upon my publisher. I see he dreads to throw up the reins of government him- self, as well as to see them drop from the hands of his fel- lows, so he delays. If he were not a man of honor he would, I fear, burn my manuscript; but being such, he contents himself with keeping back my proof-sheets, tell- ing me something like this, that my Tale is not of much account. But I will now give you my last chapter."   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    249 (She reads it throughout.) "Lisbet, you frighten me," said Mrs. Korner. "What does this mean? Were you thus insulted by your teacher?" dooking very serious.) "My dear Lina, you are as literal as I was the other day when you asked me if I had ' Bacon,' and I answered that I had some in brine, when you meant the great Eng- lish writer! No, surely not, to my knowledge. You still look doubtful; then, for the first time in my life, I swear that he has ever treated me with the respect due from one Christian to another.. Why, you make me blush that it can seem possible to you that I should be treated thus. My husband never doubted me in his life. Don't you see my drift? I had to write a chapter upon some of the new no- tions of the day--magnetism, psychological twinship, etc., etc., and I naturally wished to make it a little thrilling, and I have a foolish fashion born with me, of thinking in petty dramas. So I just wrote down one of them as it bubbled up in my mind, and it frightens, when I thought only of amusing you. For you do not need the moral. I am sorry.' "But really I think you are too hard on Mr. Seiill, an exile, and alone in the world, as he says he is." "An exile! well, all the better. It gives him an oppor- tunity to make new acquaintances. Alone, aloney, he says, does he? I had hoped there was one man in the world of sensibility and genius who did not fancy himself peculiar, but would take everything in the shape of trial and training as a matter of course, as it comes along- in short, who begins life, expecting nothing, thinking he deserves but little, and then whatever favors come to him he regards as so much clear gain and is thankful accord- ingly. I hope, at least, he did not berate the world, be- cause, forsooth, it did not appreciate him?" ,6 His conversation squinted that way once or twice; but he did not enlarge upon the subject."  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7097-00000126"/> 250   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. "Do you think Mr. Seiill is self-conceited?" said Hilda. "Rinda does." 6"Not particularly so. All men are, you know. Of course they must be from their self-imposed position, having arranged themselves since time was, on an elevated plat- form, with the women all below, who are bidden to look up to them as superior, stronger, more creative, indepen- dent, worthy to receive due wages for their labor, the fa- vored recipients for all the wine of life, which firoths to the fill brim." "While your sex are destined to cook, sew for, and com- fort them, that comes next," said Mr. Korner. "Lisbet, you are falling into cant; don't repeat that again." "No, for you seem to have learned the lesson. . But, seriously, I except you almost entirely. And, as for my husband-" "He is not self-conceited," said Hilda. "No, not much--a trifle so now and then. But I forbear to check him, for he is so faultless now that he half loses his transcendental labor, preaching to this de- generate age. So don't tell him, Hilda, for he would imme- diately set about reforming. I don't like perfect people, and I am sure the world is not good enough for such." "But this Mr. Seiill, Lisbet, I don't quite like his giv- ing you lessons," said Mr. Korner. "A Hungarian, a countryman of Kossuth, your demigod; rather dangerous for my enthusiastic little sister. What does your husband say?" "My husband! Surely he asked him to teach me Hebrew. Why, he lets me do just what I please, and in return I take every hint from him as an inspiration. The other day, I dared to differ from him upon some verbal matter in my' Story,f and wrote it according to my taste rather than his; but I lie awake nights about it, and so I have got to hunt it up, for I have forgotten it, it was so trifling, and change it according to his decision. That is   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. '   251 what wives do, who have their freedom. Don't hinder Line, if she ever takes a fancy to be strong-minded and have her rights, for only so will she give you yours." "As every right brings with it a duty, I have as many now as I can respond to," said Mrs. KISrner; "I do not wish for more." ("Mr. Seull speaks of his critical work to some of our young men, the young elect, as you and Theresa call them, and they make themselves merry about it and his numerous corrections," said Mr. Korner. "OO! I suppose so, of course. No doubt he would come in for a share of their ridicule, as nothing escapes their carping criticism.

So much do I distrust the judgment of any clique, who sip daintily here and there at every new rivulet which bursts out from hillside or glen, gathering a few sparkling drops to glitter upon their pericraniums, leaving the great ocean and the mighty rivers where they could learn their own specific gravity, and be humble, and gather from their generous depths to fill their belittled souls, that when they utter their shrewd dicta, I turn instinctively to the opposite pole of thought for the probable sanction of the truth revealed to the docile pupil of the ages. Jesus not only gathered up the knowledge and wisdom of all time to guide him and prepare him to be the Christ, but paused at the rites and symbols of his people-those sure landmarks by which to judge the fidelity of discipleship to the good, the fair, and beautiful--ever the same, standing before us in contrast to the shifting waves of speculation, which make strange  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7097-00000127"/> 252   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. inroads into the solid earth-banks. Such has been this Hungarian's course, ever breaking the fetters cast about him, deeming of little value the already attained, so that with strong grasp, he reaches after the truth beyond, while sign and ceremony give to his poetic soul the refining grace denied to those who, mole-eyed, see not their great significance. Look on this picture and then on that, and note well that the one will be revealed as the poet-critic, the child-philosopher, the Christian hero and patriot, and inspired divine; while the others, banished from the pin- nacle on which an unsanctified imagination has self-exalted them, with penitent, willing hearts must return even as far back as the two tables for the religious strength of charac- ter they lack. And then it will seem plain to them, that sinking all petty differences of opinion, it is better, shoul- der to shoulder, to do our part, to bear the ark of God along the centuries, than to slink away to fondle and hug to souls, into whom leanness enters more and more, an ism, an ophy, or an ology." "As for Mr. Seiill, I fear not his displeasure for being made a victim by an illustration, indited with the intent of doing good, for he is Hungarian, which means noble; a Jew, which means acute in reading hidden meanings; a Christian, which makes him universal; and a German, which means gemuthch-so much that is rare and excel- lent that it cannot be translated." "You have a high opinion of him, Lisbet. I have failed to see all this in him," said Lina. "Yes, said Mr. Korner; "these foreigners one knows but little about. You may as well be careful in trusting them." "A foreigner, say you, and one of your own country- men! That is like you Germans, forever talking of dear fatherland and sighing for the reunion of her principalities into one glorious commonwealth, and yet doing nothing to effect it. You do not wish for freedom nor reunion, else   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   253 you exiles would band together more in the expression of a great central sentiment, even Christian toleration and good-will. Instead of that, you stand far aloof from each other with a microscope in either hand, so that you need not miss a single point of difference between you, gather ing all such together to build a high wall of separation, preventing all cordial effort in laboring for Germany." "What is the use of trying for anything; it would do no good, and only make us miserable, by stirring up useless regrets," said Mr. Korner. "You have no faith, more than our physician and good friend. It is not every one who, in seeking medical aid can summon Poet, Philosopher, Reformer, and Doctor all in one; and yet, of what use is all this glory, for when my husband is ill, though I know he has beautiful boxes of Idealistic Pills, which I dare say would cure him, so little faith has he in their efficacy, that ten to one, he does not give him salts and senna, or filthy calomel and jalap, pah! So it is, I fear, with his treatment of his country. He gives it the bitter dose of sighs and tears, and keeps the heroic to himself. I see I shall have to take the matter in hand. I daresay I shall do more for your fatherland than either of you, with all your wailing." "Go on. It may be that you will, I'll not hinder you." "Who is your illustrator?" said Mr. Korner, turning over a blank-book, in which were specimens of his- art. "He seems to have genius." "That figure of Tyranny," said Zoe, " is very spirited and expressive; how did you find one to suit you so well, in this department of your work?" "O! in true woman's fashion, Zoe; just as you would have done. In one of my prowling excursions about the city, in which I drop into this picture-shop and that toy- store, looking for suggestions here and there, and every- where my truancy happens to lead me, I was walking along Dritte-street, and I chanced to look up at the third  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7097-00000128"/> 254   ZOE,; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. story of a building, and saw this sign--Lovie, Landscape Painter, General Illustrator, and Designer; Bauerle, Artist. Thinks I to myself, that is just what I want; an Illustrator for my ' Way,' so I began to interpret. Lovie! so far, so good. If a man has moral courage enough to call himself thus in these times, when ' Hatie,' ' Fightie,'. Slan- derie,' I am-better-than-youie,' 'Down-with-youie,' are the favorite cognomens, he must be the right one for me. 'General Illus.' etc. Surely if he can touch up the universe in general, with his art, he can my little book: better still--' Designer!' Then he is not a mere copyist with no ideality. Heaven deliver me from such! Another recommendation, 'Bauerle, Artist!' If his partner pre- serves enough of the scent of the pine woods and green fields when he gets to dry, dusty, legal Dritte-street, so as to remember to call himself the ' Bower,' it is all I need. I'll forthwith mount skyward. So I did, following one staircase after another, until I saw the name repeated on a door at the end of the passage. I knocked and entered, without waiting for it to be opened, not exactly knowing the etiquette of business-houses. One young man sat at a table, writing or drawing, with his hat on. ' That must be the ' le Bower, thought I, ' he keeps it on as a symbol, lest he forget his rural name in these brick walls. The other at his desk, a pale young man with gentle mien, arose to greet me. "'Mr. Lovie?'" said I. "'That is my name.'" "'You illustrate books?'" "'I do?'" "'Will you mine?'" "'I will.' ' "'And give me lessons in drawing?'" "'Even so.' ' "'Please call at my house to-morrow morning.'- "  'At eight o'clock?'    ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   255 "'Precisely.' And so with a few more words, showing some ignorance on my part, of technical rules, we separ- ated. The next day he came, with a little fear and suspi- cion in his aspect. I imagined, as he was bidden to mount the staircase at such unwonted summons, but which were dissipated as he found me no deluding cheat, and he does my work promptly, gladly and with appreciation as a Poet- Artist should, which proves to me that my mode of doing business is a very good one." "Ha! ha! ha! But, my little sister, that is not quite the thing. Why did you not let your husband make the engagement? It is more proper for him to settle these matters for you.-' "No, not while you and all the other strong men in our parish pile most of your religious work on his shoulders, until I see he begins to totter under the cruel load. I am not the one to add to his labors more than is possible, but am going to take care of myself. Three hundred and fifty husbands, wives, and children are too much for one man, even if he were the grand Sultan of the Turks. I vacate the spiritual harem and walk independently henceforth, until a better order of things is established. Besides, Mr. Liebenhoff was out of town just at the moment when my business must be attended to. He was gone, you know, to the yearly Souls' Fair, as your solitary purveyor in religious matters, hoping to get some celestial eye-water and heav- enly ear-salve and angelic tonic to waken you up and cure your deafness and arouse your sleepy members altogether, for he is tired of repeating the siege of Sebastopol every Sabbath in his pulpit. I want him to disband the cavalry and artillery and give the infantry into my charge for a little time, and he will soon see what we will do. But he never acts rashy, you know, and believes less in revolu- tion than amelioration; so he is reviewing the regiment, proclaiming freedom and equal rights to foot soldiers as well as officers, and goes on attacking the enemy with new  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7097-00000129"/> 256   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. courage. I follow after with my little fife and drum, say- ing, bravo! sotto voce, and carrying my own knapsack meantime, except when he insists upon relieving me." "Good! you will conquer, I think. We are a rude and lazy set of fellows to deal with, sure enough. But it is a minister's work to attend to these matters; we have enough else to do. But in what .light are you going to introduce our friend, Mr. Kuhn, to the world in your Tale?" "I have not made up my mind, whether to leave him to the judgment of his own awakened conscience for prizing it so lightly, or to steal that pretty little horse of his which he drives too fast; for I have a compassionate consideration for his future some thousands of years hence, when the soul-spark in the poor animal, after passing through all inferior metamorphoses, shall bloom into a beautiful young lady in the heaven-sphere. Supposing that he should be sailing along at the rate of a thousand leagues a minute, upon a thunder-cloud edged with tin, which, you know, shines pretty brightly and is so useful to you men that I do not think you can ever do without it; and he should see seated on the point of a rainbow, a bright and radiant sky- nymph, clad in a robe made of the brilliant day-dawn, with : a zone around her waist cut from the bow of promise, ' with diamonds in her hair and on her breast, and arms crystallized from Sirius, such as Hilda loves; and he should say, ' Come, take a sail with me.? Now if the fair nymph were a la she, would not the witty answer be; I thank you-no, I have learned better than to consort with you, my one-time master, my equal, may-be, now. I know not but in passing the Yard and Ell you would snap it in two and use it for Bits to guide me, or snatch the comet's tail to switch me with; or, if I paused a moment out of breath, the twinkling of the stars as stirrups you would force to do your bidding; or, at best, in passing by Saturn's rings, whose refreshing waters I pant and ask for to quench   SZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   257 my thirst, ' Get up, gee-ho, would all the answer be-.

"Only let me see your favorite one and at least you will not drive it at the rate of ten miles the hour again." "But really I think you had better leave that out about the ' Wandering Jew.- " "Impossible! It would be slighting the good gifts of Providence not to make the most of him, for he is the only character I have with a touch of the strange and awful about him. All the rest of you I know like a book, and you are as harmless and matter-of-fact as lambs; but he, with eyes a mile deep, and mystery, and it may-be, mis- chief back of that, its in some way to help me to a plot; for our friend, Mr. Headrich, and even my sober, truthful husband says a story is not worth much without one.

Who knows but he was created on purpose to figure here? I should be no better than an infidel to reject him." "You are very willful, I see." "Yes, you must let mne have my own way for once, and I shall live the longer for it, especially as I have been at the world's beck all my life in a certain fashion, more than I intend to be in future, I can tell you. So here I go at my own sweet will, and if any of you are sailing in a nice little skiff on some fine summer's day on waters which you have no right to, why look out for breakers when you see me ahead flying through the air on a broomstick." "My gentle Lisbet!" "O yes, gentle as old Boreas when let loose." "My passive little sister can this be you?" "Yes, passive as the sea in a storm, as the world in a general earthquake, as the sky when a hurricane sweeps over it; very, very, VERY passive, my penetrating brother! But really, there is no need for fear; I will commit no deed with pen and ink, which I am not willing you should repeat towards me. Indeed, if you please, in your first Tale you may have me for the only character, and show me in every possible light, provided you only do it in the loving spirit I do.

"Look as pretty as you can, for it will be a beautiful party in all its arrangements, I know; for hers always are."

" What now, Mrs. Paradoxia?" "Very plain and easy to understand.

I shall watch you to see if you do your full part towards it." "I shall try to as much as the prosaic times will allow me. I can talk with interest for a few minutes and be en- thusiastic too upon the surface-subjects of the day- pickled nuts, the last new fashion, novel, news, or author, the prettiest belle, the different styles of matrons, magnifi- cent, or discreet and plain-eloquent, artistic, new or coming men, war, pestilence or famine, but I tire of these transi- tional subjects and want to go on to the real and substantial, such as I indulge in in my day-dreams. Hey, Zoe!" "Give us a specimen, by way of variety, to-night, to brighten up our circle a little." "I have not the courage, when at the simple remark I made to you the other day, that when grapes grew almost spontaneously on the hillsides of more southern regions, it was a sign that the people might eat them and drink their juice, you laughed at me and called me fanciful."

Our sins and follies disturb the order of the physical, no less than the moral and spiritual universe. Creation groans till now with the foul and foolish deeds of those who should perfect the work begun by its great Architect. Tempest, storm, and inundation, which sweep with devastating fury, are but expressions of the want of harmony between man and man, and both with nature. Subdue the hurricane and whirlwind in the interior soul, enlighten it upon the great forces, which at God's bidding rule the world as second causes; let each inhabitant of earth perform his part well in conquering its arid plains and deadly swamps to use and beauty, and the world would smile as an Elysium, and Uto- pia would be no baseless fabric of a dream.

For out of this sad wreck of all free thought and frank and cordial brotherhood, from its athe- ism and mockery of truth, and low morality, from its closed artists' studios and authors' closets, double barred, and up- turned printing-presses, and shut pulpit doors, and darkened courts of justice, shall come up a low indignant cry, which shall increase, and swell and burst at length, until it rends the welkin.

Enough to do in the short life allotted us, to live for God and our own souls. Our children are born and live and die in most unnatural severance from us, who gave them birth. Wives, mothers, sisters weep till the eye loses its life and stares sightless with the vain hope of greeting the son, brother, husband of the sweet days long gone.

"Indeed! everybody knows what chatterboxes you all are. What now?" "Men are everybody, are they? Did you ever hear a woman say that her sex were the greatest talkers, making speeches four hours long in parliament, preaching sermons till they stretch to twfentiethly, prosing hour after hour in private, standing in the door-way lengthening out their last words, et cetera, et cetera! I only ask you, or any of your brethren, to note the five next assemblings of-say three men and as many women in social converse, and see which division talks the most, and how many times any one of the ladies attempts to express herself and is not overborne by the louder voices of the other sex. That is all I want you to do. I am not anxious about the result. However, I am not entirely serious in this complaint at least. I believe that your sex ought to do the speaking in public. Let women write. They wield a pen of various power, and they can do it in the retirement they are fitted for. And even in private, I think that gentlemen may well form the basis of our conversation. Their substantial, granite natures are fitted for foundation-work of every kind. But if our thoughts, like vines and flowers, and rainbows and dew, or even a good pelting shower now and then, attended by thunder and lightning, which is very purifying you know, seek to gild and beautify and refresh, at intervals, do not say, 'pshaw, this is all flummery and nonsense. Let us brush the stuff away,' and then tramp on again with your heavy tread." "Good.  I'll agree to all this,' said Mr. Korner. "But to return to oratory," said she; "I simply meant that the spirit and subjects of our conversation should be more earnest and elevated than they are. I verily believe that many others as well as myself are revolving grave and stirring questions within, who simply give out the scum and froth of our best thoughts and feelings- when we meet, and for that reason society has become tedious."   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    265 "I fully agree with you; let me stay at home and play with the children, I say. Yet if we would, through a broad culture, bring out what is in us all, each his separate gift, whatever it may be, society would be enlivening and elevating; but to stand up for four mortal hours and play and act the agreeable and interesting, with nothing inspir- ing in the tone or spirit of the gathering, is getting too much for my nerves, I confess," said Mr. Korner. "I have not got to that pass yet," said Mrs. Korner. "I look forward with a child's delight to this evening." "I am so glad," said Lisbet. "And why should you not, a sunbeam as you are, dance merrily here and there among those who love and court you for your warmth and brightness?" "George Stephenson used to say, when his mother told him to dress himself for her evening company: ( Confound it, now we have got to stand and make faces at each other till mother orders in the provender, when we shall smudge round and eat apples in our prettiest way. Hilda, let's cut and run."' "Rather free-spoken was the said young American, but you seem to have a vivid recollection of him, my dear," said Mrs. Korner. "I have. I wish I could see him now. I wonder if he is out in the western wilds of America, where he used to say he was going," and even Hilda looked dreamy and abstracted for a moment. "But, sister mine, where did you learn so much, pray? What'college gave you the prize for being orator primus? Tell me." "Orator! did you say?

And when the mountain has brought forth a mouse, the procession forms, the best carriage draws up to the door, the orator of the day steps in, supported on either side by grave gentlemen in black relieved by dazzling vests, and through crowds he mounts the rostrum, rattles with cracked thunderbolts and lightens with mouldy electricity in long-drawn, faded streaks, while the initiated cry ' hear, hearP When his eloquence has expired of inanition, he is borne away on shouts to the feast-table, where in deep potations he is drowned in the praises of his compeers, which soothe his vailed, wine- composed senses with the flattering unction of the greatest Orator of these progressive times! No, no, I am no orator, for I am only a woman and go about my daily work-now make a pudding, now smooth a pillow, sweep my parlor, prune my vines, and weed my flower-beds, or for recrea- tion sew----and you know what; these thoughts and feel- ings meantime swelling and rising until they flow out for your and Lina's entertainment, and if for something better, my beloved ones, so much the happier for me. But I am no orator; that cannot be." "' What possesses you with the idea that Napoleon, the Little, is going to work such wonders, and how do you come by your spirit of prophecy?

Ours will have to come to the rescue, I plainly see." "But you have forgotten to answer my question." "You should know yourself. Our Journals have ex- posed the result of Louis' great intentions. Did you not read yesterday's paper?" "Yes, but I saw nothing of this kind." "Strange, when it was so prominent! You must not be so busy With those law papers and then you would not fall behind the times. Why, in one of them was this announce- ment: ' That the empress Eugenie's face was remarkable for nothing so much as for its expression of a sense of enjoyment,' which added to what I know of the emperor through other sources, led me to this train of thought, and I leave it to you if it is not very common-sensible. "' Nowfthought I,/if Napoleon were as mean and wicked as the world says, Eugenie's face would wear a different look from that. There have been times since their mar- riage when she seemed unhappy, and they say, that it might be because her husband resolved in his mind whether he had better not repeat the sacrifice of his uncle in giving up Josephine. But Louis and Eugenie's vWas a real love marriage, and great good always comes from such. At any rate, all seems right between them now. Still, I do not think it would be sufficient even for the happiness of an empress, though I grant she is in a very false position and one which is liable to make her very selfish, to throw over her face the glow of a lively sense of enjoyment, simply to have her husband love her if he were a very wicked man at heart, or did not at least give strong symptoms of re- forming. No, Lisbet, you may depend upon it, she knows a fact or two, and how to keep her husband's secrets too.

He has a strong will, a power of com- mand, and executive abilities, all requisite in its present condition. Yes, he is just the man suited to succeed at this distance of time, that great genius and reformer, the first Napoleon. - He will, guided by his example where it was wise, warned by his mistakes, with a sage insight into the spirit of the times and the requirements of the age, strike the first hour upon the horologe which is to usher in a new era of civilization, in which Art, Science, Literature, and Religion are to supersede Hatred, Tyranny, War, and Diplomacy in preserving the balance of power in Europe, and allow the peculiar genius of either nation to attain its natural development and growth.' All this I read in Euge- nic's face, revealed with a true woman's artlessness, and you may be sure that she too will do her full part in bring- ing about this new order of things. "Now, do not say absurd to my mode of reasoning, but wait five years and then pass your judgment upon it. I see in Lina's face that she does not think I am an idiot." O O Lisbet, day by day is it revealed to me, why, when scarce beyond my infant years, as with fond care you led me to our rustic day-school, I felt such pride in your pro- tection, and why, when the stranger met us on our home- ward way, I nestled close beside-you, that he might know I was your little sister. And now I greet you with glad and grateful welcome in your new sphere of thought and duty, sure that as with meek and patient spirit ye have gathered treasures, too subtle for me, engrossed as I am, with my maternal cares to grasp at, So will ye with true and graceful feminine force express them in the great cause of raising woman to her rights and duties. I only fear, that in your zeal for truth, you may overstep the line beyond which the world brooks not reproach and criticism. My loving heart bids me to keep the chain of affection ever bright between myself and others, and I do not compromise the truth, I ween, in doing thus. And they must love you even as I am   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   265 loved, or half my happiness is missing. Keep in mind your mutual relations with the friends at least around you, and how painful will be a chasm between you wrought by too free a pen." "Lina, I thank you for your kind greeting, and no less for the words of caution mingled with it. Think not that with unguarded spirit, I dash the crudities of my careless play-hours in the faces of my contemporaries. But with affectionate, reverent spirit, as befits a child of the All- Perfect, who, with wondrous skill made this our time- sphere, and pronounced it good; so do I gather the produc- tions of my heart and brain, and weave them in simple fashion, but with serious purpose, with traits and incidents and expressions of my own and the little world about me, with careful hand pruning my work of every falsehood to Nature and God, hoping not to offend, but to give pleasure to the passing hour. But by the fiat announced by Him, who would have his children worthy of their high destiny, to immolate ourselves, rather than to offend one of the laws by which we are darkly held, I must reprove as well as praise. O, my sister, ye have called to mind our child- hood, with your infant pride in me, and I have ever deemed it as but a foolish fancy; though I loved you for it. But I will be worthy of your early instinctive admira- tion, nor mar with bitterness, the fair home of love, which is the necessity of your being, but strive to have it fairer, more worthy of you through my bold pen. For itis made of a precious metal, the gift of friendship and relationship, and dipped in the milk of human kindness, which cannot, if it would, draw else than lines which run parallel with truth and love, though in the process it may strive to sever in all good faith, the ruinous excrescences from our lives, and touch them with added healthful grace and loveli- ness."

"1 Lina, I mind the time, when sleeping on your baby- couch, our mother and I would gaze in rapture on your un- earthly beauty, as your cheek lightly rested on the tiny hand, the dark eyes closed in sweet repose, the lips divided by a smile, the forehead with delicate veins coursing across it, like rivulets repeating the upper sky-blue, and forehead expanded heaven-like, telling tales of the angels who joy- ously danced within. As with one breath, we would ex- claim, ' how lovely!' I would question sadly, why, when I closed my weary eyes to sleep, my brow would settle into a frown of distress, and strange and fearful and unchildlike dreams would lower from the darkness round me. Our fates to me are now interpreted. You have fulfilled your early promise. Affection, beauty, brightness and appro- bation attend your every act, for each is overflowing with sympathy and humanity. The suffering poor feed from your open hand, which meantime softly heals the soreness of their grieved natures. The sad and lonely cast but a glance at your I kind loving eyes,5 and straightway lay their burdens in your bosom.

"It is no flattery, but the simple truth, my Lina," said her husband. ' I, on the other hand, like Memnon's statue, have stood in stony silence, my music sounding deep within me, wait- ing for the rising Sun's rays to strike my harp of thou- sand strings, and chant anew the song of Bethlehem's angels.

Children have risen since around me, and soon outgrown my dull intelligence in Fashion, Elegance, Esprit du corps, Science, Art, and Literature, Mental Acumen, and Skill of Leadership, each one measuring the other by prominent development in one of these or all, as is the custom. But I have simply lived a Soul, growing by every influence Our Father sheds around me, but chiefly by stretching my stature heavenward to grasp his beams of light shed downwards. They have guided me through no me=a gymnasium which has trained and strengthened me till now. But such culture befits not one who would stand forth distinguished enough to influence largely, or give a prestige so as to be heard with gentle de- ference, though truth and beauty may drop like honey from the lips. Such manners and such regard are given to strong colors, red, yellow, or black and white mingled in striking contrast. But I, a neutral tint, though striving to mingle in the shade the elements of all the rest in fitting harmony, have been too insignificant to reflect the rays of any inferior luminary, shining by borrowed light. I have waited for the Sun of righteousness to revolve near my orbit with his full day of splendor, dawning near, to waken me to give forth such music as he approves. "I am his instrument, and if the chords may sometimes rudely jangle, it is, that through temporary discord, they may be attuned to the sublimest harmonies and charm and elevate the listeners.

" Dear Lisbet, Memnon's music has never been turned from with a deaf ear by me, though I knew not its varied power of utterance. But to drop the figure, I simply meant to express the idea that in a work designed for the widest good, much tact and judgment must be used in its construction, and in the handling of the different charac- ters, so as not to place you in antagonism with any of your readers, or at least as few as possible. What you say about your husband's parish, for instapce, may offend more than benefit." "My dear, I write for people who are gifted with com- mon capacities, of course. One must at least, presume upon thus much. I only ask for the judgment of patient and sensible readers. "The parish! I have been thinking that, like AEsop, I must take a candle at noonday to hunt it up, so gracefully it was bowing itself away from our entreaties to build anew our sanctuary; though when the pastor's services are needed for its multiform requirements, it starts up obvious enough. But, supposing that- I should, in playful fashion, place in opposite scales on one hand, the awful injuries inflicted upon it by my pretty golden goosequill, and on the other the wrongs of the sisterhood of ministers' 'wives. For they grow uneasy upon the Procrustean bed on which they are bound and cry out for freedom from their restraint. I have no great complaint to make, for a neutral-tinted object is seldom aimed at by the marksman, it is not sufficiently evident to the eye, you know. Or, if some very sharp- eyed hunter notes me and raises his bow, I pass on, say- ing, ' It cannot be for me, O no!"And even if the arrows hit me, I am guarded by such proof-panoply within, that they slide from- me like rain from off a cabbage leaf.

Item fourth. To be so unfortunate as to throw the whole parish into convulsions if she steps to music a half hour or two, though the wives and daughters may meantime dance to early dawn; or into an incurable fever, because, forsooth, she goes to see a drama enacted, though she may meet the parishioners in a body at the play-house, on the plea that she sets a bad example!

While at the same time she denies herself a generous cultivation of her artis- tic tastes and literary aspirations for want of time, engrossed by her public and social duties and family cares, increased by the necessity of earning, by some means, her own ward- robe, denied by the meagreness of the living granted her by the parish. Now look at the scales please, and tell me which side tips." "Stop," said Mrs. Kiorner; "put first into them the affection and its tokens which ever have attended you, brightening your face with smiles while saying, ' how good God is, shown in these symbols of their love, blossoming thus beautifully in kindly deeds!' " "Ay, Lina, not one is forgotten, but the spirit with which they were proffered is cherished in my heart of hearts. The children walk delighted through my dwell- ing and say, ' How many pretty things our pastor's wife has!' and I answer gladly,'Gifts all of dear affection, doubly valued for themselves and for their beautiful asso- ciations.' The-custom of the ancient Cyrus is repeated, who, when the meat and bread upon his table was grateful to his taste, said: ' Take the other half to yonder friend, and say, Cyrus loves this, receive it from him.' And when I walk abroad, proud of my brave attire, I say of some ornament, this was the choice of friendship, it fits me well.'" "Then what would you have? You surely are not sor- did, though really your speech tends that way. Should the sisterhood have a separate salary in addition to their husband's, in consideration of their interest and aid in his labors?" "O no, no, no! we are too conventional and commercial now in our modes of showing our interest in each other, and it divides those who should be members, one in spirit, as they are of one i household of faith.'

What I mean is this: that no woman should be set apart, as too holy by her position to mingle in any sports or recreations suited to her associates. It degrades both her and them by a miserable superstition. Nor in the work of life are they, more than she, exempted from the responsibility, which each one owes as a Christian woman, to do her full part to bring the world up to the tone of God's requirements. Each one should be a priestess of the Most High, and not only see that she burn no strange fire upon the altar of her faith, but that the pure flame of holy life shine brighter and brighter to the perfect day. Then no unequal burden would heavily weigh on one, no better fitted nor gifted with greater strength than others to bear along the interests of humanity; but while she could claim her share of leisure for beautiful culture and refresh- ing recreation, many a one, now palsied in mind, heart, and body by indolence and ennui, and an aimless life, will waken as from the dead at the summons to the true life- work, which now is resting upon a few wearied, and anxious, and over-worked ones, starving their fancy and living taste for beauty for want of leisure and pecuniary means with which to indulge their cravings." "You are very radical, Lisbet. The world will call you a disorganizer," said Mr. Korner.

A ship was soon to sail for Santa Cruz, and the question was debated by them whether she should return in it or wait for six months longer, when another opportunity would offer for her pas- sage to the island. For a reason which will hereafter appear, they decided that, notwithstanding their yearning desire to see her again, which, on the part of her mother, had become almost a mania, it still was better that she should remain in Denmark for the present. In this Zoe more willingly acquiesced than she would have done before her intimacy with Mrs. Liebenhoff commenced. In her she found much relief from the devourings of her own nature, turned in upon itself for lack of proper sympathy and a nutriment congenial to it, and in that lady's high- toned and enthusiastic character and sentiments, accom- panied, as they were, by a warm and growing attachment to herself, she found an approach to the ideal friendship of her day-dreams. On the one hand, the intimacy be- tween them was beneficial to her. On the other, consid- ering that her imagination was already unduly developed, (280)   Z2O; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   281 and her aspirations and religious sentiments in advance of the character possible to an inexperienced young girl, whose world had been as yet only within herself and her school-room, and whose principles were not matured and strengthened by practical life, the soarings of her friend into the ideal and imaginative, as was her custom, acted unfavorably upon her. These were but the flowering of Mrs. Liebenhoff's nature on the summit of an experience, which had strengthened her to the degree that there was no exhaustion resulting from the act; the fruitage of a life so matured by faithful labor, watchfulness, and a culture suited to the soil of her mind, that it poured forth its abun- dant harvest spontaneously, without danger of injury. If the present influence upon Zoi were considered, she might be said to have erred in her intercourse with her, though in a way very natural. Never before had she found one so much like herself in her original constitution, and at the same time, with equal simplicity and unworldliness of character. Wearied as she was with many of the coIn- ventionalisms of society, baulked of a full expression of her aspirations and feelings by the different way of look- ing upon life and the future of most of her friends and associates, when with Zoe, childlike yet mature, imagina- tive and highly refined, and with a true eye for the beauti- ful in literature and art, yet fashioned, as she was, very much by the Hebrew Scriptures, and after the model of the ideal presented by them, she felt such delight in her companionship, that her whole nature gushed forth like the crystal stream from the fountain, delighting and elevat- ing, but, at the same time, dazzling and unduly exciting her. To be sure, she gave her the wisest counsel, suited to her years and her peculiarities; but these were to bear fruit in her pupil-friend afterwards, while the intoxication of her fellowship was working daily in this impassioned child of the Tropics. 24  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7097-00000142"/> 282   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. "O Hilda'" said she, as she walked homewards, "I feel as if Mrs. Liebenhoff were inspired whenever I am in her presence. Even when I am sitting in silence with her, when she is writing or sewing, or whatever she may be doing, I am raised above my common life. Do you not think there are some persons who shed virtue from them as our Saviour did, without their voluntary will, simply because they are so good and pure? I know I feel very differently when with her from what I ever do with Miss Ingemann." "Miss Ingemann is good and pure, too," said Hilda. "Yes, I know it; but compared with Mrs. Liebenhoff, she is worldly and common-place. They seem to me as unlike in character as this Madonna, on my breastpin, is from that portrait hanging up in the hall with a crape cushion on her head and stiff stays on." "Mrs. Liebenhoff is too little conventional to suit my taste. I think she carries her ideas of fraternity and sis- terhood too far. She would make people all alike, it seems to me. We should have no kings and queens, nor even noblemen and ladies, with common people and servants to work for and wait upon them; and I should not like that. I am for preserving my dignity and not suffering every menial and low-bred person to encroach upon me. I must say I like to use my power over those beneath me, and order them round a little. It makes me feel respectable ;" and Hilda raised her head and made herself as tall as possible. "' I have never seen any one, not even Miss Ingemann, who had such control over other minds as she has, and I do not think it would be possible for one to treat her with dis- respect," said Zoe". '"Her power is within, and her rule, one which a proper self-respect, joined with love and sym- pathy for every human being, gives her. O Hilda, in the millennium, which I cannot but think is near, I believe   ZOE$; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   283 that God will be the only King, and Jesus the great Leader of the world, with a more beautiful dominion than any there are now on the earth. I want no other." '4 Then, if you were presented at Court, you would treat our King and Queen just like other people, would you?" "No, indeed, that would be very absurd and wrong. God permits them at present to rule over us, and with a pretty mild sway, compared ywith that of other wretched coun- tries in Europe. I should get instructions from some one who had been there before me of how I must behave with propriety, and I should not hesitate to say, ' your majesty,' as is the custom; and I think it a very pretty title for one who tries to deserve it as our, good Queen does. e But if I thought, that in her heart of hearts, she did not see, that by virtue of being a child Of the Most High, and one who tries above all things, to serve him truly, I were as good as she, I should callUher no lady." "Indeed! Well these are new fashions of yours and Mrs. Liebenhoffs. I suppose you would like a republic, such as they have in America." "I certainly should, only a better one, for Mrs. Lieben- hoff says they retain still in that, a good many false, feudal notions in their government and social life. I want a real Christian Republic, such as Jesus would establish, were he to come on the earth, in which every one would be free to develop their natures according to their own and God's laws, government only serving to protect them in this great work, and placing as manyfacilities in the way of it as possible, and in which all the people would, in reality, feel that they were equal in the eye of God and adapt their manners and customs to the idea. You see that my year's intimacy with Mrs. Liebenhoff has not been lost upon me." '"No, I see," said Hilda, thinking at the same time, that although Zo! had been happier and less irritable in her feelings than before she knew her, yet, that she was even more given to abstraction and more positive than ever  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7097-00000143"/> 284   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. in clinging to what seemed to her extravagant fancies and opinions than formerly. At any rate, there was less and less sympathy if possible, between her and Miss Ingemann, and this and the evils resulting from it were the greatest trials of her own sunshiny life. As has been said, Zoies sentiments and imagination were in advance of her years; her physique reached its matur- ity at a later period than usual. While Hilda, at her age, had the development, character and bearing of a young lady, at least twenty-one, though mingled with great na- ivete and vivacity; Zoe, on the contrary, at eighteen, wore still the appearance of a young girl just budding into wo- manhood. She was of medium height, of slender and symmetrical figure, graceful, but languid in her movements, with a face which seldom varied its expression from one of almost stolid repose, when with those uncongenial to her, or a pensive look of appeal and eager questioning, when with those she loved and trusted in. Her complexion was that of a clear brunette, her features regular, her eye being dark, soft and mournful, her nose delicate in its for- mation, though widening at the nostrils sufficient to give it character, and the lips just full enough to enrich and hu- manize a face, otherwise so ethereal in its beauty, as to mingle the pleasure with which she was regarded with the painful thought, that she would not be long for this world. Her hair was very dark and shining, and wearing it as she did, parted in front, confined by a band, with a rich mass of curls on the back part of her head, when she appeared abroad, she was always noticeable, no less for her beauty than for its foreign characteristics, which distinguished her from all her companions. "How beautiful Zoe Carlan, your West-Indian pupil, has grown!" said a lady-visitor one day to Miss Ingemann. "I had no idea that she would develop so prettily." ' Yes," said Miss Ingemann, " but her face sadly lacks character, and for that it has ceased to interest me. It is   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    285 but a transcript of her mind, which I have decided will always remain weak and childlike. I never shall be able to develop it beyond a certain point, and that a low one. She does not try me as much as formerly, because I see plainly her incapacity for high culture, and I resign myself now to her returning home with but a smattering of the branches taught her." "Ah! I had the idea that she was very bright. Mr. Lie- benhoff told me yesterday, that she had a rare nature." "His wife has brought him over to her faith, I suppose. The two are very intimate," and she laughed. "A fitting companion enough for her she is too.- I wish our Pastor had a partner who could support herself better in a posi- tion which calls for much strength and dignity of character. Were she really superior she might give such a high tone to our social circle. By way of complaisance, we have to place her in responsible stations when we meet for various purposes; but really, there are so many others better fitted for them, and who really do from necessity take the lead, that it seems a mere compliment." (6 This, at least, can be said of her," rejoined her friend, that she claims no skill in leadership, and on the whole, we get along more peaceably than if she were always queening it over us. I sometimes think it is a principle with her to keep in the background, as she does, that others may take the parts they are well fitted for. You know she is pretty radical upon the subject of all government." "I know but little of her opinions excepting that I con- sider her moon-struck generally, and for that reason, I have dreaded her influence over Zoe, who has no balance of mind and character. All that I can do under the cir- cumstances, however, is to counteract it as far as possible through her school lessons. I endeavor to do my duty by her."- So there was no relaxation for her pupil in her daily studies, but her powers were unnaturally taxed for many  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7097-00000144"/> 286   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. hours each day in acquiring an insight into dry metaphy. sics, or still dryer mathematics, so that at the most critical a period of a young girl's life, on which depends very much her future fitness or otherwise, for its duties and enjoy- ments, her brain and nervous system were taxed to the utmost, without their being supplied with that strength and nutriment necessary to their well-being by air, exercise, and proper attention to general physiological laws. Added to this, Zoe was homesick from morbidly dwelling upon her mother and the love with which she would cherish her, and which was denied in a boarding-school, where, if she had been ever so attractive to her teacher, she could share her favor only with forty others. She was heartsick from knowing that, do what she would in accordance with her natural genius, she never suited one, whose methods of culture were so rigid as Miss Ingemann's, and whose views of human nature were graduated by the standard of judg- ment, most favored in this practical and intellectual age, by the narrow, keen, coarse, one-sided Anglo-Saxon mind. Added to these unfavorable circumstances were her pre- mature religious sensibilities. Had she been under the modern American evangelical influence, so called, where there is a regular system in vogue of blowing up the ten- der souls of the young into a flame of excitement before the character is fitted to sustain, or the religious knowledge sufficient to guide, or the- wisdom ripe enough to protect and train it in its great life-work, she would either have be- come a maniac or a blas6 religionist, or, perhaps, as many do, have gone to the other extreme in animalism or infi- delity. But, fortunately, she was subjected to no such forcing process in this respect. Miss Ingemann was a con., scientious, sensible woman, who believed that as soon as. she had a religious conviction it was to be carried out in practice. She instructed her pupils in our Christian faith, as she understood it. She was a Lutheran; but dogmatics are not carried to the extreme, in Europe, that they are in   ZOE"; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   287 America, so that their minds were much less overlaid than they would have been there with articles of human creeds. They were taught Christian morals and piety-in a modified form, it is true-still with less admixture of error than would have been possible in such hotheds of Calvinism. Then Mr. Liebenhoff was of a wise, en- lightened, and deeply Christian spirit; and his pulpit in- structions were adapted to the guidance of souls, who have a great and good life-work to accomplish, leaving but little time to sharpen the wits to unnatural shrewdness by polemics. At home and at school, the Bible was pointed to as the chart by which they were to guide their steps, and train their spirits, both through time and eternity. Enough has been said to show Zoi's appreciation of this volume, and the part it had in her training. Her mother had given her one when she left her, saying, at the same time, 1"Read this, Zoe, every day, and not only God and Jesus will be with you when you do so, but your own loving mamma, too; for by the light of the holy Word I shall see that my darling is under their kind care, and that when they will it, I shall fold you to my arms again.' For years she had a superstitious, it may be, but none the less strong feeling, that when she sat down to peruse its pages her mother was near her, though - unseen, guiding her in the selection for the day, and impressing upon her childish mind a reverence and love for its truths. So that her filial affections were constantly operating to form and strengthen her -religious ones, at the same time that her absence from her threw a vail of romance, not only over the image of her which was impressed indelibly upon her mind, but also over the Scriptures with which that image was indissolubly connected. Human nature is the most delicate and precious creation of,.God, and to develop and mature it worthily of its great Author and its high destination, it must have no one-sided or eccentric culture, though even that may be of a purifying  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7097-00000145"/> 288   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. and elevating character. Zoe's undue, absorption in relig- ion made her superstitious and fanatical. She suffered from a want of confiding and affectionate intercourse with a variety of minds, and a more practical knowledge of the world and its concerns. Hence her feelings became un. duly concentrated upon herself. Both her instinctive and acquired sympathy with the character of Jesus was, through a want of guidance, becoming a dangerous idiosyncrasy. She felt that there was a similarity in their early fortunes and characters, and it followed that, gradually, she imagined that their destinies were to be similar. And here there was what seemed an inconsistency in her, though, at the same time, it was a very natural one. From having so high an idea as she had of what she ought to be, and what it was intended she should be, she suffered intense self-reproach for her own imperfections, and every accusation thrown upon her would deeply depress her, not so much from a sense of its injustice as from its seeming simply the meed of her deserts. And yet, whenever made thus miserable by reproach and a sense of being misunderstood, she would rush all the more eagerly to devotional musings, and in simple converse with the Christ, forget that she, a few moments before, had thought herself unworthy of being the least of his disciples. "Yes, glorious elder brother," she would say, " first-born of a new creation, how little do men know and love thee as thou art. But God has seen fit to reveal thy brightness to- me-me, a poor little, simple, lonely, unloved girl. Jesus grew up a carpenter, and his friends knew not how great and good he was to be. Only his mother thought about the promise of the Father and kept the secret in her heart. I wonder if my mother knows that her child is to live over his life again in some way not yet revealed to her, but none the less surely will it be repeated. O come the time, Father in heaven, when I shall see clearly how I am to fully perform thy great -and holy will."   ZOE; OB, THE -QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   289 These were thoughts which she never breathed, even to Mrs. Liebenhoff. Had she done so, she would have striven to correct them. But, on the contrary, that lady's glowing zeal for the improvement of society through the influence of Christianity, as embodied in his Church, served to fan her own sanguine hopes and aims to an intenser flame, and swell her heart with still wilder hopes, connected with her great mission. She would exclaim to herself, C Yes! the Church of Christ shall bring on, ere long, the millen- nial day, and I will be the leader to marshal in his second coming upon the earth." These imaginations were more and more shaping her daily experience. They gave a point to all her reading, and through them she interpreted nature and the incidents of her life. Every change of the elements po'mted to something in her destiny, and the most trivial words dropped by her associates were often big with meaning and suggestion to her. Her etherealized spirit sat lightly, in one sense, to the earth and its common interests and fashions. On the other, not a leaf could fall of the early autumn foliage, not an insect could flit across her subli- mated vision, not an event occur either in her own private history, the social circle of which she was a member, or in the great busy, self-seeking world, without her reading in them the signs which were to usher in a new and glori- otius era of awakened Christendom. The soul is a great realm. To the common eye it may seem shrouded in thickest film of sense and apathy, giving no sign even of ordinary action. And yet the outer revo- lutions of empires, the overthrow of thrones, and the con- struction of fairer kingdoms, principalities, and republics, upon their subverted bases, are simply the symbols and tokens of its workings. O reverence the human soul! thine own no less, nor yet more, than that intrusted to the keeping of thy fellows, for it is the vicegerent of the Al- mighty upon the earth, and woe, woe be unto it if it work 25  &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7097-00000146"/> 290.  ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. not with all good faith and with enlightened wisdom his lawful bidding. Zoe was sitting' one afternoon of a hot July day, in an undress, upon a cushion, on the floor of her own apart- ment, directly opposite the window, looking upwards at the fleecy clouds, which, piled in changeful masses, floated past, breathing in with luxurious delight the fast fleeting breath of the short Danish summer. She was startled from her reverie by a white dove flying in at the window. As it came towards her, she almost involuntarily opened the single loose robe which partially covered her person, and it rushed eagerly into her bosom, where it remained with its wings spread, fluttering with fear, looking up into her face with an almost human expression of appeal for protection. It was probably pursued by some bird of prey, and such seemed the obvious reason to her of so-unwonted a visit. But she was accustomed to look below the surface of the most trivial events to gather hints for her direction in life, and, in this surprising one, she read with clearer vision than had yet dawned upon her the nature of her life-mission. Poor persecuted innocent, she cried, as she looked into its pleading eyes. God sent thee unto me, for my stricken heart, he knew, would yearn towards thee and protect thee from all that would work thy ruin. But what other mes- sage hath he sent by thee, thou carrier pigeon from His great white throne? Ha, now I see the missive folded in thy fluttering pinion, and this its language is: Zoo, life of my life, awaken, arise, Clothe thee anew with zeal and devotion, Put on God's armor and strive for the prize, The world wots not of 'mid its noise and commotion. O show it the way to the truth and the light, As it shines in the face of thy Saviour divine, O save it from sin and the perilous flight,: Which awaits it while buried in vice and in crime. She closed the window, as after the first fright was over    ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   291 it seemed inclined to make its exit by the way it came in, but Zoe received it as a special messenger from heaven, and she had no idea of suffering it to depart without gathering from it its full meed of blessing. She gave it food and water, and called in Hilda and her other com- panions that they might admire its pure beauty, though, as usual, she was very careful not to speak to them of the deep significance which she attached to its visit. The next day the poor bird moped and seemed ill at ease, though carried into the open air of the garden, and wooed and petted with all the tender tones of endearment, which suggested themselves to her. Another morning came, and, cold and lifeless, it lay in the warm nest prepared for it by its gentle mistress. She looked aghast at first at the sacri- fice made of it to improper diet and confined air, and, per- haps, to some injury received on its way to her. To Rinda's "I told you so," she made no answer, but stood and questioned with herself: ' What am I to learn by this?' and the answer came very readily to one so impassioned and absorbed in one idea as she was. "It bids me hasten to do my life-work, she said. The world is famishing, dying for the pure truth of God, revealed by Christ. Let me, even me, show it the way to the Father by the simple pre- cepts and parables of our Lord; for has he not said that out of the mouths of the simple and tender he will perfect his praise?" Filled more and more by this idea of being intrusted with a peculiar mission, nature, the incidents of her own life, the world and its events, became, as it were, but the running accompaniments, or, rather, the index pointing to this great object, each and all qualifying her for it, en- couraging, guiding and sustaining her in its preparation, while, at the same time, God the omnipotent charioteer of the universe was reining it in to keep even pace with the hours, which were to usher in her ministry. On her return from Mrs. Liebenhoff's she found on her  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7097-00000147"/> 292    ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. writing-desk this subject, upon which she was to write her theme for the coming week, which Miss Holberg, at the direction of Miss Ingemanny had just placed there: ' The beauties and advantages of docility and obedience in the young." Zo' immediately took the hint conveyed by this sentence, and it provoked her, for she had ever striven to obey Miss Ingemann's instructions and rules, and when she had failed, it was only where'her nature and sense of truth had drawn her irresistibly aside from them. She had strong impulses and a quick irritable temper, wrapped within a nature of true gentleness and refinement. These sometimes got the mastery over her to an extent quite ludi- crous for one invested with credentials for so sublime a mission as she imagined, and her subsequent shame and remorse were, of course, proportioned to the height from which she imagined herself to have fallen. But in this instance when the blood mounted to her cheek and the flash of anger gleamed from her eyet she called them only the natural and just effects of a holy indignation, and she sat down with her pen and dashed off these burning lines: "Docility and obedience are the two handmaidens to lead along our steps during our weak minority, in the path which our great Father has marked out for his children, beginning with their birth and lead- ing on and on to the glories and sublimities of eternity after eternity. But does any weak, blind time-tyrant think to fetter the immortal child of the ages, the soul of the souls of lesser spirits, dwelling in darkness on this earth-sphere, within its own narrow intellectual dimensions? No, no, for like the mist which the rising sun looses from the mountain's brow, like musical sounds freed from the heavy- toned organ at its swell and fall in the lonely midnight, like the poet's measures sung to the winds in moments of rapt inspiration on the solitary sea beach, so is the soul, enfranchised by obedience to its ovn great laws and the word of its Maker, and shame, contempt, and woe shall be the doom of him who seeks to chain it any more than them. 01 come the time when freedom's breath and religion's inspiring, directing wand shall be its only mistresses, clarified and sublimed, as it will be by thr-millennial light. So yearns and ago- nizes for this great spiritual truth the liberty-loving spirit of "ZoE CARLAN."   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    293 She folded the paper upon which she had hurriedly written these sentences, and placed them in the usual re- pository for the pupils' themes, from which they were taken by the teachers for correction. It will be seen by this style of her composition, that she had been strongly influenced by her interview with Mrs. Liebenhoff, for, though her habitual thoughts were in har- mony with hers so far as their different ages would allow, with the exception of her own personal idiosyncrasy, yet her usual method of expression was more subdued, except- ing when very much excited, and then she expressed herself in poetical strains, but limited more or less by the bounds of metrical verse. To the narrow and superficial this quality of imitation, which showed itself also in her religious development, may seem a servile and inferior one. Taking, as she did, the Saviour for her model not only in the spirit of his teachings, but too much, as it would seem, according to the letter also, since it led her into the extravagant notion of her own future Messiahship, she would be judged by the so-called philosophers of the present speculative and inventive age as wanting in the higher characteristics of genius and intellectual endow- ments. But when it is considered that the universe is a great school of all the sublimest arts, sciences, literatures, and philosophies, with God for the great central inspiring Spirit, who opens one arcana after another of its mysteries as his children, by their obedience to his generous and wholesome rules, are prepared for them, and that Jesus is the pure, true, sublime, and loving revelator of the just and right principles by which these mysteries are to be interpreted, appropriated, and made practical to our daily life, it follows that the most docile pupil and obedient fol- lower of these laws and of their great Archetype is in the true path which leads to the inner temple, where shines evermore the celestial light, revealing the cherubim which keep their perpetual guard over the Holy of Holies.

For the, but now, haggard and ancient dame Nature, so hoary and wrinkled, has doffed her garments of gray and her visage of eld, and shines out lovely and fresh as a bride on the eve when new life has been breathed through her being from the peren- nial Eden of love. He dashes his picture, the pride of his heart and the hope of his future, in rage and tears at her feet. "O mother, capricious and cruel!" he cries, "1 why have ye deceived me?"   But hark! hear her gentle and musical voice, which now elates him with joy and enhances his love to the pitch of devotion to Him, her great Author; for before his couched vision, His glory now shines in each line of her youthful and radiant face. And these are her words, "O  Son of my love, who, still groping and blind, didst see too minutely each fissure and stain, each decay and excrescence, yet loved me no less, ay, even more for these weather-marked lines, indented by caring and labor- ing for thee, receive now the reward of your trust and affection." She touches his eyelids and there thrills through his being, a divine inspiration, and now is revealed the great truth that he, who in reverent faith follows, step by step, the leadings of nature and God through his Christ, in his feeble minority, shall be one with them and the angels in blissful communion; and his soul shall be trained, and his hand shall be guided by a holy idealism, to- paint for im- mortals the spirit of earth and the essence of the heavens,   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   295 not on canvass alone, but on the ever during tablets within. Another influence besides Mrs. Liebenhoffs had been, of late, assisting to mould Zoe by its effect upon her ima- gination and feelings. This was the acquaintance and instruction of her German teacher. His method of tuition was unlike any which she had been subjected to, and more in accordance with the nature and character of her mind. Discarding all tedious, elementary rules, he, at once, through the aid of an interlined copy of the Gospel of John placed that most beloved portion of Scriptures within her grasp, through a form of expression novel and sugges- tive to her. She made rapid progress, both in the pronun- ciation and translation, so that when Miss Ingemann asked him of his success with this, her most discouraging pupil, she was surprised by his cordial encomiums upon her mental capacity and docility of disposition. The thought crossed her mind that she might have made a mistake in her attempt to inclose Zoe within her own cast-iron methods, but like the oak tree, which, for a moment, may sway to a powerful passing wind, only to return again to its usual imperturbable sturdiness, so she soon regained her usual self-complacency on this point. But in other ways was the Hungarian shaping her thoughts and sentiments more powerfully than through the German language. He was a man of a strong, acute intel- lect, trained both in the Jewish rabbinical schools and in the cloister-like universities of Germany, filled with curi- ous and profound learning, both of the ancient and modern schools of theology, philosophy and literature, at the same time that his imagination was lofty and well controlled. But what impressed her more than any other quality of his character was his moral force. This was the commanding element, which gave aim, energy, and perpetual vitality and inspiration to his own life-work, and, carried on his pupils from day to day to unprecedented success in every  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7097-00000149"/> 296  ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. branch which he taught them. Like the waves of the sea at spring-tide, which bear on their resistless current all lighter substances, which, floating near, they draw within their influence, so did his strong will, and high and never- flagging sense of the great possibilities of the human mind, when awakened to its duties, propel them with glad but resistless impetus to high attainments. When a woman feels this influence buoying her up and impelling her on- wards, she joyfully acknowledges the leadership of man. Her clear, spiritual glance sights from afar, the true, the beautiful, and right, and she plumes her butterfly wings and flutters gladly towards it, but with feeble and unsteady motion, unless his strong, eagle-eye and pinion, which never blinks or tires, cleave the air and make a swell, so that she be strengthened and sent onwards in her flight. If he do this, his heaven-ordered part, she sparkles brightly and more brightly as she nears the upper sunlight, playing about his head, resting her grace and beauty upon his heart, flying ever and anon in advance, sustained by his strong breath, then nestling with joyful acknowledgment of weak ness upon his kingly form, even making herself tinier than need be that he may be glorified the more in the view of the great skylight. O man! beware how ye come within the sphere of any base, destroying elements, for, though ye may escape utter ruin to your coarser immortal fabric, her more ethereal and tender one may be irremediably bemired. Keep her beside you in your highest soarings, and she will preserve the curtain of your eye cleansed to the point of clearest vision, and give you such glad impulse by her cheering that the rarer ether will never weary, but change more and more your earthly being to the celestial temper of her own, only relieved by what she most looks up to and admires, your strength and manhood. Zoe felt this force more than she reasoned upon it, and her progress was in accordance with the conviction. So delightful was it to be cordially praised for any acquisition, that, through   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    297 her study of German, her whole nature took a start, and the school-girls, quick to perceive each other's inner or outer changes, laughed at her for actually growing taller under the new administration. Zoe," said Adelgunda Heiliger, one day as she was assisting her to dress, "you must get a new frock and charge it to Ben Ezra. He is the cause of this sudden out- growth from the old one, and it is but right that he should replace it, for really this is too scanty for you in the pre- sent fashion." "Let her piece it out to the proper length with her Ger- man exercises," said Rinda. 1"They will answer for phy- lacteries which, you know, she will have to don by-and-by, as is the custom of certain people. Hey, Zoe!" "Of all things in this world, don't call our teacher a Pharisee," said Zoe, "for he is at the moral antipodes from that sect." "At any rate he intends, from present appearances, to be no Essene," said Freya. "Zoe, love, invite me to the wedding, will you not, and introduce me to Ruth? I have always wanted to know her better. I will help her glean, next time she goes to the field of Boaz, and I will be as little fascinating as possible too, so as not to damage her prospects with her kinsman." "Here are some nice smooth stones," said Adelgunda, "which I picked up on the sea beach, which I shall drop into David's pouch as I sit at the feast-table with him. I am going to strike for the throne and cut out Michal alto- gether. I never shall reprove him for dancing, but will waltz till the ark drops to pieces from old age. I shall have an opportunity to learn some new figures, shall I not? and I will astonish Mr. Ernestine next time he comes to give us our lesson."

The Queen of Sheba need not think to come again and delude him by her flattering compliments. I will give her the- go-by in a way she never experienced before. But we forget the principal personages of the occa- sion. Zoe, darling, what roles will suit you and Ben Ezra best, besides that of bride, Madonna-like and saintly, and- what shall I call him of all his metamorphoses?" 4"Call him the Prophet-Priest and King Melchisedec of the coming dispensation, who, without beginning of days or end of years, remains forever the emblem of peace and justice, on whom devolves the ministry divine of ushering in the representative of the second coming of the Son of God," said Zoe. "Ah! King of Salem! I salute thee and hail with joy the day when thou, man of the ages, mysterious and mighty, born without father or mother into our time-globe, takest to thy arms of eld my Zoe to give thee youthful life again, and carry her on to her high destiny!' said Hilda, bowing to her German class-book. 'When is this wonderful union to take place, Zoe?" said Rinda. "I like to know of great events in season so as to be in proper readiness." "Ask the great High Priest of heaven and earth, even our heavenly Father," said she with great seriousness. "There are secrets which even Jesus was not let into wh-en on earth, much less am I. But cease your mirth and raillery, my friends, for I never expect to marry," and she walked out of the room absorbed in her own thoughts. This was a part of her idiosyncrasy, which strengthened as she grew older, that, like Jesus, she should fulfill her mission unbound by the strongest ties of life. To-be-sure, she was shaken for a moment, now and then, when in the presence of her teacher, whose increasing interest in her became suspected by her companions. When his voice   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    299 sank to a tender tone as he addressed her in her recitation, or she caught his eye resting upon her face when she raised it in inquiry to his own, while following his reading, she forgot for a moment her peculiar fate and felt a thrill of youthful love's first dream, but it was soon forgotten in her life-long musings.  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7097-00000151"/> "If she be a traitor, Why so am I; we have still slept together, Rose at an instant, learned, played, eat together, And wheresoe'er we went, like Juno's swans, Still we were coupled and inseparable."--SHAKSPEuB. 'E  Xi # Miss Ingemann read Zoeis outhurst of feeling in her theme, she was shocked and almost discouraged; but being both strong and decided in character, and, ai the same time, conscientious and faithful, so far as she saw her duty, she determined to make a strenuous effort to cure her pupil of her extravagant fancies and willfill opposi- tion to reasonable restraint. She sent for her to her room. Zoe knew what was coming, but she had got to the point, at last, where a determined purpose and strong con- viction of being in the path marked out for her by God and her nature will bring even the most plastic and gentle. Therefore, with head unusually erect and eye expressing courage and enthusiasm, she stood before her teacher. "I Miss Zoe," said Miss Ingemann, " here is your theme. Its expression does not come within the limits of propriety and good sense, and therefore we cannot accept it from. you. We require you to re-write it in a mode consonant to what you know is our reasonable expectation." "Excuse me, Miss Ingemann, I cannot do it." "What do you mean, Miss Zoe? That you intend a will- ful disobedience to the rules of this establishment?" (300    ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   301 "I have no such willful intention. I have simply written my true feelings and thoughts, and I cannot falsify them' by a different expression." "You amaze me by your presumption. -I demand of you a more subdued and rational composition. The thoughts are extravagant and fanatical, and the expression wild and highly improper, and we cannot permit such within these walls. This is my unalterable determination," and Miss Ingemann arose and stood at her full height. Zoe was completely roused, and she burst forth like a torrent to the astonishment of her teacher, who had never seen her under such excitement. "Madam, I have uttered what is in me, and woe be unto my soul if I turn aside the inspiration of God into another channel at the bidding of human lips! I read yesterday in a journal from that far-off land which God opened, that his children might have one abiding-place for freedom to worship God according to His and nature's laws, that her ministers, instead of being guides to lead and light along the people to the millennial day, enchain their minds each five years by a promise to utter nothing but what its creeds of ages gone by have ordered. So they squeeze, and trammel, and wind their thoughts like serpents, ever striving to be free, around a time-worn, bloody, lying parch- ment. Only now and then one frees himself, so as to inter- pret the Word of God as He demands of the growing powers he gave him. But hark! a hiss and sting, and the poor tim'id spirit coils himself again in meek submission to the dismal parchment, whispering, 'I said it not,e or, if I did, ' I meant the same as you!' And what is the conse- quence? Why, sins of every shape and hue start rampant round them, emboldened by the falsehood and treachery of the priests and prophets, scattering misery and darkness, and hurling to perdition millions whom God has given into their keeping.

"; What heroics are these?" said Miss Ingemann, indig- nant and astonished; then paused to look critically into Zoe's face to see if she were not insane. Her pupil knew well that gaze, and it always turned her into stone. She simply bowed and left the room. Once out of her sight, she ran like lightning into her apartment, where she found Hilda. 4 What is the matter?" said she, alarmed at seeing Zoe's excited face. "The matter is, that I am going to sail to-morrow for Santa Cruz." "Why, what has happened? tell me." "Hilda, I have lived entrammeled long enough. My chains gall me to the point of desperation. God and my conscience command me hence, and I obey them. The ship departs to-morrow, and I shall take passage in her." "But, Zoe, you cannot go alone. You never have been away from this retreat, and think how you would feel upon the deep or among uncongenial strangers!" "Hilda, you know me not. I can do anything. I have powers within me that can shake the nations, ay, and shall do it too; how much more guide my own way across the waters. In God I trust. He will watch over me." "O Zoe! I know you better than you think. I have noted your genius and rapt, poetic soarings, so different from the working of my mind, and I have striven to reveal them to our teacher, but your own failure of response to my encomiums by ever wearing before her your stony face, has made them seem to her only like my childish prefer- ence for you without a base of truth. I know too, that your broad vision takes in the practical, as required within our little circle, for we, your schoolmates, ever come to you for a decision upon our little tastes and decorations. But, darling, you are not strong as we are, and one day   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    303 your spirits -rise to the mountain top in exultation, and the next fall into the abyss below. Does she not aid and soothe thee then, thy own strong Hilda, of this common, naughty earth-sphere? Zoo, how canst thou live without me, or I without thee, if thou art far away?" and she began to weep. '6 Hilda! my own, my good and true, who hast borne with such meek yet cheerful patience with my wayward temper, and hast had ever a word and smile of gladness for my strange woe, the cause of which I hardly know of, though it pervades my being, checking each gladsome thought ere it is fully formed, casting a shadow over each smile ere it shines forth to brighten my dull face, thinkest thou I love thee not? O my friend! though a strange gulf, riven not by me but by our Maker, for I have vainly striven all these years to cross it, to cover it up, or make believe that it existed not, divides our deepest souls, yet are you dear to me as my own life. When you are not by, I am restless and forlorn, I gaze into the distance to catch the first glimpse of your beloved form, and strain my ear for quick intelligence of her who, is my sunshine, my tower of strength to lean upon, the interpreter of my thoughts to the stern world, which chills them ere they are expressed by its cold glitter and its icy breath. I know not how life can be life without thee, but God points with direct, com- manding index towards the great ocean, and I go; for in him I live, and move, and have my being in a way which seems to me most peculiar, and if I disobey his counsel, not I alone,but the whole universe is jostled from its orbit. Of this I must say no more; but, O Hilda! pray that I may have strength and guidance for my strange destiny." "Zoi, my life, my inspiration, guide, restraint, and ten- derest friend! I go with thee. Whatever betide thee shall be shared by me, so far as God permits. Thou shalt not leave me to the desolation which would come over my lot unshared by thee, my childhood's mate, thee sharer of my  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7097-00000153"/> 304  ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. room by night and day, and to whom I have grown each year by finer yet stronger ties, even to my opening woman- hood, when judgment, taste, fancy, and deeper religious yearnings all point to thee as my best earthly satisfaction. Can I relinquish thee for all the world beside? No, never! we go together." The two girls embraced each other with all the enthu- siasm suited to their different natures, united as they were by a strong and disinterested affection, high principle, and the purest sentiment. To Hilda there remained a painful and difficult task, which was to inform Miss Ingemann of her determination. They loved each other. With the one, the affection was mingled with pride and a just satisfaction at the successful result of most conscientious training; with the other, gratitude and admiration for this oldest and most faithful teacher and guide. But she hesitated not a moment in view of this trial. '6 Zoe needs me more than any other one in the world, and how can I live without her?" she said to herself, as with the quick decision and courage which characterized her, she threaded her way to Miss Ingemann's apartment. She found that she and Miss Holberg had gone on a visit to a friend in the country, and Would not return until late in the evening. What was to be done now? Zoe was the directress in this emergency. "I must go and bid Mrs. Liebenhoff farewell," said she. "She has been so confined for the last week, nursing our pastor in his severe sickness, that I have not met her for several days; but I must see them both." "Yes," said Hilda, "and Mrs. Korner and other friends too, and above all, Mr. Andersen. Then the captain-we must make arrangements with him immediately. O, how much we have to do!" "Here is your hat, Hilda," said Zoe, as she put on her own. "Come, we can tie them on the way." And the twain, with gloves in hand, arranging their mantles as they walked along the street in a way which   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    305 would have shocked their teacher's nice sense of pro- priety, walked with rapid strides towards Captain Keiser's dwelling. As they came within view of the sea, they saw a ship just sailing from port. They looked at each other and said nothing, but quickened their pace almost to a run to reach the captain's house. The servant at the door told them that he had just sailed for the West Indies, and that they had been misinformed in supposing that the next day was the time of his leaving. Zoe looked bewildered for a moment, for guided, as she felt herself to be, by a special inspiration, this obstacle she could not account for. They were slowly retracing their steps when an acquaintance of Miss Ingemann, an elderly gentleman by the name of Sarran, whom Hilda, in her fondness for playful titles, had dubbed "the Viking," from his frequent voyages, met them. "Good evening, my VolkyriaP' said he to her. "Why droop your wings in that fashion? Come, give me a shake of the hand, ay, and something better too, as a parting blessing, for I suppose you know that I am off to- morrow?" "No, sir; for where?" said Zoe and Hilda in one breath, catching at the faintest hope of release. "To Santa Cruz. Do you think I am going to winter my old rheumatic frame among the ice and snows of old Denmark? Not I. I hope I know what is best for myself. Any commands? I am at the service of any fair damsels of Valhalla, who may wish to send anything, mayhap in the shape of a love-message to the other world, and keep it a secret, too, from the powers at head-quarters," said he, winking at them. "'Neither Odin nor Freya get any revelations from me. Hey, ladies!" and the good-natured old gentleman laughed at his own bright wit, as it seemed to him. "May we go with you?" said Zoe. " O, pray, let us!" 26  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7097-00000154"/> 306   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. "How are you going?" said Hilda, "the ship has sailed." "By England. The monthly steamers to the West- Indies are a better conveyance than any other, in these days. Besides, I have business in London. You go with me? Bless my stars! ain't I in luck? To-be-sure you may, and you need not fear but that I will take good care of you too. There is no gallantry in these days like what I was bred to. But be sure and not be tardy, for I like to be in season. At five o'clock, to-morrow evening, we must be on board, bag and baggage. Remember the hour, please," and the old gentleman bustled away more self-important than ever. "It is just what I want," said Hilda. "Mamma has always said that I might visit her relations in London, before I left Europe, and now is my opportunity. But here is the parsonage. I hope that Mr. Liebenhoff is not very ill." They ran up the steps and asked for their friend. Mrs. Liebenhoff at first sent down her excuse, saying, that she could not leave her husband; but on telling the servant that their urgency was extreme, she appeared, but sad and worn by night-watching and anxiety. They told her in hurried terms, of their sudden determination, but forbore to enter into particulars in her present state of feeling, and she, though sad and tearful at the thought of losing them, was not so much surprised as they expected. The fact was, she knew that they were to go home in the course of the year, and preoccupied as her mind was by her husband's illness, it did not seem strange to her that they should be summoned to return a few months earlier than they antici- pated, so she did not question them about it. "Can we not see Mr. Liebenhoff, one moment?" said Hilda. "I think so. I will see," she said. In a few moments they stood before him. He was   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    307 propped up by pillows, pale and emaciated, and they were shocked to see the change which a few days of suffering had produced in him. "You are going to leave us then, and next Sabbath you were to join us in our renewed communion? We shall sadly miss our dear young friends. It may be, however, that I shall be absent too; what think, dear Lisbet? Well," seeing her turn aside in agitation, " it must be as God wills. Farewell, little ones! be good children and remem- ber us, as we shall you, with love and prayer, that God may bless you and grant us to meet again!" They kissed his pale forehead, then were folded for a moment in the arms of Mrs. Liebenhoff, and weeping left the house. A few more calls, and tender adieux, and many tears) and then they returned to gather their goods together for-their voyage. They sat up late packing their boxes, writing farewell notes to friends whom they should not see again, and arranging everything with a discretion and sense of fitness remarkable .in two young girls, who had ever been watched over by careful guardianship. But it seemed as if a great purpose had matured them in a day and carried them to its fulfillment, as with the force of inspiration. They talked over their plans till late at night, then fell into fitful, dreamy sleep to awaken by the broad sunlight shining into their window. After breakfast, hand in hand they appeared before Miss Ingemann. She looked up from her book and started, as if she read a strong resolve in every feature of their faces. Hilda, who thought she had nerved herself for the crisis, began to cry. "What means this?" said their teacher. "We come," said Zo, " to inform you, madam, of our determination to return to Santa Cruz. We are in readi- ness and, shall leave this evening. We ask your blessing on our way."  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7097-00000155"/> 308   ZOB; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. Miss Ingemann looked from one to the other, doubting the evidence of her senses, then with dignity and a slight curl of the lip, said to Zoe: "And who has given you permission to leave your guardians so abruptly?" "God and my conscience," answered Zoe. Miss Ingemann had high respect for principle and a strong resolve, and though she saw lamentable fanaticism in her pupil, yet she could not but respect the determined bearing of the young girl, though she meant that it should yield to her own strength of will. "Zoe," she said, "I do not wish to be harsh with you; but you are entirely in the wrong in this matter. People are not inspired in these latter days. We have other aids to guide us. It is very wrong for you to think of leaving your school before your father sends expressly for you." "My father had in view only my greater ease and plea- sure in bidding me stay a few more months. 'But I know he is in trouble from the unsettled condition of our island at this time, and I wish on that account, if on no other, to return. I am not selfish, as I wish to prove to him. Already he has spent beyond his lessened means in my edu- cation; and my mother and I are pining to meet each other. I wish to go. Mr. Sarran will protect us on the voyage." Miss Ingemann's methodical mind was not convinced by these reasons. There was always much formality in the manner of the -dismissal of her pupils, and this extempo- raneous leave did not consort at all with her strict notions. She waved her hand and said, "It is of no use to exchange words upon this subject. I dismiss you, young ladies, to your studies." Zoe was roused and burst out again. "No, madam, it is of no use, as you say, to lengthen words upon my leaving you. A greater than my teacher bids me go hence, where my every respiration is drawn at the expense of truth, of nature, and the high behest of God.   ZOE'; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   309 "Last night in dreams I saw myself upon the broad and fearful waste of waters. Strangely did they sustain my weight, as with most natural self-possession, with drooping head and hands suspended by my side I walked upon them. There was darkness behind, and gloom and a fear- ful wall of briny waves before me, but a bright gleam from heaven, shining through a silvery cloud, lighted my foot- steps close before me, and the mists blew westward, and the waves flowed fast towards the same goal; and the wind, the sun, and every voice of nature sounded in my awaken- ing ear-' Onward, still onward,' and I must go." Seeing the girl's determination, and knowing that, in a few months, at farthest, she was to give her up, the thought came to Miss Ingemann's mind, like a flash, that she had better not contend longer with a nature with which she had so little sympathy and success; and as she knew Mr. Sarran well, and that she could confide her to him with safety, she changed her tone and said: "6 Well, Zoe, if you choose to take the responsibility of disobeying your father, I will no longer fetter you, as you, in your high-flown language, accuse me. I will write to your parents, explain- ing to them the reasons for permitting you to leave. I am sorry if my care and labor for your good have only given you the sense of bondage. I have striven to do right by you," and her voice trembled. Zoe was completely subdued by this expression of feel- ing. One of her accustomed revulsions came over her after a time of excitement. She threw herself on her knees before her teacher, wailing out, "Think me not ungrateful for all the good I have derived from you. My heart is burdened with a sense of unworthiness; for I well know I have not met your plans and exertions in my education as you have desired. Forgive me, and yet pity me, for I know not what I am, nor what God would have of me. I could not be what you wish, and yet I am weighed down by remorse that I am not."  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7097-00000156"/> 310   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. This unwonted revelation of her struggling feelings, which was forced, from her by the softening influences of the occasion of parting from her home and teacher of years, brought out strongly the opposite characteristics of these two beings. Zoe, gentle, affectionate, and humble from ever looking upwards to an exalted ideal; poetic, sensitive, and delicate in her feelings and of quick insight into character, felt no resentment at the obstinate efforts of Miss Ingemann to warp her nature aside from its rectitude and beauty by a culture unsuited to it. On the contrary, she looked at the conscientious motives which had governed her in the main, forgetting now what she had previously felt very forcibly, that wounded pride was also a cause of her being no better liked by her teacher. She simply wished to be free as God and her own soul irresistibly impelled her, and, therefore, the step she was taking, accompanied as it was by so much heart-rending feeling. In Miss Ingemann's character, on the contrary, pride, self-reliance and self-esteem were combined with a strong, clear, but narrow intellect, and a reason which took in but little besides the obvious, striking, and practical in life and character. To this was superadded a religion, which though abstract, speculative, and mystical in its creed, and favoring a certain cast-iron form of sentiment and con- tracted mode of religious experience for all souls alike, frowned upon all indications of an awakening religious life in accordance with the advancing mind of the age, and the natural influence of a more rational understanding of the spirit of our faith in its gradual emancipation from a slavish obedience to the bare letter of Scripture. The consequence was that there was in her a hardness, direct- ness, sternness, and even scorn and intolerance towards what was the deepest life and inspiration to Zoe, her poeti- cal sentiment and rapt musings with the ethereal spirit of   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    3" nature and the universe, quite crushing to all her confi- dence and trust. These qualities were revealed in her answer to Zoe's simple expression of gratitude and confession of self-reproach. "I am very glad, Miss Zoo, that you show symptoms of a proper consciousness of your faults, and that you are not entirely unmindful of all that has been done for you. However, I am very direct, as you know, (this she often said with much emphasis,) and I must say to you that there are- reasons why I, of late years, have not expected the same of you as my other pupils, so it may serve as some alleviation to your sense of imperfection as well as to my own disappointment. But let me advise you, as a friend, to give up your foolish and sinful fancies and be governed by common sense and evangelical faith in God. I wish to part from you in friendship," and she erected her head with self-satisfaction at her magnanimity. Zo6 keenly felt all that was conveyed in this truly coarse speech, though Miss Ingemann did not intend it as such. It was simply the natural expression of a woman highly bred by aristocratic, conventional, dogmatic life, just in the proportion that she was vulgarized by losing sight of the eternal principle of the equality of every immortal soul before God, blinding herself to the truth, that if one seems inferior to another, it is because circumstances have made it so, or what is equally probable, because her own stands ard of judgment is too low for her to see the truth as it really'is. The conviction flashed upon her pupil with lightning force, that while she, in her simplicity, had opened her heart to her teacher as in the presence of God, she had been met by a severe, selfish, worldly spirit, revealing itself quite as much through her religious wishes in her behalf, as in her implied inferiority of caste and mental endowment. She too ejected her head and left the  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7097-00000157"/> 312   ZOEO, OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. room, her sorrow and self-reproach turned into a sense of injustice and indignation.     S In this mood of mind she ran into one of the recitation rooms for a book, where she found her German teacher. He had just heard from Mrs. Liebenhoff of her intention of leaving Copenhagen, and came immediately to see her. They gazed into each other's faces for a moment, and a quick intelligence revealed their mutual feelings before Zoe had time to train her eye to its usual look of passion- less repose. At this moment the youngest "child of the regiment" of school-girls, a favorite of Zoe, and who was often hanging about her during her recitation, came into the room. She was artless, and affectionate, and a great chatterer.          r J "O dear!" said she, "you shan't go away, Zoe, shall she, Mr. Seiill? Why don't you make her stay?" said she. "If I were a great, strong maxn, I would. Do try, won't you?" and she took a hand of each, and endeavored to draw them together. "You believe in intimations from above," said he. "O! accept this, through one, about whom heaven lieth in her infancy. Will you not stay? or may I not go to you?" Zoi said nothing, but her face expressed the opposite feelings, striving within her. "I know she will stay if you want her to; because she told Hilda she was very sorry to give up studying German; that she liked to speak it better than Danish." "Let me interpret that," said he, "for my own soul holds the true key to it, or I mistake me. 'Because you can think aloud in it better than in the more northern tongue.' Tell me that it is so." She smiled and blushed, and emboldened, he approached her. She waved him back, for the thought of her great mission came between her and the rapture of a first affec- tion. Still, partly swayed by passing suggestions, various thoughts flashed through her mind. "It may be that God   ZOEc; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   313 intends him for a helper in my great work. But shall I return to my dear parents with my life's partner chosen without their knowledge? I will not be so unfilial." She partly turned from him, saying, "Wait but a year." "What say you?" he said, not wishing to believe that he heard aright. "Be my friend for a little year," she said decidedly, "and, in the meantime, I go to the arms of my beloved mother." ' Have pity on me first," said he, " and give me surer hope than this. I have dreamed that at last heaven was propitious to my prayer, and was granting that in you I might see the completion of one arc of my weird destiny, and that in your loving care and tenderness, comfort would flow into my stricken heart." This had the opposite effect upon Zoe to what was intended, for her own life had been one of such suffering and privation, that when she thought for a moment of the possibility of marriage, it was as a refuge and consolation to herself in some degree, and the oft-repeated words of Mrs. Liebenhoff, implicating his sex for its low view of woman, now came forcibly to her, chilling her feelings very perceptibly. He saw this, and interpreting it wrongly, said: "It may be that far away, you will forget, in the smiles of others, even to wait one little year." Zoe flashed up at the possibility of any want of truth and rectitude in herself. "Do you believe that I would trifle with your most sacred feelings?" said she. "I know well that the youthful of your sex are not with- out caprice, and lack, sometimes, a faithful memory of those they leave behind. How can I trust my fate to the few words you have spoken, and those so enigmatical? I cEn in chains, and you would sail away unshackled into the dim distance, leaving me -" 27  &#xD;<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7097-00000158"/> 314   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. "Free as the air that blows over the Carpathians from even the bonds of friendship,s said she, turning abruptly from him and walking out of the room. If Ben Ezra, after months' acquaintance, in which she had revealed her- self to him more than to any other one, believed her so worldly and common-place, she wished to be bound to him by no tie whatever; and indignant and disappointed she ran to complete her arrangements. Hilda remained with Miss Ingemann after Zoe left the room. Her teacher did not dream of her going, too; for loving her as she had always done, she felt sure of her being obedient in every respect to her wishes. Seeing her in tears, she said, "I am sorry for this misguided girl. She gives us all much trouble, but dry your eyes, my dear. I am going into the country to pass the next Sabbath with my friend, Mrs. Petersen, and you shall accompany me, love. In the meantime make yourself as happy as possi- ble, and-perhaps you would like to assist Zoi in her pre- parations the next hour or two. If so, I will excuse you from recitation this morning." "I must go with Zoe," said Hilda. Miss Inge'mann started and paused before she would trust her voice to speak. "You, my dear Hilda, my pride and joy! You will not disappoint me by any disregard of my hopes -and wishes? Why should you go now? Another opportunity will offer six months hence. Zoe will leave this establishment in disgrace for her willfulness and ingratitude. I wish my darling to carry with her all the honors it can give her." Here, too, Miss Ingemann failed in her appeal, though to a nature very much like her own in its original charac- teristics. But Hilda had been moulded by Zoe, quite as much, though more indirectly, than by her, and now that her gentler friend was in trial, she clung to her. She had gradually been awakening to the wide difference between the two, and her mature preference was for the more   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.    315 poetic and spiritual one, though she was not blind to the extravagances in her development. She wiped her eyes, and with as much decision and coolness as Miss Ingemann could manifest when occasion offered, she answered to what she considered a low motive for her to place before her for staying. "I must go with Zoe, Miss Ingemann;" and then left her. At five o'clock, all was in readiness for them to leave; the last box corded, the last little gift exchanged with their favorite companions, and the last kiss given to Miss Hol berg, who was in and out all day assisting them by kindly suggestions, and exchanging many a word of affectionate interest. The final duty was to go and bid Miss Ingemann farewell. The latter was cold and dignified to Hilda, in proportion as her affections and pride were more severely wounded by the step she was taking, and Hilda acted the same role in a little less lofty and dignified style, while Zoei was overwhelmed with sorrow.  Miss Ingemann, partly touched by this, and partly to rebuke Hilda, with whom she was really offended, condescended to say, "Miss Zoi, perhaps at some future time you will again visit Den- mark?"Her pupil, softened by the thought of leaving the only home of which she had any distinct knowledge, and her sole guardian since infancy, longed to throw herself into her arms and respond warmly to this chilly, non-com- mittal invitation; but she thought what a gulf there was between them. She never yet had uttered an untruth, and in mournful accents and with drooping head, leaning with tsinking form on Hilda's arm, she slowly answered, "No." So she went forth to meet her destiny; a reed, shaken by every passing breeze; a wind-harp, now tuned to melody by each gentle breath, now its cords snapped asunder by a rude touch or gale; a vase, inclosing in its depths a store of sweet perfume, essence, and spirit of lore and science, by no means meagre for one so young; a failure, it is true, in the discipline of mind deemed essential by the calculat  &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7097-00000159"/> 316   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH. ing, critical spirit of the age; yet a trophy of success in the great school of Christ, for she had learned of him to be meek and lowly, at the same time that she was brave and true to Nature and her most enlightened conscience, and had caught a glimpse of the power and grandeur of a life like his, and by what struggle it was to be attained, so that, come death, come woe, or serenest happiness, it mat- tered not; the goal was before her, and for that, her aim was set, and never-ending labor. As they drove away, Miss Ingemann said to Miss Hol- berg, "I am more than ever convinced that there is no use in trying to educate the masses, excepting to suit their low position. In this instance, I have been unsuccessful, while Zoe has been a great detriment to the really superior mind of Hilda." "I feel," said Miss Holberg, weeping, " that we have not been able to interpret her nature successfully, and hence our disappointment. Depend upon it, she has trea- sures within her, which only need the right key to unlock them, to astonish and delight us." "Do you think so?" said Miss Ingemann, and stood thoughtful for a moment. She was truly religious, and seeing her assistant in such grief, she said, "( Well, my dear, we have striven to do our duty by her. May God forgive us if we have been guilty of an unintentional mis- take. We can only commend her to Him now, and may He supply what may have been lacking in bur instruc- tions." The Pastor's wife watched with sinking heart, the sands of her husband's hour-glass running silently, but none the less surely towards eternity. In one sense, she was pre- pared for this premature ultimate of a life, taxed in mind and heart beyond the possibilities of a healthy longevity. But more than actual exorbitant work, in its injurious effects upon the physical system, was the heavy weight of responsibility thrown upoon him, by the want of co-operatioll   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH,      317 of the surrounding community in his labors, for what he felt to be its absolute and imperative need. Quickened as his soul was to a high point of spiritual insight and eleva- tion, the prevailing materialism, and the lack of a full and living appreciation of the high duties devolving upon every human being towards itself and the world, weighed upon an already fractured constitution with destructive force. Lacking her keen imaginative glance and ever-living hope- fulness, he was sustained in his unflagging self-devotion by firm principle and love for truth, more than by any pros- pective vision of eventual success. He was invested with every quality of mind, character and culture incident to humanity, save the single onie of passion, which would have given to the others the magnetic dart, necessary to pierce through the heavy crust with which mammon and sense had covered up the hearts of his people. But all was over, and she, like Marius upon the ruins of Car thage, sat upon the grave of her desolated hopes, and thus her soul sighed out its dirge, broken in its strains by the anguish of many loving friends of his flock, no less than by the sense of her own life-loss.

Ah I well I know the cause of thy untimely exit, And as Achilles by Patroclus' death-bed Vowed to avenge him, so do I thee, my own, Twice slain, once by excess of care and labor For the selfish world: then by the foul city's breath, Made poisonous by sins, too mighty for thy cure, Too monstrous for thy slackened power of life's continuance.

After due care and observance, Ben Ezra left the re- mains of the dead to bid a more satisfactory farewell to Zoe, than she, in her impatient excitement, had allowed him. As- he passed the quay, he saw a ship with its sails fully set, just sailing away into the thick mist, which at the hour of evening was enveloping the harbor. He inquired of a bystander its name and commander, and found it was the one in which she and Hilda had embarked.   A double sense of desolation settled on his spirit. His dearest friend in the present scene of his lengthened experience had just departed, and now the hope, which had gilded his latest life, was fast fading away into the grave which the ages had been lowering and ever lowering. Thus he wailed out his lament: "Gone I gone I another ray of sunshine over my pathway stealing. How long, O Lord, how long dost thou deny my heart's sore pleading I Am I the sport of a blind destiny, the caprice of a stern fate?

There are plenty of shrewd and knowing people, who will tell me if it is formed according to the rules laid down for authors, if the sentences are too long, if the facts agree with the time stated, if the characters speak and act as they ought to, and make many other remarks upon it which you would not, and I hope, never will understand. But I wish to give it in charge to those who will love it for its spirit, its deepest meaning; so I come to you, and if a part of it is too old for you now to take a lively interest in it, you will, I hope, grow to like it better by-and-by. "My children, you know all too well that we are left without his guidance, who was ever faithful and loving in his instructions to us, so we must be all the more true and earnest in laboring for ourselves. He loved each and all of you, little ones. It cheered him, each Sabbath morning, to come to you, and look into your sunny eyes, and mark your obedient attention when he spoke to you of God and Jesus. And when weighed down in spirit by the lack of interest of his older hearers in the truth he gave them, which was dearer than his own life to him, he would say: 'The children will drink into their young hearts its beauty and purity, and their souls will bud and bloom into sweet flowers for the garden of our God; and they will build a temple for his worship, and each of them shall be a living stone in it, polished to fittest grace and loveliness.' And now that he is gone, they say, 'we cannot rebuild our church, so we will leave it as it is, a wreck for passers- by to gaze at, and, may-be, scoff for our lukewarmness.' "My children, we will build the church, new and com- plete in every part, a fit offering to the great, good Father and our Redeemer. Come one, come all, Mary, and Freya, and Edgar, and Carl, and Gunhilda, and Louise, and Eva, and Fritz, and many more that I cannot name.

And little Petrea shall sing for us, meanwhile, the simple song she learns at school, and Meta shall come and dance for us, and if she trips with graceful step to help, by her playful, winning ways, to build a temple where she can learn of Him, who loved more than all else, little children, then she will grow up and never be proud and vain because of her ' flouncy gown.' "Do you ask, how we shall have strength and money enough to build our church? Never fear, my children. ' God will provide. Only begin with loving hearts and an earnest purpose, and the sweet heavens and every gracious influence of earth will aid us., Never fear, but commence the work in fullest trust and love, and more than the half is done. "What shall its form be, do you say? It shall grow into grace and beauty under our hands, even as a forest- tree. Strong and massive shall it be, to live for ages, so that our children's children shall see where their parents worshiped, and say, ' we will praise God even more worthily than they, because of their blest instructions and the ever- living, growing action of our own souls combined.' "Its pointed doors and windows shall uplift us as we gaze towards the heavens. Its two towers, one sur- mounted by an anchor, the other by a cross, shall speak to us of consecration of ourselves to duty, however trying, and of high hope combined. Its shell, with open ear, shall teach us to be awake and listening to every hint borne to us from God without and God within us. Its pillars, many-branched, shall, like the trees, tell us of God, walk- ing amid the cool wood's shade, of which our temple shall be a symbol.

He will read, too, of God's dealings to his people before his coming; and then of his full, consummated truth, exempli- fied'by his great life. And we will chant the psalms and hymns together-turning our faces towards the choir and organ-each one as he best may, with melody of utterance, or by the sincere and voiceless spirit. a It shall be adorned with pictures, which speak to us, at times, even with plainer voice than words.

"Christ, walking upon the water, an emblem of the electric spirit's potency, shall be a hint to us of the power of the coming future. The Prodigal Son, welcomed by his Father, will show us the forgiving love of God for sin- ners. And we will not forget our sufering Saviour, for his crucifixion tells us trumpet-tongued, of the high cost of every man's redemption; for, not alone by Jesus dying to ease, to glory, and to earthly love; nor by his resigna- tion to what God appointed, but by our own likewise, do we gain the crown, and reign as conquerors over sin and ruin forevermore. "We will build high our church, with steps ascending to it, so that the ' Children's Chapel ' underneath shall have full air and sunshine. It shall be broad and spacious, even the Church above, for many will come to our Sunday- school, I ween.

I have many ready for our Chapel now, my own. "It shall be open each Sunday evening too. Sometimes we will gather to hear one, who can tell us well of the wonders of the stars. Again another shall teach us of the beauty and high uses of the trees and flowers; another, of the marvels of the tinted shell, linking each with thoughts of God, and his many-sided goodness, loveliness and power. And thus the Pastor will be relieved and cheered by the aid of many minds, intent like him, upon spreading God's truth and love, and making our lives harmonious therewith. Sometimes, too, we will meet in our Chapel- home for social converse, brightened by intelligence and thought, and warmed by sympathetic interest in high themes. "9 And now, I am going to speak to you, my children, of what many pious people will think a very sinful plan, but it is not nevertheless, to my simple faith. So be attentive to me. You know that the Sabbath was given us to rest from labor, to grow good, to do good, and be happy in. God has not told us exactly how, though all the ages have pointed to the Church and its simple and holy ordinances, as one great means of becoming thus; so every Sunday morn- ing, if possible, we will come to church; and in the after- noon, there are so many good books to read, it seems a very pleasant way to spend the hours in, to learn some- thing from their teachings. But sometimes, on Sunday evenings, we will have dramatic representations in our Chapel. Is'it so very dreadful? You have felt, I dare say, after being serious all day long, as if you would like to sport and play. God put this love of change into your feelings. You only must learn to guide it rightly. It is no more wicked to laugh than weep, indeed much less so, I think, in a world which God has made purposely for us   ZOE; OR, THE QUADROON'S TRIUMPH.   327 to be happy in. So we will be merry a part of Sunday, will we not? "' And do you not think, if a little boy or girl were striv- ing very hard to grow up good, and wished to learn how, in every way he could, that, if he saw, represented by liv- ing persons, the struggles, trials, and at last the victory of some great and good man or woman, who had toiled from childhood for this high aim, that he would learn as much, as if he went to a darkened church three times each Sun- day, to hear a gloomy-looking man say in the morning, over and over again, 'that sin is exceeding sinful;' and in the afternoon, tell of the ' terrors of the law,' and in the even, ing,' that God was going to burn up a multitude of his children for ever and ever?' "I think we should learn a great deal more. .So the young people, with little trouble and preparation, will use the talent which has been given them, for some good pur- pose, to make our Sabbath evenings happy and beneficial to us. "And now, I go into the sweet country and the bright tinted woods to gather comfort and hope again from their refreshing influences. Farewell, my children, and when I return, come to me, for a little while, and a few at a time; for I have much to do, and your noisy prattle when too long listened to, disturbs the current of my many thoughts. And you shall see my pictures, and select one, each of you, as you best like; for I have many which have been suggestions to me while I wrote my book for you, and which I will with pleasure give to my little friends. Fare- well." END OF VOL I.   &#xD;</p>
