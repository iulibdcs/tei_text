            <head>GLEASON'S PICTORIAL DRAWING-ROOM COMPANION,</head> 
            <head type="sub">A RECORD OF THE BEAUTIFUL AND USEFUL IN ART.</head> 
            <p>The object of this paper is to present, in the most elegant and available form, a weekly literary melange of notable events of the day. Its columns are devoted to original tales, sketches and poems, by the BEST AMERICAN AUTHORS, and the cream of the domestic and foreign news; the whole well spiced with wit and humor. Each paper is BEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATED with numerous accurate engravings, by eminent artists, of notable objects, current events in all parts of the world, and of men and manners, altogether making a paper entirely original in its design in this country. Its pages contain views of every populous city in the known world, of all buildings of note in the eastern or western hemisphere, of all the principal ships and steamers of the navy and merchant service, with fine portraits of every noted character in the world, male and female. Sketches of beautiful scenery, taken from life, are also given, with numerous specimens from the animal kingdom, the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea. The Pictorial is now printed on the finest of paper, from a font of new and beautiful type, manufactured expressly for it,-presenting in its mechanical execution an elegant specimen of art. It contains fifteen hundred and sixty-four square inches, giving a great amount of reading matter and illustrations-a mammoth weekly paper of sixteen octavo pages. It forms THE BEST FAMILY PAPER, inasmuch as its aim is constantly, in connection with the fund of amusement it affords, and the rich array of original miscellany it presents, to inculcate the strictest and highest tone of morality, and to encourage virtue by holding up to view all that is good and pure, and avoiding all that is evil in its tendency. In short, the object is to make the paper loved, respected, and sought after for its combined excellences.</p>

                  <head type="sub">AN ALPINE VALLEY-HUT OF MONNA BARBARA.</head> 
                  <p>
                     <figure> </figure>
                  </p> 
                  <p>DUSK was deepening over the Alpine summits, and huge shadows stalked slowly downward, broadening gloomily through the valleys. All nature was sinking into the sealed quiet of a winter's night, only to be broken, during the long hours, by the rumbling thunders of shifting fields of snow in the passes and declivities of the mountains, or perchance the sudden rushing crash of an avalanchine slide of gathered ice, bearing terror and destruction to the slumbering villages below.</p> 
                  <p>Near the base of a steep precipice, the rocky side of which served for one of its walls, was a rude hut, constructed of roughly cemented stones, with a roof partly-thatched with coarse flag grass, partly sheltered from the weather by the gnarled convolutions of thick vine, running rankly up the sides of the precipice, and spreading in an almost impervious mass over the top and eaves of the building. From the single small and unglazed window of this hut, streamed a light, as of a glowing fire.</p> 
                  <p>Other lights were scattered along the line of the sheltered valley, glimmering from the casements of peasants' cottages, wherein at this hour the humble but contented denizens of the hamlet were busied in the preparation or hearty enjoyment of their evening meal; and one light, brighter than any of the rest (and nearer to the mountain pass which formed the southern outlet to the vale) gleamed from the dwelling of old Nicolo, a famous hunter-guide, well-known throughout the Alpine districts. This light was in truth, something more than an ordinary beacon; for it could be distinguished from afar, upon the peaks, and was moreover, nightly trimmed and tended by the hands of Nicolo's fair grand-child Bianca, allowed by common consent to be the rustic queen of all the valley maidens.</p> 
                  <p>But we have immediately to do with the hut first mentioned, built under the steep precipice, and half-covered with tangled vines, which was<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6326-00000004"/> situated only a few hundred yards from the more capacious and comfortable cottage of Nicolo. It was occupied by three persons, an aged woman, who bore not the best of reputations among the villagers (being reputed as a witch, or; at least, as being more familiar with the many imps and sprites of the mountains than good Catholics were allowed to be), and her two reputed sons, Berthold and Valentine. That the old mother was ill-favored and weird-looking enough to entitle her to Some claims on the score of witchcraft, was not to be doubted; but it was very evident that whatever necromantic power she might possess, did not suffice to elevate her worldly condition, since both she and her sons had dwelt for many years in the vine-roofed hovel, the latter laboring in the summer season as dressers in the vineyards of the valley, and officiating in the winter as guides, or essaying their fortune as hunters in the mountains; while the crone herself busied her aged hands in collecting every sort of herb from the hills, which, after carefully cleansing and drying, she made into small bundles, and sold at the summer fairs and festivals. Perhaps it was the poor dame's habits of clambering up the rocks, and hobbling over the valleys, in search of her herbal treasures, duly plucking them at their full time of juiciness, whether such occurred at noon or midnight, that first inspired the superstitious peasants with an impression of her supernatural connections. Besides, it is a well-known fact, that when poverty is united with extreme ungainliness in the person of an old female, the young and thoughtless have ever been willing to add to the poor creature's afflictions the stigma of dealing with the evil one; whereas, it will generally be found, on inquiry, that a great deal more ground exists for suspicions of the sort, When the object of them is quite young and handsome, since there is surely more danger to be apprehended from the attractions of youth and beauty than from the absence of both.</p> 
                  <p>This was, at least, the reasoning of the good friar Ambrose, the spiritual director of the valley, on an occasion when the zealous peasants were disposed to amuse themselves, and establish their orthodoxy, by resorting to stringer measures in order to test the genuineness of Monna Barbara's faith in the church; for no only had the offence of devil-dealing been imputed to the unfortunate old woman, but she was likewise charged with being a Lutheran-a character which, in the eyes of the worthy peasantry was little less to be dreaded than the veritable enemy of souls himself. Nevertheless, in spite of many cattle having died with the murrain, and two or three blights visiting the vines since Monna Barbara first brought her young children from across the German mountains, and took up with them her abode in the pleasant Val d'Orazio (which was the name of the little district shut in by lofty hills, where she had continued to dwell to the present time); in spite of these things, we say, the old woman was acknowledged to be of great service among the inhabitants; and indeed, it was conceded that to her skill, in the preparation of herbal remedies, many a poor villager, wounded by accident, or stricken with fever, had owed his recovery from near the very gate of death. So, on the whole, though some extravagant fellows, after drinking wine and walking in procession to church, were accustomed to denounce Monna Barbara as a witch and heretic, none of the better class of people ever thought of molesting the peaceable and inoffensive crone. And for her defence against the ignorant common people, it was well-known that the lads Berthold and Valentine, now grown into stalwort youths, were quite able to guard their humble domicile against violence. Therefore, Monna Barbara pursued her business of gathering simples without much fear of the church, or its too-zealous adherents.</p> 
                  <p>Berthold was the eldest of the two sons of Monna Barbara. He was a young man of stout frame, thick-set in person, with broad shoulders and endued with a strength which made him equal to great feats of labor during the vinegathering season, and of course, rendered his services in much demand among the neighboring husbandmen. He was likewise skilful as a hunter, and accustomed to exertion and exposure during the inclement winters, making light of many hardships that deterred youths of less vigor and boldness from the pursuits of the chase, or the vocation of guide to travellers wishing to pass the dangerous portions of the mountainous chains that extended far beyond this valley to the frontiers of France, Switzerland and Germany. Berthold, sometimes alone, sometimes in company with his brother, had often traversed the entire route, and by this, means, together with their summer labors, the youths had always kept themselves above the reach of want. Yet, though his capabilities and courage were allowed to be great throughout the valleys, Berthold was no favorite among the villagers, and many evil things were conjectured about him, which often, as in the case of his mother, were quite ill-founded. His general demeanor, indeed, was not prepossessing, and his features contributed little to produce a favorable impression on acquaintance. He had small, piercing eyes, constantly roving in wandering glances, and seeming to scan the thoughts of those who encountered their regards. His complexion was swarthy, and the expression of his face scornful and repulsive. Indeed his looks appeared to convey a consciousness of his unpopularity, and to intimate at the same time that he defied and despised those who were inimical to him.</p> 
                  <p>Valentine was very unlike Berthold. The eyes of this young man were dark and bright, but they were likewise large, and looked out from beneath his forehead with a clear and earnest expression. Like Berthold he was strongly built, and taller in frame than he, with a more graceful and easy carriage. But his smile was free and open, while the other's was covert and scornful, as though mirth were a weakness he despised. Berthold was habitually haughty and unmoved, while Valentine's temper was impetuous, and his actions sudden and often violent. But the young men of the valley, opposed as they were to intimacy with the elder, were ever favorably disposed to the younger of these two sons of Monna Barbara; and so, consequently, Valentine, from his childhood, had been accustomed to mingle in the sports and feasts of the youthful villagers, while Berthold withdrew himself at all times from the merry meetings of the valley, as if conscious of the aversion with which he was regarded.</p> 
                  <p>The brothers now sat together before a blazing fire in the single apartment of their humble dwelling, whilst, to and fro, preparing the evening meal, the old Monna Barbara hobbled on her aged limbs. In the light of the burning fagots this woman's face appeared very ancient and ghastly. In truth, she was at this time full threescore years of age. Nevertheless, her small black eyes were still quite sparkling, and though her hair was white as snow, her teeth were neither discolored nor decayed. Altogether, Monna Barbara was a singular-looking old personage, with her thin silver locks, sharply-bright eyes, and brilliant teeth; and perhaps it is not to be marvelled at that the credulous villagers gave her credit for a charmed existence, though her old hut and bundles of simples were all the infernal machinery that was ever visible to their scrutiny.</p> 
                  <p>Monna Barbara's white straggling hair was parted over her forehead, and tied behind with a piece of faded ribbon. Her bird-like eyes glistened beneath their shaggy brows, glancing furtively from one to the other of the two youths, who, sitting on wooden stools near the fire, plied their short hunter's knives, the one carving an ice-pole, the other shaping snow-shoes from hard wood.</p> 
                  <p>Suddenly Berthold raised his eyes, and looked sharply at the old woman, saying in an impatient tone of voice:</p> 
                  <p>"Why do you not make haste?"</p> 
                  <p>Monna Barbara returned his glance with one as sharp, but went on with her preparations, replying nothing.</p> 
                  <p>"Why do you not answer me, woman?" muttered the son, morosely.</p> 
                  <p>"Nay, Berthold,' interposed Valentine.</p> 
                  <p>"Speak not thus harshly to our mother."</p> 
                  <p>"You interfere-do you?" cried Berthold, fiercely turning on the young man. "Mind you your work, boy, or belike I shall have a word or two with you!"</p> 
                  <p>"Certainly I shall not sit by, and see our mother abused by her eldest son, though he is well-known to have little natural feeling," rejoined Valentine.</p> 
                  <p>"Ha, ha!" ejaculated the gloomy Berthold, with his customary contemptuous laugh.</p> 
                  <p>"You think to provoke me," said the younger brother. "You have a mind to quarrel with both of us, were I to heed your brutality. Nevertheless, brother of mine, hark ye-our mother shall not be treated with disrespect."</p> 
                  <p>"Who taught you all this fine language, my valiant stripling? Are you indebted to old Nicolo for the lesson?"</p> 
                  <p>Valentine remained silent, but he bit his lips, nervously, to keep down his rising passion.</p> 
                  <p>"Or, maybe, his pretty grand-daughter was so good as to teach her handsome young neighbor?" continued Berthold, with a sneer. Valentine still made no reply.</p> 
                  <p>"Faith! the boy has lost his tongue. Without doubt, it has followed his heart, and the pretty Bianca is now-"</p> 
                  <p>"Have a care what you say concerning her," exclaimed Valentine, suddenly losing his temper, and speaking in a loud key.</p> 
                  <p>"Doubtless, I shall say whatever I like, without asking permission of <emph>Valentine,</emph>" retorted the provoking Berthold.</p> 
                  <p>"Then your bull-head shall' feel this goad,"<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6326-00000005"/> exclaimed the younger brother, lifting his arm, and brandishing the ice-pole which he had been sharpening, and to the end of which he had affixed the ferule of pointed iron, with which such sticks are shod.</p> 
                  <p>Berthold started from his stool, clutching the knife which he had been using, and seemed about to rush at once upon his brother. But the old dame hobbled forward, and grasped his arm, screaming:</p> 
                  <p>"Take care of yourself, Valentine."</p> 
                  <p>"Away with you, beldam!" muttered Berthold, fiercely. But Monna Barbara saw the knife glittering in the firelight, and she clung with closer grasp to his arm.</p> 
                  <p>"Take that, then, for your interference," cried the ruffian son, and he struck with his left hand a backward blow at the crone, so that she staggered and fell against the wall.</p> 
                  <p>But Valentine, by this time, had grappled with his infuriated brother, and now, with dexterous twist he wrenched the knife from his hand, just as the aged mother was dashed to the side of the room.</p> 
                  <p>At this moment, the door of the hut was opened from without, and two figures appeared upon the threshold. Valentine released his hold, for he recognized in the foremost old Nicolo, the hunter, grand-father of Bianca, whose innocent name had been the cause of the sudden collision.</p> 
                  <p>"Ho! what is all this, young man?" exclaimed Nicolo, as he paused in astonishment on the door-still, and surveyed the attitude and threatening demeanor of Valentine, who had just plucked away his antagonist's weapon. "Your hand at your own brother's throat, and your knife bare, too! For shame! for shame, lad! I thought not the like of you!"</p> 
                  <p>Saying these words, the old guide advanced into the hovel, followed by the stranger who had appeared with him upon the threshold. This latter was a man of tall stature, and goodly mien. He was enveloped in a mantle of rich sable, fastened with clasps of massy silver, wrought in the form of lion claws. This gentleman surveyed the countenance of Valentine, with the same fixed attention that had been bestowed by Nicolo, and evidently with similar surprise; for the face of the young man had now lost its defiant expression, and being of naturally prepossessing cast, as we have before said, presented a strong contrast to the threatening appearance it had worn so lately. Valentine discovered instantly the false light in which he now stood with his friend Nicolo, and hastened at once to explain the circumstances. But Berthold, assuming a very calm voice and manner, anticipated his brother's intention.</p> 
                  <p>"It is always thus," said the crafty fellow, with an appealing look towards the old guide. "The unhappy temper of this brother of mine, whose violent outbreaks are too well-known, puts us in continual fear for our lives!" Saying this, Berthold turned about, and scowled ominously at Monna Barbara, in order to frighten her, so that she would not venture to contradict his assertion.</p> 
                  <p>"It is bad-it is bad!" said old Nicolo, gravely. "When brothers quarrel, and that, too, in the presence of a feeble mother, it bodes, no good to either."</p> 
                  <p>"But, hear <emph>me!</emph>" exclaimed Valentine, who had been so startled at his brother's cool effrontery, that for a moment in deprived him of speech. "Listen to me, while I declare that what this crafty brother of mine has said is falsehood!"</p> 
                  <p>"There-do you not perceive, his violent temper cannot be restrained!" interrupted Berthold, calling the notice of Nicolo and the stranger to the features of Valentine, which had again become inflamed, whilst the youth's whole body trembled with passion.</p> 
                  <p>"It is sufficient! Do I not see the knife in his hand?" cried Nicolo. Then addressing Valentine, he continued; "Do not add a false accusation of your brother, to the sin of which you have been guilty."</p> 
                  <p>Valentine at this speech was almost tempted to fly at his cunning brother, and finish the quarrel at once by some desperate action. But his better nature restrained him, and gulping down his anger with a violent effort, he turned towards Monna Barbara, who had shrunk into a corner, dreading the scowling looks of Berthold.</p> 
                  <p>At this moment the stranger who, until now had stood in the middle of the hut, wrapped closely in his mantle, commenced speaking, in a fully, manly voice, that immediately riveted the young man's attention. He ventured, at the same time, to glance at the speaker, and was surprised to encounter the other's clear eye fixed calmly upon his own, as if it were capable of penetrating to his inmost thoughts. Valentine experienced an unaccountable emotion at this, as if the stranger's glance were recalling to his memory some strange and forgotten passages of a former life, familiar yet indistinct, like the dim shadowings of a twilight dream.</p> 
                   
                  <p>Who has not felt it? that mysterious emotion, like the memory of a face once half-disclosed in a morning-dream? What is it? Why will the tones of a voice which all outward circumstances convince us we have never heard before, awaken within our hearts a thrill as if a long-lost friend had whispered to us? Why will a flower, a bush, a landscape, that we suddenly encounter in wandering where our feet have never trod before, bring at once before our mental vision a scene which we know was never beheld by our sensuous faculties in this life, yet rises clear and distinct as a memory of yesterday? Is it to be imagined that our spirits, long, long since, at a period in eternity's grand march, of which our finite comprehension can define no conception, performed their parts even as now-experienced hopes and fears, joys and sorrows, and doubts, even as in the present? And may we believe that the apparent recognitions of things and localities, which dawn so inexplicably at times upon our minds, reveal to us glimpses of an antepast which should assure us of immortality? reveal to us the spots which some joy, experienced far back in pre-existence, has redeemed, through its perfectness, from the general oblivion, reveal to us tones of some voice to which in the illimitable past our souls have listened with immortal gladness?</p> 
                  <p>"What thought, indeed, what speculation, shall compass the revolving life of universal matter-where it beginneth, where becometh multiform, where it is resolved again into formless chaos, or elemental nothing?</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE STRANGER.</head> 
                  <p>PERHAPS the thoughts of the young vine-dresser of Val d'Orazio did not run into such unlimited speculations as these, into which we have been led by the suggestions of past existence, awakened through the singularity of attention with which the stranger regarded Valentine. Indeed, there was little time allowed the youth for metaphysical indulgence, inasmuch as he was called upon to listen to the very business like words which reached his ear.</p> 
                  <p>"I am in want of a guide over the mountains, and as the good Nicolo here cannot conduct me farther than beyond the second pass, it is necessary that another should accompany us, to continue with me the route. I am recommended to make my choice of one of you."</p> 
                  <p>Berthold here broke in abruptly, though with no vehemence of manner. "I know every foot of these mountains, my lord," said he-"ay, for that matter the routes are alike familiar to me, from the French passes to the Salzion Alps."</p> 
                  <p>"Ay, then, thou must fain have travelled considerably in thy life-time?" said the stranger, transferring his keen glance to the elder brother. "Doubtless, the pass of the Boccheta is likewise well-known to thee?"</p> 
                  <p>"I have skipped over its snow-drifts a dozen times perhaps. Nay, good fathers of St. Bernard, they know me well, my lord, and from this valley to the glaciers of Tyrol, there is no place I have not footed, save only the White Mountain itself."</p> 
                  <p>"Thou hast not, then, ascended Mont Blanc?"</p> 
                  <p>"For reason, my lord, that the guides of Chamouny are jealous of us who dwell near the French borders, and mislike our conducting travellers with full purses, and generous withal, as my lord himself is."</p> 
                  <p>As Berthold said this, he made a grotesque attempt to smile graciously, to show the earnestness of his compliment. But his flattery seemed to produce upon the stranger an effect quite contrary to that intended; for the latter turned abruptly from Berthold, and resuming his survey of Valentine, said, in an affable tone:</p> 
                  <p>"In spite of thy brother's experience, and the scene in which I beheld thee engaged as I entered, I am disposed to trust thee for a guide sooner than he who has traversed all the Alps to the Swiss summits. What sayest, young man? Canst guide me to the Boccheta?"</p> 
                  <p>"Valentine has been there thrice," here interposed Monna Barbara, who had remained silent in her corner till this moment. "He will lead my lord safely."</p> 
                  <p>The stranger started suddenly, as the first tones of the old woman's shrill voice reached his ear, and he peered into the smoky nook where Monna Barbara had ensconced herself. The crone had half-risen, and was eagerly stretching forward her long neck, disclosing the shrivelled face, bright eyes, and white teeth in the flickering glare of the burning embers on the hearth. Never, perhaps, had this old mother presented a more witch-like appearance than at this moment, and it was doubtless no wonder that the tall stranger should start and change color at the almost unearthly apparition, accompanied with the sudden tones of a cracked voice. He quickly recovered himself, however, in discovering that the crone was the mother of the young men, though he could not help feeling a very uncommon sensation thrill through his frame as he encountered the look which Monna Barbara cast at him.</p> 
                  <p>"Valentine will conduct you safely, signore," repeated the old woman; "to the Boccheta, to the Simplon, to Mount St. Gothard-to the Tyrol Alps, if it like you, where the boy first drew mortal breath."</p> 
                  <p>"He was born in Switzerland, then, good mother?" said the stranger, interrogatively.</p> 
                  <p>"Both of them, signore, and stretched their first legs where the eagles build their nests, and the wild goat suckles its kids. Never fear, signore, but Valentine will lead you safe, though the slides be not far distant, as I know full well, by the moanings to-night."</p> 
                  <p>"The moanings, good mother? What be those?"</p> 
                  <p>"I hear things, and see things, that young ears and young eyes may wait long for," answered the crone, energetically. Old Nicolo, however, who had listened in silence to the colloquy, now interposed with an explanation.</p> 
                  <p>"Monna Barbara, it is well-known, signore, can tell when the slides are about to change. She thinks she can hear the huge masses of snow sinking in the clefts and gullies, with a great smothered sound, like to some one moaning in pain."</p> 
                  <p>"And who says me nay?" cried the old woman, sharply. "Did I not bid Jacopo Landi flee away from his house, when the fool and his family were sleeping soundly, and the avalanche trembling above them. He laughed at Monna Barbara forsooth, and what came of it? Where was his house, and himself and his wife, at the daybreak?"</p> 
                  <p>"It is very true," replied old Nicolo, solemnly. "I did not gainsay your knowledge, good Monna-for well I know that the goatherd Piero Bembo owed his safety to your timely warning, which he did not make light of, like Jacopo."</p> 
                  <p>The crone seemed satisfied by this admission of the old guide, and drew back to her nook without speaking, whilst the stranger tapping Valentine lightly, said:</p> 
                  <p>"Get thee ready, youth, then, for our journey. I would fain be many miles hence before sunrise."</p> 
                  <p>Valentine looked at the speaker with a grateful smile, which added much interest to his naturally pleasing countenance. But as he proceeded hastily to array himself for the road, he heard Berthold mutter to the stranger:</p> 
                  <p>"Take heed the youth's pleasant face deceive you not, signore."</p> 
                  <p>"I require no judgment but mine own, good fellow," replied the keen-eyed traveller, as he turned towards the door. Nicolo was about to follow, when Berthold, concealing his resentment at the contempt with which he was evidently regarded, detained the old guide, addressing him, with one of his low laughs:</p> 
                  <p>"What think you, Nicolo, raised the fiend tonight in my good brother yonder?"</p> 
                  <p>"I care not for the cause," returned the hunter. "It is a shame for both of you!"</p> 
                  <p>"Nevertheless, I'll make bold to tell you," said Berthold, not in the least abashed by the new rebuff. "I will tell you, out of friendship, that you may keep watch of your household."</p> 
                  <p>"What mean you by that, young man?" asked Nicolo, pausing at once, to listen to what Berthold had to say.</p> 
                  <p>"I mean this," returned the other, in a blunt way, like and honest man, desirous of making short work of an unpleasant duty-"I mean, that it was because I mentioned the name of your grand-child, Bianca, and for no other reason, that this hot-blooded young man quarrelled with me."</p> 
                  <p>"And what said <emph>you</emph> of Bianca?" asked Nicolo, quickly.</p> 
                  <p>"I but rated the stripling for his boast that he loved the maiden," returned Berthold, with his cold laugh. "And moreover, I ventured to hint that a poor lad like himself, stood little chance in your favor, against all the young farmers of the valley-not to speak of the intendant of the castle, and, maybe, the padrone, for that matter. Such things have been!"</p> 
                  <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6326-00000007"/> 
                  <p>"Peace, young man! What idle tale is this?" exclaimed the old guide. "Well-what more would you say? If it be true the boy loves Bianca-"</p> 
                  <p>"Ay-it <emph>is</emph> true! I do love her!" here suddenly interrupted the impetuous Valentine, who had overheard the last words of Nicolo, and now rushed forward. "From my heart do I love that gentle maiden," repeated he, clasping the hunter's hand in his own.</p> 
                  <p>Nicolo appeared for a moment lost in amazement; then he exclaimed, in a sharp tone:</p> 
                  <p>"You are crazy! The child has not been reared for such as you! Hold thy peace, I pray thee!"</p> 
                  <p>With this speech, Nicolo shook off the young man's hand impatiently. Valentine turned away, a half-choked exclamation of angry feeling upon his lips, the flush of sudden indignation mantling his face.</p> 
                  <p>"Take care, Nicolo!" said Berthold, whispering to the old guide, but loud enough for his brother to hear-"take care! the young cub will not forget this slight."</p> 
                  <p>"No, Berthold! I shall <emph>not,</emph>" murmured Valentine, with difficulty striving to preserve a calmness. "The time will come," continued he, turning toward the old hunter-"when <emph>you,</emph> Nicolo, shall repent your words!"</p> 
                  <p>The guide shrugged his shoulders, and moved to the door, without which, during this scene, the stranger in the mantle had been waiting. Then, Nicolo leading the way, the three took their departure from the hut.</p> 
                  <p>Berthold watched their figures till they disappeared in the gloom, and then, returning to the fireside, vented his vexation in a curse at the poor mother, who had tremblingly resumed her preparations for supper.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">MOTHER AND SON.</head> 
                  <p>"AY, ay," muttered the crone, grumblingly, as she moved back and forth, "ye may curse, but curses will never change what's to be."</p> 
                  <p>"What is that you are saying, old beldam?" cried Berthold, overhearing his mother's words. "What's to be, witch?"</p> 
                  <p>"If I am witch, it's the spell of fiends like you that made me so," rejoined Monna Barbara, in a louder voice, and pausing to confront her brutal son.</p> 
                  <p>"Like dam like cub," cried Berthold, with his sneering laugh. "But pretty Valentine is no fiend at all, I suppose, good witch?"</p> 
                  <p>"Valentine is what he is-and Berthold is what he is," answered Monna Barbara. "But, flesh and blood of mine own, as you are, unnatural boy, Valentine will put his foot on you, sometime, I tell ye."</p> 
                  <p>"Not without this knife-hilt deep in him," cried the elder son, with a savage gesture that made the mother retreat a step. "I know, old hag, that you favor Valentine more than me, and have always taken the young man's part against your first-born. But I'll be even with both of ye yet, or I'm no witch-born, as the villagers call me."</p> 
                  <p>"They call you that, do they?" gasped the crone, writhing in recollection of the stigma which had for years clung to her like a pestilence, making her as it were a pariah among her kind. "Well, well," she continued, sinking her voice; to a low mutter-"It's right-it's right! ill-blood is in both of us, and man's curses are not harder to bear than God's malediction."</p> 
                  <p>"Ill blood in both of us?" repeated Berthold, catching part of his mother's last speech. "What do you mean by that? Is there no ill blood in white-faced Valentine?"</p> 
                  <p>"The blood of the lion is not that of the wolf, answered Monna Barbara, using one of her customary figurative expressions.</p> 
                  <p>"Look you, mother of mine," cried Berthold, starting from the stool on which he sat, and striding toward the old woman. "If you like not to see this baby of yours strangled, some day or other, you had best keep a quiet tongue in your mouth about his fine qualities. I doubt not, if your word could do it, that Valentine would be lord of the valley, and Berthold goatherd to his high mightiness-"</p> 
                  <p>"And no more than right," interrupted Monna Barbara. But she paused in her speech, as she noticed the ominous blackening of Berthold's countenance, and continued in a lower tone; "What do I get from my eldest but blows and abuse? Who rates me like a galley-slave, and calls me 'witch,' even as the vile urchins of the<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6326-00000008"/> town cry out after me, as I hobble through the market-place?"</p> 
                  <p>"But who drove the pack of them before his stout arm, when they would fain have dragged the 'witch,' as they called her, to do penance on the church stone? Who cudgled the churls of all the valley, giving no quarter till they promised to molest his mother no longer? Was it smooth Valentine, or the ill-blooded dog, Berthold?"</p> 
                  <p>"Nay, nay, son Berthold, I said not that! No dog-blood runs in thy veins, Berthold," cried the crone, somewhat mollified by the recollection of her son's prowess in protecting her from the superstitious violence of the villagers. "But thy harshness sometimes makes me forgetful of speech."</p> 
                  <p>"And who," resumed Berthold, heedless of the crone's interruption-"who searched for you from sun to vespers, when you were lost in the great snows-bawling his throat hoarse, and straining foot and hand, till he found you half-buried, and ready to perish at the bottom of the 'Smuggler's Gulch?' Was it Valentine or Berthold?"</p> 
                  <p>"No more, no more, son Berthold! You are my child, whom I love, in spite of all things," exclaimed Monna Barbara. "It is bad blood only that keeps us in trouble, for I warrant thou wouldst not see thy old mother harmed by strangers, quarrel as thou wilt with her thyself!"</p> 
                  <p>"Not I," cried the son, with an oath. "But, when the youngster Valentine-"</p> 
                  <p>"Let us speak no more of him," said Monna Barbara. "He'll not be back to-night, so break bread in peace, I pray thee, Berthold, and let us forget the bad humor of both of us."</p> 
                  <p>So saying, the mother began to take out with a wooden spoon, from a pot at the fire, the <foreign xml:lang="ITA">quazetto,</foreign> which it contained-a mixture of meat, onions and vegetables, such as the French call <foreign xml:lang="FRA">pot-pourri,</foreign> and, with the addition of garlic, the Spanish peasants convert into their <foreign xml:lang="ITA">ollapodrida.</foreign>
                  </p> 
                  <p>The savory cloud of steam which soon filled the hut, grateful to a sharpened appetite, began to exercise a benignant influence upon the evil temper of the young man, and in a few moments, with the frown banished from his forehead, he became busily occupied in discussing the merits of Monna Barbara's cookery.</p> 
                  <p>The old woman did not partake of the repast, but contented herself with serving the <foreign xml:lang="ITA">quazetto</foreign> and black bread to her son, and setting before him an earthen bottle of thin wine; after which she retired to her corner near the hearth, where was a nook shaded by the abutting stone which formed a portion of the fire-place, and there, seating herself on a low block of wood, let drop her head into her hands, and watched her son, as he plied his vigorous appetite.</p> 
                  <p>Berthold, on his part, seemed to take no further notice of his mother's presence, proceeding to despatch his meal, till the mess of stew was sensibly diminished, and no crust of bread remained upon the table. Then lifting the jar of wine, he satisfied his thirst with a long draught.</p> 
                  <p>Apparently this indulgence had restored to him his good humor, for as he rose from the table he said mildly to Monna Barbara:</p> 
                  <p>"Good mother, I am now going to take a short walk, as I have a little business on hand to-night. So when you choose, you may go to rest, and leave me to come home when I am ready."</p> 
                  <p>"You had better remain home, Berthold," replied Monna Barbara; "I like not both of you away all the long hours; and besides, an evil boding is upon my mind to-night, as if danger threatened the household."</p> 
                  <p>"Take your beads, then, and pray, for I must even be away, in spite of all presentiments of danger. Belike a prayer or two might not be amiss for either of us."</p> 
                  <p>"There is indeed need of prayer for both, son Berthold," said the mother. "Need that you wot not of. But, get ye gone, if you will. My beads may as well be counted without you."</p> 
                  <p>Berthold shrugged his broad shoulders, as the crone proceeded to remove the remains of his supper; but he said no more, till he had attired himself in a heavy cape of skin and woollen scarf, such as had been donned by Valentine ere he departed, and grasped his staff, preparatory to leaving the hut. Then, turning toward Monna Barbara, he asked:</p> 
                  <p>"Do you recollect, mother, what our Valentine said to Nicolo, when I bade the old man take care of harm from him?"</p> 
                  <p>"The boy meant nothing by his words," rejoined Monna Barbara.</p> 
                  <p>"Ay, you'll take part with him, no doubt. Nevertheless, you heard as well as I, that Valentine threatened old Nicolo that he should 'repent his words.' Mischief was meant there, good mother, I'll warrant me!"</p> 
                  <p>Then with his usual scornful laugh, he hurried away from the hovel.</p> 
               </div>

                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">"THE STAR OF THE VALLEY."</head> 
                  <p>THE traveller in the sable cloak, with Valentine and the hunter-guide, after leaving Monna Barbara's hut, pursued their way in silence till they reached the old man's cottage, which, as we have said, was distant only a few hundred yards. It stood at the opening of a wide gulch, through which, far up into the mountains, a narrow road extended, skirting the sides of great precipices, and winding beneath rugged walls of rock, whilst high over all, especially at this season of the year, immense shelves of snow and ice hung, apparently self-poised in the air, but ready at any moment to move in fearful avalanches upon the vales below. Through this pass, Valentine was engaged to guide the stranger some half-dozen miles, to a place called the "Huguenots' Altar," and thence downward a half-dozen miles farther to the north, till they reached the neighborhood of the great lower pass, called II Boccheta, where, at the period of our story, the grand army of the French Republic, under the youthful General Bonaparte, was engaged in forcing a passage through the Alps, into the heart of the Genoese territory, thence to overrun like a torrent the whole Italian land. II Boccheta was then in possession of the invading army, with which, doubtless, the stranger was connected in some station of rank.</p> 
                  <p>When the three arrived at Nicolo's small but neat and comfortable dwelling, they were met at the gate of a little paling which surrounded it by the sprightly figure of Bianca, who had opened wide the cottage door, disclosing the warm, inviting interior, with its white walls and floor, and shining hearth, on which blazed a genial fire. The apartment was rendered more brilliant still by the light of a large triangular lantern of thick glass, fixed against the cottage window that looked towards the mountain-path. This lantern not only irradiated the cottage, but illuminated with its outward streaming rays the dark walls of rock for quite a distance upward.</p> 
                  <p>But Bianca herself was the true light of old Nicolo's home, and the beacon which, more than the lantern or firelight, conducted him homeward with anxious heart, from every mountain journey. For in truth she was a gentle and loving maiden, with a heart full of all guileless feeling, and thoughts pure as the mountain snow-wreaths. Beautiful withal was she, at least so thought her grand-father and for the matter of this, all the youths, in a score of miles around, were of the same opinion, which they would have gladly revealed to Bianca herself, had she permitted them so much freedom. But the old hunter's fair grand-child was far from encouraging the gallantries of the youths choosing rather to be called Nicolo's "Star of the<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6326-00000009"/> Valley," which was the fanciful name his affection had bestowed upon her (because of her watchful tending of the beacon light for him, almost since she was a baby), than to be known by any appellation that a stranger could bestow upon her.</p> 
                  <p>Nevertheless, a shrewd observer might have suspected, from the sudden flush which overspread the maiden's cheek, as she recognized in her grand-father's company the handsome young neighbor, Valentine, that there might, after all, be such a thing as a heart in the little one's breast, and that such a heart was not entirely whole. Perhaps, unfortunately, Nicolo noticed this, for he quickly said to his grand-child;</p> 
                  <p>"My staff, Bianca! I shall go a mile or two with the stranger. It is a mild night, and the walk will do me no harm."</p> 
                  <p>Then, holding the cottage-door half-open, he waited for the maiden to bring the long, iron-shod pole, which the guides and hunters of the Alpine districts are accustomed to carry with them in all their journeys. Indeed, the passage of ridges and chasms in the ice, without such an instrument to support or steady the steps, would be not only hazardous, but very likely, impossible.</p> 
                  <p>The young girl soon equipped her grandsire with everything requisite for his short expedition, not, however, without stealing a glance at Valentine, which was returned by a tender look that plainly discovered the poor youth's situation to be beyond a cure. Old Nicolo did not remark this interchange of regards; nevertheless, as Valentine and the stranger preceded him in departing from the cottage, the grand-father lingered a moment, and said in a low tone to the maiden:</p> 
                  <p>"I have something to speak to thee about, when I return, Bianca; and I trust to find thee dutiful to my wishes."</p> 
                  <p>As the old guide spoke, he made a slight inclination of his head, in the direction which Valentine had taken; and poor Bianca felt her young heart overshadowed at once with the forebeding of her guardian's opposition to a love which was already in possession of her heart. She dropped her eyes sadly, as she replied:</p> 
                  <p>"I hope ever to be dutiful, my dear father!"</p> 
                  <p>"Bless thee, Bianca! bless thee!" murmured the old man, kissing her forehead. Then, grasping his staff, he hurried after the other pedestrians, who had commenced ascending to the mountain pass.</p> 
                  <p>Bianca watched them, till they had passed the point where the lantern's last rays extended, and she could no longer discern her grand-father's figure, nor the tall form of Valentine, whom she loved in secret as well as he loved her.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER V.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE MULE-PATH INN.</head> 
                  <p>THE vine-dresser Berthold departed from his dwelling, leaving Monna Barbara to carry out her pious intention of saying a few almost-forgotten aves upon her wooden beads; for in truth, so far from being the Lutheran, as some graceless villagers had proclaimed her, the poor old soul was, as far as she professed any faith, a steadfast believer in the dogmas, rituals, saints and ceremonies of that ancient church devoutly venerated through all the valley districts. Perhaps the good padre, who had in times past often protected her from the too zealous visitations of the rabble portion of his flock, knew very well that she was a staunch Catholic, or he might not have been so doubtful of her necromantic character; though, sooth to say, Monna Barbara seldom darkened the door of the village church with the shadow of her ugly person-a laxity of discipline very excusable, however, when the crone's ungainly reputation was taken into consideration.</p> 
                  <p>We may therefore without immediate comment permit Monna Barbara to follow out the dictates of her serious inclinations, contenting ourselves with following the steps, or rather strides, of her promising son Berthold.</p> 
                  <p>These were not directed toward the valley slope, whence glimmered so many beacons of domestic life, from the windows of huts and snug cottages, neither did they conduct in the opposing quarter, where diverged the mountain route lately taken by Valentine and his companions. But, striking abruptly from the main road through the village, about two hundred yards below the cottage of Nicolo, the young man bent his course along a rugged pathway which brouching into the rocky acclivities that formed the first strata of mountain above the narrow but luxuriant plateau, whereon were situated the vineyards cultivated by the valley peasants. Keeping this pathway which wound deviously through rough and sterile fields, ascending gradually into the heart of the hilly region, Berthold at length reached a wide-mouthed cleft or chasm severing the stony pathway, and apparently cutting off all farther progress in the direction he was pursuing. The black depth of this fearful fissure presented an appalling contrast to the white rocks on either side, over which now fell a shower of moonbeams, brightening the icy garment which clothed the mountain cliffs, till it flashed like silver armor on a giant's frame. Far down, many hundred feet beneath the brink of the gulf, a fragment of rock, or ice, disengaged from its position, fell suddenly, as Berthold neared the spot; and at once a multitude of echoes answered the sound of its descent, doubled and redoubled by the sonorous walls of rock, until<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6326-00000010"/> the gathered clangor roared in the lowest depth, and then sank mutteringly away, leaving the desolate scene to resume its silent grandeur.</p> 
                  <p>The vine-dresser paused a moment as the noises multiplied and died away, not in alarm, for he was too accustomed to Alpine existence to be startled by aught less than the convulsion of an avalanche; but simply, as it appeared, to direct his sharp glances across the gulf, and discover, just visible, about a couple of hundred yards distant and below him, the feeble gleam of a light, proceeding, as he well knew, from the casement of an <foreign xml:lang="ITA">albergo</foreign> or roadside inn, situated on a lonely shelf near a mountain mule-path, penetrating far into the interior of the range of hills that shut in the Val d'Orazio. This mule-path was not in much repute as a secure road for chance travellers, inasmuch as rumor had given to the dwellers in divers rocky reaches on one side of it a dubious character as respected honesty. In fact, the peasants had long been accustomed to believe that a gang of brigands, whose exploits inspired terror throughout the valley district, were inaccessibly fortified in some one of the many impregnable defiles in the neighborhood; and that it was from such a position they were used to sally out upon the foot roads leading to the neighboring city, attacking large companies of travellers, and often engaging boldly and sometimes dispersing the very soldiers sent out to apprehend them.</p> 
                  <p>Whether true or false these rumors relative to the intrenchment of the robbers in these particular regions, it was very certain that suspicious fellows, not belonging to the village, had often presented themselves at the fairs and church-festivals, and that, in more than one Sunday homily, the worthy padre had warned his youthful hearers (especially the female portion) against lending ear to any strange visitors who might, with the assistance of a jaunty jacket, and free and easy manners, not to say soft speeches and jingling purses, be disposed to ingratiate themselves into the good opinion of his flock. Besides, in truth, without the neighborhood of any brigands at all, this mule-path was a sufficiently lonesome route, and as such had been chosen long ago as a safe avenue for the transport of contraband goods, smuggled over the frontiers of France and Switzerland. It was the better adapted for this pursuit, from the fact that many intricate paths and defiles connected it at various points with the national highway, and because, likewise, the goatherds and shepherds of the lofty regions surrounding, were all, more or less, disposed to favor a business which enabled them to possess themselves of many little luxuries to which they had otherwise been strangers, besides adding to their gains by some slight participation in the profits of what it would be difficult to persuade them was not a perfectly legitimate traffic-in spite of governmental dogmas to the contrary.</p> 
                  <p>However, we have directly to do with Berthold, the vine-dresser, rather than with goatherds or smugglers, and must follow him as he suddenly turned to the left, after his rapid glance over the chasm, and commenced to descend cautiously an abrupt winding of the path which led down the sides of the precipice to a rude bridge that spanned the gulf, some twenty feet beneath. Crossing this bridge, formed of sapling trunks bound firmly together with vines, but which yet swayed somewhat, as his heavy foot trod upon it, the young man soon found himself on the opposite brink, and continued his course, descending the mule-path in the direction of the lonely albergo.</p> 
                  <p>Lonely, however, as this roadside tavern had appeared from the point above, Berthold discovered, as he approached, that its public room was now occupied by more than one guest, as was plainly evident from the sound of noisy mirth within. At least a dozen voices seemed vieing as to which should be heard, and a chorus of some wild drinking song was just in full swell as he reached the closed door and knocked boldly with his staff.</p> 
                  <p>The summons had an instantaneous effect upon the revellers within; for suddenly every sound was hushed, and deep silence took the place of uproar. At the same moment, a female voice came from a small, diamond-shaped aperture in the barred window-shutter (whence had proceeded the only light visible), demanding in sharp accents:</p> 
                  <p>"Who knocks?"</p> 
                  <p>"Assuredly a friend to the house, good Brigita. Open the door, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">il mia ostessa,</foreign> to a weary traveller."</p> 
                  <p>"'Tis the vine-dresser," Berthold heard the woman say, as if in reply to an inquiry from some one within, and then the rough tones of a man called out:</p> 
                  <p>"Art alone, comrade?"</p> 
                  <p>"Truly I am, Bacco, and thirsty for a cup of wine, with such good company as one meets as your snug fireside."</p> 
                   
                  <p>As Berthold concluded this remark, a bar was removed from the inside of the massy door, and he presently found himself in the midst of his desired "good company."</p> 
                  <p>A motley assemblage was this, picturesque and wild-looking enough to satisfy any sketch-hunter who ever straddled a travelling stool in the Apennines or Abruzzi. Nearest the door, and the first to encounter his glance as he entered, Berthold beheld the portly <foreign xml:lang="ITA">esercito,</foreign> or landlord, of the hotel, whose name he had called on before his admittance. Bacco was short, thickly-built, with a bull-neck set so solidly upon his broad shoulders that the latter rose somewhat like haunches on either side. His face was a compound of phlegm and stupidity, the stolid look of which was only enlivened by an occasional glitter of his small eyes, which from beneath their heavy brows sometimes volunteered a hint that under their owner's apparent dullness might be sleeping a disposition whose quietness it would scarcely be safe to trust too far. This personage greeted the young man, without rising, or foregoing his hold of an earthen flagon which he had just raised to his lips, and from which he proceeded to imbibe a copious draught.</p> 
                  <p>Opposite to the burly Bacco, stood, with her arms bent, and her hands resting on her hips, a sour-visaged, ill-favored woman, of tall figure and thin frame, who rejoiced in the name of Brigita, and the possession of Bacco as her worse but larger moiety. This good lady bent on Berthold the regards of a pair of scrutinizing eyes, accompanied by a wrinkling of the forehead, which plainly showed that the vine-dresser was no especial favorite of hers, whatever he might be of the <foreign xml:lang="ITA">oste</foreign> himself.</p> 
                  <p>Grouped about the apartment in such attitudes as their custom or ease dictated, were a dozen men, at the least, clad in the various garbs of muleteers, mountaineers, and goatherds, though the former appeared to predominate. These people were drinking wine, and eating sausages and black bread, at the same time talking loudly, and singing at intervals verses of some rude song, generally illustrative of the charms of just such meetings as the one in which they were now mingling; though sometimes the ballad took an amatory or adventurous turn, and recited the vows of a mountain girl, or exploits of her mountain lover. At the upper end of the room, which was of considerable capacity, was a door leading to an inner apartment, toward which Berthold at once made his way, at a sign from the ponderous Bacco, which assured him that a person whom he sought was in the albergo.</p> 
                  <p>The door alluded to was wide open, and as the vine-dresser reached it, he beheld, just at the other side of the threshold, a small table, at which two persons were seated, amicably sharing a bottle of wine between them, whilst the odor of an aromatic cigar flavored this portion of the albergo with a more agreeable effluvium than that exhaled from the sour wines and stale meats discussed by the company at large.</p> 
                  <p>The first of these companions, whose position exposed his face to Berthold as he gained the door, was a man attired rather jauntily, in a jacket of green broadcloth, set off with broad lappels, to which heavy silver buttons gave an appearance of gaudiness, that was hardly kept in countenance by the rest of his garb. This latter was made up of well-worn and discolored leathern breeches, coarse boots, exhibiting unsightly thongs, fastening them to the legs, which were now stretched out at length over the floor, and a short embroidered cloak, evidently of somewhat too thin a texture for an Alpine temperature, however it might comport with the gay jacket beneath. The proprietor of this costume, was an individual of at least sixty years, tall and well-shaped, with gray, curled hair, depending upon his shoulders, and with a countenance expressive of much determination.</p> 
                  <p>The second person at the table, whose head was quickly turned about, as Berthold's shadow fell across the threshold, was a young girl, whose small, compact figure was tastily arrayed in a close-fitting boddice of blue velveteen, beneath which a petticoat of dark brown stuff, trimmed with ribbons of a lighter azure than that of her upper garment, fell to the tops of small, fur-tipped boots, that displayed to advantage the well-shaped feet which they covered. The face of this young girl, as it appeared half-turned towards the young man, was of a fine oval form, and of pure olive complexion. Her forehead was encircled with a sort of coronet of common but quite brilliant blue beads, well contrasting with the glossy, black ringlets which they confined, and perhaps borrowing lustre from a pair of flashing eyes that looked out fearlessly beneath them.</p> 
                  <p>Berthold's glance, which had sought that of this young girl, as soon as he perceived her eyes turned toward him, sank the next instant before their fixed gaze, and his voice faltered in a measure<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6326-00000011"/> sure, as he addressed the other occupant of the room, with:</p> 
                  <p>"Good evening, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">il mio capitano!</foreign>"</p> 
                  <p>"Good welcome to you, if you bring news of business, and a draught of good wine, whether or no," returned the man with the gay jacket. "Sit down, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">il mio amico,</foreign> and Francesca here will fill your cup of Muscat. 'Tis the last of my delicate <foreign xml:lang="ITA">vino d'est,</foreign> and the saints only know where I shall get more of the same-if in truth I be not soon brought to no wine at all, which may St. Geronimo long avert!"</p> 
                  <p>Saying this, the worthy proprietor of the short cloak and green jacket crossed himself devoutly, and then continued in a lower tone to the vinedresser, who was receiving a cup of wine from the hands of the young Francesca:</p> 
                  <p>"And is there nothing promising at all, worthy Berthold?"</p> 
                  <p>"May I speak before your daughter?" asked the vine-dresser, in the same key, throwing a glance toward the girl, who, after filling his cup, had risen from the table, and was now directing her gaze into the outer room.</p> 
                  <p>"And why not before Francesca?" rejoined the other. "She is able to keep her father's secrets, I'll warrant."</p> 
                  <p>"I but spoke on account of-"commenced Berthold, but he stammered, as he encountered the glance of Francesca turned suddenly on him.</p> 
                  <p>"Tut, comrade! go on with your news, and may the saints grant it bring fortune!" cried the father.</p> 
                  <p>"I doubt me not it will, if it be taken advantage of at once," answered Berthold, in the blunt manner which he could so well assume. "The news I have is this-that a traveller, who is evidently a signore of distinction, and I doubt not has a sack well-lined with what honest mountaineers can easily find purses for-is but now crossing the north pass, to the, 'Huguenots' Altar,' and with our friends the good goatherds and muleteers yonder, you may make what he carries your own before daybreak."</p> 
                  <p>"And know you what he carries, worthy Berthold?"</p> 
                  <p>"I know that he has gold, and that in no silken pouch, but a money-belt such as none wear but they who bear wealth when they travel. I watched closely, and I warrant me this strange lord carries more than has crossed these mountains in many a mule-load that you have risked life to rifle, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">il mio capitano.</foreign>"</p> 
                  <p>"And where saw you this?"</p> 
                  <p>"Under mine own roof, but a couple of hours since, whither my lord must come to show himself, and to engage my good brother Valentine to guide him on his journey. Old Nicolo is with them, but he goes no farther than the 'Huguenots' Altar."</p> 
                  <p>"And how long are they departed, say you?" inquired the other, whose vocation doubtless has by this time been divined by the astute reader. As he asked this question, he emitted a short, hissing sound from his lips, which was immediately responded to, by a sudden bustle in the large apartment, and the appearance, a moment after, of three or four men in muleteer garb, at the open door.</p> 
                  <p>"Arm and make ready," was the short command given by the captain, whose countenance had assumed a stern and resolute expression. The men at once retired, and the girl Francesca began to assist her father in his hurried preparations.</p> 
                  <p>"Your brother is to guide this stranger, said you not, Berthold.?"</p> 
                  <p>"Ay, captain; and as the boy is of some spirit, it were best if-"</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, fear nothing on that score! I know what you would say, good Berthold; but fear nothing, for no hair of the lad's head shall be hurt-neither the traveller's, for that matter. I am too old now, to spill blood wantonly; we will but relieve the signore of his money-belt, and bid him godspeed on his journey."</p> 
                  <p>The old brigand concluded these words with a laugh at his own humor; but his mirth was not apparently shared by the vine-dresser, who, to speak the truth, looked as if the assurance just given of his brother's security from danger was not the most pleasing thing in the world to himself. However, he made no reply, while the brigand captain, finishing his preparations, soon stood before him, well-armed, and ready to start.</p> 
                  <p>"They will doubtless reach the 'Altar,' about an hour before midnight, when the moon is at its height," remarked the old man, as he turned toward the outer room.</p> 
                  <p>"I know Nicolo's pace very well," returned Berthold, "and the hour will not vary many minutes from that you mention."</p> 
                  <p>"We shall speedily overtake them, by the mule-path defile," rejoined the captain. "I give you many thanks, worthy youth, for this timely notice, and will bring more substantial means of rewarding you, may St. Geronimo prosper. Now haste, Francesca, and fill flasks with the last of my <foreign xml:lang="ITA">vino d'est.</foreign> You shall drink a glass, Berthold, before you return to the village."</p> 
                  <p>"With all my heart, and thanks, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">il mio capitano,</foreign>" said Berthold. So saying, he received a second cup from the hands of the fair Francesca, and at the same instant a quick glance from her eyes, that appeared to communicate to the young man a sudden command, which he acknowledged by an awkward nod, and the spilling of a few drops of wine from his flagon.</p> 
                  <p>"Have a care!" cried the captain, noticing the spilling of the liquor, though not the signs of intelligence exchanged by his daughter and the vine-dresser. "Have a care, youth! You find not such wine as this <foreign xml:lang="ITA">vino d'est</foreign> in the cellars of Val d'Orazio!"</p> 
                  <p>"In truth, no," said the other, finishing his draught, and returning the flagon to Francesca, not without stealing another look at the young female. "Such wine gives jacket and cloak in the coldest weather."</p> 
                  <p>"Now for the road," said the captain, abruptly. And without further delay, save to press a hasty kiss to Francesca's lips, as they were raised to his own, the old brigand passed into the outer apartment.</p> 
                  <p>Not a single individual, save the host, of those who had crowded the room when Berthold arrived, now remained in the hostel, though they had appeared so disposed to revelry, and vieing with each other in exertions of vocalism. Bacco, however, still grasped his flagon of wine, and emitted clouds of tobacco smoke from his pipe, formed of Swiss clay, whilst his wife moved incessantly about, placing stools and tables in their places, after the evening's disorder.</p> 
                  <p>The brigand captain knew very well where to look for the stout fellows whom his orders had drawn suddenly from their debauch, to await his signal for an expedition they knew not nor recked not whither. So, exchanging a brief sentence with Bacco, he tarried no longer in the public room than was necessary to complete his equipments with a beautiful, silver-stocked <foreign xml:lang="ITA">carabina,</foreign> which the landlady Brigita fetched him from a secure corner in which it had remained under her charge.</p> 
                  <p>"The saints give you a good return," said Brigita, as the captain received the carbine from her hands.</p> 
                  <p>"Thank you, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">il mia ostessa!</foreign> And at the next fair I will surely remember you. Take good care of Francesca, worthy Brigita."</p> 
                  <p>"Never fear me, captain!" answered the sharp-voiced hostess, as she unbarred the door, and gave egress to the old brigand, who, standing on the threshold a moment, saw a group of dark figures just in the shadow of the house, who moved at once as he appeared.</p> 
                  <p>"Are you all ready, comrades?"</p> 
                  <p>"Ay, captain, and a fine night we have for brisk walking."</p> 
                  <p>In five minutes more, the party were moving forward along the mule-path, in the direction opposite to the place where Berthold had lately descended.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VI.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">FRANCESCA.</head> 
                  <p>BERTHOLD the vine-dresser still remained in the small room where had taken place his interview with the brigand leader, and here, in scarcely the lapse of a minute after the departure of the father, whom she had followed to the door, Francesca joined the young man.</p> 
                  <p>She advanced slowly after crossing the threshold, whilst Berthold who had resumed his stool at the table, and was puffing the fine cigar bestowed on him by his late companion, held out his arms as if to receive an expected embrace.</p> 
                  <p>But the flashing eyes of the young girl gave little token of fondness, as likewise assuredly did not the first words she uttered:</p> 
                  <p>"Well-you are here again, with your wicked information!"</p> 
                  <p>"Sweet Francesca-for whose sake do I bring news to your father?" asked the vine-dresser, subduing his usually coarse voice to an intonation, which was really musical. As he spoke, he attempted to possess himself of the small, delicately-moulded hand of the girl, but she repulsed the motion at once.</p> 
                  <p>"Not for mine-not for my sake, nor my love, either," cried the brigand's child, suddenly breaking forth in an angry tone, though her voice was still low. "It is your own selfishness and evil purposes, not love of me, that brought you here to-night."</p> 
                  <p>"I swear it is my love for you, Francesca, and nought else;" returned Berthold, with more feeling than his usual demeanor evinced the possession of. "I would risk life and salvation for you, if you would but treat me as a man, and not as a dog."</p> 
                  <p>"False, Berthold-you speak not the truth! Long ago I bade you bring no more tidings to my father, to lead him out on such errands as as he undertakes to-night. I have said that it was base and treacherous in you thus to decoy the travellers who confided in your character of an honest mountain-guide. Once I thought you too brave and noble to be guilty of such acts-but now, Berthold, you make me-<emph>hate</emph> you!"</p> 
                  <p>As the young girl uttered these words in an agitated voice, the tears gushed suddenly from her eyes, across which she dashed her small hand, as-if ashamed of the weakness.</p> 
                  <p>"Hate me, Francesca! O, do not say you hate me!" cried the vine-dresser, now clasping her hand in his, and drawing her nigh in spite of her efforts to prevent him. "I swear to you I will obey you in whatsoever you command me; I will be your slave, your dog, if you will but smile upon me and let me be near you. If it is treachery for me to serve your father in my vocation as guide, then bid me leave the village at once, and join the band-"</p> 
                  <p>"Join the band-O, no, no! Would rather you would take my father far away from these mountains and his unhallowed calling! Berthold! Berthold! have I not told you I am weary of violence, and rapine, and-"</p> 
                  <p>"Not murder, Francesca!" interrupted the young man, as he divined what word trembled upon the girl's lips. "Your father, though he be called Tomaso the Terrible, is not renowned for deeds of blood. He has not many grievous sins to answer for!"</p> 
                  <p>"If he has <emph>one,</emph> it is too much, Berthold! If he has ever stained his hands with the blood of his fellow-man, life is scarce long enough for fitting repentance. O, Berthold, if you really loved me, you would take my father from these fearful mountains, where daily and nightly his life is in constant peril."</p> 
                  <p>"What would you have me do, Francesca?" cried the youth. "He will not listen to advice from <emph>me.</emph>"</p> 
                  <p>"That is because he trusts you not-because he despises you, as a spy and a traitor, in spite of what he gains from your assistance! O, unhappy that I am, to love one so unworthy even of a robber's confidence!"</p> 
                  <p>She wept anew at these words, and her bosom heaved violently beneath the thin muslin over which was laced her simple boddice. Berthold looked on her beautiful face with a mingled expression of passion and fear. He felt that the girl loved him, but that she likewise regarded him with no sentiments of true respect. The latter reflection chafed his gloomy temper.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, well-what is, is!" he muttered, releasing his hold of Francesca's hand, and moodily turning his head. "If I am to be despised by father and daughter-if I'm fit neither to be brigand nor guide, then let the fiend make me what he will, I care not."</p> 
                  <p>"Shame! shame on you for a man, Berthold!" cried the daughter of Tomaso, fixing her brilliant gaze upon the eyes which sought to avoid them, while the tears streaming over her flushed checks, lent new interest to the loveliness of her face. "Shame that <emph>I</emph> should love you, if you see no path for manhood but the robber's or the spy's."</p> 
                  <p>"In the name of all the saints, what would you have of me?" exclaimed the vine-dresser, breaking out into a sudden mood of violence. "Shall I turn soldier, and go to the wars?"</p> 
                  <p>"Ay, <emph>that</emph> were in the spirit of a man, Berthold! That were worthy of him whom Francesca loves!".</p> 
                  <p>"And be killed by a musket-ball in the first battle, while Francesca remains safe at home, to smile on new lovers!"</p> 
                  <p>The brigand's daughter was about to reply to this sneering remark, when she, observed the thin form of the hostess Brigita appear at the door. Without another word, then, she turned away from the table and left the vine-dresser to his reflections.</p> 
                  <p>What the burden of these may be, must be developed in another chapter; for, soon after the departure of Francesca, Berthold himself rose, and hardly exchanging a word with Bacco, who gave him egress, set out from the hostel, retracing his steps to the hut in Val d'Orazio.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE AVALANCHE.</head> 
                  <p>THE midnight moonbeams silvered all the mountain peaks and craggy summits, and cast white lustre on the sides of great precipices, and penetrated far into deep chasms, out of which came up sullenly the roar of hidden whirlpools. Over rocks and toppling clifts, and broad plateaus, was spread the crusted mantle of snows gathered during many winters.</p> 
                  <p>A narrow, perilous path wound under the brow of a huge wall of rock, adown whose slanting sides the glaciers appeared always as if about to slide upon the vales beneath. These glaciers glittered dazzlingly in the moonlight, like mites of shining mirrors. So narrow was the path below the summit of this mass of rock, that in many places the close-united feet of a mule might scarcely find a resting-place, whilst here and there some wide gap suddenly revealed the darkness of an awful gulf dividing even this secureless causeway. But, at the extremity of the glaciered wall, the way widened into an oval space, beyond which led a comparatively safe avenue to the village lying nearest to Vald' d'Orazio, on the road to the French passes. In the middle of the oval space alluded to, arose a pyramidal structure of rough stones, to which tradition assigned some terrible interest, as marking the scene of a bloody tragedy which had taken place during the old religious wars. This pile of stones bore among the mountaineers the name of "Huguenots' Altar."</p> 
                  <p>Here, with their figures largely outlined in the moonlight, stood the three persons who had set out at nightfall from Nicolo's cottage. The old guide, attracted by the beauty of the night, and more by the conversation of the stranger, who was a man of varied experience and acquirements, as evident from his speech, had been drawn over the mountain route farther than was his original intention; and now he still lingered, holding the traveller's hand as if loth to part from so agreeable a companion. The younger guide stood a few paces in advance, leaning upon his pole, and holding on his left arm the heavy furred mantle of the stranger, who, in the animation of his walk, had preferred to wear only his thick paletot, which was bound, like the cloak, with rich sable.</p> 
                  <p>Valentine, as he thus stood, could not but regard admiringly the majestic figure of the traveller, his symmetric proportions and graceful bearing. At the same time he recalled to his thoughts how old Nicolo had been completely, won by his companion's discourse during the long mountain walk, and the young lover could not refrain from a sigh, and a wish-that <emph>he</emph> might learn some powerful method to ingratiate himself so speedily into the good opinion of Bianca's grandsire.</p> 
                   
                  <p>Thus the three stood near the triangular "Huguenots' Altar," their forms plainly visible for many miles around, so transparent is the atmosphere in these wintry regions. Consequently their every movement was quite apparent to a party of men who had been following closely in their track for some time back, and who had now paused, just concealed by the jutting rocks which formed one side of the pass at its termination in the oval area where the travellers now were separating. This party, as the reader must suspect, was the band of Captain Tomaso, and the old brigand himself, hidden by the withered branches of a gnarled tree which overlooked his contemplated prize, from behind the cliffs, was near enough to distinguish the parting words spoken by the stranger to Nicolo. He peered cautiously from his concealment, meditating a method of securing and disarming the traveller and his guide Valentine, without doing bodily injury to either; and he awaited the separation of Nicolo from the other two, in order that less difficulty night be encountered in carrying out his project.</p> 
                  <p>"<foreign xml:lang="ITA">Addio il mio caio,</foreign>" signore, said the aged guide, warmly pressing the traveller's hand. "I shall probably no more encounter you, but an old man's blessing hurts not. Therefore signore, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">Dio vi benedica!</foreign>"</p> 
                  <p>"Thanks, my worthy friend. The benediction of an honest man is not to be slighted!" answered the stranger, returning the grasp of Nicolo's hand. And thus for an instant, the two remained looking at each other.</p> 
                  <p>At this juncture, a low muttering was heard as if proceeding from a point far above in the mountain-a sound which produced an immediate effect on the elder and younger guide, for they both started, and looked at one another with changing countenances.</p> 
                  <p>A huge mass of rock towered many hundred feet upward behind the "Huguenots' Altar." The steep sides of this, forming a lofty wall, were in many parts crusted with glittering ice, whilst other portions exhibited wide belts of the rocky strata. Upward, now, straining their glances toward the summit of this wall, the guides directed their faces, listening at the same time to that mysterious sound which, rivetting their attention, seemed to grow more and more distinctly audible.</p> 
                  <p>"It is the <emph>avalanche!</emph>" suddenly exclaimed Nicolo, in a hoarse tone. "Haste for your lives to the pass!"</p> 
                  <p>Then, still holding firmly to the traveller's hand, the brave old hunter-guide turned in the direction of the gap immediately opposite to the pass through which they had entered the oval theatre-which gap conducted at once to a winding road leading to the next village.</p> 
                  <p>Valentine, on his part, as he felt the certainty that a mountain slide was approaching, felt likewise his thoughts centering upon the cottage where Bianca awaited her grand-father's return; and, with an undefined impulse, instead of following his companions, he rushed suddenly upward toward the defile which he had lately traversed, casting but one hasty glance, as he ran, toward the two who were hurrying to the lower gap. At the same moment, looking upward, he discerned, instead of the clear stars that a moment before shone calmly over the scene, a great cloud-like form of loose and flying snow. Well he knew that a fearful slide was driving this cloud before it, and with redoubled speed, he strove to gain the sheltered pass-one word upon his quivering lips-"Bianca!"</p> 
                  <p>But a rush as of the sweeping of a myriad wings now filled the darkened air, and a thick mist of sharply-biting particles of snow encompassed him on every side. The youth felt himself lifted, as by a whirlwind, and as he struggled through the heavy gloom, and gained the narrow opening of the pass, his ears were stricken by a noise like the roar of artillery, shaking the hills and rolling deafeningly a down the valleys. Then the whirlwind of scattered snow raised the hunter bodily in its embrace, and bore him, wrapped in icy drifts, far into the pass which he had striven to gain. Still clinging to his tough pole, he was hurled forward and upward on the rising billowy drifts, until, at length, he fell prostrate, breathless and insensible, beaten down, but saved, by the upward pressure of the overwhelming sea of snow, which, after outspreading on the area below, burying the "Huguenots' Altar," and the oval space around, had then enlarged itself, and dashed through the mountain passes.</p> 
                  <p>The fearful roar which had presaged the event deepened as the avalanche crashed downward in the pass beneath, and then, from vast depths in the valleys, and from the distant defiles of the hills, came answering voices of uproar, as if all the elements were exultant over their mighty manifestation. But Valentine the young hunter, heard not this awful symphony of nature, for he lay stretched unconscious across his iron<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6326-00000014"/> pole, his form half-buried in the drifts which had preserved him from being swept downward in the bosom of the great slide.</p> 
                  <p>Far up, the atmosphere remained thick with snow; the moon was darkened, and dense shadows mingled with the sleety clouds. Long did this agitation continue, and when, an hour after the passage of the avalanche, the youth Valentine opened his eyes and recognized that he was thus almost miraculously saved from destruction, the mass of fallen slides had not yet subsided into immobility.</p> 
                  <p>The hunter with difficulty, by the help of his staff, extricated his benumbed limbs from the snow, and steadying himself cautiously upon the surface of the mass, advanced a few paces to the opening of the pass. Here he found the drift more compact, it having been forced together, by the rapidity of its descent, and jammed into the narrow oval space before mentioned. From this point Valentine surveyed the change that had taken place since he last beheld his companions.</p> 
                  <p>No trace of the triangular pile of stones that formed the "Huguenots' Altar" was now to be discovered. The space it had occupied presented only an unbroken plain of snow, piled up at the mouth of the upper pass where Valentine stood, and at the gap immediately opposite, near which, doubtless, Nicolo and the stranger had been overwhelmed in their downward flight.</p> 
                  <p>A sickening pang shot through the young man's breast at the thought that such was the fate of the stranger whose noble form he had lately surveyed so admiringly, as well as of the grand-father of the being who of all others living, he loved best. But Valentine was a resolute mountaineer, accustomed to act promptly in emergencies. A bare possibility existed, that, as Providence had preserved his own life in so remarkable a manner, its power might have likewise operated to preserve the lives of his companions. So, fixing his pole firmly in the settling snows, he ventured forward from the pass into the plateau beneath. The surface gave way but slightly to his weight, and gaining confidence as he advanced, he proceeded across the intervening space toward the lower gap.</p> 
                  <p>But when he reached that opening, and gazed down the broadening path that formed the road to the next village, he could discover, in the clear moonlight that now again irradiated the scene no vestige of any object which might awaken his hopes. The slide had forced its mighty way through this aperture, and thence descended far below, in a long stretch of motionless white, reflecting the moonbeams, covering entirely what before had been the valley route.</p> 
                  <p>Valentine paused, sadly contemplating the silent waste. Where now were the strongly-knit form, the symmetric limbs, which he had almost envied in the stranger? Where-O, where was the aged Nicolo-the guardian of his Bianca?</p> 
                  <p>But suddenly a gleam of joy shot from the young man's eyes, for he caught a glimpse of some dark object protruding from the snow, and with hurried steps he advanced toward it. It was Nicolo's iron pole, slanting out from a huge drift, near the mouth of the gulch, and just beneath the precipice of rock that formed its corner abutment. A moment more, and his vigorous hands had dashed aside the snow, and disclosed the hand and arm of the old hunter, the rest of whose form was wholly buried. Valentine drew the shoulders upward, and discovered that Nicolo's hand was still clinging to the pole, as he lay upon his back, his face upward, and near the surface of the drift which had covered him. The features were set and rigid as in death, but the youth fancied, as he stooped beside him, that he felt the breath still warm upon the old man's lips. Hastily exerting himself to extricate the hunter's limbs, Valentine at once essayed to restore the animation so long suspended.</p> 
                  <p>But poor Nicolo's frame was evidently chilled throughout. His white hair and beard were encrusted with sleet, and his garments were so stiffened, that it was with great difficulty the strong hands of the youth could remove the icy fastenings of the leather doublet which he wore. Valentine well-nigh despaired of the presence of any life, when, after violent manipulation of the limbs and breast of the old hunter, he could feel no return of warmth to the body. Nevertheless, he slackened not his energy, and at length was overjoyed to hear an almost inaudible moan attest that his friend was still a living man. He redoubled his efforts, until the old man's eyes opened, and his lips moved feebly as if to speak.</p> 
                  <p>"It is I, Nicolo-you are saved!" murmured the youth.</p> 
                  <p>The old guide's feeble glance fell on his preserver without apparent recognition, and the eyelids closed once more, with the reflux of drooping life. Again Valentine strove, and with still greater earnestness, to retain the almost expiring spark of spirit which yet clung to its earthly frame. He chafed the bosom and limbs, drew the old man's form to his own warm embrace, and at last, recalling to his recollection the flask of strong liquor always carried by the Alpine hunters, to be used on occasions like this, he drew it hastily from his pouch, and applied it to Nicolo's lips. But still only occasional moans, as if from in ward pain, answered his continued efforts, and Valentine at length decided to convey, if possible, the aged man to the cottage on the other declivity of the mountain. It was a bold resolution, and required arduous strength to accomplish it; but the youth felt that it offered the better chance to preserve his friend, and therefore, lifting him at once in his arms, he began slowly with his burthen, to retrace his steps to the upper pass.</p> 
                  <p>It was about an equal distance from the "Huguenots' Altar," to either of the villages lying in the neighboring valleys; but the young guide knew that, after such a heavy slide, the narrow upland path toward his own village would be easier to traverse than that into which the greater weight of the avalanche had been precipitated. Bearing, therefore, the old hunter, he crossed cautiously to the opposite opening, and toiled his way through the loose snow that filled it.</p> 
                  <p>Gaining the spot where he himself had been overwhelmed, and so providentially preserved, Valentine discovered, half-buried in the drift that costly mantle of sable furs, which had hung across his own arm at the moment when first appeared the avalanche's approach. Torn from his possession by the same billow of snow that had borne him on its crest to safety, the stranger's cloak now again met his gaze, uninjured by the blow which had swept away its hapless owner. The youth gladly availed himself of the ample folds of this rich garment, to envelope the chilled form of Nicolo, after which he made one more attempt to awaken the old hunter to at least a consciousness of present security. But again nought but the low moans replied to his exertions; so, with his drooping burthen, Valentine staggered through the snow, ascending the mountain path.</p> 
                  <p>And as he glanced for an instant backward over the white waste, he thought sadly of that stranger whose fate had been so sudden and terrible. But the thought of Bianca stole likewise to his heart, and amid all the perils he had escaped, he rejoiced in the hope that he should yet save her grandsire.</p> 
                  <p>"Then," murmured poor Valentine, "then, perchance he will repent his harsh refusal."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">MONNA BARBARA.</head> 
                  <p>MONNA BARBARA, after the departure of her ill-tempered elder son, continued for some time to hobble about the interior of the hut, engaged in bestowing the platters and wine bottle into some mysterious receptacle near the fire-place. Apparently, her good intention in regard to counting her beads, was in a fair way of contributing its quota of pavement to a place which we need not specify; for, on concluding her domestic bustle, the crone betook herself to the stool on which Berthold had been seated, and, resting chin on hands and elbows on knees, the most approved fashion of ancient dames, whether they be witches or not, she seemed to lapse into entire forgetfulness of all things that were about her.</p> 
                  <p>Nevertheless, Monna Barbara's thoughts were not sunk in apathy, as was apparent presently from certain occasional twitches, that imparted, if possible, greater ugliness to her withered features, and an uneasy shifting of her hands from side to side of her bird-like eyes, as their gaze looked straight forward with a vacant stare. In truth, the beldame was in a mood for reflection, and memory busied itself in presenting to her mind events and images that had for long years been banished from her waking life.</p> 
                  <p>She recalled a wild but picturesque mountain region-in its midst a lovely cavern, wherein the setting sun's last beams darted a yellow light. Upon a rude couch of dry forest-leaves, lay the form of a wounded man, garbed in the gay habit of an outlawed mountaineer, but writhing apparently in grievous pain. Beside him knelt a woman in the prime of life, her countenance handsome, but stamped with the lines that unchecked passions write so legibly upon the human face. In the woman's features, through the misty shadows of her vision, Monna Barbara, beheld her own lineaments ere time and grief had marred their freshness. This female knelt beside the mountaineer, binding his wound with linen, and soothing him the while with words of love. Without the cavern, two children, a boy and girl were innocently playing, whilst on a rocky shelf, overlooking the cave, the bayonets of soldiers gleamed in the crimson sunbeams. These soldiers descended unseen and noiselessly from the heights-they reached the spot where the unconscious children sported-the female child, terrified, fled shrieking away, while the intruders rushed into the cavern. Then there was another shriek, a struggle, and the wounded brigand, bound with strong cords, was dragged from the embrace of his wife and the boy who clung affrighted to her garments.</p> 
                   
                  <p>Monna Barbara moaned fearfully, as this picture of past life flitted before her vision; and, throwing her withered hands forward imploringly, she cried, in piteous accents:</p> 
                  <p>"Mercy! mercy! For the love of heaven, leave him to die with me!"</p> 
                  <p>But the vision changed. Its shifting light revealed a landscape beautiful as dreamland-a proud castle towering on a lofty eminence, watching warder-like the vale beneath-a yale luxuriant with gardens, and smiling with dimpled brooks and laughing in silvery cascades; on either side, sloping hills, clad with blossoms and fruitage; high above all, great mountains girdled with glaciers, and afar, the king of mountains, BLANC, diamonded with ice, and sitting throned in stern magnificence and changeless pride.</p> 
                  <p>Again the vision was filled with terror-a scene of wild confusion usurping the quiet of that peaceful landscape. Rough men, strangely attired, and armed with murderous weapons, descended from the hills, rushing to and fro, wounding and slaying the flying dwellers of the vale. Anon the lofty castle appeared wrapped in lurid flames, its massy walls and graceful galleries, arched gates, and carved windows, and embattled turrets, all girded by the fiery elements that swept in terrible grandeur over every defence; still, crumbling in fierce heat, the structure sunk to earth a ruin, smouldering beneath great clouds of gloomy smoke. And fore most amid the fierce incendiaries, foremost among the murderous band that smote the peaceful valley, the shuddering crone recalled one face-one female form. O, woe for her! the face and form were Monna Barbara's.</p> 
                  <p>Terrible were the workings of the dreamy woman's soul. The beaded sweat stood coldly on her ashen cheek-her voice sounded strangely hollow and unnatural, as she moaned aloud:</p> 
                  <p>"Thus-thus Monna Barbara avenged her husband!"</p> 
                  <p>The echo of her own voice awoke the beldam from the dream-like retrospect of past events. She shuddered, and rose from her seat, her tottering limbs feebly obeying her stronger will. As she gained her feet, a sudden flash of red gleamed from the dying embers on the hearth, and as it illumined for a second the obscurity of the hut, the old woman's glance was attracted by some brilliantly shining object lying near the door. She approached the spot, with faltering steps, and stooping to the ground, groped in the gloom until her fingers closed upon a hard substance, which she immediately bore to the fireplace. Then, hastily throwing a dry branch upon the coals, she waited a moment till a blaze rose from the ignited wood, and then proceeded to examine her prize.</p> 
                  <p>It was a small cross of jet, with a golden heart in the centre, attached to a plain silken braid. Upon the golden heart was a simple inscription in German letters. There was nothing remarkable about the ornament, nevertheless, no sooner did Monna Barbara's glance rest upon it, than an extraordinary change came across her countenance; her eyes dilated into a fixed stare, her breath was choked, and the corners of her mouth quivered convulsively, and then grew rigid.</p> 
                  <p>Thus for a few moments, the crone remained, steadfastly gazing at the cross of jet. Again the visions of memory rushed athwart her soul; again the past gave up its phantoms. At length, a low murmur came from the old woman's lips:</p> 
                  <p>"It was he-surely the dead walk!"</p> 
                  <p>Once more Monna Barbara scrutinized the little emblem. Long and fixedly her eyes dwelt upon it, and as they did so, the hard look which was habitual to them seemed to vanish; they grew soft and moist, and at last-O strange visitor to Monna Barbara's eyes! a tear dropped from them upon the golden heart. The crone dashed her hand across her brow, as she felt the unusual tenderness; but the long pent waters, haply unsealed by heaven's mercy, now found their channel from the woman's heart. Monna Barbara struggled a moment against her rising feelings, and then, burying her withered forehead in her hands, still grasping the cross of jet, she flung herself prostrate on the floor of the hut, and gave vent to all the violence of an uncontrolled nature overpowering itself with its own emotions.</p> 
                  <p>Long did the old woman sob and moan, and sway her shattered body to and fro, upon the hard ground; but at last the paroxysm subsided, giving place to calmer grief. Then, indeed, Monna Barbara felt a strange change working in her soul-a change that seemed to crush her abjectly in the dust, and yet uplift her higher than she had ever risen before-a change that made bare her heart, with all its evil secrets, and yet appeared to cast about its nakedness a mantle that shielded it from outward harm. Monna<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6326-00000016"/> Barbara rose again, with much of the darkness of her mind enlightened. Her features seemed not so ugly as before, and something soft and human had taken place of the querulous and weird expression which so lately marked her countenance.</p> 
                  <p>Once more the crone looked at the jet cross, with its gold heart shining in the firelight. Then she moved to a shelf in the dark nook where she was wont to sit, and took down from it a string of beads, broken, and dusty with long disuse.</p> 
                  <p>And then Monna Barbara knelt beside the stool, and in the gloom and solitude of her hovel, began to pray to that God whom she had long forgotten-the God of the poor as well as of the rich-of the outcast and contemned as well as of the exalted-of the sinner as well as of the saint.</p> 
                  <p>And her prayer was "Have mercy upon me! God who forgivest!"</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IX.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">NICOLO'S PARTING-THE ACCUSATION.</head> 
                  <p>BIANCA had watched throughout the long night at the cottage casement, her bosom swelling with anxiety, and here eyes dimmed with tears. Solemn indeed was such a night vigil, with only the yellow moon and the great mountain-peaks of eternal snow looking coldly down upon her devotion. But the long hours passed away, and yet the straining gaze of the maiden discerned no human form upon the lonesome mountain path. At length, near the daybreak, when the low beams of the setting moon slanted feebly over the high glaciers, Bianca fancied she could discover a slow-moving object descending toward the valley. At first she could distinguish no figure, but as the form drew near the opening, and entered into the light reflected from the cottage lantern, she recognized at once her lover, Valentine, and her quick instinct as readily informed her that the burden he bore was her grand-father. She needed no more, but darting from the cottage, ran rapidly to meet them.</p> 
                  <p>"My father! O, Valentine-my father!"</p> 
                  <p>"Hush! let us reach the house! He is, thank heaven, only fainting!"</p> 
                  <p>Old Nicolo was borne as soon as possible to the couch which he had pressed, man and boy, for sixty years. For many minutes after, he exhibited no sign of life, other than the low moanings Valentine had heard before. But, when, after repeated applications of warm cloths, and the genial temperature of the room had diffused a little life through his frame, the flask of spirit was once more applied to his lips, the aged hunter appeared to revive. His eyes slowly opened, and he rested their feeble glance alternately upon Bianca and Valentine.</p> 
                  <p>"My father! O speak to me-to your Bianca!"</p> 
                  <p>A smile stole very faintly over the old man's features. At that moment returning consciousness was recalling all the events of the night, slowly and dimly, but yet with sad distinctness. Valentine's hand was clasping his, and he pressed it feebly, as his gaze was fixed for a moment on the youth. Then he murmured:</p> 
                  <p>"The traveller-"</p> 
                  <p>"Alas!" was all that Valentine could reply.</p> 
                  <p>A shadow fell on the old guide's brow, as he seemed to divine all the significance of that single exclamation.</p> 
                  <p>"But <emph>you</emph> are saved, dear father-you are-"</p> 
                  <p>Again the eyelids of the aged hunter drooped, and a deadly paleness succeeded to the faint flush which had for a few moments overspread his countenance. Bianca fell on her knees beside the bed, and clasping her grand-father's hand called his name in a tone of anguish.</p> 
                  <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6326-00000017"/> 
                  <p>But Nicolo's eyes opened once more, and now entire recognition appeared in their glance. The smile stole gently over his features, and the gaze again sought the faces of those beside him. It sat fondly on Bianca-kindly, gratefully on Valentine.</p> 
                  <p>Then again the low moan was heard, and the next moment all was over with Nicolo the hunter.</p> 
                  <p>Morning broke over the village of Val d'Orazio, and the sun arose grandly, gilding the lofty summits crowned with ice, and the fields below mantled with unbroken snow.</p> 
                  <p>Morning glimmered through the window of Nicolo's desolate cottage, casting its first gray beams on the ashen face of death. The sun, that had been wont to steal joyously into that casement, falling upon the happy brow of the early-risen hunter, and playing, as if in gladness, with the lovely face of Bianca, as she made ready the morning meal, now seemed as if loth to enter with his garish beams into that house of sorrow. But his rays stirred not the mourners at that couch where reposed all that remained of Nicolo. Kneeling side by side, their hands clasping the cold fingers of the dead, Valentine and Bianca heeded not the approach of day, till the broad light fell around them, and warned them that life was yet in the world, life with its duties, and its realities.</p> 
                  <p>Bianca's tears were dry, for the strong heart of a woman was in her breast, and as she rose with Valentine from beside the corpse, she felt that, at least for a season, she must seal that fountain whose overflow can alone relieve the spirit bowed by sorrow. The woe must lie for a time heavy within her breast, until the form of him whom she had long regarded as a father, should be laid forever in the grassy churchyard, whither she might then steal silently, and weep in secret over his grave. But now she must nerve her maiden's heart for the last duties which the living owe to the departed.</p> 
                  <p>Therefore, no tear was in the maiden's eye, as she spoke calmly to Valentine upon the course necessary to pursue in reference to the sudden death of Nicolo. Many she well knew would mourn her grand-father's fate; many with whom for half a century he had held almost daily intercourse. Far and near, through all the valley and mountain routes within a score of leagues, Nicolo's name had been long familiar to the inhabitants as a trusty guide and bold mountaineer. And during all his life, perhaps, the good man had made no enemy, save only those unhappy natures who are enemies to aught that is good.</p> 
                  <p>It was, however, at first, and above all things necessary, that the padre should be advised of the death of his parishioner, and that explanation should be immediately made to him concerning the sudden demise of Nicolo, in order that the misfortune of the old guide's departure from this world without the consolation of the viaticum might be no bar to his being laid in ground blessed by the priest; likewise that proper measures should be taken to the end that prayers for the deceased should at once be offered up in the village chapel. These pious commissions Valentine at once took upon himself to perform, and then, after a sorrowful embrace of Bianca, as they stood beside the cold remains of her grandsire, he departed from the cottage, just as the full light of the arisen sun was streaming through the valley pass, which he had traversed so lately with the form of him who was now no more.</p> 
                  <p>Bianca knelt a few moments by the couch, murmuring a simple but beautiful prayer, which affection for her grand-father had made a daily orison. But, alas! it implored protection through the day, and a safe return to his home at night, for him whose cold form would soon be borne away from that home, to return to more forever.</p> 
                  <p>The maiden rose again, but Valentine was no longer at her side, and the sense of loneliness came terribly over her. Nicolo had been her friend and protector since childhood; for her parents were taken are she could well articulate their names, and thereupon Bianca had been accustomed to look upon the old hunter as uniting in his gentle solicitude the care of both father and mother. True she had one more relative, a sister of Nicolo, who dwelt in the next valley, where she had been left a window many years before, remaining in possession of a little cottage and plat of ground which afforded her a scant but secure subsistence. The hunter, though on kindly terms with his relative, had not opposed her often-reiterated desire to continue in occupation of the little property left by her husband; and therefore the good Agata had never become an inmate of her brother's more commodious cottage in the Val d'Orazio. Consequently Bianca, tough she often visited her aunt, was not accustomed to regard her with the affectionate interest which she felt for old Nicolo.</p> 
                   
                  <p>But now, with the consciousness of her unprotected situation, the thought of Agata mingled in Bianca's mind with that of Valentine; and the maiden resolved, as soon as the latter should return, to engage the services of one of the villagers to convey intelligence of Nicolo's death to his only sister. This assisted somewhat to soothe the feeling of abandonment which Bianca experienced, and she awaited in calmness the return of her lover.</p> 
                  <p>In the meantime, as well as she was able, she disposed the couch on which Nicolo lay, crossed the old hunter's hands over his heart, and placed within the rigid fingers a small wooden crucifix which was usually hung over his head. There were no flowers now in the little garden plat outside the cottage, or Bianca would soon have decked the couch with fragrant emblems of immortal bloom; but she sprinkled over it in pious reverence, some water which the priest had lately "blessed" for Nicolo, and lit a short piece of "holy candle" carefully preserved since the last candlemass day, when it was brought from the village church. This she placed at Nicolo's head, where its faint rays, mingling with the sunbeams, might fall upon his reverend brow.</p> 
                  <p>As Bianca thus occupied herself, she heard the sound of voices at the cottage door, and immediately after a quick knock. She hastened to admit the visitors, and discovered that a crowd of villagers were gathered around the little paling that half-enclosed the house. The foremost of these, and the one who had knocked, was Berthold, and close after him came Monna Barbara. Several neighbors followed hard behind, to gain admittance.</p> 
                  <p>There was strong sympathy visible in the countenances of the neighbors, coupled with a strange expression, as of mingled horror and indignation. Berthold the vine-dresser advanced toward the couch, and in so doing, his glance fell upon the sable mantle of the lost traveller, which hang across a table near the wall. At this sight, he exchanged a look with the neighbor who entered behind him, and immediately a murmur ran through the group at the door. Bianca gazed anxiously at the vine-dresser, startled at his singular demeanor.</p> 
                  <p>Many people now entered the room, and thronged about the bedside. But the maiden grew more alarmed, as she noticed the silence which they preserved, and the mysterious glances passing from one to another. At length one spoke-it was a peasant who occupied the cottage nearest on the road to the hamlet:</p> 
                  <p>"Poor Nicolo!" he said, and then, "It was a foul deed!"</p> 
                  <p>"I will not believe he is guilty!" exclaimed the old woman, Barbara, as if in response. "God will prove him innocent!"</p> 
                  <p>The neighbor only answered by pointing to the cloak which lay upon the table.</p> 
                  <p>"Who is guilty? Of what deed speak ye?" cried Bianca, rushing forward, her heart sinking with the prescience of some new calamity about to fall upon it.</p> 
                  <p>"Alas! alas!" murmured Berthold, hiding his face, as he turned away.</p> 
                  <p>"Poor youth! he is stricken with shame and sorrow!" whispered one of the peasants to a companion. "His own brother!"</p> 
                  <p>"In the name of heaven of what are ye speaking?" cried Bianca, wildly, looking from one pale face to another among the group. "What would ye say?"</p> 
                  <p>"That your poor grandsire has been-murdered!" returned a peasant, with horror depicted strongly on his visage.</p> 
                  <p>"Murdered! 'tis false! murdered? By whom?"</p> 
                  <p>"O, wretched Valentine!" murmured Berthold, in a broken voice, his face still buried in his hands.</p> 
                  <p>"Valentine!" exclaimed Bianca, in a voice startlingly clear, whose tones thrilled through the strong men present-"Valentine!" she echoed, raising her hands to her forehead, as if to shut out a fearful sight.</p> 
                  <p>"O, listen not! believe them not!" cried Monna Barbara, struggling forward to the side of Bianca. "He is innocent-Valentine is innocent!"</p> 
                  <p>"I do <emph>not</emph> believe them!" murmured the maiden, in tones grown suddenly calm, while the clairvoyant light of confiding affection shone from her truthful eyes. "No!" she continued, sinking by the couch of Nicolo, and closing her hands devoutly, whilst her gaze was lifted toward heaven-"O sanctified spirit! thou knowest that Valentine could never raise his arm against thy beloved life! Thou knowest that Valentine is innocent!"</p> 
                  <p>"Thank God-thank God!" cried Monna Barbara who seemed to recognize in this invocation of the young maiden a sufficient refutation of all suspicion against her son. But the stern<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6326-00000018"/> voice of an aged peasant near her rejoined solemnly:</p> 
                  <p>"Where, then, is the traveller whom the young man led into the mountains? Did not many among us behold yonder mantle worn by the stranger who last night passed through the village?"</p> 
                  <p>A murmur of assent from many present answered the old man's adjuration.</p> 
                  <p>"But my grand-father died here, in Valentine's arms," exclaimed Bianca. "Nicolo recognized him kindly with his last glance."</p> 
                  <p>"O, unhappy youth! Did he then receive the last breath of his victim?" cried the aged peasant, with a look of horror.</p> 
                  <p>"It is false! ye are all mad!" cried Monna Barbara, breaking forth violently, her wrinkled hands flung upward in wild agitation. "Valentine would harm no living thing."</p> 
                  <p>"Stay, wretched mother!" said the peasant. "Answer me, if what I speak be true. Did not your wicked son threaten Nicolo's life ere he sat out on this ill-omened journey? Speak, young man!" he continued, turning to Berthold-for Monna Barbara replied not-" Did not your brother swear to revenge himself on him who now lies there?"</p> 
                  <p>"Spare me!" murmured Berthold, wildly.</p> 
                  <p>"Answer me, on your soul I charge you!"</p> 
                  <p>"He threatened not vengeance-he but-"</p> 
                  <p>"His words, young man?"</p> 
                  <p>"He but said when Nicolo answered him," spoke the crafty vine-dresser, with well-counter-feited reluctance. "He but said, 'The time will come when you shall repent your words!'"</p> 
                  <p>A long silence followed this reply, which was broken by Bianca, when she had recovered in a measure from a sort of stupor into which the reiterated charges against her lover had thrown her senses. "It was Valentine," she said, looking around at the horror-stricken faces of the peasants-"It was he that you accuse, who rescued Nicolo from the avalanche which crushed him-who brought him to his home-who received his last sigh, and prayed with me when his spirit had departed!"</p> 
                  <p>"Let us examine the body!" said the old peasant, abruptly, as Bianca ceased speaking. "Perchance the marks of violence are upon it!"</p> 
                  <p>This proposition was at once assented to by looks of satisfaction, and the aged peasant, gently taking Bianca's hand, led her from the couch to another part of the room, whither Monna Barbara slowly followed her.</p> 
                  <p>The garb which Nicolo wore was still damp from the snow that had encrusted it, though his outer jerkin had been removed by Valentine when the old hunter was laid upon his bed. The vest and shirt had been opened at the breast, to enable the young man to rub the chilled flesh, and bathe it with spirits from his flask. All other portions of the guide's attire remained as he had himself donned them on the previous day.</p> 
                  <p>But, what was the horror of the old peasant on unlacing the thongs which fastened the leathern vest to the leggins of like fabric which formed Nicolo's nether garments, to discover dark stains upon the brown linen-at the same instant that another villager, withdrawing his hand hastily from the old guide's naked side, held it up in the broad sunlight, disclosing the fingers crimson with blood.</p> 
                  <p>Bianca, who had anxiously watched the movements of those around the couch, uttered a loud shriek as she beheld the gory hand raised aloft, as in solemn confirmation of her lover's crime. Monna Barbara screamed also, and attempted to rush forward, but was withheld by Berthold, who, with face paler than that of the corpse, regarded the action of the villager.</p> 
                  <p>"Mother! what think ye of your Valentine <emph>now?</emph>" hissed the malignant brother, in a hoarse whisper.</p> 
                  <p>"Let her come forward!" exclaimed the old peasant, who seemed to take the lead of the rest, and who had noticed the motion of Berthold, in restraining Monna Barbara. "Let her approach! Here is the murderer's mark!"</p> 
                  <p>As he spoke, he laid bare the hunter's side, discovering a small, uneven wound, clotted with extravasated blood, which had evidently been inflicted by a blunt iron weapon, and, lacerating some interior artery, had caused an inward hemorrhage, resulting in the sufferer's death.</p> 
                  <p>"The blow was dealt with a hunter's staff!" resumed the peasant. "It was an assassin's stroke!"</p> 
                  <p>The old man turned to Bianca, as he uttered these words; but the maiden heard them not. She lay prestrate upon the floor, stricken insensible by the cruel thought of her lover's guilt, apparently so terribly made manifest.</p> 
                  <p>At this moment, a new group entered the cottage, among which was the <foreign xml:lang="ITA">padre</foreign> of the village and the youth Valentine; but the latter was bound with cords, and guarded by the sturdy mountaineers.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER X.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">TOMASO THE BRIGAND.</head> 
                  <p>THE same morning sun that was shining in upon the cottage of Nicolo, falling over the dead man's rigid form, and on the faces of the fearful villagers who crowded the apartment-the same golden rays that disclosed this awful spectacle-penetrated at the same hour a narrow, low-roofed room in the osteria of Bacco, on the lonely mulepath, and revealed a scene likewise of sorrow and suffering.</p> 
                  <p>The room itself, though small and confined, with but one window, looking out through a long glen, which formed a vista far in the heart of the hills, was yet extremely neat, and adorned with many little ornaments, displayed in such a manner as denoted the presence and care of a woman. Upon its walls, concealing in a measure the unsightly rafters which protruded, hung several colored pictures, chiefly of a religious cast, being generally the figures of kneeling nuns or saints of the church. An ivory crucifix was fixed near the window, and near it that indispensable article of furniture in a lady's apartment, a mirror. Various articles of female apparel, interspersed with several weapons, that seemed much out of place-a silver-stocked carabine, a brace of pistols, and two murderous-looking daggers, without scabbards-depended from other portions of the whitewashed walls.</p> 
                  <p>A narrow bed stood in a corner, spread with a richly-worked silken coverlid, under the ample proportions of which lay a man, whose forehead was bound with a kerchief, while his eyes were closed, as if in slumber. Evidently, however, he rested not, for ever and anon the muscles of his face worked with convulsive motions, and his teeth grated harshly against each other. It was easy to perceive that either troubled thoughts, or some harassing dream disturbed the man's mind.</p> 
                  <p>The sun's rays, as we have said, entered the narrow apartment. They lightened somewhat the dark features of the old brigand captain, Tomaso, for it was he who lay so unquietly upon the bed. Tomaso, the father of the young girl Francesca, whose graceful figure now appeared at the door, advancing noiselessly into the room.</p> 
                  <p>The expression of the maiden's face, as she came towards the couch, was very mournful. A deep sorrow seemed to look forth from the dark eyes, and rest upon the pale, arched forehead. She moved silently forward, and knelt at the bedside, clasping her hands, and gazing fixedly upon the writhing lineaments of her father. Bitter were her reflections as she thus regarded him, as might be seen in her quivering lips, and in the tears that slowly dropped from her cheek upon the silken coverlid. A lifetime of mental suffering, fear, and foreboding, seemed to reveal itself in her attitude and looks.</p> 
                  <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6326-00000019"/> 
                  <p>Old Tomaso started nervously, and opened his eyes. Francesca's soft hand was in a moment pressed to his cheek, and her face approached his own. "Father!" she murmured.</p> 
                  <p>A wild stare, as of doubt or distrust, at first answered her from Tomaso's eyes. But the gaze of deep affection which met it appeared to have a sudden influence upon the brigand. The hard expression of his features relaxed, the eyes drooped, and something akin to a smile illumined the close-set lips, which a moment afterwards, opened painfully, feebly murmuring:</p> 
                  <p>"My child! raise me!"</p> 
                  <p>Francesca wound her arm tenderly about the old man's neck, lifting his head, and pillowing it upon her bosom. Thus supported, the brigand's scarred and weather-beaten countenance, half turned toward the casement, was bathed in the morning sunbeams, which likewise encircled, as with a halo, the luxuriant curls that clustered over Francesca's finely-moulded head.</p> 
                  <p>"Francesca! I have had-a-terrible-night!" murmured the old brigand, pausing to gather breath between each word he uttered, feebly, and with great effort.</p> 
                  <p>"O, my father-you are very weak! Do not strive to talk!"</p> 
                  <p>"No-no-Francesca-I am better-now! The wine, good girl!"</p> 
                  <p>Francesca could reach, with her disengaged arm, a small table standing near the bed, where-on were a flask and glass filled with wine. Placing the latter to the parched mouth of her father, who eagerly swallowed the wine at a gulp, the maiden saw with satisfaction that it appeared to strengthen the old man at once, and she remarked, with still greater pleasure, that a slight perspiration was moistening his previously dry and fevered flesh. She contemplated silently this favorable symptom, until, after a brief pause, the old brigand again spoke:</p> 
                  <p>"Francesca! I have seen death rioting on the battle-field, and lingering on the scaffold, and struggling on the bed of unshriven remorse!-but never did I behold it in so fearful and sudden a guise as that in which it appeared last night."</p> 
                  <p>"O, my father! And Heaven, in its mercy, preserved your life alone!"</p> 
                  <p>"Mine only-worthless as it is!" replied Tomaso. "O, Francesca!"</p> 
                  <p>The brigand closed his eyes, as if to shut out the memory of the awful scene he had witnessed. But, presently, he asked:</p> 
                  <p>"How bears Bacco the loss of his sons?"</p> 
                  <p>"Alas, he has been insensible since daybreak! Such draughts of wine as he swallowed, he may never recover from. He is now lying stupified in his great chair."</p> 
                  <p>"And-Brigita!-"</p> 
                  <p>"Poor Brigita!" replied the maiden. "She will not be comforted."</p> 
                  <p>"Comforted!" echoed a shrill voice at the door, and turning her head, Francesca saw the ostessa standing near the threshold. The thin frame of the woman was bent, and her head bowed upon her breast. The saturnine expression which her features usually wore had given place to a look of utter dejection. She leaned totteringly against the rough, upright post of the door.</p> 
                  <p>"<emph>Comforted!</emph>" repeated Brigita, fixing her sharp gaze upon Tomaso. "Let him who led my poor boys to the path of the avalanche-let him from whom their blood will be demanded at the great reckoning day-let Tomaso speak comfort to me-if he can!"</p> 
                  <p>"O, Brigita! Brigita! I implore you-go now away! Leave my father now!"</p> 
                  <p>"No, Francesca!-let her speak-let her curse me!" said the brigand captain, in tones almost as heart-broken as those of Brigita. "It is just! On me lies the guilt of all!"</p> 
                  <p>It must have been a fearful night indeed that had so changed and subdued the fierce soul of Tomaso, "the Terrible!" as in his earlier days he had been surnamed by the band which he commanded. It must have been a mighty up-ploughing of the old hard nature, a tearing open of the ancient sutures of wounds long cicatrized by customary crime and violence, that could alone have wrung from the brigand's lips such words as those he now murmured faintly, or brought to his cold, dry eye the unusual tears which now fell slowly, one by one, upon the white hand of Francesca.</p> 
                  <p>"Brigita, curse me!" continued the old man, as the ostessa, advancing to the bedside, folded her arms across her breast, and sternly regarded the speaker. "On me let the anger of God fall, for I am the chief of sinners!"</p> 
                  <p>Thus spoke Tomaso the brigand, and the broken accents of his voice so startled the old woman that the vindictive words she was about to speak died away upon her lips. The self accusing humility of the robber-captain appalled her more than the most violent burst of anger could have done. It seemed to reveal the working ing of a higher power in the man's heart than her own sinful nature could comprehend.</p> 
                  <p>"Do you not curse me, Brigita?" murmured the brigand, his voice fainter even than before.</p> 
                  <p>The ostessa fixed her steadfast glance upon the old man's face, but not with the angry gleam that lately proceeded from it. It seemed that some feeling akin to that which worked in Tomaso's heart, was exerting its mysterious influence upon her harsh spirit, subduing its revengeful vehemence.</p> 
                  <p>"Poor man! I do not curse you!" cried the ostessa, turning from the bed. "May God forgive you for leaving me a childless mother!"</p> 
                  <p>With these words, Brigita departed from the room without another look at the brigand or his daughter, whose forehead had drooped upon the pillow beside his, while tears gushed hot and fast from her eyes.</p> 
                  <p>Francesca remained in this position for some moments after the ostessa had gone, while her father kept silent, but apparently agitated with conflicting thoughts. At last Tomaso said, in a low tone:</p> 
                  <p>"My child! Think you I dare pray to God?"</p> 
                  <p>"Pray, my father!" exclaimed the girl, a flush of joy suddenly irradiating her countenance. "O, indeed! Why should you fear to do that? Pray-pray, my father, to the saints, and our holy mother!"</p> 
                  <p>As she hurriedly spoke these words, Francesca took from her bosom a little volume with a cross gilded upon its sides, to which, likewise, was fastened a small rosary of silver beads.</p> 
                  <p>"Here, my father! 'Tis a book which the padre has blessed! And these beads-do you not remember that you gave them to me-long ago, when I was a little child? Dear father! May I not pray with you?"</p> 
                  <p>The maiden's fine eyes, suffused with tears, were raised full of earnest affection to her father's face. The pleading beauty of her glance seemed to reach the heart of Tomaso, and to soothe him with its influence. He raised both his hands, and placed them on his daughter's forehead, then suffered them to fall, clasped together upon the bed.</p> 
                  <p>"Pray for me!"</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XI.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE BRIGAND'S DAUGHTER.</head> 
                  <p>THE morning hours wore away; the sun-beams, after slanting for a brief space, through the eastward-looking defiles and gorges of the mountains, withdrawing themselves wholly from the lower vales, to dwell upon the broad plateaux; or linger, courtier-like, during all the day, around the summits of higher Alpine chains.</p> 
                  <p>There was not a sign of life visible about the osteria of Bacco the innkeeper. The doors remained close, the windows barred within, and no form appeared before the rude porch, during the long hours from daybreak till the sun no longer shone into the glen. Thus, lonesome and silent, the mule-path remained till near the middle of the day, at which time the figure of a man approached the hostel from the direction of Val d'Orazio. He paused, in astonishment, as he remarked the untenanted appearance of the inn, disclosing, as he looked upwards, the face of Berthold the vine-dresser.</p> 
                  <p>A couple of well-delivered knocks at the solidly bound door, failed to Arouse the inmates; but at the third summons the window-shutter was unbarred, and the beautiful face of Francesca appeared in the opening.</p> 
                  <p>"In the devil's name," began Berthold, roughly, as he beheld the shutters unclosing, but the sudden apparition of Francesca caused him to leave unsaid the rest of the sentence; for not only was the vinedresser startled at seeing the maiden's face, but its expression, and her manner as she looked forth, struck the young man as strangely altered from her usual demeanor.</p> 
                  <p>"Berthold, there is sorrow in this dwelling!" spake Francesca, slowly, and in low tones. "Go hence, I pray you, for Bacco keeps no open house this day."</p> 
                  <p>"What mean you, Francesca?" cried the vinedresser, terrified, he knew not why, at the girl's words. "Is he-dead? Is Brigita-"</p> 
                  <p>"Go hence, Berthold. I must return to my father. To-morrow come hither, and you shall know what has happened."</p> 
                  <p>"The captain, then, is in the house. Why may I not speak with him, Francesca?"</p> 
                  <p>"Come you here to betray more travellers to their destruction?" cried the maiden, with sudden vehemence. "Away, Berthold-away!"</p> 
                  <p>"You have heard, then-you know the traveller's fate-the murder of Nicolo, and-"</p> 
                  <p>"What is that you would say?" cried Francesca, starting. "Whose murder? It is false! My father has committed none!"</p> 
                  <p>"Nay, nay, Francesca-it is not your father-it is my poor brother who is accused."</p> 
                  <p>"Your brother! The gentle Valentine! Of what?"</p> 
                   
                  <p>Berthold felt a pang shoot through him, as the word "gentle" fell from Francesca's lips, applied to his hapless brother. It was thus the world had distinguished between them. The gloomy youth felt that, triumph as he might over the innocent Valentine, he could never win the esteem with which all had hitherto regarded him whom they now accused of crime. But envy gave bitterness to his next words.</p> 
                  <p>"The <emph>gentle</emph> Valentine has proved himself cruel. He has murdered a fellow-guide and a traveller."</p> 
                  <p>"Berthold!" spoke the maiden; and her steady look, fixed upon the vine-dresser's countenance, made the guilty man tremble in spite of his habitual control of emotion. "Berthold!" she repeated. "Beware how you condemn the innocent! Nicolo the guide, the traveller of whom you speak-nay, your brother himself, were all buried by the avalanche which destroyed the sons of Bacco."</p> 
                  <p>"The sons of Bacco! What say you? And the Captain Tomaso, and the band!"</p> 
                  <p>"My father alone lives of all who went with him last night, at your ill-omened bidding. Hasten-if, as you say, your brother is accused of murder-hasten and reveal the truth. No human hand destroyed the traveller. It was the act of God alone!"</p> 
                  <p>The eyes of Francesca, raised upward as she spoke-her attitude and solemn tone-conspired to produce a strange effect upon the vinedresser. His voice in rejoinder exhibited less of confidence-but assumed a more earnest accent.</p> 
                  <p>"How know you this, Francesca? How did the Captain Tomaso escape?"</p> 
                  <p>"He was saved by a miracle, entangled in the knotted branches of a mountain tree, which held him firmly while the avalanche rushed past. All were swept away before his eyes-all the comrades-"</p> 
                  <p>"But he saw not the traveller-the guides?"</p> 
                  <p>"He saw the avalanche overwhelm all, and when the mercy of Heaven had preserved him from the fearful fate, he returned to this house, praised be the good God-no longer the captain of a robber band. You have heard the truth-haste to your brother!"</p> 
                  <p>"Francesca," returned Berthold, calmly, "What you say may be true. But my brother is in the hands of the law, accused of a double murder. Who will bear testimony to his innocence? Who will swear that the avalanche caused these deaths?"</p> 
                  <p>"My father beheld it."</p> 
                  <p>"But the Captain Tomaso dare not testify, even were the testimony of an outlaw admitted. Your father's life would be forfeit, should he venture within the village. Is it not so?"</p> 
                  <p>"It is true-too true!" murmured the brig! and's daughter. "But your brother-they will not, dare not condemn him-"</p> 
                  <p>"All things are against poor Valentine!" rejoined the dissembling Berthold. "I fear there is no hope of saving him!"</p> 
                  <p>"He <emph>shall</emph> be saved!" exclaimed Francesca. "O, Heaven is just, and will not permit the innocent to suffer! What says your brother to the charge?"</p> 
                  <p>"Alas, there is but his single word against all suspicions," answered the vinedresser. "It is in vain, I fear, to hope!"</p> 
                  <p>"Berthold!" suddenly exclaimed the maiden, who had been for some time regarding the demeanor of her lover with a scrutinizing look, "I fear me there is some wicked scheme at work against your brother. God will discover, if there be guilty ones who seek his death. But, hasten you, and say what you have heard. Speak of it as a rumor-as a dream, if you will! But bid the unjust villagers beware how they bear false accusations against the innocent! Hasten, and return hither to-morrow. Then I will speak more with you!"</p> 
                  <p>With these words, Francesca, bestowing no glance of affection upon him for whom she had the night before avowed her love, hastily closed the shutter, and Berthold the next instant heard the wooden bolt replaced in its socket. He lingered a moment, as in hesitation, and then, turning away, muttered savagely:</p> 
                  <p>"This girl thinks she may use me as a puppet. She is repentant, too, forsooth-the brigand's daughter! But Valentine! How shall his innocence be made to appear? Not through my means, or may the fiend seize us both!"</p> 
                  <p>Striding back toward Val d'Orazio, the gloomy vinedresser thus gave utterance to his evil thoughts.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">PADRE AMBROSIO'S VISITOR.</head> 
                  <p>GREAT was the sensation awakened in Val d'Orazio, and indeed through all the valley districts, when the rumored-murder of the guide, Nicolo, and a traveller in his company, by the son of Monna Barbara, became known. The old guide's long residence in this region, his many virtues and spotless character, had rendered him much beloved, and his sudden fate was deeply deplored by old and young. Of course, in proportion to the praises and regrets uttered regarding the dead, the maledictions pronounced upon the unhappy young man, who was charged with his assassination, were not few nor feeble. Indeed, before a day had elapsed after the arrest of Valentine, the swift tongues of evil report had coupled his name with all that could be imagined hostile to man and God. He was magnified into a demon by those who had never heard his name before, and even his youthful friends in the village, who had always professed friendship for him at the merry meetings and fairs, now scrupled not to talk of the "bad blood" which could not but be expected in the son of one so well known for her evil practices as the witch-woman, who gathered herbs at midnight, wherewith, doubtless, to concoct poison for the whole valley.</p> 
                  <p>Thus poor Monna Barbara's supernatural reputation began to receive new <foreign xml:lang="FRA">eclat,</foreign> and even her elder son, Berthold, though he had so well acted his part at the examination of Nicolo's body, came in for a share of the suspicions and abuse of the more ignorant peasantry, many of whom, indeed, remembered his strong arm and stout cudgel that had in former time been somewhat too familiar with the rabble assailants of his mother; but Berthold's demeanor on the arrest of his brother was so subdued and law-abiding, and his struggle between natural feeling and stern duty so apparent and meritorious in a young man, that the good padre and leading men of Val d'Orazio threw the sacred mantle of their official countenance over the vine-dresser, and he walked abroad without a stain.</p> 
                  <p>In the meantime Valentine had been removed from the cottage of Nicolo, after being obliged to confront the cold body, and laying his hand upon its bosom to solemnly protest his innocence,-at which ceremony, on the present occasion, much to the astonishment of the gaping peasants, no new efflux of blood took place from the wounded side,-and conveyed, under strong guard, to the cellar of the priest's house, which being the oldest and strongest stone building in the hamlet, was chosen as a proper place of confinement for so dangerous a criminal. Here he was safely immured, still tightly bound with cords, after being adjured by the padre to turn his meditations to the author of heavenly mercy, as it was more than probable that the dispensers of justice in his case would not be likely to take earthly mercy into account. This was good advice, doubtless, on the part of the priest, but Valentine, in the state of mind which the consciousness of his own guiltlessness, joined with the cruel accusations against him, had thrown him, was little likely to profit by it. Nevertheless, in volunteering such counsel, the padre deemed himself acquitted of his immediate duty; so, bestowing his benediction upon the two mountaineers who had been deputed as a guard over the criminal, outside the cellar, our worthy village priest proceeded to the more comfortable upper portion of his snug little parsonage.</p> 
                  <p>The good pastor was a little man, with short, thick limbs and portly frontal proportions. His round head was set upon broad shoulders. His face, amply clothed with firm flesh, rubicund with health and good living, attested both the philosophy of its owner and the liberality of his parishioners. Altogether, Padre Ambrosio was a model village priest.</p> 
                  <p>He mounted with slow steps the few easy stairs that conducted to his "library,"-as he called it, though a very few books found place on shelf or table,-where a cheerful fire simmered cozily on the polished hearth; and there, as he ensconces himself in a large cushioned chair, we will leave the worthy padre for a brief space, whilst we recount the incidents which had just awakened suspicion as to the guilt of our unhappy friend Valentine, in the cellar beneath.</p> 
                  <p>It will be recollected that the lover of Bianca had parted from the young maiden in the early morning, with the intention of proceeding to the priest's house, to acquaint him with the sudden fate of his old parishioner; but on leaving Nicolo's cottage, the youth had just directed his steps towards his own home, where he found Berthold just arisen, and Monna Barbara engaged in preparing the morning repast. Almost the first rejoinder of the elder brother to the sad intelligence brought by Valentine, was a rough denial of belief in its truth, and an intimation that the youth had dealt foully with the old guide. An altercation, in the angry style which Berthold's brutality generally provoked, followed immediately, in the height of which several villagers, passing the cottage, were attracted to overhear the quarrel. Their appearance only gave looser rein to Berthold's wicked temper, and redoubling his accusations, he called on Monna Barbara to bear witness to the threat which Valentine had uttered the night before in reply to Nicolo's slighting rebuke of the youth's pretensions to Bianca's favor. The unhappy mother was forced by the villagers to reply, and so deep an impression was made upon the minds of the latter that they resolved at once to detain the younger brother a prisoner for examination by the padre and magistrate. Valentine readily surrendered himself into the hands of two mountaineers, who volunteered to guard him till the padre could be sent for; and leaving these with their charge in the hut, the rest of the party repaired at once to the cottage of Nicolo. The scene which there took place is known to the reader, so by his leave we will return to the library in which we left the village priest.</p> 
                  <p>For some minutes after depositing his portly figure in the arm-chair, the padre remained alone, until a knock at the door of the apartment interrupted whatever reveries he might be disposed to indulge in. In answer to his summons to enter, the door was softly unclosed, presenting the figure of a good-featured little woman, who exercised in his bachelor establishment the triple vocation of cook, porter, and <foreign xml:lang="ITA">casiera,</foreign> or housekeeper.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, Veronica, what is wanted with me?"</p> 
                  <p>"A strange lad at the gate is begging hard to see your reverence," replied the casiera. "I bade him come when your reverence had dined, for the virgin knows, not a morsel has your reverence had since morning; but the youth was so pleading that-"</p> 
                  <p>"Well, well, good Veronica, I suppose we must admit the lad." So said the priest, desirous of interrupting the housekeeper's garrulity. "But I thought no youth in the village was unknown to thee, Veronica?"</p> 
                  <p>"Your reverence speaks truth; but this lad is no villager-nor has he a look like any that I know," uttered Veronica, with a puzzled expression upon her countenance.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, we may soon know his errand-therefore admit him at once."</p> 
                  <p>The casiera departed, and in a few seconds re-appeared in company with a graceful figure, whose light footsteps scarcely sounded as they approached. His face was much shaded by a mountaineer's felt hat, which slouched upon a finely turned shoulder, half exposed, by the shifting of a cloak, in which the youth was wrapped, somewhat back from his compact frame, that was attired in a jerkin of embroidered<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6326-00000022"/> dered velvet. The good padre half arose from his arm-chair, so dignified, yet easy, was his visitor's demeanor, as the housekeeper ushered him into the apartment, and then at a glance from her master, respectfully retired, closing the door behind her.</p> 
                  <p>"My son, what is thy errand with me?"</p> 
                  <p>For a moment after this question, the stranger remained standing in the middle of the room, as if undecided what reply to make to the mild interrogation of the priest. Then, apparently with a sudden impulse, he drew near and knelt at the padre's feet, saying at the same instant, in a voice of remarkable sweetness:</p> 
                  <p>"Father, I have a secret to reveal."</p> 
                  <p>"Wouldst thou be shriven, my son? If so, the confessional were more fitting place."</p> 
                  <p>"Not that-not now," returned the youth, hurriedly. "Tell me, holy sir, is there a young man in this village accused of a terrible crime of murder?"</p> 
                  <p>"Truly, there is, my son. One who, till now, has been in good repute among his fellows; but the crafty are discovered at the last, and-"</p> 
                  <p>"He is innocent-this young man! He has committed no crime!" interrupted the visitor, in a quick rejoinder.</p> 
                  <p>"What wouldst thou say, my son? No crime! Who then did slay the worthy guide, Nicolo, that last night was full of life as myself? And the stranger who trusted the unhappy youth-"</p> 
                  <p>"Father, they were not murdered-it was the avalanche which overwhelmed them."</p> 
                  <p>"Nay, my son, that is but the assertion of the accused, supported by no testimony. But the avalanche could not have dealt a murderous stab at poor Nicolo's breast-nor left the traveller's rich garments in the youth's hands-nor miraculously spared <emph>him</emph> alone of all the three."</p> 
                  <p>"Alas! alas! father, if you would hear the truth!"</p> 
                  <p>"Speak, then, my son! Gladly would I listen to aught that might cast a shadow of doubt upon the young man's guilt."</p> 
                  <p>"O, I entreat you, believe me!" cried the strange youth. "Last night there were more human beings hurried to eternity than those you deem murdered. Last night, a band of outlawed men descended to the Huguenots' Altar, from the mountains, to rob the traveller of whom you speak. Following closely upon their destined victims, they shared his sudden fate-all were overwhelmed by the fearful avalanche!"</p> 
                  <p>"What tale is this, my son?"</p> 
                  <p>"But one escaped-the leader of the outlawed men, who, snatched from death by the mercy of Heaven, beheld his companions swept to their awful doom. He, moreover, saw the traveller and the two guides buried likewise in the dreadful snows."</p> 
                  <p>"Who is this man? Let him come hither."</p> 
                  <p>"Alas! he is outlawed-a robber!" cried the youth, sinking his head upon his breast. "He dare not enter a village lest the laws should claim him!"</p> 
                  <p>"To what am I listening?" exclaimed the padre, hastily rising from his seat, leaving his suppliant kneeling upon the floor. "This is doubtless some idle story. What! is not the deadly wound sufficient? And did not the vine-dresser-did not his own brother first proclaim the youth's guilt?"</p> 
                  <p>"Berthold?" asked the visitor, hurriedly.</p> 
                  <p>"Ay, Berthold, brother to the accused-the first to give information of the wretched young man's threats against Nicolo's life but a few hours previous to the deed."</p> 
                  <p>"It is not so! No, no, it surely cannot be," cried the stranger, rising quickly to his feet. "Berthold could not act so wickedly-he would not do so foul a thing. Father! father!" he continued in great agitation, following the padre, who had moved across the room, "I pray you, condemn not the innocent! I swear to you, on my eternal soul, and as we shall both meet at the judgment seat, that what I have said is true, that the avalanche was alone the cause of death last night-the avalanche that spared but my father's life!"</p> 
                  <p>"Thy father, my son! Who, then, art thou?" cried the priest, suddenly grasping the youth's hand, and drawing him nearer to himself. The action caused the slouched mountain hat, which the visitor had not removed since its entrance, to fall on one side, and the lad made a sudden movement to replace it over his forehead; but the padre said instantly, on remarking for the first time the rudeness: "Remove thy covering, youth. Is this meet respect for me?"</p> 
                  <p>The visitor made a hasty motion to obey, and lifted the hat from his head; but in doing so, he exposed beneath the thick curls which shaded his entire brow, a long braid of hair that had become disengaged, and now fell low upon his shoulders. Padre Ambrosio's placid face grew very dark.</p> 
                  <p>"What mummery is this?" he cried, sternly.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"O, forgive, forgive, holy father!" exclaimed the youth, sinking prostrate upon the floor, and permitting the false locks that had concealed the braided hair beneath, to fall entirely off, disclosing the beautiful face of Francesca, the brigand's daughter.</p> 
                  <p>Padre Ambrosio started back a pace, and letting drop the maiden's hand, regarded her with a look of mingled, surprise and alarm. Possibly, the good priest imagined for a moment that the evil one was assailing him in the guise of that dangerous temptation-a lovely woman. But it was only for an instant that he looked upon her in doubt, for as she lifted to his own a countenance full of deep grief, but with a holy purity in every lineament, while the pleading expression of her look attested the earnest truth which animated her heart, the worthy father felt a strong feeling of pity awakening in his breast mingled with a desire to penetrate the mystery of both her appearance and her errand. Long as he had exercised in that quiet valley the gentle duties of his pastor's office, and intimately as he was acquainted with the peasantry for many leagues around, he remembered not to have beheld any face resembling that now raised so devoutly to his own; and he judged at once that there was much in the young girl's situation that demanded the sympathy, perhaps the assistance, of one in his position. Nevertheless, the padre was not a man to lend too credulous an attention to appearances alone, and therefore a degree of caution was mixed with the tenderness of his reply to the passionate adjuration that had been uttered by the discovered female.</p> 
                  <p>"I fear me, daughter," he said, in a low voice, "that the thoughtlessness of an earthly love has prompted thee to this imprudent step. Who, and what thou art, and why the interest thou showest in the fate of him who is accused of grievous crime, must be revealed to me, as to one who claims the right of knowing the sorrows of those who seek relief at his hands. If thou hast erred, daughter, but mock me not; if love for man has made thee forget the modesty of thy sex, and urged thee to attempt deception, put forth now, I charge thee, in a servant of God, and open thy heart to me, albeit it be false and sinful."</p> 
                  <p>Thus adjuring her, the padre took both the hands of Francesca within his own, and gazed with a benign look into her face. Tears gushed at once from the maiden's eyes, tears that relieved her overcharged feelings. She bowed her forehead upon the priest's hands as he resumed his seat in the arm-chair, and then commenced a recital of events and experiences in the past, such as she had never before poured forth to any living being. Broken by many sobs, but listened to with close attention by the padre, whose features, as the confession proceeded, exhibited a multitude of emotions, the story of Francesca, the brigand's child, from her infancy to the dread night just passed, went on till the early shadows of a winter's eve began to darken in the room, and the fire which had been brightly burning died out upon the hearth.</p> 
                  <p>And when that strange relation was over, and Francesca's voice no longer audible, the good father, reverently raising his eyes to Heaven, murmured a short but earnest prayer, and then, after laying his hands solemnly upon the maiden's head, arose from his chair, and going to the door, called quickly to Veronica, bidding her hasten and bring to him his heavy cloak and staff. And in an hour afterwards, Padre Ambrosio and the seeming youth had passed through the little hamlet of Val d'Orazio, and were wending together the lonesome mule-path, leading to the osteria of Baceo and Brigita.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">REPENTANCE.</head> 
                  <p>A WONDERFUL alteration had taken place in the looks and feelings of <foreign xml:lang="ITA">Il capitano Tomaso,</foreign> whilome surnamed Spaventevole, or the "The Terrible." Whether the spectacle of his comrades hurled so swiftly and unready into eternity, and the subsequent night of suffering which he had passed, had been powerful to uproot the deep-grown evil of his past associations, or whether this sudden change was but the result of years of potent effort on the part of his daughter, during which many gentle influences, persuasions and prayers had been apparently wasted by Francesca, but now seemed crowned with blessed success at the last; or whether, indeed, it was not both these causes combined which stirred the long-dormant better heart of the brigand, and laid it open to the merciful entrance of the "dove which beareth healing on its wings," need not be sought out by the reader; suffice it that the man was now broken in spirit, and imbued with the contriteness that presages true repentance.</p> 
                  <p>The mental affliction of Tomaso had been severe, and its traces were strongly marked in his haggard cheeks and sunken eyes; but, nevertheless, the wildness of look were no longer visible, and his mouth exhibited not the muscular tension that had before united its hard corners.</p> 
                  <p>Beside his bed knelt the Padre Ambrosio, his hands clasped, while with closed eyes, he repeated fervently the prayers of the church. At a little distance, Francesca, likewise now kneeling, joining with her low-toned voice in the response of the priest which implored mercy upon sinful humanity. She had removed the disguise in which she had visited the priest's house, and now appeared in her own neat attire.</p> 
                  <p>Tomaso's lips moved, but without sound, in concert with the padre's supplications. The brigand lay upon his back, his fingers joined over his breast, grasping firmly the ivory crucifix that had depended at the head of the couch. A smile of hope was blent in his features with the shadow of remorseful thought, as he recollected the ruined lifetime he had passed.</p> 
                  <p>Thus the good padre knelt and prayed, and the repentant robber listened, and his daughter united her soul in deep devotion, when the door of the apartment was rudely opened, and another figure appeared upon the threshold. It was that of Bacco, the innkeeper, just awakened from a stupor in which he had been plunged during the entire day, the effect of enormous potations of strong wine that he had drank on receiving intelligence of the sudden fate which had overtaken his sons. The ostinello's usually sluggish face presented now a dark and threatening expression, as it protruded into the room, whilst, clinging with one hand to the door, he steadied his reeling frame, almost falling from intoxication-for though the brutal sensibility of the man had returned, he was still under the influence of the poison which had overpowered him. He had evidently been aroused to recollection but a short time since, and stimulated by some uncertain evil purpose, had staggered to the apartment of Tomaso, without knowledge of the padre's presence or the scene that was transpiring.</p> 
                  <p>This apartment was one occupied, during many years, by the girl, Francesca, who there remained in retirement and comparative security, while her father, with his band, carried on their trade of rapine, making their dwelling in secret caverns far away in the fastnesses of the mountains. The osteria, seldom the resort of honest travellers,-inasmuch as the near neighborhood of Val d'Orazio obviated any necessity for such persons to stay their journey in so lonely a spot,-was used by the brigands of the hill, with whom Bacco and his family were leagued, as a place of rendezvous prior to or succeeding the marauding expeditions, whilst the different classes of smugglers who travelled the mule-path and its many intersecting defiles, in pursuance of their vocation, looked upon the secluded tavern, to whose suspicious character they were no strangers, as a snug resting-place, at all times, and often a safe shelter for themselves and goods, during the violent tempests that sometimes continued for days to rage furiously in the rocky passes.</p> 
                  <p>Francesca, protected by her father's influence and authority among his wild associates, had been accustomed to consider the inn of Bacco as her home, since much of her existence from childhood had been passed in the neighborhood, and of late years she had resided wholly within its walls, sometimes assisting the dame Brigita in her domestic efforts, sometimes occupying herself in embroidering her father's clothes, or adorning with the needle her own simple garb, but oftener absenting herself from the hostel, to wander in the most inaccessible portion of the hills, seeking some lonely cove, or silent nook, where for hours she might dream and sorrow, unseen by mortal eye. For one dark cloud hung evermore over the maiden's heart-the thought of her beloved father's lawless career, mingled with the memory of a solemn vow which, when yet a child, she had made on recovering from an almost fatal sickness. This was to endeavor by every means to wean her outlawed parent from his wild habits of life, and direct his footsteps to the paths of peace and honor.</p> 
                  <p>For years Francesca had devoted herself to the good work, but seldom with a promise of success-for Tomaso was growing daily older in life and crime, and habits had become with him indeed a second nature. Nevertheless, often as he contemplated or returned from his frequent expeditions, the maiden sought, by gentlest words and tenderest entreaties, to turn his feelings in the direction of her own, to make him sensible of all that he might accomplish and enjoy in nobler pursuits, and to gain his promise of a change ere yet it should be too late.</p> 
                  <p>But until now her efforts had been fruitless, opposed as they had ever been by the influence of old associations and her father's daily intercourse with the outlawed men who called him leader. With these wild beings, Francesca shrank from intercourse, and they stood in too much awe of their captain ever to attempt unbidden familiarity. One person alone of those who visited the osteria, had the maiden ever looked with a feeling akin to that which she bore her father-this person was the vine-dresser, Berthold.</p> 
                  <p>Berthold had, a year previous to the time of which we write, encountered Francesca in one of her lonely wanderings, on an occasion when, seeking shelter from a sudden storm, she had missed her way in a labyrinth of rocky defile far in the mountain's bosom. The young man, albeit his moody nature was seldom attracted by female beauty, could not but be struck with the grace and loveliness of the strange maiden, who, as he well knew, was no dweller in the neighboring Val d'Orazio. He conducted her safely to the osteria of the mule-path where he had often before been a transient caller, in his mountain excursions; and it was not long before, after several succeeding visits, he began to awaken a tender interest in Francesca's breast, which he returned as strongly as his rude nature was capable of doing. Some months, however, elapsed before Berthold became aware of the relation in which the young girl stood to Tomaso, whose profession he very well knew; and when he did learn the fact, it was only to avail himself of it by soon instituting a close connection between himself and the brigand captain, in which, probably actuated by a share of the plunder,-but, to do him justice, still more by his affection for Francesca,-the vine-dresser took upon himself the part of a decoy or spy, to<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6326-00000024"/> give information to the robbers of such travellers as passing through the Alpine districts, might offer to these lawless men an opportunity of sudden assault and pillage.</p> 
                  <p>Strong as was the love which had begun to develop itself in the passionate nature of Francesca, it received a sudden shock when she became aware of the dishonorable office Berthold had accepted. Her first impulse was to banish him at once from her presence, even though her heart should break in the effort; but when the vine-dresser, with words of earnest devotion, declared to her that nought but his love for her inspired him, that he might gain her father's favor, and an opportunity for more frequent interviews, the woman's heart of his hearer almost forgot its better instincts, and she half pardoned Berthold even while she condemned. But, alas! subsequent incidents began slowly to disclose before the maiden's purer vision, much in the character of him she loved to fill her with the saddest forebodings. Violence, selfishness and malignity began at times to thrust their serpent-heads out from the rosy garland with which her trusting fancy had crowned the forehead of her lover. The affection which she could not check became a pain instead of a joy, and she had reached a state of mind when she dreaded, whilst anxiously looking for, each interview with the vine-dresser, when that terrible event that ended forever her father's connection with his robber band, terminated likewise in Francesca, the struggle of her duty with her feelings.</p> 
                  <p>Therefore, if since her return with Padre Ambrosio, the thought of Berthold mingled with her prayers, it was in supplication that the God who protected <emph>her</emph> would mercifully change the heart of him she had loved, and would give her meanwhile strength to bear the wreek of all her earthly hopes, and to devote herself henceforth to the saving of her father's soul. Therefore she implored of Divine Goodness a fortitude that would enable her to wrest for this sacred purpose, all earthly passion from her heart.</p> 
                  <p>But while the maiden thus prayed, the fierce eyes of Bacco glared upon her from the threshold, and a hoarse oath broke from the innkeeper's lips, as his drunken senses became half aware of the unusual exercises that engrossed her attention.</p> 
                  <p>"Ho! ho!" laughed the ruffian, savagely, staggering forward a pace. "Captain Tomaso, bold comrade, what dost thou with the priest? Pretty Francesca, where got ye this shaven-head for a lover?"</p> 
                  <p>The brigand's daughter shrank fearfully from the innkeeper's brutal gaze encountering her startled look, and the captain himself half started from his pillow, a gleam of the old light darting from his eyes; but Padre Ambrosio, casting but a glance at the intruder, reclosed his eyes, and pressing his clasped hands against those of Tomaso, in gentle rebuke, continued in a louder tone than he had before used to pour forth his prayer for the repentant man. The solemn litany proceeded, the priest's voice filling the apartment, the maiden's low but distinct accents uttering the fervent responses.</p> 
                  <p>It was a singular scene, as disclosed in the light of a single lamp which cast its faint rays upon the pale features of Tomaso, the quiet countenance of the priest, and Francesca's beautiful though agitated face. It was strange to hear those clear-toned orisons arising, to behold the kneeling figures, the remorseful man of crime clasping his ivory crucifix, and then to mark the rough form of the <foreign xml:lang="ITA">oste</foreign> Bacco, his stolid lineaments lit with a dubious expression of mingled fierceness, fear and hesitation. Such a picture might Salvator have sketched to inspire after ages with strange speculations as to its mysterious significance.</p> 
                  <p>"What, ho! Tomaso!"</p> 
                  <p>No answer returned the innkeeper's hoarse exclamation. The prayer still went on-the priest took no note of the interruption.</p> 
                  <p>"I'll have no preaching in my house!-dost hear me, girl?" cried the ruffian, with another oath; and reeling forward he grasped roughly the shoulder of Francesca.</p> 
                  <p>Tomaso at this movement, which he was the first to behold, strove to raise himself, but was pressed back by the priest's hand.</p> 
                  <p>"My son, compose thyself!" whispered the unmoved padre, and then slowly turning his head, he fixed his gaze upon the innkeeper. Bacco seemed about to speak again; but the priest rising calmly, took from the captain's hand the crucifix, and lifted it suddenly above his head.</p> 
                  <p>"Wretched man!" spoke the padre, in a tone of sternness, before which the drunken Bacco appeared to recoil at once, "wouldst thou insult thy God?"</p> 
                  <p>Saying this, he advanced towards the innkeeper, still elevating the sacred emblem on which the awful scene of Christ's martyrdom was carved in the white ivory.</p> 
                  <p>Bacco's sodden intellect, brutalized by intoxication cation, was no proof against the severe look and stern voice of Padre Ambrosio. At once all the terrors of the church which, brigand and sinner as he was, he yet, in common with his countrymen, invested with awful powers, seemed arrayed against him. The words of the priest, as the latter lifted the cross, alarmed the superstition of his nature. He shrieked rather than cried out, at the same instant sinking on his knees, and trembling throughout his massive frame:</p> 
                  <p>"Pardon! pardon! holy father!"</p> 
                  <p>"Rather should I pronounce <foreign xml:lang="GRC">anathema</foreign> upon thee, child of perdition!" returned the priest, perceiving the terror which his words had created; "rather should I curse thee, who comest hither to disturb the sacrament of God!-the confession of a repentant sinner. Hence! avaunt! ere the malediction of the church be hurled against thee!"</p> 
                  <p>The padre fixed his unmoving gaze upon the wretched innkeeper, who quailed before its intensity, and grovelling for a moment at the feet of his rebuker, turned away and dragged himself to the door and over the threshold.</p> 
                  <p>"Remain thou there!" then said the priest, "whilst I implore pardon for thy crime!"</p> 
                  <p>Bacco, now appearing to have recovered in a measure from his drunken insanity, obeyed the stern command like a child who dreads its parent's wrath. Padre Ambrosio then kneeling in the middle of the apartment, between the crouching innkeeper and Francesca, resumed his prayer to Heaven, mingling with his appeal in behalf of Tomaso, a supplication for the wretched man who had just been stricken like a weed to the earth-an evidence of the mysterious power and authority wielded by that church of which the village pastor was but the humblest instrument.</p> 
                  <p>The prayer concluded, and absolution extended to the repentant Tomaso, Padre Ambrosio rose to depart from the osteria, not however before Bacco had humbly entreated him to offer prayers for the repose of his two sons, swept to a terrible fate by the last night's catastrophe. The priest, with a few words of solemn warning to the man himself, promised his intercessions, and then taking leave of Francesca, prepared for his homeward walk.</p> 
                  <p>And as the good padre took his way from the lonely hostel, and ascended the mule-path towards the rude bridge leading to Val d'Orazio, he murmured to himself in a low voice:</p> 
                  <p>"This innocent youth must not be sacrificed! It is all true which the maiden spoke, and the young man must be saved."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE TOWN BURGESS-THE FLIGHT.</head> 
                  <p>THE Padre Ambrosio ascended with very cautious steps the abrupt curve in the mule-path which led from the chasm; and as he gained the top, encountered a man advancing from the village quarter. The features of this person were not distinguishable, as he walked somewhat in the shadow of the rocks, where the moonlight which now illumined the road did not fall; and the priest was about to pass him with a "benedicite," when the other, stopping short, pronounced his name.</p> 
                  <p>"Ah! is it thee, Berthold? Thou art late in the mountains, my son; but I have good news for thee. Thy brother, the lad Valentine, is not guilty, as we deemed him."</p> 
                  <p>The padre could not note the displeased expression that immediately darkened the vine-dresser's visage; but he marvelled that no exclamation of astonishment or joy followed his announcement.</p> 
                  <p>"Dost hear, my son? Thy brother, I may in verity disclose, is innocent of the charge which, as rash men, not knowing Heaven's purposes, we have preferred against him."</p> 
                  <p>"And how does this good intelligence, come, reverend father?"</p> 
                  <p>"Let it suffice thee, worthy Berthold, that it shall save thy poor brother's life. Come with me at once that we may speak to <foreign xml:lang="ITA">il Borghigiano.</foreign> Let us lose no time, for in truth the day has been a weary one to me, and I long for the evening's rest."</p> 
                  <p>The house of <foreign xml:lang="ITA">il Borghigiano,</foreign> the burgess, was situated near the middle of the village, on the road leading to Padre Ambrosio's own residence. It was not long before they reached it, and were ushered into the magistrate's presence.</p> 
                  <p>
                     <foreign xml:lang="ITA">Il Borghigiano</foreign> was enjoying his pipe, and an odoriferous atmosphere filled the room in which the visitors found him. The good priest at once opened his business by requesting the private ear of the town burgess. Signore Leoni, as the magistrate was called, led the way at once to a small closet, opening from the apartment, and thither the padre followed him, leaving Berthold to await the result of their council.</p> 
                  <p>The vine-dresser's countenance, during his short walk in company with the priest, could it have been seen by the latter, would have satisfied him that the declaration of Valentine's innocence was not quite so palatable to the elder brother as consanguinity might seem to demand. The sullen frown, habitual to him, deepened on the young man's brow, and his mouth, that best index of the human feelings, wore a vexed and alarmed expression.</p> 
                  <p>Though Padre Ambrosio gave him no further information in reference to the cause of so sudden den a recantation of belief in Valentine's guilt, he could not help suspecting from Francesca's words at midday regarding his brother, and from the fact of his encountering the priest upon the mule-path, that the daughter of Tomaso had been instrumental in changing the latter's convictions. The reflection was bitter to him, as it not only awoke a suspicion of a decrease in Francesca's affection for himself, but a fear lest the priest's scrutiny might bring to light his own nefarious connection with the late band of brigands. However, with characteristic caution, he had allowed nought to escape him that might reveal his secret reflections, and now awaited the padre's entrance with a countenance apparently undisturbed, for the youth was suspicious that in a magistrate's dwelling there might be eyes observing his, demeanor which his own glance did not discover.</p> 
                  <p>The interview of Padre Ambrosio with his friend and parishioner, Signore Leoni, the burgess, did not last long; but apparently it was quite satisfactory to the priest, whose features, when the two appeared, wore a look as if a burden had been lifted from his mind. He nodded to Berthold encouragingly, and said:</p> 
                  <p>"My son, the good Signore Leoni is pleased to signify that thy brother Valentine shall be set at liberty."</p> 
                  <p>"Alas! reverend sir," returned the vine-dresser, hesitatingly, "my poor brother is, doubtless, as you say, innocent of the crime imputed to him; but the villagers, I fear, are much excited against him, and will refuse to believe the truth."</p> 
                  <p>"Let them refuse!" cried the burgess, warmly. "Shall an innocent young man be sacrificed to their injustice? Our reverend father, Ambrosio, has revealed enough to satisfy me that the deaths of last night were Heaven's will and direct act; and through no agency of man; and therefore I say the youth Valentine shall go free!"</p> 
                  <p>"But the peasants may seek his life if he is liberated?"</p> 
                  <p>The magistrate regarded Berthold with a searching look, as if he suspected that some sinister motive lurked behind the brother's seeming solicitude; but good Padre Ambrosio appeared to consider the vine-dresser's suggestion as of some importance.</p> 
                  <p>"It is very true," he said;" the village people, more especially old friends of Nicolo, are exceeding wroth against the accused, and it will be difficult to satisfy them of his innocence, save by explaining more than we are at liberty to do. Therefore, Signore Leoni, we must devise some means of protection for the youth against private violence, else, indeed, it would be no mercy to set him free."</p> 
                  <p>"If my poor brother might be sent away from the valley," suggested Berthold, "until such time as Nicolo's death is-"</p> 
                  <p>"That may very well be done," rejoined the burgess, quickly. "Let it be even so, and charge thyself with the business. As brother of the youth, thou art the most interested, so be it thy care to conduct him from the prison whithersoever his safety shall require; and let this suffice for thy authority and protection hereafter, should thy acts be questioned!"</p> 
                  <p>So saying, Signore Leoni hastily wrote on a scrap of paper, an order for the delivery of Valentine by the mountaineers in whose custody he had been placed, and then resuming his pipe, recommenced the emission of spiral clouds of smoke. Padre Ambrosio, on his part, settled his heavy cloak about his shoulders, grasped his staff, and took leave of the magistrate, after thanking him warmly, and bestowing his customary blessing. Then, followed by Berthold, the priest set his face once more towards his own snug home, where the anxious Veronica awaited him, carefully attending the bountiful supper, long since prepared in expectation of her master's coming.</p> 
                  <p>On this good supper, for which, truly, his exertions had provided a fitting appetite, the padre's mind dwelt as he proceeded, while that of Berthold pondered only on the hatred which he bore his brother, and the surest means that he could adopt to render the flight of Valentine from Val d'Orazio one from which he would not soon return.</p> 
                  <p>When Valentine, accused of the murder of one whose existence, as connected with the happiness of Bianca, had been dear to him as his own, found himself immured in the cellar-prison of Padre Ambrosio's house, with a feeling that in spite of his entire innocence of the charges against him, many circumstances conspired to render these of no trivial importance, he was disposed at first to arraign in bitter terms the justice of man and Heaven, and then, in the conviction of his own helplessness, to give way to a despairing apathy. But his reflections after a brief space assumed a more resigned character, and hope, which is ever bright in<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6326-00000026"/> youthful bosoms, began to whisper that some happy event would change the appearances now so strongly against him, and return him to liberty and the respect of his fellow-men.</p> 
                  <p>But as the long hours passed, and night came, shutting him in darkly, his meditations again became sombre and despondent. He began to dread that fate was about to involve him in one of those fearful webs of suspicion, which often defy all the efforts of innocence to escape their entangling folds, and that perchance a conspiracy, the cause or agency of which he knew nothing, would ultimately render futile all his expectations of rescue.</p> 
                  <p>Such reflections tortured the unhappy youth's mind, as he threw himself at length upon a rude pallet in a corner of his dungeon, in the faint hope that sleep might come to him with its happy forgetfulness; but at this moment, the unclosing of doors aroused him, and the padre entered, accompanied by his brother Berthold. Valentine arose in astonishment at the priest's first words:</p> 
                  <p>"My poor son, thy sufferings are ended! I have come to bid thee depart in peace!"</p> 
                  <p>"Father, what do I hear? My innocence, then, is established! Heaven be thanked!"</p> 
                  <p>"Follow thy worthy brother, my son. He will conduct thee to safety. But first, receive my blessing, and go on thy way in hope, for I will pray to Heaven that thy steps may be guided away from the paths of danger."</p> 
                  <p>Padre Ambrosio as he said this, extended his hands, and Valentine, kneeling in the obscurity of the cell, listened reverently to the benediction which the pastor pronounced in a fatherly tone.</p> 
                  <p>"Now follow thy brother, Valentine, and may the Lord have thee in his holy keeping!"</p> 
                  <p>The youth, bewildered at the suddenness of the event, could only murmur a word of gratitude, before Berthold had abruptly seized his hand, and led him from the prison and the padre's house out into the road, leading downwards through the hamlet. Here, pausing, the vine-dresser addressed his brother:</p> 
                  <p>"Valentine, there have been rash words between us heretofore. When last we parted, I believed you guilty of the death of Nicolo. Since then I am assured that my brother is innocent, and that our mother's gray hairs will not be dishonored. Valentine, we here part; but let us part as brethren, with pardon on our lips for whatever evil we may have sought against each other!"</p> 
                  <p>Berthold uttered this speech in a tone so subdued and apparently earnest, that his confiding brother was moved to tears. Clasping the hand which was extended to him, Valentine replied:</p> 
                  <p>"Brother, if I have sometimes rashly angered you, may Heaven witness, I never harbored evil purpose; but why, Berthold, must we here part? Am I not free?"</p> 
                  <p>"It is true you are free, but not to remain here, Valentine. <foreign xml:lang="ITA">Il Borghigiano</foreign> has released you, at my earnest prayers, joined with the good padre's request-and because, likewise, there is doubt in their minds regarding the justice of the charge against you; but it is on the condition that you leave at once this valley that this boon is granted."</p> 
                  <p>"What! and am I to fly from my accusers, and leave my memory blackened with false charges?" exclaimed Valentine.</p> 
                  <p>"By flying you give time for your friends to prove your innocence, while, remaining here, you may be to-morrow sacrificed to the bigotry of the churls who hate our mother and ourselves," replied the vine-dresser.</p> 
                  <p>"It is too true, Berthold-they hate us all," said Valentine, in a changed voice. "I will follow your counsel, and depart-perhaps forever!"</p> 
                  <p>Berthold's countenance exhibited a gleam of pleasure at his brother's despondent words; but he concealed his satisfaction, and rejoined:</p> 
                  <p>"Not forever, Valentine! This unhappy error of the villagers will soon, I trust, be corrected in some manner which we know not yet; so says the padre, at least."</p> 
                  <p>"Did the good priest speak thus?" asked Valentine, quickly. "Well, I will away; but I must first bid adieu to my mother."</p> 
                  <p>"Nay, Valentine, stay not even for that! Some loitering peasant may observe us, and betray your escape at once. My counsel is, that you depart immediately from the valley, by one of the mule-path passes. You have no time to lose, for safety lies not in Val d'Orazio."</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps you are right, brother," returned Valentine, sadly. "I will go, then, at once; but-"he hesitated, and turned away his head.</p> 
                  <p>"You would like to see Nicolo's niece," said Berthold, with something of his usual sneer. "You had better not, if you be wise enough to forget, and if you be not wise, you had still better not."</p> 
                   
                  <p>"What mean you, Berthold?"</p> 
                  <p>"Only what all the village knows well-that Bianca was loudest in her demands for your punishment, believing you guilty of the murder of-"</p> 
                  <p>"No, no! it is impossible! She cannot credit so monstrous a thing!"</p> 
                  <p>"Have your own opinion, brother! Nevertheless, I tell you Bianca hates you, and couples your name with that of assassin!"</p> 
                  <p>Berthold spoke in a calm tone, looking straight into his brother's face. Valentine remained silent a moment, his breast heaving with agitation, his countenance deathly pale. Then suddenly striking his forehead with one hand, he grasped his brother's in the other, and cried in a choked voice:</p> 
                  <p>"Farewell! God knows if it be forever! Pray our mother to remember me!"</p> 
                  <p>"Farewell, Valentine. Trust me, we will have justice done-"</p> 
                  <p>"I care not <emph>now</emph> for justice or mercy!" interrupted the unhappy youth. "Farewell, Berthold! I go-God only knows whither!"</p> 
                  <p>The next moment, Valentine had broken from his brother's side, and was rapidly moving towards one of the clinging rocks toward the mule-path. Berthold remained where they had stood together, and watched the retreating youth till his form was lost in the shadows of the cliffs. Then, turning towards his hut, he muttered, as he proceeded:</p> 
                  <p>"So much for the good lad's love-making. By San Giovane! he will put many a league between himself and Val d'Orazia, ere matin hours. It is just the turn that I wished-for, in truth, it somewhat disturbed my conscience to have a hand in the boy's death-guilty or innocent. Now, thanks to my good fortune, he is away in such mood as will give a thousand chances to one that he knocks his addled brains out before the month is gone! At any rate, he will return no more, since he believes his sweetheart to have forsaken him. Ho! ho! the coast is quite clear for me now. Neither foxy old uncle nor testy lover in the way. Bianca will soon, I wager, be quite as complaisant to the stout Berthold as to his sentimental brother."</p> 
                  <p>Thus the vine-dresser communed with himself, disclosing one at least of the dark motives that actuated his conduct. It was evident that the event which had just transpired, though it had removed Valentine from danger, was yet not displeasing to the plotting Berthold, since it now appeared that the latter's desire had been not so much to wreak immediate injury upon his brother's person, as to inflict a deeper wound in his affections, and at the same time leave the way open for the accomplishment of his own ulterior schemes. Therefore there was a gleam of malevolent satisfaction in his eyes, when he returned to the hut, as fixing their regards upon Monna Barbara, who awaited him, he said, in a triumphant tone:</p> 
                  <p>"We shall be no more troubled with your cub, "Valentine, thanks to our good luck, mother!"</p> 
                  <p>"What say you?" cried the old crone, starting up quickly from the dark nook, where she had been sitting. "Valentine! has aught more happened to him? O, Berthold! do they still deem him guilty?"</p> 
                  <p>"To be sure they do!" returned the vinedresser, sharply. "What has the fool done to clear himself? Think you the stripling's word is so good that it needs nought to purify it? Out, good mother! let the neck crack that can take no better care of itself!"</p> 
                  <p>Berthold spoke these words in his usual vein of sullenness, but evidently enjoying the pain which they inflicted upon the wretched mother. Monna Barbara replied not to them, but hiding her face in the dingy shawl that covered her shoulders, uttered a sobbing sound, as if choked with her feelings.</p> 
                  <p>In truth, the old woman, since her return home, after witnessing the awful scene of the morning, in Nicolo's hut, had done little but rock herself to and fro, sighing and moaning in unintelligible murmurs of grief. Berthold had cursed her several times, roughly ordering her to prepare his food, and she had mechanically obeyed the commands which she hardly comprehended; but when left alone in the hovel, on her son's departure, she seemed to take no heed of anything around her, but had continued her piteous lament till the night closed in, and hours of darkness passed ere the vine-dresser again made his appearance.</p> 
                  <p>But when the last cruel remarks of her elder son reached her ears, Monna Barbara seemed entirely broken down, and so violent in a few moments became her agitation, that the hardened Berthold grew alarmed. He roughly seized his mother's arm, and exclaimed:</p> 
                  <p>"Come, this is but baby play, mother! The lad's safe enough-so stop your whimpering for him!"</p>

                  <p>But Monna Barbara's paroxysm only increased.</p> 
                  <p>"Do you hear me, mother? I tell you Valentine has escaped-is free-is far away from the valley by this time."</p> 
                  <p>These words produced a sudden effect upon the crone. She uncovered her face, and fixed her inflamed eyes upon Berthold, who had now lighted a brand on the fireplace, which cast its gleams around the hovel.</p> 
                  <p>"What say you? Escaped! My Valentine escaped?"</p> 
                  <p>"<emph>Your</emph> Valentine has escaped-if that will satisfy you, good mother!" answered the sneering son. "Or, rather," he continued, with his customary duplicity, "I, his despised brother, was fool enough to liberate him."</p> 
                  <p>"You, Berthold!-you liberated Valentine?"</p> 
                  <p>"Even so, my very dear mother-out of regard for your favorite son, I risked my own neck to obtain the Signore Leoni's favor for the innocent boy!" answered the vine-dresser, with a bitter accent. "Look ye, if that be not something for a witch's cub to have obtained for the benefit of another cub."</p> 
                  <p>Saying this, Berthold showed to Monna Barbara the order which the town burgess had written for the release of Valentine.</p> 
                  <p>"And he is free-he is safe!"</p> 
                  <p>"Safe enough if he make good use of his heels, and leave the mule-path behind him a few leagues by daybreak. The passes on the other side are now swarming with French brigands, under the new Corsican general, and doubtless your Valentine will find friends among some of the cut-throat bands. O, he's safe enough, I doubt not, since the devil takes care of his own; but give me some wine, mother, before I talk more, for my throat is as dry as a soldier's biscuit."</p> 
                  <p>Monna Barbara shuffled to the cupboard, to produce therefrom the earthen bottle which contained the vine-dresser's drink, and then, anxious to learn more concerning the escape of Valentine, awaited patiently the moment when her coarse son should become somewhat more communicative-a result generally following indulgence in his cups.</p> 
                  <p>But Berthold, on this occasion, replied only in monosyllables to the questions which his mother, after a little delay, ventured to ask him, and Monna Barbara was able only to glean from him the bare intelligence of the manner in which Valentine had been freed, and of his subsequent departure by way of the mule-path through the neighboring mountains; after which the vine-dresser, yielding to drowsiness, subsided into a state of repose, attested, if such could attest the fact, by a succession of sonorous snores.</p> 
                  <p>Monna Barbara watched her unnatural son, as he gave himself up to sleep, with a look in which various emotions were apparent. Then she resumed her old position upon the low stool, her elbows resting on her knees, her face covered with her thin fingers. Thus she remained for many minutes.</p> 
                  <p>At last the crone began to exhibit a return of the emotions which had excited her so deeply on the previous night. Tears moistened her eyes, and seemed to soften her rugged spirit. She drew carefully from her bosom the cross of jet that she had found on the floor of the hut, where it had evidently been dropped by the stranger, whose sudden fate had involved her son in such imminent peril, and, first pressing it to her lips, gazed at it for a length of time with evident emotion. Then her aged countenance became lit with a new expression, as if in sudden resolution. She arose, glanced a moment at the sleeping Berthold, and then proceeded, with as much celerity as her feeble frame would admit of, to wrap herself in a thick, short cloak, of the kind used by the female peasants, and to bind about her head with a scanty shawl one of the rude felt hats worn indiscriminately by both sexes. Then taking from her dark nook a pair of snow-shoes, and a stout oaken staff, Monna Barbara stood for a moment in the middle of the hut, as if in doubt of her purpose.</p> 
                  <p>But her hesitation, if such it was, did not long continue. She gathered her coarse cloak tightly around her, grasped her staff with a firm hand, and then approaching the sleeping Berthold, lifted her eyes a moment, as if in mental supplication, then stooped feebly, and imprinted a kiss upon the vine-dresser's forehead-a kiss which, albeit so withered the lips that gave it, was yet sacred with the strong affection of a mother. The next moment Monna Barbara had disappeared from the hovel, and Berthold, still wrapped in stupor, remained its only inmate.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XV.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">BIANCA.</head> 
                  <p>MUCH the valley people marvelled, many were the murmurs, and not a few the threats, on the second morning following Nicolo's death, when it was discovered that the youth, suspected of being its cause, had disappeared from the village, leaving no traces of his flight. More astonishment still was created when the magistrate, Signore Leoni, openly declared that he had ordered the accused to be released; and the popular wonder was redoubled when, on the succeeding day, which was the Sabbath, Padre Ambrosio preached a funeral sermon over the old guide, in which he dwelt solemnly upon the event of the week, and asserted his knowledge of the young man's innocence, together with his conviction that to the avalanche alone was attributable the catastrophe. But when, in connection with this, the priest revealed the startling fact that Tomaso's robber-band had, by the same terrible agency, been annihilated, and that the bodies of a dozen brigands now lay wrapped in a winding sheet of snow, beneath the Huguenots' Altar, there to remain until the spring floods should melt the deep drifts around them, the good villagers began to believe that a special revelation from divine intelligence had been vouchsafed to their pastor, and that, as devout Catholic Christians, they were bound to look upon the escape of Valentine as the result of direct heavenly interposition.</p> 
                  <p>So the remains of Nicolo were quietly deposited in the little burial-place of Val d'Orazio, and the peasantry in a short time ceased to revert to his death, or to the flight of Valentine. Rumors and speculations concerning the latter, were indeed rife during a few weeks, but these gradually died away, and as the spring drew near, the valley inhabitants, preparing for the avocations which its coming rendered necessary, ceased to think of the events that had broken in upon the quiet of the winter months. No intelligence of the youth's fate ever reached Val d'Orazio, and if any conjecture concerning it was hazarded, it was to the effect that Valentine, escaped as he deemed from fatal danger, had leagued himself with one of the brigand-bands infesting the northern declivities of the extensive range of mountains.</p> 
                  <p>In Berthold, the vine dresser, however, it was remarked that a notable alteration had been effected, whether on account of the circumstances in which his brother had been involved, or from other causes. The young man, immediately after the funeral of Nicolo, appeared to change both in demeanor and character. He no longer seemed the morose and repellant being which the villagers had so long considered him. His looks become serious, without sullenness; he mingled often with the peasants, apparently seeking their good opinion; and he became,<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6326-00000028"/> moreover, a constant attendant of mass at the little chapel in which Padre Ambrosio officiated. It was commented upon by many as a marvellous occurrence, that the vine-dresser should present so great an improvement; but the wonder of all was excited when, in a short time, not only was Berthold, but the old Monna Barbara, beheld on the Sabbath mornings winding their way, with sober looks, to listen to the priest and join in his simple worship. What occasioned the apparent regeneration of Berthold, and how far it was genuine, will appear in the sequel of events.</p> 
                  <p>The spring-time began to advance through the more sheltered valleys, swift footed and laden with all good gifts. Flowers and fruitage came to adorn the hillsides, and the Easter festival was at hand which, after the long season of fasts, enjoined by the church, and more religiously observed in these districts than at the great capital of Rome, the youths and maids welcomed with glad anticipations.</p> 
                  <p>Nicolo had not left his grandchild destitute of the world's goods; for a life of frugality had enabled him to lay by a small store, designed at first for Bianca's marriage portion, but now (a sadder gift) become his funeral bequest. It was no great legacy, to be sure, but it sufficed for the maiden's ample wants, especially as, after the old guide's death, his sister Agata joined with it her little means, and removing from the neighboring valley, took up her abode in the cottage.</p> 
                  <p>Beneath the protection of her aunt, Bianca kept herself retired from the little village world. In vain the brisk young hunters and peasants, with their gaily embroidered jackets thrown jauntily over their shoulders, came often before the cottage gate, to ask of aunt Agata how fared that worthy dame's health, and-incidentally, of course-that of her lovely niece. In vain did many a bouquet of early blossoms, with more substantial gifts from mountaineer and villager, find their way to good Agata's hands, reminding her of the time when she herself was young and beautiful. But Bianca appeared regardless of all, remaining secluded in her aunt's society, never seen by the admiring youths, save when, on the Sabbath or saints' days, she slowly passed from her dwelling to the little chapel of the hills, holding closely to Agata's arm, and lifting not her eyes from the ground, save when she returned the salutations of her oldest friends.</p> 
                  <p>But, strange to say, among the latter, distinguished by a faint smile, or passing word, was one who certainly seemed the last person worthy of the maiden's notice-namely, the vine-dresser, Berthold, who seldom failed to be near the church door when Bianca approached, and was ever the first to offer her the holy water, as she passed modestly to her seat. Some persons averred that he was the favored one among all the youths who contested for her good graces; that she always greeted him with a smile when he presented himself, and that it was quite evident there was more between them than the world knew of. And, indeed, it appeared sufficiently mysterious that Bianca should regard the son of Monna Barbara with preference, considering the implication of his brother in the events connected with old Nicolo's death. "But," said the gossips, " there is no accounting for a woman!"</p> 
                  <p>The true reason of Bianca's favor was not, however, fathomed by the gossips-which reason was simply that the maiden believed Berthold to have loved his brother, and truly befriended him in assisting his escape. The vine-dresser had acquainted her of the fact that he had liberated Valentine, on the very night when that event took place, and thereafter Bianca, cherishing as she did an unchangeable affection for her lover, began to entertain a feeling of gratitude to his brother, which manifested itself on the few occasions when they met. It was ever with a thought of the exiled Valentine, and perchance with the faint hope that she might hear intelligence of him, that she so quickly raised her glance when Berthold greeted her, and thus appeared to distinguish him from the rest of her admirers.</p> 
                  <p>But Berthold-what thought he? We shall learn if we follow him from the church, after one of his brief interviews with Bianca, and accompany him to the place where we first encountered him-that is to the hut of Monna Barbara; but before doing this, it is necessary that we return for a space to the vine-dresser's much injured brother.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">AN ARMY IN THE ALPS.</head> 
                  <p>"QUI VIVE?" was the sudden and sharp demand of a sentinel who, at the entrance of a rough gorge, held his position as one of the long line of picquet guards-the outposts of a French army, occupying all the passes of the Alps which sloped toward the fertile plains of Lombardy. This was the grand body of troops, in three divisions, destined to become widely known as "The Army of Italy," now under conduct of General Bonaparte, who had been despatched by the Directory of France to assume the chief command.</p> 
                  <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Qui vive?</foreign>" was thus demanded by the diminutive Gallic sentinel of a man who had just abruptly presented himself within musket-range, apparently climbing from a narrow and precipitous footpath intersecting the main defile. The individual addressed responded by advancing a few paces, and holding out his hands to show that he was unarmed, save only with a common hunter's staff.</p> 
                  <p>"Amico!"</p> 
                  <p>"Advance with the word!"</p> 
                  <p>The last order was not replied to so readily as the first, for the reason that it seemed unintelligible to the Italian hunter-for such he appeared to be-who now stood plainly revealed amid the brownish twilight that pervaded the mountain passes. Nevertheless, the new comer continued to advance, until the sentinel, apprehending treachery, brought his musket to a level, and was about to press the trigger-in which event no further parley would have been ours to chronicle,-but at this moment the measured tramp of men was heard in the gorge, and a squad of the relief guard suddenly approached on its round to place the sunset watch. The sentinel seeing himself in presence of an officer, recovered his arms for the salute, and then pointing to the intruding Italian, who had halted and was leaning upon his staff, said to the corporal:</p> 
                  <p>"Whether you fellow means mischief, I know not; but he would have eaten a leaden supper in a trice, but for your coming. I was on the point of firing-"</p> 
                  <p>"To alarm the whole line, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">petit Jacques!</foreign>" replied the corporal. "Better is it, comrade, to deal quietly with these fellows, or we shall have such a devil's nest at our backs as will make the return to France as difficult as our march thus far."</p> 
                  <p>"Faith, the 'Little Corporal' has no intention of returning by this route, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">moitre Pierre.</foreign> Are we not to cross the Rhine, and bivouac in Vienna, and St. Genevieve only knows what else, without a biscuit in knapsack, or a son in pocket!" returned the soldier, who, small as were his physical dimensions, was yet a big-stomached<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6326-00000029"/> stomached fellow, who already began to show symptoms of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">vieux groguard,</foreign> or grumbler, a character which, in after times, the emperor made for himself a source of much amusement.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, no more now, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">petit Jacques.</foreign> Fall in, and let us be moving. And thou, fellow," continued the corporal, turning to the hunter, who had been silently regarding the group, and addressing him in the Savoyard patois, which is generally well understood throughout the Alps, "What is thy business? Wouldst join the grand army? Methinks a goodly youth as you appear, must want excitement, and-"</p> 
                  <p>"I desire no better than to cast my lot with such brave men," replied the hunter. "The French know how, to take care of themselves without kings, like my own countrymen, the Swiss, and I hope the Italians will soon learn the lesson!"</p> 
                  <p>"Bravo!-well said, my Swiss comrade; and as you are willing to join the grand army which is to give liberty to all nations, and make all of us rich as lords, be so good as to fall in at once, and we shall shortly be as firm friends, I doubt not, as if we had made the campaign together. March!"</p> 
                  <p>So saying the corporal led the way along the gorge, and the "Little Jacques," as the sentinel was called who had been relieved, found himself, a moment afterwards, marching side by side with the hunter, at whose breast he had so lately pointed a deadly weapon. Such a different sequel was this to what would have been presented, had not the relief guard come at the nick of time to save the stranger's body from a musket ball.</p> 
                  <p>The sun was just setting as the corporal, after disposing of his fresh guard, and filling their places with the relieved sentinels, marched his new recruit into the rough quarters, which, hastily constructed of huts formed of such materials as the neighborhood afforded, relieved by a few officers' tents much the worse for previous Alpine campaigns, stretched along the base of a shelving hill, commanding a view of the barren plains and valleys. This was the rear division of the army's right wing, under command, of General La Harpe, comprising the outer detachments and extreme picquets of the line of march.</p> 
                  <p>Arrived at the guardhouse, which was also occupied as a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">couture,</foreign> or military store, whence a bright-eyed <foreign xml:lang="FRA">vivandiere</foreign> dispensed such commodities to her customers as the rapid progress of the troops, and the total lack of government supplies, rendered of great demand as well as price, the hunter recruit, chaperoned by Maitre Pierre, found himself in presence of the officer of the watch.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, Maitre Pierre, what hast thou there? A spy, doubtless."</p> 
                  <p>"No, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon capitaine!</foreign> but a brave Swiss hunter lad, who is anxious to join our regiment."</p> 
                  <p>"Ah!" responded the officer. "Have a care, Maitre Pierre, that no plan is on foot among these wily mountaineers, who are in league with the Austrians, as thou well knowest.-Now, my good fellow," continued the captain, addressing the recruit, "art thou honest in thy wish to win glory with the grand army of the Republic?"</p> 
                  <p>"Try me!" laconically returned the hunter.</p> 
                  <p>"What is thy name?"</p> 
                  <p>"I am called Valentine."</p> 
                  <p>"Hast thou no other?"</p> 
                  <p>"Certainly one is sufficient to be shot by!" returned the hunter.</p> 
                  <p>"Ah! then thou desirest to be shot, comrade?"</p> 
                  <p>"I shall not take much trouble to dodge a bullet!" answered the recruit.</p> 
                  <p>"Very well, we shall try thee before long. So march off with Maitre Pierre, who will take good care that thou art gratified, for I doubt not bullets will be plenty enough ere morning."</p> 
                  <p>Maitre Pierre saluted his officer, and conducted his new recruit, whom the reader has doubtless recognized as the son of Monna Barbara, to his own rude quarters, where the addition of a ragged uniform coat and tri-colored cockade speedily transformed him into one of "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">les braves</foreign>" who constituted the company of which Maitre Pierre was a corporal, as well as school-master; after which Valentine was introduced to his new associates, and then assigned his resting-place for the night.</p> 
                  <p>Many and conflicting thoughts occupied the young hunter's mind during the sleepless hours of his first military night, until the quick beat of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">reveille</foreign> startled him from his rough couch. Maitre Pierre was soon at his side, when, answering the summons, he hastily joined the group of soldiers who obeyed the first tap, and the corporal manifested his satisfaction at his recruits's promptitude by an encouraging slap upon the shoulder.</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, we shall make a soldier of thee, young comrade. Fall in, and I will presently give thee a lesson, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ami!</foreign>"</p> 
                   
                  <p>Though the reveille had awakened from their quarters all the rank and file of the division; though it yet lacked an hour of daybreak, deep gloom still shrouded the camp, broken only by the glimmering line of bivouac fires, extending far on every side, where ridges and shelves of rock denoted the flanks and rear of that great military monster, whose limbs wound through the northern passes, while its head and iron now threatened the panic-stricken valleys of Italy. The watch-fires illumining the heights which they crested, threw into bold relief the figures of sentinels surrounding them.</p> 
                  <p>Maitre Pierre, as soon as the muster was over, began to occupy himself in bestowing upon Valentine, by the light of the watch-fire, a few short lessons of the manual, interspersed with sage advice upon the proper execution of military duties, and assurances of the absolute certainty that all good soldiers in the Republic's army would in time not only be corporals and sergeants, but even captains, generals and marshals of Frances.</p> 
                  <p>"For be it known to you, comrade, that the 'Little Corporal,' as well as our young general, (<foreign xml:lang="FRA">mousquet sur l' epoule!</foreign>-that is right, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ami</foreign>), is none of your haughty old blunderheads (closer to your shoulder, my comrade), like yonder Austrian, Beaulieu (support your musket in that manner), who has been showing his heels for a week past, but a true son of the people, is General Bonaparte, that takes snuff with Maitre Pierre as readily as with Commissioner Salicetti, (present your fusil, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ami</foreign>-that will do very well, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ami.</foreign>")</p> 
                  <p>"And who is Commissioner Salicetti?"</p> 
                  <p>"O, nobody at all when <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon petit corporal</foreign> is by. (Present arms!) To be sure, he is the commissioner who orders all our supplies, which we never get; but then <foreign xml:lang="FRA">le petit corporal</foreign> is the general, and the Republic must not be without a general, though we can do very well without commissioners in the enemy's country. The Republic, comrade, depends upon its generals you must know. (Hold up your head, comrade.) Moreover, <emph>our</emph> general is always victorious, and so (shoulder musket!) is a great favorite with the Directory."</p> 
                  <p>"And with the army, likewise."</p> 
                  <p>"Not a man of us but what would die for our little general. Look ye, comrade, when we go into line for battle to-morrow, you will see a splendid officer riding up and down, with a white plume, and hear all the regiments shouting, '<foreign xml:lang="FRA">vive Murat!</foreign>'"</p> 
                  <p>"And who is Murat?"</p> 
                  <p>"Certainly you are to be pardoned for your ignorance, because you have just joined the grand army; but I will tell you what Murat was, comrade. He was a soldier in the ranks like yourself, and is now a general, promoted by <foreign xml:lang="FRA">le petit corporal.</foreign> But, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">n'importe,</foreign> there are others; but I am forgetting our lessons. Stand firm, comrade!-raise your fusil! <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Peste!</foreign> There, that will do."</p> 
                  <p>"The general, Murat, rose from the ranks, you say?"</p> 
                  <p>"It is true, and not he only; but you will see Duroc, and Lannes, and many more-all were soldiers like us, my comrade. So you see the Republic, thanks to our good general, knows how to reward her sons. (Right face!) <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Diable!</foreign> what is that?"</p> 
                  <p>The corporal's last exclamation was elicited by a sharp report of musketry, which at this moment broke upon the stillness of the morning air, apparently proceeding from a line of outposts, forming one of the flanks of the encamped division. The ominous signal was succeeded almost immediately by a general stir in the quarters. Maitre Pierre no longer, thought of his lesson or recruit, but ran at once toward the guardhouse, whence presently issued the quick tap of a drum, as the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tombour-major</foreign> appeared, hurrying to his post. Officers, full armed, started suddenly into view, and groups of soldiers who had been stretched at length in the huts, or dispersed around the bivouacs, rushed hastily into line as the renewed summons of the reveille rolled its quick beat upon their ears. In ten minutes the camp was roused, the troops drawn up in columns, and the officers, at the head of their respective detachments, awaited with anxiety some signal from the quarter whence the noise of firing had proceeded.</p> 
                  <p>Valentine, hurrying with other soldiers, found a place in the company to which he had been assigned, and with shouldered, fusil, and head erect, according to Maitre Pierre's directions, stood in silence amid his new comrades, all watching, earnestly the countenances of their immediate officers, who took position with drawn swords before the line, and air listening with hushed breath for the marching beat of the drums or-shrill summons of the, trumpet.</p> 
                  <p>The young hunter's face, though very pallid in the light of the watch-fires, wore yet a determined expression. The excitement of impending conflict could not but cause his veins to<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6326-00000030"/> throb with quicker pulse, and though the despairing thought of hopeless banishment from Val d'Orazio, and the belief that he had lost the affections of Bianca, weighed upon his spirit and crushed its natural buoyancy, still his heart leaped at the reflection that in the approaching battle he might distinguish himself, perhaps, as Maitre Pierre had said, win the notice of that strange commander, whose eagle eye could discover merit when hidden in the humblest sphere. "I may yet return with an honored name," murmured Valentine, half audibly, as the dark memory of his misfortune began to brighten beneath the light of arising hope. "In the combat let me seek my destiny, whatever it may be!"</p> 
                  <p>Suddenly, breaking heavily upon the air, amid the sharper sound of the distant musket firing, the boom of a cannon echoed through the surrounding hills. Then another discharge, and another; then the loud blare of a trumpet, followed by the instantaneous rattle of a dozen drums; and Valentine heard a tramp of horses near the bivouac. The next instant a group of officers appeared, followed irregularly by a regiment of riflemen, who, clambering up the rocks, crowded toward the line of troops which were drawn up on the rear guard of La Harpe's division.</p> 
                  <p>"These devils of Austrians are attacking us in the rear!" cried the foremost officer, suddenly reining in his steed opposite the spot which Valentine occupied in line. "Massena's troops have given way at Dego, and the Sardinians are reinforced at D'Agui! The whole army will be forced into conflict!"</p> 
                  <p>"And Dego retaken by the Austrian army! Shame!" cried another officer. "Col. Lannes, we must drive those fellows back, or the general will never forgive us!"</p> 
                  <p>"General Lanusse, it is for you to lead-we follow!" answered the brave Lannes, then about to win permanently the favor of the commander who had raised him from the ranks. "Do we await the general's orders, or shall we proceed at once to the centre?"</p> 
                  <p>"We await nothing!-we engage at once! Forward!" cried Lanusse, in reply, as he drew his sword, and waved it in the gleam of the watch-lights. A murmur, which soon broke out into a shout, running through the extended line, attested the effect of the officer's speech upon his troops; and ere it subsided, a new group suddenly appeared, as if emerging from the earth, and the prolonged cry of the extended line of sentinels reached at the same moment the marshalled division, acquainting them that the commander-in-chief was on the spot.</p> 
                  <p>Napoleon was at this period but just turned of twenty-six years, and his youthful appearance presented a strong contrast to the weather-beaten looks of most of the officers around, many of whom had served through all the republican campaigns; but in the countenances of all, as they became aware of the general's presence, there was visible in a moment an expression of enthusiastic respect. Simultaneously every officer lifted his chapeau, and a spontaneous shout broke from the soldiers' lips as they recognized their leader, and passed the news of his arrival through the extended line. Napoleon's eye ran hurriedly along the ranks, seeming to take in at one glance the entire disposition of forces, and then in a quick tone, he exclaimed:</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, you are ready!"</p> 
                  <p>"And impatient, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon general!</foreign>" responded Lanusse.</p> 
                  <p>"Forward at once! The Austrians have blundered on good luck, it seems, and regained the ground which Massena yesterday took from them. It is necessary that we fight the battle over again. You, Lanusse, will advance!-and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ami</foreign> Lannes will accompany me. In twenty minutes we must cross the Bormida!"</p> 
                  <p>Lanusse saluted his commander, and in a moment more was at his post, marshalling the head of the column, which was the usual form in which the different divisions of the army commenced an attack. In ten minutes, around the flickering watch fires, marking where the soldiers had bivouacked, there remained only stragglers of the camp, suttlers and others, who tarried for various purposes behind the line of march.</p> 
                  <p>Meanwhile the daybreak revealed, in its gray light, one of those forced advances so common in the after tactics of Bonaparte, but which in this early campaign were novel and extremely arduous to the troops. The constrained march of an army in all situations involves great hardships, but in an Alpine country it was hazardous as well as difficult. Often the most dangerous defiles and abrupt passes, suspended as it were over unfathomable gulfs, were to be carried in the face of an opposing army, flanked and surmounted by fortified positions on well-nigh inaccessible heights, and threatening ambuscades in ravines and sheltered gulleys. Sometimes it became came necessary that a halt of the rear columns should be made, in order to assault a castle or entrenchment on either side of the route, in which case the men were hurried forward with renewed alacrity to engage, defeat and disperse some force which disputed its progress. Thus the head of the army, consisting of riflemen and other light troops, and the cavalry, which latter, in all possible circumstances accompanied the general's staff, were obliged to abandon everything that might retard their celerity, dispensing during a long march with provisions, stores, and camp equipage, and only retaining the arms and ammunition necessary to render their unexpected attack of an enemy successful.</p> 
                  <p>The columnar onset of Napoleon's active force was ever like a thunderbolt in the suddenness of its appearance and tremendous effects. It was precipitated, as it were, by his mighty will, upon the precise position which he wished to shake or annihilate, and seldom failed, so minute and unfailing was the mathematical calculation of this wonderful commander, to produce the entire and positive result intended. Whether swooping from the Cal di Tende, as in his earlier Alpine campaign, or surrounding and defeating three armies in detail at the first great battle won in his own person at Monte Nolte, or executing in after life the terrible encounters of Marengo, Austerlitz and Borodino, Napoleon, in the words of one of his biographers, was always "like lightning in the eyes of his enemies." Everything gave way before the tremendous impetus of his uncompromising will, which, like necessity itself, seemed to overawe even apparent impossibilities.</p> 
                  <p>It often happened that while the van of the French army, after undergoing the fatigues of an excessively forced march, found itself in presence of a foe, and was ordered at once to the engagement, the rear was closely occupied in storming a fortified place, which it had been left to carry and dismantle; and just at the moment when the latter's arduous effort was successful, and the wearied troops resting a moment from their fatigues, an order came back from headquarters, commanding instant and rapid advance or detour, in order to strike some exposed position of the enemy's forces, or co-operate with the centre or van.</p> 
                  <p>The advance of troops under such abrupt orders was fully displayed in the movement which, under the commander-in-chief's own direction, now took place towards the village of Dego. This village, taken from the Austro Sardinian troops on the day previous, had been surprised during the night by a detached force of the enemy, who in their turn gained possession of the town, driving out the French garrison, and cutting off the valley of the Bormida from communication with the French passes. Thus the rear and van of the French army were separated from the centre, and if time were allowed to the defenders of the country to effect a junction of all their forces, the hitherto triumphal march of the Republic's young general might be unexpectedly stayed, perhaps turned back upon the mountains. Consequently the present was a juncture calling for Napoleon's promptitude and boldness, and his decisive will speedily diffused its influence throughout the division, every man of which soon became imbued with the determined daring of the commander-in-chief. In this manner the column of attack rapidly descended the slopes and rough gorges of the hills, to precipitate itself upon the entrenchments of Dego, dashing through the swollen waters of the Bormida. Which horse and infantry where half compelled to swim rather than wade. The Austrians awaited with confidence the assault.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">BERTHOLD'S PLOT.</head> 
                  <p>THE Easter festival approached, and the snows began to melt away from the hillsides and valleys where the sun's heat was first more strongly reflected. On the great precipices, and in the darksome defiles that surrounded the mule-path, the deep drifts remained. The osteria had resumed its publicity, and still, under the sway of Bacco and his wife Brigita, continued to entertain the contrabandists, straggling goatherds of the upper ranges, and wandering children of Savoy, who chose to travel over these isolated routes. The ostessa since the fatal disaster which had made her childless, seemed to have become, if possible, more acrid and saturnine in her manners, and the oste himself had lapsed into such a habit of drinking that he was scarcely ever seen but in a state of inebriety and was often so steeped in his potations as to be unable to recognize the most ancient cronies among his rude guests.</p> 
                  <p>Neither Captain Tomaso nor his daughter remained in the osteria. The sudden destruction of his small band by the avalanche, with the subsequent influence of Francesca, and the timely visit of Padre Ambrosio had, as we have said, awakened the brigand's conscience and operated a powerful change in his character. He began to regard his past evil courses with a horror of mind which required all the skill and affection of his child to prevent merging into madness or melancholy. But, happily, Francesca's spirit was one of rare patience and discretion, and on the very day succeeding her father's interview with the priest, she formed the resolution to take advantage of her parent's apparently renewed better nature, and persuade him to accompany her at once from the scenes of his late marauding life-whither she cared not, but at least to a place of rest and safety, both for himself and her.</p> 
                  <p>Tomaso made no opposition to his daughter's wish, but as speedily as the partial return of his strength would admit, arose from his bed in the osteria, and collecting what valuables he possessed, informed the hostess, Brigit, that he intended to depart upon a long journey. Then, with his daughter clasping his arm, half sustaining his form, and almost guiding his footsteps, the old brigand took leave of the osteria, the lonely mule-path, and the passes and defiles whence he had often led his comrades on some plundering expedition. Tomaso and Francesca departed-none knew whither. There was no one of the band remaining to inquire.</p> 
                  <p>No one save Berthold, the vine-dresser; and when, to his vexation, on the next visit which he made to the osteria, after his repulse by Francesea, he was still refused admittance; and when, after repeated attempts to see the maiden, he was informed by the ostessa that both she and her father had disappeared, his astonishment and anger knew no control. He accused Francesca as bitterly as he once accused the innocent Valentine, of a hundred wicked things, and, with imprecations, threatened revenge on Tomaso, Bacco, Brigita-to all which the vinegar-faced hostess replied by vigorously thrusting him from the porch where he stood, and closing the hostel door in the face of his curses. So Berthold returned to Val d'Orazio to plot mischief in another quarter.</p> 
                  <p>The spring and Easter, as we have said, approached, and one evening of a Sabbath, when the vine-dresser had been as usual to the chapel of the hills, and there awoke the jealousy of a dozen youths by the apparent good terms on which he stood with the fair Bianca-she having at the church door that morning accepted, with a gracious smile, a few little tufts of wild mosses, which Berthold had woven into a quaint bouquet, with some early flowers-the latter took his way to the hut which he still occupied with his mother, and whither, at the close of a previous chapter, we promised the reader to follow him.</p> 
                  <p>The vine-dresser's return to his home was as it seemed looked for by another besides the crone. This was a man of about thirty years of age, of noble form and features; but in whose look was manifest the unrestrained indulgence of evil passion, whilst the advancing lines of dissipation marred in his countenance the finer work of nature. He was richly dressed, and jewels sparkled on his fingers, but he seemed ill at ease, nevertheless, nervously striding over the cottage-floor, at the same time whipping the air with a riding lash which he held in one hand.</p> 
                  <p>"Thou hast come-at last," exclaimed this personage, in an impatient tone, as Berthold's figure darkened the low entrance. "Well, man, speak-what news hast brought?"</p> 
                  <p>"Simply," replied the vine dresser, apparently not abashed at the other's rude greeting; "simply that all will be according to your lordship's wishes."</p> 
                  <p>"And when?-at once?" exclaimed the person, addressed.</p> 
                  <p>"Your lordship must be aware that time is neces-"</p> 
                  <p>"Time! I want no more delay! I have waited long enough for this girl; and it appears my worthy Berthold is playing some double game with me. Enough of this trifling, my good fellow."</p> 
                  <p>"Your lordship forgets-"</p> 
                  <p>"I forget nothing-certainly not that I have waited for six months for a shrewd villain to serve me, and seem now to be as near the completion of my desires as at the beginning. Hark ye, sir, is this peasant girl to be mine?"</p> 
                  <p>"Undoubtedly she shall be, my lord," answered the vine-dresser, laboring to preserve calmness, for his evil temper was on the point of being roused by the other's jeering words; "but, perchance, it is not so easy as your lordship may think, to carry her off in the face of a hundred quick-handed blockheads, who would think their lives lost cheaply in defending her."</p> 
                  <p>"How, then, secure our prize?"</p> 
                  <p>"I have hitherto said, my lord, leave it to me to make the task easy. Now, if your lordship will let me explain-"</p> 
                  <p>"I listen."</p> 
                  <p>"Your lordship would not that suspicion attach to yourself or servants; but rather that the business be so managed that it may seem the girl is carried away by brigands-"</p> 
                  <p>"We understand, good Berthold!"</p> 
                  <p>"Therefore, my lord, to ensure the object, Bianca will go herself to the mountains, and there-"</p> 
                  <p>"What!-Bianca!-the mountains!"</p> 
                  <p>"There will be no difficulty. My lord must know the girl had once a fancy for my brother Valentine, who fled from the valley when accused of her uncle's murder."</p> 
                  <p>"Which murder I am not so sure thou didst not thyself commit, good Berthold!"</p> 
                  <p>"Your lordship is pleased to be jocose," muttered the vine-dresser, sulkily. "Shall I explain, further, or-"</p> 
                  <p>"O, go on, my testy Berthold," said the noble; "let me understand the scheme at once."</p> 
                  <p>"Bianca, as I said, having a fancy for my unfortunate brother, will gladly believe me when I tell her that Valentine has returned, and is concealed in the hills, for fear of the villagers-"</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, I comprehend!"</p> 
                  <p>"And wishes to see her but for one moment, if she believes him innocent-"</p> 
                  <p>"Proceed, worthy Berthold!"</p> 
                  <p>"And implores her to come to a secret pass above the lonesome mule-path-"</p> 
                  <p>"And she will go? She will obey-"</p> 
                  <p>"Most certainly, my lord, I doubt not. And<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6326-00000032"/> if she does not greet an old lover, she will find a new one! So where's the difference?"</p> 
                  <p>"Berthold, thou art a shrewd villain, and shall be well rewarded for thy assistance."</p> 
                  <p>Berthold appeared to hesitate a moment, and then looking at the noble scrutinizingly, said:</p> 
                  <p>"I trust your lordship does not think I serve for gold only?"</p> 
                  <p>"Well, in truth, honest fellow, thou art never loth to accept such payment."</p> 
                  <p>"Nevertheless, a man may have a tender regard-"</p> 
                  <p>"What! hast thou a tender regard for me, Berthold? That is more than I looked for, truly."</p> 
                  <p>The noble spoke with a sneer similar to that which was habitual to the vine-dresser himself.</p> 
                  <p>"I may have a <emph>regard</emph> for your lordship; and a <emph>tender</emph> regard for some one else! The fair Bianca will not always be young, and-"</p> 
                  <p>"Aha! methinks thou dost covet the reversion of my pretty peasant! Surely, thou art a serviceable scoundrel!"</p> 
                  <p>"Bianca will not always please your lordship, and if she weds-"</p> 
                  <p>The vine-dresser paused.</p> 
                  <p>"If she weds thee when I discard her, thou wouldst say! Very well-we may discuss this matter at another time. At present I would know when this girl for whom you profess a 'tender regard' is to show the same to me?"</p> 
                  <p>"Within twenty-four hours, my lord."</p> 
                  <p>"To morrow, then?"</p> 
                  <p>"At the Easter festival, when the villagers lose their silly brains in sport, I can safely lure Bianca from the old Agata's cottage, and send her-"</p> 
                  <p>"To meet her lever!"</p> 
                  <p>"And leave the rest to your lordship."</p> 
                  <p>"Bravo, Berthold! The scheme cannot fail. At the Easter feast, to-morrow! Fail me not, good Berthold."</p> 
                  <p>"Your lordship will be satisfied."</p> 
                  <p>The noble bowed his head slightly, and turning from the hut followed the vine-dresser, who went to unfasten a fine horse that had been pawing the ground at the rear of the house. A few moments afterward, Lord Roberto, well-known throughout the valley as a reckless libertine, who divided his time betwixt the follies of Milan and orgies of a wilder description carried on at a castle which he possessed, near Val d'Orazio, passed up through the hamlet, riding furiously through the groups of peasants on the road, returning to their homes from Sabbath services, and directing his course towards a small hunting lodge not far from the castle, which latter crowned a lofty eminence near the head of the valley, at a point where the main road diverged into the mountains.</p> 
                  <p>Berthold, on his part, returned into the hut, moodily grumbling as he thought of Monna Barbara and her mysterious flight, and then set himself about getting something to eat.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE BATTLE OF MILLESIMO.</head> 
                  <p>VAL D'ORAZIO, bosomed in hills, and elevated far above the Pass of the Boccheta, where the passage of Napoleon had been effected, was little disturbed by the great invasion which threatened the Italian states. Though the plains at less than half-a dozen leagues distant were overrun by foreign soldiers, while villages smoked and castles tottered on either side of the conqueror's route, the quiet Alpine hamlet, in which the chief incidents of our story have occurred, remained in happy ignorance of the actual ravages of war. At times, it is true, some more adventurous scouting parties from either army, extending their explorations, had ascended to the upper passes that embraced the Val d'Orazio, and once a foraging detachment had threatened the peasants with a forced acquaintance, so far as concerned the latter's granaries. But as spring opened without the actual presence of conflict or its attendant sufferings, the good villagers found abundant reason for thankfulness in being spared the military visitation of either friend or foe. Nevertheless, many a worthy wife clung closer to her spouse, and perhaps Padre Ambrosio murmured an additional prayer, when at times the hollow-sounding defiles far down beneath the hamlet, echoed and re-echoed to the thunders of artillery, and made the hills respond like great organ-pipes to the wild bruit that whelmed their giant bases.</p> 
                  <p>Such a bruit was rolling through gorges and defiles at the hour of daybreak, when two individuals emerged from a mountain gap on the descending slope that conducted through alternate declivities and ridges, from Val d'Orazio to the Italian hillsides on which the lower pass of the Boccheta opened. They were a man and woman, the first apparently advanced in years, as his steps were feeble, and had to be sustained by his companion, who was quite youthful in form and features. As they reached a jutting point, commanding a wide sweep of prospect, they paused to survey the valleys and plateaus lying outspread for many leagues under their observation.</p> 
                  <p>The eastern clouds were fading before the advancing beams of morning, and drifting slowly from the mountain tops, and dividing in the lower districts; but from the plains immediately beneath their gaze, the beholders could distinguish thick masses of vapor which arose, not from exhalations of earth, but from the mingling of opposing battle smokes vomited out of cannon and rifles in the action of a fierce conflict which was just unrolling its terrible pictures beneath the brightening heavens.</p> 
                  <p>About a mile from the base of the shelving precipice on which the two travellers had halted, a river, swollen at this season by the melting snows, wound amid a rocky landscape for some<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6326-00000033"/> distance, and then, broadening, flowed near a small town, which seemed to be the central position of attack and defence of the large bodies of troops now engaged in battle. Far beyond the fortified buildings of this town could be discerned a long line of troops hastily advancing, whilst on the banks of the river many more were drawn up in preparation for the strife. At the same time skirmishing parties mingled in close fight at various points upon the plains, and from the opposite passes of the hills a dense array of armed men swept like a torrent towards the river-side. It was evident that a fierce and long contest was at hand.</p> 
                  <p>"Father, we had better here remain," said the young woman to her companion, as she led him to a ridge of rock, which, somewhat protected by an overshelving cliff, offered a resting-place, sheltered somewhat from the keen morning breeze, which blew across the exposed portion of the mountain-side.</p> 
                  <p>"They are Frenchmen-and yonder is the Austrian eagle," said the old man, seemingly absorbed in the view of the scene beneath them, as he slowly seated himself on the rock to which his daughter directed their steps. "There will now be a brave fight, my child."</p> 
                  <p>"And these strange men who fight know not each other!" replied the young girl. "Strange that they should meet for the first time with such hatred in their hearts!"</p> 
                  <p>"Alas! there is hatred in all hearts," said the man.</p> 
                  <p>"Till they are changed, my father."</p> 
                  <p>"O, if they be <emph>ever</emph> changed, Francesca!" cried the ancient brigand, Tomaso, for it was he who, thus led by his daughter, had wandered many weeks before from Val d'Orazio. "O, if indeed they be ever changed in this world!"</p> 
                  <p>"Look!-behold, father-they are coming hitherward!"</p> 
                  <p>Tomaso looked in the direction which Francesca pointed, and saw a large body of French soldiers suddenly concentrate in column, and wheel from a broken declivity at the distance of half a mile, advancing rapidly to the pass through which himself and daughter had descended. In a few moments the heavy clatter of their arms sounded distinctly below, and while the old man and Francesca withdrew beneath the shelving cliff, a dense array of soldiers climbed the rocks and shelves around, and swarmed in the wide pass, sweeping onward with wonderful celerity, till they disappeared among the hills.</p> 
                  <p>It was one of Napoleon's sudden manuvres, by which detaching a portion of his main force, he cast it as a compact missile apparently directly away from the field, but in reality causing it to whirl, catapult-like, with tremendous centrifugal power, right upon the object which he wished to annihilate.</p> 
                  <p>In the meantime the belligerents upon the plains drew closer to each other, and the artillery belching its wide-mouthed thunder, shook the air for leagues around, darkening it at the same time with increasing smoke vomited incessantly forth, mingled with lurid flame, in which the hurrying battalions of horse and foot were half disclosed, seeming more like legions of Alpine fiends than living men. Down from every pass and gorge of the hills, out of innumerable clefts and gaps in the lower mural of rocks, the clustering troops of Frenchmen poured in unbroken succession, centering and uniting in column as soon as the nature of the ground admitted, and thence deploying in squadrons and battalions, marching separate till the river was crossed, immediately after which the column was re-united, and hurled compactly towards the assaulted town. It was the battle of Dego, more commonly termed Millesimo, the third of Bonaparte's pitched fights, which opened for him a conqueror's path over Italy.</p> 
                  <p>Tomaso and his daughter watched the changing fortunes of the conflict, whilst the morning sun rose gradually towards its zenith, and cast its rays faintly through the thick atmosphere that overhung the plain. Comparatively secure in the half-covered position they occupied, from any mischance to which such near neighborhood to a battle might otherwise expose them, and alike fearful of proceeding on their route, or of retracing their steps back to the mountain passes, the two wayfarers resolved to await the close of the engagement before resuming their journey. They surveyed therefore the progress of events, the father tracing with something of a former spirit-for he had been a soldier in youth-the rapid evolutions of the troops, the fierce charge and bloody hand-to-hand combat; while the daughter, closing her eyes, at each recurring shock of hostile meeting, strove to shape her thoughts to prayer for the souls of those who were falling as thickly as autumn leaves before the withering blast.</p> 
                  <p>Meanwhile, hurried among other military units to the close affray, obeying a charging trumpet, or following the outstretched swords of his officers, that gleamed like stars amid the clouds of battle, Valentine, the hunter, found himself lost in the confusion of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">melee.</foreign> Little space was left him here for memory of the past or thought of the future. Around him flashed fast the flames of cannon and muskets; in his ears rumbled a wild din of undistinguishable sounds, the great boom of field-pieces, the roll of volleying discharges of the lines on either side, the sharp tirallade of the rifle brigades, firing as they advanced and wheeled to flank the central batteries. But at times, as the young soldier looked up through a rift in the smoke, he could catch a glimpse of some daring figure in advance of the column, spurring his bleeding steed to the van of conflict, and hear at the same time the shout of his comrades in the ranks, repeating the name of some gallant officer raised to leadership of his companions by the favor of the greater one, who led them all.</p> 
                  <p>"Advance-Lannes! mon ami!" was the sudden command of a slight-built commander, who rode swiftly through the centre of the column. His chapeau was drawn tightly over his forehead, and his eyes gleamed like fire beneath, showing a countenance pale as marble, the lips pressed firmly together, and the nostrils dilated with awful determination. He wore a gray surtout, crossed by a simple sash; his cloak was strapped at his saddle-bow, over which he leaned as he rode, pointing with his unarmed hand towards the dense clouds of smoke that enveloped the strong entrenchments of the Austrians defending the town of Dego. As this plain-looking figure appeared, every heart in all that dense column of soldiery stood still, to beat in a moment after with redoubled animation-for the men recognized their young general, Bonaparte, and the cry that evermore greeted and followed him rang along the line, "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Vive la notre general! vive Napoleon!</foreign>"</p> 
                  <p>"Advance! and carry the town!"</p> 
                  <p>The order was borne from mouth to mouth, and flew from leader to leader in the close array. But ere it had been heard by a dozen others than himself, the brave Lannes had thrown himself at the column's head. Shouting the name of Napoleon as a war-cry, he plucked his plumed chapeau from his brow, waved it enthusiastically thrice around his head, and then elevating it upon the point of his sword, as a signal of advance, plunged at once toward the Austrian batteries; and behind him, crushing the earth beneath them, trod the feet of a thousand men, pressing on their leader, while a thousand voices echoed his battle-cry with an inspiring shout that rose high above the confusion of arms.</p> 
                  <p>Valentine, borne forward in the headlong charge, felt himself animated with the electricity that pervaded all the rest. Handling his fusil with the skill and precision of his comrades, he bore his part in the combat as one who had mingled in many a strife before. A portion of the vast military automaton moved by the skill of those who created the movements, he became in a little space the soldier and the veteran. Such is the brief apprenticeship required for the hero, because excited passion fills the place of experience, that a single battle is sufficient to accomplish what a thousand, drills and parades might fail to determine.</p> 
                  <p>But the fight grew dense and more desperately sustained. Twice the French column, advancing to the assault, were repelled by the steady bravery of those who defended the town; twice the tide of success was rolled back to the plain, and the battalions and companies, dispersing in their retreat, overspread the rocks and hillsides around.</p> 
                  <p>In the mid-ranks of the struggle, the young soldier, Valentine, borne hither and thither as the battle swayed, beheld an officer whose daring demeanor more than once arrested his gaze, and drew from his comrades their spontaneous huzzas. This officer, apparently past the middle period of life-though from his countenance, clouded with dust and, smoke, it was difficult to determine his age,-was a man of tall figure and a bearing at the same time majestic and graceful. At the first hurried glimpse which the hunter obtained of this brave superior, a thrill of emotion unaccountably pervaded him. It seemed to him, excited as were his impressions by the scene and the part which he himself bore in it, that some link of sympathy had become suddenly revealed to his perception, uniting him to the changing interests of the day's strife. A recognition appeared to be established in his mind, through which he beheld a companion and kindred being mingling in the fortunes of the field, and thenceforth he endeavored with ardent gaze to keep in sight the unknown individual who thus controlled him. In the first hours of the engagement the attempt was difficult enough-since he was forced mechanically forward or back in the evolutions of the battalion<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6326-00000034"/> ion, of which he was but a mere integral,-and he had no eye or thought save obedience to immediate command, stimulated by the presence of danger and the example of courage around him.</p> 
                  <p>But the third charge of the entire army, led by the commander-in-chief in person, and supported by his master-strokes of detached and suddenly recalled flanking divisions, to cover the advance of the centre, bore our youthful combatant into the thickest of the affray, where commanded the unknown officer whom his eyes had sought during many hours of previous fight.</p> 
                  <p>It was amid the tumult and disorder of a bayonet charge upon the outer batteries of the enemy, met and repelled by a fierce sortie of the defenders to protect their guns, that Valentine, swept back and separated from the dense ranks, beheld the gallant unknown surrounded by a dozen foes, defending himself desperately against their combined attacks. The color-bearer of the regiment had been struck down, and the colonel, for such was his rank, had snatched the eagle as it fell, and lifting it above his head with one hand, kept back with his single sword-arm the flushed foemen who pressed forward to pursue their advantage over the French. Valentine be held the struggle, and turning with an uncontrollable impulse from the disordered ranks, threw himself boldly forward to the assistance of his superior. It was full time for such aid, indeed, for the colonel's sword was broken in his hard defence, and he, himself, pressed sorely by a crowd of foes, staggered before their furious blows which fell upon his steel halbert. The young hunter saw at a glance the danger of the unknown officer, and pausing for no consideration of peril to his own life, dashed into the melee, and using his fusil as a club, whirled it with terrible force against the weapons of the Austrian soldiers. An assault so fierce and unusual dismayed for a moment the enemy, allowing the discomfited officer to possess himself of the dead ensign's weapon, which had fallen with the eagle from his grasp; and ore the attack could be renewed, a new charge by a reserve division of the French forced back the Austrians in their turn, and changed the feature of the strife once more. Valentine in the next instant was separated from the man whose life he had preserved, and found himself soon after combating as before, in confusion and tumult of undistinguishing action that had constrained his position during the previous hours of conflict.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE VINE-DRESSER'S TREACHERY.</head> 
                  <p>WHILE the events we have described were transpiring under the observation of Tomaso and his daughter, as well as the soldier, Valentine, other characters of our story were involved in a train of circumstances that rapidly hurried them towards the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">denouement</foreign> of their different perplexities. The Easter festival, for which preparations had gone on during many weeks, at last opened its day of innocent enjoyment for the quiet dwellers in Val d'Orazio, and with its advent ripened to completion the nefarious plot which Berthold, the vine-dresser, had laid against the orphan Bianca.</p> 
                  <p>Rising at the first peep of day from their beds of corn-husks, the good villagers busied themselves in getting ready for the first duty of the yestal day, a procession of youths and maidens to the little chapel, there to celebrate by a solemn mass the advancing season of light and sunshine, toil and its genial fruits. Bianca, earnestly entreated by her worthy aunt to take part, at least, in this pious custom, had at length consented, and betimes in the morning awaited in the quiet cottage the coming of some neighboring village maidens, her youthful companions, but not, indeed, her compeers, being no rivals at all in the charms which had made her the favorite of the valley gallants.</p> 
                  <p>Bianca was very beautiful, indeed, that fine spring morning, as she sat with her aunt Agata near the little window of their dwelling, which looked out upon the mountain pass. The lantern still occupied its position, and rightly was it tended by the young maiden, its rays continuing to illumine the outward gloom. Agata acquiesced in the desire of her niece to keep up the old custom of lighting the beacon; "for," said the kind dame, "perhaps some poor wanderer in a storm may be led to a shelter by our lamp." But Agata did not know that Bianca, whenever she trimmed the watch-light, thought of a wanderer whom she did not name, but whose image was ever present to her gentle heart.</p> 
                  <p>Bianca was very beautiful that morning, and so Agata thought and said; yet was the maiden pale, and only a faint smile answered her aunt's praices. "Perhaps she has been dreaming of our poor departed Nicolo," soliloquized Agata; but, in truth, Bianca was thinking at this time more of the living than of the dead.</p> 
                  <p>Yet was she indeed beautiful, in her close brown boddice and half mourning jacket, from which a snowy robe, gift of the lost guide, depended to her pretty feet. She wore no ribbons nor ornaments, save a simple lace border about her neck, and a coronal of early spring buds circling her white forehead. The long lashes<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6326-00000035"/> drooped over her fine blue eyes, which now sought the floor, and now were lifted to gaze from the window toward the mountain-pass with a longing look as though they sought some coming friend. Alas! would he ever come again?</p> 
                  <p>But she was still so beautiful; and thus thought Berthold, the vine-dresser, as, approaching the cottage, he paused at a point whence he could observe Bianca through the casement. Berthold himself seemed attired for participation in the approaching fete. A blue velvet jacket, with silver plated buttons, and breeches trimmed with yellow ribbons, gave an unusual jaunty appearance to the young man; and his customary gloomy countenance seemed to have yielded somewhat to the enlivening influence of the occasion. He paused but a brief period to observe Bianca, and then advancing, knocked at the cottage-door. Agata opened it, and admitted him.</p> 
                  <p>Bianca started as she recognized the brother of him whose memory dwelt always with her, and at this moment filled her mind. A faint smile of welcome illumined her features, as extending her hand, she invited the vine-dresser to be seated.</p> 
                  <p>"Are not the poor villagers to be gratified with your presence?" Berthold asked, as he responded to the maiden's salutation. "As I just now came through the street, I heard many hope that you would join the chapel procession."</p> 
                  <p>"I shall go," simply replied Bianca.</p> 
                  <p>But Agata, taking up the discourse, said hastily:</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, indeed, master Berthold, my sweet child shall take part in the duty, though she says it is out of affection for me, her poor aunt. Nevertheless, she is fair enough to grace it at any time."</p> 
                  <p>"You may well say that," rejoined Berthold; "and I doubt not the town will say likewise; but," he continued, addressing Bianca in a lower tone, "will you favor me with your attention for a moment? I have something to reveal to you."</p> 
                  <p>The young maiden's cheeks flushed quickly as the thought that perhaps Berthold might have received news of his brother darted through her mind. The vine-dresser apparently noticed her agitation, for he remarked immediately, raising his voice:</p> 
                  <p>"The air is balmy this morning, and the villagers are already busy with their preparations. Perhaps even now they may be in sight to summon their favorite maiden."</p> 
                  <p>Saying this; he rose, and opening the door of the cottage, stepped beyond the threshold, casting at the same time a glance of meaning at Bianca, who thereupon followed him, apparently in response to his last remark. When, however, she stood beside the vine-dresser outside of the cottage, before Agata could join them, Berthold said in a whisper:</p> 
                  <p>"Valentine has returned."</p> 
                  <p>Agata-as at this moment she reached the two-could not but notice the sudden change which came over her niece. The maiden's face was as colorless as marble, and her limbs tottered so that she would have fallen to the ground had not the vine-dresser suddenly interposed with his strong arm to sustain her.</p> 
                  <p>"You are ill-you are faint, Bianca," said the latter, in a tone of deep sympathy.</p> 
                  <p>"My child! what is the matter?" cried Agata, filled with apprehension.</p> 
                  <p>"Nothing-nothing, aunt; it is but a sudden weakness. Go, dear Agata-bring me, I pray, some water, and I will be well in a moment."</p> 
                  <p>The good woman went back hastily into the cottage, and Bianca turned toward Berthold with an appealing look that demanded what her lips could not ask.</p> 
                  <p>"He has returned, but fears to enter the village, lest the people may again arrest him; but he prays to see you once more."</p> 
                  <p>"O, Berthold! where is he?"</p> 
                  <p>"He lies concealed in one of the passes above the mule-path. 'Could you but see him there,' he said."</p> 
                  <p>"He said so!-Valentine! Did he doubt that I would come?"</p> 
                  <p>"He but implored it."</p> 
                  <p>"Berthold, conduct me-I am ready to go with you at once!"</p> 
                  <p>"After the procession," returned the vine-dresser, in a hurried whisper, as Agata re-appeared in the door.</p> 
                  <p>Bianca nodded in token that she understood him, and then drank the water which her aunt had brought from the cottage. At this moment a joyous troop of young maidens came into view, advancing from the village street, and this gave Berthold a pretext for exchanging a few other low words with Bianca, in which he bade her await him outside of the chapel, after the procession should have entered. Then, bidding farewell, he turned from the cottage, saluting the group of maidens as he passed them with so jaunty an air that more than one coquettishly looked after him, and said: "Can that, indeed, be old Monna Barbara's son? And is <emph>he</emph> Bianca's favorite? Well, we shall find out something by-and-by!"</p> 
                  <p>Agata, meantime, was bustling to arrange her darling for the procession, insisting that she should wear an ancient string of Roman pearls, long treasured by the simple aunt, and moreover arguing that a gay ribbon or two would not be out of place upon the maiden's sombre jacket; but Bianca chose to appear in the modest attire which she had chosen, and throwing over her forehead a long, white veil, which drooped gracefully from her gathered black hair, she went slowly out to meet her companions, who on their part, each casting back her veil, testified their delight by embracing one after another the village favorite, bestowing many resounding kisses on her fair cheek, which, had they reached the ears of Berthold, might have caused that envious fellow much chagrin.</p> 
                  <p>Very soon the band of maidens, proceeding up the rocky street, were joined by other white-veiled girls, emerging from cottages on either side, and presently the young villagers began to mingle with them. Then came a half-dozen rustic musicians, with their simple bag-pipes, sounding merry notes that were answered from the rocks by a hundred musical echoes. These took their station at the head of the little cottage, where likewise walked, in their pilgrim garb, three devout villagers who had just returned from a winter's journey to the virgin's shrine at Loretto. Swarthy young fellows from the higher Alps, in the dress of shepherds; ruddy-faced hunters, and smiling-visaged youths from neighboring hamlets, vied with the denizens of Val d'Orazio in their attire and close devotion to the fairer sex. With slouched hats thrown carelessly back from their open foreheads, with many-hued jackets of coarse velvet, bedecked with ribbons and huge silver buckles, heirlooms of many a generation, clasping rosettes in their broad-toed shoes, the joyous gallants of the Easter feast made, as may be imagined, a very goodly display, as they walked in procession beside the fresh young damsels, who, in dress and coquetry were not a whit behind their rustic beaux.</p> 
                  <p>Thus the morning procession of the first spring festival wound its way through the hamlet, pausing at the house of Signore Leoni to greet the worthy borghigiano with a clear blast of the pipes, and again halting at the padre's snug dwelling, to be joined by the good Ambrosio himself, who taking his place beside the Loretto pilgrims, gave his kind benediction to all as he led the way towards the chapel of the hills.</p> 
                  <p>Berthold, the vine-dresser, had not again approached Bianca, though he walked in another part of the procession, carrying a large wooden cross, decked with blue and white ribbons, and twined with a portion of the vine-branches that grew over the hut in which he dwelt. He moved with a demure air at the rear of all, apparently much impressed with the solemnity of the rite in which he assisted; and the honest peasants, standing at their doors, as they beheld Monna Barbara's son so seemingly devout in his demeanor, forgot their prejudices against the reputed witch-mother, and united in commendation of the young man's religious character.</p> 
                  <p>Berthold, however, took little heed of them or their thoughts, for his eyes were constantly peering forward to where Bianca walked, and his mind was revolving the many wicked schemes which, long plotted in its darkness, were now about to be brought to the light of execution. The maiden, on her part, as she pursued her way in the procession, at a short distance from Padre Ambrosio, and beside a brother of one of her female companions, was occupied more with the thought of Valentine, whom she believed awaited her coming in the mountains, than by any less worldly reflections, though her companion, a handsome young hunter, doubtless attributed her absent mood to very sober meditations. Vainly did this good youth venture during the route, numberless whispered compliments and attempts to draw the valley beauty into converse. She walked silently beside him, taking, apparently, little heed of all his soft sayings, until at length the procession reached its destination as the chapel of the hills.</p> 
                  <p>Padre Ambrosio ascending to the altar with the white-robed boys, who were to assist in the ceremony of mass, commenced the opening litany prayer for the occasion, and the pious villagers knelt reverently around to bear their part in the responses; but ere the solemn service had commenced, Bianca, gliding quietly away, joined the vine-dresser, who awaited her without the porch. A single word was spoken, and then the two hurried from the chapel down a rocky pathway, which led from the main street, penetrating the hills to a point at which it intersected the lonely mule-path.</p> 
                  <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6326-00000036"/> 
                  <p>But the maiden's movement did not altogether escape notice. The young hunter, who had walked beside her in the procession, and who had long been a zealous aspirant for the smiles of Nicolo's grandchild, perceived her departure from the chapel, and impressed, perhaps, with a feeling of jealousy, took the opportunity for himself to steal away from the ceremony. Reaching the pathway, the youth caught a glimpse of Bianca and her companion hurrying toward the hills, and in a moment resolved to follow them.</p> 
                  <p>It was not difficult for one who knew every foot of the mountains around, to strike out immediately into another devious defile, by which he might intercept the obvious route of the fugitives. He diverged therefore from the direct path they had taken, and struck across a higher ledge that conducted to the mule-path.</p> 
                  <p>The morning was now quite advanced, and the sun-beams fell brightly upon the rocks, down which dashed numberless rivulets from the melting snows above. Pietro-for that was the hunter's name-kept on his way, without heeding any obstacles, leaping at one moment over a deep chasm, at another skirting some narrow shelf, whilst grasping a higher cliff for support. Thus he proceeded for more than a mile, toward the inner range of hills, occasionally obtaining glimpses from his more elevated route, of the two who traversed the mule-path.</p> 
                  <p>Bianca, in the meantime, confiding in her treacherous guide, followed him in silence-for Berthold, conscious of his own baseness, felt little disposed to conversation, besides being occupied with his own speculations regarding the ultimate success of his wicked plot; and the maiden herself, agitated with the hope of meeting him whom she devotedly loved, scarcely brooked the obstacles of the distance that still separated her from what she believed was his place of concealment. Thus the innocent girl was led onward till they arrived at a point in the mule-path where several dim defiles brouched in various directions through the rocky country. Here the vine-dresser paused suddenly.</p> 
                  <p>"In yonder pass," he said, pointing upward, and turning his eyes as he spoke from the maiden's trusting gaze, "Valentine is securely hidden; but he cannot yet expect us, or he would certainly have met us. Remain here a moment, Bianca, while I ascend that dangerous ledge."</p> 
                  <p>Saying this, the traitor sprang from the mule-path, and ascending a steep defile, was in an instant after lost to view.</p> 
                  <p>Bianca, trembling half with terror, half with anticipation of meeting the long-absent Valentine, remained for a few moments patiently awaiting the appearance of Berthold; but as some time elapsed, her fears began to increase, and a sense of peril to herself for the first time came over her mind. The foreboding was changed to alarm, when presently, instead of the vine-dresser or his brother, a tall and richly-dressed man appeared suddenly before her, emerging from the rocks, behind which her late companion had vanished. Surveying the stranger as he advanced, the poor maiden recognized, with increased affright, the face of one whom she had once or twice beheld during Nicolo's lifetime, and against whom the good guide had warned her oftentimes to beware of, as a bad and dangerous man.</p> 
                  <p>It was, indeed, as the reader doubtless suspects, no other than the Marquis Roberto, lord of much of the surrounding domain, and feared alike by old and young on account of his wicked passions and reckless mode of life. Scarcely would it be thought, however, that so graceful a gentleman as now approached the maiden, with a winning smile upon his lip, and his richly broidered hat extended as in deprecation of his appearance, could be the wicked nobleman of whom rumor said so many evil things. He placed his gloved hand upon his heart as he paused, and bowing to Bianca, spoke in a low and encouraging tone:</p> 
                  <p>"Fear nothing, lady-I am your friend!"</p> 
                  <p>The young girl, terrified, but unable to speak, retracted a step, with an undefined idea of flight, and it was not until Lord Roberto, still smiling blandly, approached still nearer to her that she became suddenly impressed with a suspicion of Berthold's treachery in conducting her hither. A thousand fears then possessed her soul, and gaining strength in the conviction of her danger, she shrieked aloud, and essayed to fly along the rocky pass; but the marquis, but half confident of his prize, had anticipated this movement, and as she turned to escape, another figure sprang from behind the rocks, and the next moment a heavy cloak was thrown about the maiden's form, enveloping her face, and stifling the wild cry that had broken from her lips.</p> 
                  <p>"Quick! the mule!" cried Lord Roberto, and as the servant, who had, cast the mantle over Bianca, now raised her slight form in his brawny arms, Berthold, the vine-dresser, appeared at the pass, leading a mule, saddled for immediate flight. In another instant the hapless girl was lifted to the back of the beast, and the servant seated himself behind her; the marquis at the same time led forward a horse, which he immediately mounted.</p> 
                  <p>"Now, good friend, farewell! We shall take care of her!" whispered he to the treacherous vine-dresser, who held the bridle of the mule. At this crisis, Berthold's wicked plot seemed completely successful.</p> 
                  <p>But at the moment when the marquis, reining his steed, and catching the bridle of the mule on which his servant held Bianca, was about to gallop from the mule-path toward his hunting-lodge, a new actor appeared upon the scene. Pietro, the hunter, tracking the route which Berthold had taken, reached the opening of the pass just as Lord Roberto and his ruffiian servant were spurring from the mule-path, leaving the vine-dresser to retrace his steps to Val d'Orazio. The youth needed but a glance to divine the situation of affairs. Hastily drawing the hunting-knife that he wore in his girdle, he leaped boldly from the rock which he had reached, and throwing himself upon the servant who sustained Bianca in his arms, drove the heavy blade of his weapon into his side. The man fell headlong from his mule, and Pietro, catching in his arms the fainting Bianca, turned to defend her against the other abductors.</p> 
                  <p>Berthold, ever crafty and watchful, had caught the first movement of Pietro, as the latter sprang from the rocks. The hunter, as he was aware, must have recognized him, and the fact of complicating in this nefarious action, he knew would seal his ruin should it ever be discovered to the villagers of Val d'Orazio. Perhaps it was this reflection, as much as any determined courage, which caused him, immediately upon the servant's fall, to rush forward and grapple with Pietro ere the Marquis Roberto had recovered from the shock occasioned by the young hunter's desperate assault upon his servant.</p> 
                  <p>Bianca, insensible and still enveloped in the thick folds of the cloak, sank upon the pathway, for the vine-dresser's fierce onset obliged Pietro to put forth his entire strength in order to protect himself. But he was young and used to violent exertion, his sinewy limbs well knit, and his spirit brave as that of a lion; consequently Berthold found as soon as they closed together, that the hunter was no feeble opponent.</p> 
                  <p>Both combatants were armed with hunting-knives, which in the first grapple they strove to use upon one another. Pietro, ere he relinquished his hold of Bianca, received a slight wound in his left arm; but the vine-dresser was repaid for the blow by a return stroke which divided his slouched hat, and nearly stunned him by the force with which it was dealt upon his forehead. He shouted aloud to Roberto:</p> 
                  <p>"Kill him!-stab this tiger, or he will ruin us all!"</p> 
                  <p>The marquis had by this time dismounted from his horse and approached Bianca; He turned at Berthold's wild appeal, and discharged a pistol at the hunter, who perceiving the attempt, avoided it by a desperate effort of his strength, which threw his body forward upon the vine-dresser. At this moment a shrill whistle rang through the defile, and two men clad in hunting garb, appeared far up on the rocks at the mouth of the pass. Pietro, clutching with both hands the throat of his antagonist, looked up for an instant and recognized two of his mountain comrades, who, hastening to the feast of Val d'Orazio, had at this juncture reached the mule-path. He uttered a loud shout of joy, and half released his panting foe, who, profiting by the opportunity, struck a fierce blow with his weapon at the young man's bosom. At the same time Lord Roberto fired a second pistol with a truer aim, for its bullet entered the shoulder of Pietro, who fell heavily to the earth.</p> 
                  <p>"Away now, or we are lost!" cried the vine-dresser, staggering to his feet. "The valley may be aroused ere we can escape!"</p> 
                  <p>"And leave my fair prize? No, good Berthold!" cried the marquis, as he lifted Bianca in his arms, while the cloak which had enveloped her fell to the ground.</p> 
                  <p>"The girl is dead!" exclaimed the vine-dresser, turning pale, as the countenance of the maiden, ghastly white, was revealed in the sunlight.</p> 
                  <p>"Thou liest!" muttered Lord Roberto, wrath-fully. "Mount yonder mule and follow; for by the fiend himself, I will secure this girl, though all Val d'Orazio rise to oppose me!"</p> 
                  <p>With these words Roberto sprang upon his horse, and clasping the still insensible form of Bianca before him, spurred with desperate speed adown the mule-path, towards the lower passes. Berthold needed no further stimulus to flight, for the two strange hunters, leaping from rock to rock in their hurried descent, had now nearly reached the nearest defile. He leaped at once upon the mule, from whose saddle Pietro had stricken Roberto's servant, and pressing the animal's sides, urged him rapidly down the path, in the direction taken by the marquis.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XX.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE MEETING ON THE CAUSEWAY.</head> 
                  <p>FRANCESCA and her father, while the vicissitudes of the changing fight of Milessimo were taking place beneath their observation, had leisure to reflect on their past and present situation. For the mind of the latter, the quietude and repose of a few weeks' sojourn among the goatherds of the mountains, after his departure from the <foreign xml:lang="ITA">albergo</foreign> of Bacco, had operated a great change, it is true-rendered more enduring, doubtless, by the constant presence and gentle influence of his daughter, who, striving to forget her own sorrows, devoted herself with single-hearted purpose to the pious task she had undertaken. Nevertheless, the breaking up of long-fixed habits, and the emancipation of a nature like that of Tomaso's, from the dominion of old associations, required the exercise of no ordinary skill and discretion in his young counsellor-for the brigand's memory, recurring at one time to deeds of rapine, seemed to close against his soul the gate of repentance, filling him with dismay and despair; at other seasons recalling the wild independence of his position as a bandit-chief, for many years, was constantly warring against the better spirit that had been awakened so lately, promising peace to his closing life.</p> 
                  <p>Francesca, however, faltered not in watchful kindness, by turns inspiring and soothing her wretched parent, with all the tender arts that a daughter's solicitude, joined with the pious resolution that actuated her, could render effective. At times, the poor girl, in the enthusiasm of what she believed her peculiar mission, nourished the hope that the iron energy and determination which, in spite of present physical weakness, still formed the chief ingredient in Tomaso's character, might yet be employed in the cause of that religion which the brigand's past career had mocked and slighted; in effect that her father, renewed in heart and body, might yet be permitted to dedicate his remaining years to the service of the church which had pardoned his past trangressions. Cherishing a hope like this, Francesca strove steadily to banish the recollection of her hapless affection for one whom she was forced to believe possessed no feelings kindred with her own higher emotions, and more than ever resolved to wean her thoughts from the world, in striving for her father's moral welfare.</p> 
                  <p>Tomaso, surveying the battle through the rapid changes that continually took place, felt at times a wild longing to mingle in the fray; and often he started up, as if about to leave the sheltered position which they occupied, when the restraining arm of Francesca wound rapidly around him, and a reaction of sudden weakness reminded him that he was still an invalid. The daughter marked these evidences of her father's secret agitation with much despondency, but she ceased not, nevertheless, in her endeavors to direct his thoughts to other things.</p> 
                  <p>"These armies, my father-these foolish men, fighting for they know not what-it makes me sad to look upon them."</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, Francesca, they combat for glory!"</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, is it glory, my father, to shed blood and feel that every soldier who falls leaves friends behind him to grieve evermore for his loss! O, were I amid yonder battle, and you awaiting here for my return-say, dear father, if I should be slain-"</p> 
                  <p>"Madonna shield thee, my child!-what sayest thou? To lose thee, Francesca, were death indeed to me!"</p> 
                  <p>"And could I survive thy loss, dear father?" murmured the maiden, leaning her check upon the brigand's hard bosom, as she sat beside him. "O, let us no more think of violence or battle! Let us hasten on our journey to the quiet valleys of Savoy. There, my father-there we may <emph>both</emph> be happy."</p> 
                  <p>As Francesca uttered these words, tears fell fast over her pale checks upon Tomaso's hand. A moisture gathered also in the captain's eyes, as he drew his daughter closer to his breast.</p> 
                  <p>"It shall be as thou desirest, my child," he said, in a changed voice. "Let us, in God's name, go on; and if He indeed make thee an instrument to save thy poor father from perdition, glory be to His name. I will not harden my heart against His mercy."</p> 
                  <p>Saying this, Tomaso kissed the girl's forehead, as if to seal his promise.</p> 
                  <p>Francesca was overjoyed, for this resolution of her father was expressed more decidedly than any of his former ones, and she knew the old brigand's firmness of character gave to this declaration the solemnity of an oath. She returned his embrace with fondness, and murmured in a low tone of voice:</p> 
                  <p>"The virgin be thanked for this. My prayers are indeed answered."</p> 
                  <p>At this juncture, while father and daughter were renewing pledges of mutual confidence, and exchanging their hopes for the future, a series of events involved them suddenly as actors in the drama that was transpiring around them.</p> 
                  <p>The pass, a defile, from which they had entered upon the wider causeway leading to the plain, and whence they had made a slight deviation to reach the overshelving rock that now concealed them, was one which penetrated far up, and through the centre of the rocky ranges, back to the Val d'Orazio. A portion of this defile, comprising a section of the route they had lately traversed, could be discerned by Francesca and her father from the sheltered position they now occupied, which latter likewise afforded them, as we have seen, a view of the entire field of battle beneath.</p> 
                  <p>Down this pass, crossing an opening in the rocky wall, through which Francesca could obtain a full view of their persons, the maiden now beheld two riders advancing almost toward the causeway. A single glance sufficed to assure her that one of these was Berthold the vinedresser, and a sensation of mingled terror and pleasure agitated her bosom for a moment, but as briefly gave place to feelings of another character.</p> 
                  <p>Berthold bestrode a mule, which he guided with one hand, while the other assisted to sustain upon his companion's horse a figure concealed by a dark mantle, but which Francesca divined at once to be a female. The cavalier who held this figure before him, was one whose face was known to the brigand's daughter, as she had often seen him from a distance when, wandering through the hills, she had paused to watch the hunting train of Lord Roberto skirting the forest's edge, or ranging over the broader passes.</p> 
                  <p>Not unknown to her either was the evil reputation of the libertine marquis; and now as she recognized him, evidently in the prosecution of some wicked enterprise, in which Berthold was his assistant, the poor maiden's heart encountered a new shock, in the confumation which it thus received of all her sad impressions concerning her late lover. She gazed steadfastly at the advancing riders, her eyes dilated, her mouth compressed, and her breast heaving with excitement. Tomaso, reclining upon the rock, whilst the maiden stood beside him, noticed her sudden agitation.</p> 
                  <p>"What seest, Francesca? Art frightened, my child?"</p> 
                  <p>"Look, father! Know you those travellers descending the pass?" whispered the girl, assisting the still feeble brigand to gain a more elevated position.</p> 
                  <p>"Surely, the one is Berthold, the other Marquis Roberto-"</p> 
                  <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6326-00000038"/> 
                  <p>"And they have yet another with them, my father. Seest thou not?"</p> 
                  <p>"Ha! the marquis is at his wild tricks, I doubt not. A goodly brace-the vine-aresser and the lord!"</p> 
                  <p>Francesca felt another pang shoot through her heart as she thought of her ill-omened love for one whose character her father evidently well understood; but she had not long to dwell upon this reflection, for the two riders had now descended quite to the outlet of the pass, and halting on the wider ridge which sloped towards the plain, surveyed in astonishment the panorama of battle suddenly disclosed to them.</p> 
                  <p>"Father, I must learn what these men do purpose," cried Francesca, preparing to descend the rock.</p> 
                  <p>"Nay, nay, Francesca-what hast thou to do with these?"</p> 
                  <p>"Fear not-they will not discover me," an swered the maiden, stepping lightly around the jutting base of the cliff, where her quick eye had before descried a narrow fissure, which conducting near to the point where the group had halted, would enable her to approach unseen within hearing distance. Quick as her determination she glided from her father's side, and moved noiselessly to the extremity of the fissure, and there, effectually hidden from observation by a mass of tangled brush that sprouted from the interstice, found herself within a couple of yards of the mule bestridden by her unworthy lover.</p> 
                  <p>Lord Roberto, as he checked his horse, had lifted the mantle that enveloped Bianca's form, and the brigand's daughter beheld reclining upon the noble's breast, the face of a maiden younger than herself, and beautiful as that of an angel; but it was deathly pale, and the bloodless lips were half apart, revealing the small white teeth set as if in death.</p> 
                  <p>In truth, Bianca, wrapped in a swoon, from which she had partially awakened during three hours' ride from the mule-path, where she had been betrayed-awakened only to relapse, after a choking effort to cry out, stifled by the rude hand of her abductor.</p> 
                  <p>At the instant when Francesca looked from her hiding place, Bianca's pale and lovely features, supported on the breast of the reckless marquis, were turned full towards her, and though she recognized them not, a feeling of womanly sympathy immediately filled her bosom; but at this instant, Berthold's voice struck harshly upon her ear.</p> 
                  <p>"My lord, we cannot proceed-the Frenchmen fill yonder plain, and-"</p> 
                  <p>"Peace!-we sleep not till we reach Milan."</p> 
                  <p>"But will your lordship risk the life of-"</p> 
                  <p>"She'll not die, good fellow! Take you heed that we break not our necks over these confounded precipices, or encounter any of yonder vagabond soldiery, and I'll insure our safe conduct otherwise."</p> 
                  <p>"By Saint Jeronimo! I must not return to Val d'Orazio," returned Berthold.</p> 
                  <p>"Be faithful, Berthold, and you shall not regret this business. It is true that yonder meddlesome hunter was settled for."</p> 
                  <p>"Ay, my lord, <emph>he</emph> will tell no tales! I fear only that the others recognized us-or your lordship's poor servant, who Pietro slew."</p> 
                  <p>"Tut," answered Roberto; "that fellow was new in my service, and if he be known or not, it cannot hurt me; but let us at once descend, and as these rocks are better known to you, Berthold, go forward with the mule, and show me some quiet defile by which we may skirt yonder plain. I have no mind to be stabbed by these <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sans culottes</foreign> Frenchmen, who have brought their republican doctrines into our goodly Italy. Away, friend, let us hasten!"</p> 
                  <p>Berthold, turning the head of his mule, prepared to follow Lord Roberto's directions; but an obstacle suddenly interposed. A female form descended the rocky wall on which they were halting, and placed itself in the vine-dresser's pathway. He recognized Francesca, the daughter of Tomaso.</p> 
                  <p>"Berthold!" exclaimed the maiden, in a tone rendered shrill by her excited feelings; "Berthold, what new work of darkness is this? Whither would you bear this poor girl?"</p> 
                  <p>The vine-dresser startled by Francesca's sudden appearance, and her first address, could utter no word in reply, while Lord Roberto began to survey curiously the rare beauty of the maiden, illumined by the eloquent animation that flushed her face with rich blood. Thus, for an instant, the group remained-the brigand's daughter standing before the mule, her form towering in proud loveliness as she fixed her dark eyes upon the trembling vine-dresser; the marquis, almost forgetful of the pale, insensible woman he held, in gazing at the dark resplendent creature who had so strangely burst upon them; and Berthold, himself, grasping nervously the mane of his mule, while he began to frame a language meet for his deceptive thoughts.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"Francesca!" he commenced, striving the while to discover by some sign in the maiden's countenance, if she yet felt toward him the love that she had once confessed; but Tomaso's daughter turned not her calm look from his changing features, nor relaxed its sorrowing but cold expression; then yielding to the natural dictates of his brutal nature, he changed his demeanor at once, and cried, in a sneering tone: "Art jealous, my pretty bandit's child? Faith, thy Berthold is true to thee, spite of new faces. Where is Tomaso, sweetheart?"</p> 
                  <p>The withering glance which shot from Francesca's eyes at this audacious speech from him for whom she had still cherished a yearning affection, forced Berthold to drop his bold gaze to the ground. Nevertheless, his evil nature had displayed itself, and he continued, with a sneering laugh:</p> 
                  <p>"Better mount with me, sweet Francesca! Many a time have you said you loved me. Come away, for I doubt not my Lord Roberto is willing."</p> 
                  <p>"Leave not so fair a sweetheart behind, worthy Berthold," laughed the marquis. "Twere shame, indeed, for so gallant a vine-dresser to do thus!"</p> 
                  <p>"Are you indeed lost, <emph>lost,</emph> Berthold!" cried Francesca, in a voice so full of sorrow that its tones would have moved any hearers save the two heartless ones before her; but he to whom the appeal was addressed, answered with a gloomy scowl:</p> 
                  <p>"Come, by the fiend! Francesca, thou has provoked me long enough! No more will I be trifled with by thee! I know not wherefore thou art here, or in what company; but by San Geronimo! I'll not leave thee behind, my sweetheart!"</p> 
                  <p>As he said this, Berthold pressed the mule to one side, and bending from the saddle threw his strong arm around Francesca's waist, lifting her from the ground to a seat before him as easily as a child would raise its doll. At the same moment, Bianca, suddenly awakening from the deep swoon in which she had been plunged raised a feeble cry of terror, as she became half conscious of her situation. It was responded to by Francesca with a shriek that echoed loudly through the surrounding hills.</p> 
                  <p>Tomaso, awaiting his daughter at a few yards distance, heard those cries directly beneath the rock that concealed him from those upon the causeway, at the same time that it intervened to prevent his witnessing Francesca's interview with Berthold. Tomaso heard, distinguishing his daughter's voice, and quick as thought the old brigand flame burned up within him. It was but a second that the shriek vibrated upon his brain when, forgetting his pain and weakness, forgetting aught but that Francesca was in peril, the old captain sprang around the jutting rock, and reached the causeway just as Lord Roberto, having wound his cloak closely about Bianca's head, to silence her once more, was spurring his steed to descend the broader road. Dashing furiously against the marquis at first, Tomaso, the next moment, caught sight of Berthold clasping Francesca tightly in his arms, while bowing over the mule's neck, he prepared to urge the animal to a headlong flight toward the plain.</p> 
                  <p>The plain itself, at this crisis, presented a singular appearance. While two compact columns of the French army, attacking the town of Dego at different parts, had succeeded in silencing the main batteries, and driving the Austrian centre, the greater portion of the republican troops were scattered in brigades and squadrons over a large area, extending deep into the hills, through the lower defiles. These detached forces were now reuniting as rapidly as possible, though several were in actual conflict with portions of the enemy's troops retreating toward the Bormida.</p> 
                  <p>Tomaso beholding the desperate design of the vine-dresser, seized the bridle of the mule, and strove to stay his career. The old man's limbs, albeit enfeebled by his late sickness, were yet tough, and his grasp was tenacious enough to swerve the mule aside as Berthold urged him forward; but the captain's hand sought in vain for the weapons which of old ever hung at his belt-his trusty dagger and a brace of heavy pistols. They were no longer there, and the brigand, with a return of his ancient passion, muttered an oath as be endeavored to seize the dress of Francesca, while at the same time he retained the mule by an iron grasp of the bridle.</p> 
                  <p>Berthold saw his personal danger, and recollected his late companion's character. At once he knew that it was life or death between him and Tomaso: and with a darker scowl blackening<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6326-00000039"/> ing his sullen visage, he drew his hunting-knife, yet red with Pietro's blood, and struck at the father's breast. Tomaso, staggering under the" blow, released his hold of the bridle, and the mule, with her double burthen, clattered down the causeway, following the strong steed that bore the marquis and Bianca.</p> 
                  <p>The road leading to the plain wound between perpendicular walls of rock for a hundred yards, and then opened abruptly upon a broad platform, from which a series of hillocks and slight elevations sloped to the field of battle on either side of the river. The vine-dresser, grasping in his arms with fierce determination the shrieking Francesca, who, in spite of her struggles, found herself completely powerless, in her captor's embrace, soon came up with Lord Roberto, and hastily crying, "Turn to the left-yonder is a safe pass leading from the plains," dashed forward, and led the descent.</p>

               <div type="chapter"> 
                   
                  <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">VALENTINE THE SOLDIER.</head> 
                  <p>THE pass to which Berthold, well-acquainted with all the, hill region, now directed his course, was the same which we have noticed as being so suddenly filled with a French force detached in an early stage of the neighboring conflict, to gain by a circuitous route a position favorable for co-operation in the main assault upon Dego. Through this path the vine-dresser knew that a secure detour might be made, conducting them away from the Bormida and its dangerous vicinity, toward the great highway to Milan, where, once arrived, the marquis, he was aware, could safely defy the humble friends of the abducted Bianca.</p> 
                  <p>Nevertheless a new enemy was before them, advancing like themselves toward the path that promised them so easy a method of avoiding interference. Hardly had the encumbered riders turned to leave the causeway, when close beneath they saw a battalion of cuirassiers, followed immediately by a scattered body of tiralleurs, sweep upward toward the heights. Berthold at once drew bridle to avoid the fierce celerity with which the soldiers pressed upward over the uneven ground; but ere he could effect his purpose the adjacent hillocks and the, causeway itself were covered by the French, whose onward ranks wound between the two riders enveloping them in a cloud of dust. Francesca at this, crisis threw out her arms, and gave utterance to another shriek for succor.</p> 
                  <p>But the dense battalion, regardless of aught but the imperious force of military discipline that urged it forward, had no ear for a feeble woman's cry. Almost sudden as its approach was its sweeping disappearance up the rough ascent-so sudden indeed that the Marquis Roberto, clasping his muffled prize with one arm, whilst with the other he strove to guide his steed, which had been carried onward in the whirl of the troops, found himself now in peril of being crushed in the press or entangled in the advance of the French. It was impossible at the moment to rejoin his companion, for the tiralleurs, drawing closer together, now filled the cause way between them, and the noble, rather than attempt to force his way through these, chose rather to urge his horse directly away from the securer pass toward a narrow ridge that shelved steeply downward to the hillocks whence the scattered tiralleurs were now converging. There he hoped to maintain at least a foothold till the soldiers should debouch by the pass above.</p> 
                  <p>But the shriek uttered by Francesca, though it failed to arrest the iron-clad curassiers, had not been raised in vain. The echo of its despair had hardly ceased to vibrate, when a soldier, blackened with dust and powder, sprang<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6326-00000040"/> from the rearmost rank of the tiralleurs, and darted toward the Marquis Roberto, whose attempt to back his steed had withdrawn his attention for an instant from the burden which he held. During that instant, the mantle which had closely concealed Bianca, became detached from her shoulders, and fell trailing from the saddle-bow, and the marble-white countenance of the swooning girl were revealed distinctly in the sunlight-the features beautiful, thought so death-like, turned upward from the breast on which the head was leaning.</p> 
                  <p>Lord Roberto had no need for further care of his horse, for a strong man's hand clutched the bridle, and threw the animal upon its haunches. Then, as the insecure ground crumbled beneath its iron hoofs, the steed reared affrightedly, and rolled over the sloping ridge, whilst the marquis, reeling in the saddle, fell backward heavily upon the rough stones; but ere horse or rider struck the earth, Bianca, still unconscious, was caught in the outstretched arms of the soldier Valentine.</p> 
                  <p>Little space had the comrades of the daring tiralleur to marvel at, if they indeed noticed, his sudden action-for closing their ranks as they neared the upper pass, the long line dashed amid the hills and disappeared from the dusty causeway, leaving the hunter-soldier sustaining on his bosom the drooping form of a woman, whilst the man whom he had hurled from the saddle, lay motionless and insensible upon the stony ridge.</p> 
                  <p>Berthold, meantime, separated by the rushing battalions from his employer, and forced to control at once the motions of his mule and the strength of the struggling Francesca, who he had believed would speedily become reconciled to her captor, but whose resistance was redoubled at every attempt which he made to soothe her, had not as yet become aware of Roberto's rencontre; nevertheless, perceiving as he paused amid the cloud of dust raised by the rushing military, that the marquis lingered behind, the vine-dresser turned his mule, and beheld his companion's situation, though without recognizing the strange soldier who had overthrown him. Not so, however, Valentine, who supporting Bianca in his arms, fixed his astonished gaze upon the female whom his brother held upon the mule, while he exclaimed:</p> 
                  <p>"Berthold! is it thee? What means all this?"</p> 
                  <p>Berthold, though he had failed to discern in the blackened figure before him the man who of all others he least desired to encounter, could not but be assured by that voice that Valentine was actually there; and no sooner did he become aware of this than the ruffian feelings which had been gaining strength with each new struggle of Francesca for release, burst forth into desperation. Springing from the mule, and recklessly dashing his burthen to the ground, he leaped towards Valentine, and aimed a blow at his heart with the weapon already twice stained with human blood that day. It was a murderous stroke, and the young soldier, sustaining with one arm the still fainting Bianca, had doubtless sunk beneath it, had not an unlooked for hand restrained the vine-dresser's motives, interposing suddenly between him and his brother. It was Monna Barbara!</p> 
                  <p>Wierd-like and unearthly seemed the crone, thus gliding suddenly into the sunlight from behind the rocky wall which on one side here terminated in the open plateau. She threw her thin form before the furious Berthold, her bright eyes shining with more than mortal lustre, as she fixed them upon the distorted visage of her eldest born. The vine-dresser's uplifted arm trembled, even while it threatened his brother's breast; but it was only for a moment that his purpose faltered.</p> 
                  <p>"The dog shall die!" he muttered, savagely. "Stand aside, woman, if you value your own life!"</p> 
                  <p>"I value it not, ungrateful!-but thou shalt not take it!" replied Monna Barbara, still pressing before her desperate son.</p> 
                  <p>But at this moment a shout that startled a thousand echoes, rang through the neighboring defiles; and breaking like wild deer from above, a score of hunters leaped suddenly from the rocks upon the causeway; and between the foremost two, their arms upholding his sinking frame, appeared the old Tomaso.</p> 
                  <p>Francesca, who had meanwhile risen from the ground to which her felon lover had flung her in his rage, rushed in an instant to her father's side; while Berthold, recognizing the men of Val d'Orazio, felt that his doom was sealed should he fall into their hands; but his habitual craft failed him not at this crisis, for seizing the moment of confusion to spring upon the mule, he spurred the animal with furious speed toward the pass he had previously sought to enter. The hunters saw his movement and attempted to intercept him, but he had already gained a hundred dred yards advance, desperately urging his flight toward the hills.</p> 
                  <p>"Let not the villain escape! Follow me!" cried the first hunter, dashing forward in pursuit.</p> 
                  <p>His companions delayed not an instant, but dispersing simultaneously to various accessible parts of the rocks, prepared to cut off the retreat of the fugitive.</p> 
                  <p>Monna Barbara, whilst this rapid transition of circumstances was taking place, stood in the attitude which she had assumed in attempting to stay the vine-dresser's violence, with her witch-like head thrown back, and her arms extended rigidly before her; but a strange alteration was apparent in her countenance; the eyes no longer sparkled brightly, but, fixed and staring, seemed clouded by a deadly film; her features, alike immobile, seemed palsied, as did her whole frame, by some fearful memory just awakening in her brain. They were turned toward the girl Francesca and the wounded Tomaso, whom the former sustained upon her breast, whilst she supported the brigand's drooping head with her encircling arm.</p> 
                  <p>That strange, out-wandering expression which Monna Barbara's face had once worn when, in her gloomy hut, she had discovered the small cross of jet, gleaming like a star through the darkness, now again marked her withered lineaments, succeeded as before by a singular softening of the rigid muscles and a moistening of the hard eyes. Thus the crone remained for a few moments, taking no apparent heed of Valentine who stood beside her, nor of the sudden flight of Berthold, pursued by his vengeful enemies. Then slowly, as if fearful to distract her own tensity of vision, she crept, rather than walked, towards the old Tomaso.</p> 
                  <p>The wounded brigand raised his swimming eyes as the woman approached, and for another brief space the two gazed at each other, an expression of wild recognition overspreading Tomaso's countenance, which seemed to re-illume as it were with a flash of many memories. His lips opened as if to speak, but only a feeble murmur broke from them. He clasped his hands together, and outstretched them toward Monna Barbara.</p> 
                  <p>"Berthold!" shrieked the crone, staggering nearer to the brigand, and sinking prostrate upon the ground at his feet.</p> 
                  <p>Tomaso raised himself with a violent effort from his daughter's bosom. His breast heaved, his uplifted hands shook for an instant as with an ague fit, then fell heavily downward, clasping the shrivelled neck of Monna Barbara.</p> 
                  <p>"Barbara! Barbara!" he cried, in a half-stifled tone; "My wife-my Barbara!"</p> 
                  <p>Valentine and Francesca-for the hunters had all departed in pursuit of the vine-dresser-alone witnessed this strange scene, and the former, absorbed in his efforts to restore the fainting Bianca to consciousness, gave little heed to aught else that might occur. The horse which his strong hand had backed till the rider was unseated, now careered wildly over the plain, while the master, Lord Roberto, lay stretched over a rough ledge, stunned by a violent blow which he had received in falling. Francesca still knelt beside her sire, watching his strange agitation, and startled with the words that, breaking so suddenly from his lips, revealed the existence of a parent whom the maiden believed to have died while she herself was yet a child. It was with trembling anxiety that she awaited further revelation of the mystery that enveloped her.</p> 
                  <p>And this was not long delayed; for as the clasped arms of Tomaso embraced his long lost wife, the vine-dresser's mother raised herself slowly to her knees, and placing her withered hands upon the brigand's cheeks, pressed back his head, and gazed long and tenderly upon the manly, and it might be still handsome features.</p> 
                  <p>"It is he!" she murmured, the tears gushing from her eyes. "It is, indeed, my Berthold-the husband of my happy youth!"</p> 
                  <p>Then flashed over Monna Barbara's memory a portion of the vision which had softened her heart in the lonely hovel of Val d'Orazio. Again recalling the dim past, she knelt beside her brigand husband in the cavern of a Swiss mountain, illumined by the glow of sunset, bathing his wounded side, while their children sported on the rocks without; again she beheld that husband dragged from her embrace by the fierce soldiers who had tracked him to his hidingplace; again-</p> 
                  <p>But as the painful vision rushed athwart the woman's recollection, her eyes encountered those of Francesca, fixed with earnest but wondering expression upon her face. The sight recalled her to the present. She glanced inquiringly at Tomaso, and at once, by the light that broke from the old man's features, divined what she would have asked.</p> 
                  <p>"My daughter!" murmured the crone, and tottered feebly toward Francesca.</p> 
                  <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6326-00000041"/> 
                  <p>"And-my son-our-Berthold!" cried the brigand, with a look full of anxious meaning.</p> 
                  <p>The words seemed to pierce Monna Barbara's heart like a dagger. She forgot her weakness, her memories, her joy-she thought only of that wretched one who even now was fleeing for his life before a score of angry foes.</p> 
                  <p>"There!-there!" she shrieked, pointing her withered hand upward to the Alpine range.</p> 
                  <p>The sun, long since ascended to its zenith, now sloped its rays over the western side of the mountains. The smoke of battle, hanging low upon the plain and river, rendered the surrounding atmosphere dense and murky; but on the elevated region to which Monna Barbara's gaze was now directed, all was clear, and every outline distinctly visible in the beams of day. The mule and its fugitive rider were no longer with in sight; but the hunters of Val d'Orazio. could still be discerned, occupying various points of the upland, but though seemingly dispersed, were evidently shaping. their paths towards a high hill, or rather rocky shaft, which cut the central background of the landscape, towering over the encircling hills and ridges. These mountaineers appeared to be pursuing the race with the same vigor that had marked their first appearance, and so lofty a track had they already gained, that only faint echoes of their encouraging shouts came back to the causeway. Still seeming to abate no portion of their determination, the vengeful comrades of Pictro toiled in their ascent toward the base of the white-walled rock that lifted its narrow summit like a vast altar prepared for some fearful rite of sacrifice.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE VINE-DRESSER'S FLIGHT.</head> 
                  <p>WHILE the scene was transpiring which we have described as taking place between Monna Barbara and her newly-discovered kindred, the rescued Bianca had unclosed her eyes once more, and recalling her faculties, happily oblivious through the greater portion of the dangers through which she had been hurried since her betrayal by the vine-dresser, recognized in time on whose breast she now reclined-not the hateful abductor, Lord Roberto, but her own true and long-wept lover, Valentine. The joy of such a meeting had nearly deprived the poor maiden of her consciousness once more; but the young soldier's warm embrace, and the, kiss of ardent affection which he imprinted upon her lip, were too real and earnest, to bewilder her. She clung convulsively to his breast, as if her happiness might be insecure, and in doing so, her eyes fell upon the insensible form of the Marquis Roberto, lying prostrate at a few paces distant, his cheeks pale, and lips closed as if in death. She shuddered at the spectacle, and laid her face upon Valentine's bosom.</p> 
                  <p>"Fear not, my Bianca! No one shall harm thee now, my beloved!" cried the young soldier, tenderly clasping the trembling form which he sustained.</p> 
                  <p>"Alas! is he dead?" murmured the maiden.</p> 
                  <p>"Nay, I doubt me that a fall from his horse could have slain him, though 'twas an ugly rock that received his lordly head as he fell," answered Valentine. "But, dear Bianca, what means all this? My mother here, and Berthold, and-in Heaven's name, dear one, speak of thyself!" he added, in an anxious tone.</p> 
                  <p>Bianca raised her gaze to her lover's agitated countenance, and seemed about; to reply; but at this moment the shrill voice of Monna Barbara startled them both, drawing their regards to the other group, and they beheld the crone's shrivelled arm extended toward the mountain top.</p> 
                  <p>It was now apparent to what purpose the hunters of Val d'Orazio had dispersed in the beginning of their pursuit of Berthold, and were now converging from every point. The path through which the fugitive had desperately, directed his flight, was one which for a few hundred ascending yards presented ample breadth and foothold for a mule, but beyond this distance began to wind, becoming narrower and more perilous as its altitude increased, until at length it conducted to the lofty rock already noticed as springing from the centre of the mural wall. Here all pathway vanished, and nothing, save the foot of a mountaineer, or that of a chamois-goat, might essay to climb the almost perpendicular steeps, rising one above another, and disclosing a track, it track it could be called, so precarious as would<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6326-00000042"/> terrify any but a desperate man from attempting its passage.</p> 
                  <p>Notwithstanding the dangers of the ascent, however, those whose looks followed the direction of Monna Barbara's arm, could distinguish the figure of a man slowly toiling up the ridges of the central rock, pausing ever and anon as if checked by some obstacle, or faint from weariness. This figure, which they knew at once to be the wretched Berthold, had already gained a point which apparently bade defiance to a pursuit on the part of any one less desperate than him who sought escape, and such seemed to be the opinion of the Alpine hunters, who halting half way down the white-ridged rock, appeared now to consult regarding the safety of ascending further.</p> 
                  <p>This was the position of things as Monna Barbara, gasping with stifled utterance the words, "There! there!" attracted the gaze of those near her to the from of her felon son as he appeared in full view, clinging to the jagged point of a rock that overhung a dizzy precipice, whilst his feet unsupported by a hunter's staff, so indispensable to security in Alpine districts, strove to maintain their precarious hold upon the slippery ledge which they had reached. Three hundred feet below the ledge, the mountain-men of Val d'Orazio were crowded together, gazing up, apparently appalled at the daring progress of the fugitive.</p> 
                  <p>For a few moments it seemed that the bold energy of Berthold were to be crowned with success. Slowly, inch by inch as it were, he seemed to creep across the face of the rock, ascending transversely from side to side. Above him, perhaps not higher than fifteen feet, was a platform, or wide ledge, which once gained would afford him a resting-place, and doubtless enable him to discover some pass or outlet by which he might pass from the central rock into the otherwise inaccessible interior of the great range that it hid from view. This apparently seemed to have occurred to the fugitive on attempting his perilous ascent, and he now, as was evident, depended upon gaining the platform as the last hope of escape.</p> 
                  <p>To the hunters at the base of the shaft like eminence, this platform above appeared as a white marble capstone to the great column. It was in fact a huge and compact mass of ice that had gathered, unmelted, through many seasons, and now overlapped the cliff beneath like a glittering cornice. Berthold as he glared upward, could discern a wide gap in this glacier, which he judged to denote a fissure that would assist him in his progress, perhaps discover to him a path by which he might descend upon the inner range, and he felt a ray of hope succeeding to the dogged desperation with which he had hitherto prosecuted the ascent; but this ray was destined to be quenched in a darkness deeper than despair.</p> 
                  <p>For, as the vine-dresser, cautiously dragging his feet from ridge to ridge, and clinging nervously to the projections of the rock with his hands, till the blood streamed from the swollen fingers, reached the verge of that fissure which he had sought to gain, and grasped, its jagged rim, he beheld a sudden rocking of the white mass above, announcing the insecurity of the platform that he had fancied might afford him ample resting-place. He saw the bed of glittering ice starting from the rock on which it had so long been poised, and moving toward the precipice; he heard a shivering and a cracking as the glacier surged above him, and the wretched man saw that his fate was inevitable. One effort, however, wild as the desperate shrick that broke from his lips, he made to cast himself forward into the gap that divided the icy platform; but it was too late. The great mass of congealed snow and ridged ice slid slowly forward, swayed majestically for a moment over his head, then overlapped and become unbalanced on the edge of the cliff. Flashing for a second in the slanting sunbeams, it then plunged downward, roaring and crashing, and falling at length, crushed and splintered into a myriad of fragments upon the rocky bases of the mountain. The hunters of Val d'Orazio, fleeing in consternation before the descending ruin, looked backward to the height where they had last distinguished the vine-dresser.</p> 
                  <p>But Berthold was no longer there-the avalanche had accomplished its work!</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">RECOGNITIONS.</head> 
                  <p>"THE ALPS," said Sir Walter Scott, "seem a barrier erected by nature herself, on which she has inscribed in gigantic characters, 'Here let ambition be stayed!'" Nevertheless, it was upon the highest plateau of one of the loftiest Alpine ranges, that the great modern conqueror of Europe, in the month of April, 1796, fixed his camp at Montezemato, overlooking all the great valley district of Piedmont, with their thousand rivers descending like belts of silver from the icy robes of the surrounding mountains. A month's campaign, during which he had gained three well-contested battles, and forced his way through perilous passes, and over immense precipices, into the heart of an hostile country, had at this period placed the "Man of Destiny" in full possession of a dozen strong fortresses, well named "The Keys of all Sardinia." Here throned upon snows, and threatening the whole north of Italy, Napoleon in his head-quarters presented a sort of prophetic foreshadowing of his mighty after-eminence, when, from the summit of his ambition, he was to give laws to fallen kings, and threaten the entire world.</p> 
                  <p>But we have at present no further business with the embryo emperor, or his yet unrevealed destiny, but must beg the reader's attention to a little group which, halting at the base of a some what steep rise of hills, appeared to be engaged in some affair which occupied their close attention.</p> 
                  <p>Very wild but picturesque and sublime scenery filled up the back ground, and stretched far away upwards and downwards on every side of the small area where appeared the group above mentioned.</p> 
                  <p>Below, extended like a great map, the territory of Piedmont-afar off the beautiful cities of Genoa, Milan and Turin. Down the abrupt declivities of the mountains, whose long-gathered snows were now fast yielding to the power of spring, descended numberless torrents, sweeping over huge rocks, and tumultuously dashing through rocky channels, in falls and cataracts of wondrous magnificence. Up among the crowning peaks lay immense glaciers which, as they presented their slanting surfaces to the sun, seemed like seas frozen in the fulness of their tides, from the midst of which at varying intervals, arose solid globes and columns of white-crusted snow, the deposit and accumulation of countless avalanches.</p> 
                  <p>At various points in the perspective view from that lofty mountain, on whose height Napoleon Bonaparte had now stationed his head-quarters, were visible a succession of strongly-fortified castles, looking down like sentinels upon the<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6326-00000043"/> seat of war. In the valleys, and on the plateaux and hillsides, could be discerned long lines of huts and tents, the hastily-erected shelter of the different columns of the French army which, under various generals, encamped around the district, from which the Austro-Sardinian troops had been driven by the result of the last battle. This encampment also occupied the gorges and defiles opening from the horizon's line on the borders of the Tuscan states.</p> 
                  <p>Such was the gorgeous panorama unrolled before the gaze of him whose mysterious star was now beginning to cast the brilliant light which afterwards became so lurid and baleful; but apparently the scene possessed no attractions to the persons who, as before said, occupied a depression of one of the hilly ranges, and seemed for the moment absorbed in matters of a more personal interest. In truth, a scene was transpiring which, however common upon the stage of war, and the accessories of fatigue, wounds and exposures, is always fraught with an interest inseparable from mortal hopes and fears-a human being was dying.</p> 
                  <p>With most of the individuals who made up this group our readers are already familiar. On one side, leaning upon his musket, stood the corporal, Maitre Pierre, his gray moustache and weather-beaten cheeks in strong contrast to the youthful countenance of Valentine, who stood beside him, deprived of his arms and guarded by two soldiers of his company. The young man's head was uncovered, and his drooping eyes were turned fondly upon the maiden, Bianca, who sat on a stony ledge, holding his hand in hers, while her tender looks seemed responding to the sad feelings which apparently possessed him. Monna Barbara knelt upon the earth near by, her aged bosom supporting the head of Tomaso, whose features were now overspread with the ashen hue that presages dissolution. Francesca, with her hands clasped about her dying sire, and praying audibly, her voice thick with bitter grief, which she strove vainly to suppress. Altogether, this group upon the mountain-side presented a picture of suffering and sorrow that could not fail to awaken the deepest sympathy in the breast even of a stranger, as was apparent from the demeanor of Maitre Pierre, who with difficulty mastered his emotion sufficiently to prevent a gush of tears from his fast-moistening eyes. As it was, the brave corporal found occasion to dash his hand across his brow more than once as he listened to Francesca's broken prayers, and Monna Barbara's sobbing responses. He took, nervously, a pinch or two of snuff, and then in a low voice addressing Valentine, said hurriedly:</p> 
                  <p>"Comrade, it is hard for me to keep you here a prisoner, since no more gallant youth than yourself fought in yesterday's battle; and as yonder poor people are your family, comrade, and-<foreign xml:lang="FRA">peste!</foreign>-I know not what I am saying-notwithstanding, you bear no ill will to Maitre Pierre, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon pere</foreign>-eh?"</p> 
                  <p>"No, comrade!" answered Valentine, taking the hand which the corporal extended. "If I have forfeited my life and must suffer, you, Maitre Pierre, are not the cause. You must do your duty!"</p> 
                  <p>"That is spoken like a soldier, comrade; but you must not think they will be so harsh with you. It is true <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Les Regles</foreign> says death to the soldier who leaves his ranks; but it was no cowardice in thee, my brave fellow, as we all know who saw thee fighting like an old Roman instead of a raw recruit. Besides, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon colonel</foreign> who sent me to take charge of thee, said: 'Treat him well, Corporal Pierre, for he is a brave youth!' No, no, they will not treat thee harshly for a slip out of the ranks, when the battle was almost over, too."</p> 
                  <p>As Maitre Pierre delivered himself of this opinion, he renewed his applications to the iron <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tobatiere</foreign> which he held poised between his fingers. Valentine smiled faintly in response, and then bent his head to whisper soothingly to Bianca, whilst the stifled prayers of the other maiden trembled on their ears. At this moment, the near sound of horses' hoofs gave notice of the sudden approach of men, accessories to the scene. It was the colonel of the regiment to which Maitre Pierre and Valentine were attached, who, with a couple of subalterns, now rode up the slight elevation, and reined their horses near the sorrowful group! Their presence caused a sudden action of surprise in two of the actors of our story, which checked the prayer of Francesca, and caused even the wandering senses of her dying father to revive for an instant into animation.</p> 
                  <p>The colonel of the regiment, as he checked his steed immediately opposite the stiff figure of Maitre Pierre, had raised his chapeau from his forehead with one hand, and discovered a countenance very dignified and commanding, but at the same time radiant with benevolence. In that countenance, as his glance was lifted, the young hunter Valentine beheld the well-known lineaments of one for whom he had suffered much-whom he had till now believed dead-the stranger of the sable mantle-the traveller whom with Nicolo he had guided to the "Huguenots" Altar, on the fearful night of the avalanche. Here, erect and living before his eyes, Valentine once more beheld the noble form and gallant mien of a man for whose supposed murder his own life had been imperilled.</p> 
                  <p>And with the certainty of recognition that stamped the identity of the traveller, another strange discovery flashed across the mind of Valentine. The majestic figure before him, at once the colonel of the regiment and the stranger whom he had believed lost, assumed another character. He was the hero of yesterday's conflict, the gallant French officer whom Valentine's timely aid and boldness had saved from the combined attack of a dozen foes. As the consciousness of this fact flushed the young soldier's cheek, his eyes met the calm gaze of his colonel, and the mysterious <foreign xml:lang="FRA">rapport</foreign> of intelligence which had marked the first glances exchanged between the two in the hovel of Monna Barbara, now renewed its influence upon both.</p> 
                  <p>But, while pausing a moment, as if for steady regards of one another, the young soldier and his colonel remained silent and motionless, a strange, low cry from Monna Barbara suddenly drew their attention. They looked toward her, and saw that the old woman's features were strangely agitated; she had suffered the head of the dying Tomaso to drop upon her lap, and with her bright piercing eyes fixed upon the stranger's face, seemed recalling some dim yet fearful memory of her previous life. The scrutiny was rapid and brief, yet seemingly fraught with satisfaction-for Monna Barbara's dark features became overspread with a light that softened their harsh outlines into a look of deep thankfulness and peace. She beckoned feebly, nodding her head, and the colonel, swayed by a strange impulse, dismounted at once, and throwing his bridle to Maitre Pierre, drew near the aged woman. Valentine, as if controlled by a like influence, dropped Bianca's hand, and approached Monna Barbara on the other side.</p> 
                  <p>As the two thus stood before the crone, whilst Tomaso's glazing eyes looked upward from her lap, and the beautiful countenance of Francesca suffused with tears, was raised in mute surprise, the glance of Valentine and his colonel again interchanged, seemed to renew the singular sympathy that apparently united their natures. Monna Barbara recognized this, and her eyes grew brighter and her features yet softer in their expression. She slowly outstretched her thin fingers, and clasping the hands of each drew them together, uniting them as if in friendship. Then in a clear and distinct tone she said:</p> 
                  <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Sieur Montaldi</foreign>-thou, whose house twenty years ago was burned by brigands-thou, who wert then deprived of thine only child-behold him now before thee! Sieur Montaldi, this young man is thy son-that long-lost child!"</p> 
                  <p>At the old woman's first words, which revealed his name, the colonel seemed to recall in his mind a terrible occurrence of the past, and as the revelation proceeded his face grew pale as marble, and then became flushed with returning blood. Then, as the crone ceased speaking, he pressed his hand to his breast as if to calm the tumult of the heart beneath, and exclaimed in a broken voice:</p> 
                  <p>"Great God! can this be true?"</p> 
                  <p>Monna Barbara hastily thrust her hand beneath the coarse jacket that covered her neck, and drew forth the cross of jet which she had found upon the floor of her hovel in Val d'Orazio. Attached to this cross by its chain, there now appeared a small golden armlet, such as might have decked the infant shoulder of a child of the nobility. At the sight of this simple ornament, the colonel, who had been addressed as the Sieur Montaldi, became violently agitated. She raised the token, and held it close to his eyes.</p> 
                  <p>"Look, Sieur Montaldi-behold the arms of thy house engraven upon the inner circle. That golden armlet clasped thy little son's arm, when I, unhappy woman, tore him from his infant couch, and fled with him to the mountains, whilst thy castle crumbled to ruins in the flames kindled by my revenge!"</p> 
                  <p>"Thy revenge, woman! How had I injured thee?"</p> 
                  <p>"Deeply! O, deeply!" cried Monna Barbara, gathering strength as the memories of her early life crowded upon her. "Listen, Sieur Montaldi, and attest the truth of these, my parting words-for not long will the wretched Barbara survive this hour. Twenty years ago, Sieur Montaldi, thou wert governor of a castle and lord of a beautiful valley in Switzerland. A band of outlawed men, persecuted by unjust laws, had taken refuge in thy domain, making hiding-places of the mountains that looked down<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6326-00000044"/> upon thy castle. These men were hunted by thy soldiers, dispersed as brigands ere a crime had stained their hands. Their leader, a brave man, whose country's tyrants had driven him to exile, was tracked, wounded, to a cavern in the hills, and dragged from the arms of his wife and helpless babes. What mattered it that he afterwards escaped his persecutors?-the deed was done, and his wife, maddened with her loss, revenged his fate on thee and on thy house!"</p> 
                  <p>Monna Barbara paused, and the Sieur Montaldi seemed about to speak; but she resumed her recital immediately.</p> 
                  <p>"I was that unhappy wife! 'Twas I who, seeking out the scattered outlaws, inspired them with my frenzy of revenge; whilst thou, leaving thy castle to hunt thy hated fellow-men-"</p> 
                  <p>"Not so-not so!" interrupted the colonel." Say not that I hated the unfortunates. I was a magistrate, compelled by duty to proceed against the outlaws-"</p> 
                  <p>"Ah!-duty!" cried Monna Barbara. "And I was a wife whose duty was to revenge her husband. I led the outlaws against your castle, Sieur Montaldi-I lit the destroying torch-and O, 'twas I who bore thy shrieking child from his cradle, and with my own wretched one, nursed him in a foreign land! It was my revenge-it was a crime, ye say! But you, too, are avenged, for I am worse than childless!"</p> 
                  <p>"And this-this is my son!" exclaimed the Sieur Montaldi, grasping Valentine's hand and drawing the young soldier to his bosom.</p> 
                  <p>"The Almighty restores him to thee!" cried the old woman. "Mary he forgive the manifold sins of the wretched Barbara!"</p> 
                  <p>The crone's head sank upon the pale cheek of the dying Tomaso, whose neck was encircled by Francesca's arms. The old brigand's lips opened faintly, and murmured:</p> 
                  <p>"Barbara!"</p> 
                  <p>"My Berthold!" cried the unhappy one, pressing her last kiss upon her husband's lips.</p> 
                  <p>With that kiss, perhaps, the love of their youth, so abruptly broken, so strangely reunited, received assurance of completion in another world. Who shall say that the souls of the brigand and the weird Monna Barbara were not in that last moment made purer through mutual love?</p> 
                  <p>When Francesca raised her mournful eyes from her father's dead face to fix them upon the rigid face of her mother, she uttered no despairing cry, no sound, indeed, save a low moan; but she knew, nevertheless, that in the moment of her parent's last embrace, she had herself become an orphan.</p> 
                  <p>Little more have we to relate concerning the characters that have been with us through this romance of Alpine life. Valentine di Montaldi, restored to the parent whose life he had preserved, needed no order from his colonel to insure his release from the custody of worthy Maitre Pierre; but he soon found himself in closer and more-enduring bonds, woven by the fair hands of his bride, Bianca. Tomaso and Monna Barbara were buried in a quiet spot near Val d'Orazio, and the daughter, Francesca, counselled by the good Padre Ambrosio, devoted herself to a religious life, for which her trials and resignation seemed peculiarly to fit her. Long afterwards she was known throughout the Alpine regions as a gentle ministrant to the poor and afflicted; and if a pure and spotless life, devoted to the doing of good, be powerful to intercede for departed souls, then surely the unhappy brigand and his wife are not forgotten by Eternal Mercy!</p> 
                  <p>For the remaining persons of our story a few words will suffice. The Marquis Roberto recovered from his violent fall, but with the loss of a leg, which somewhat interfered with his after progress in gallantry. Pietro, the young hunter, whom the vine-dresser had wounded, likewise recovered, and lived long to enjoy the friendship of Valentine and his wife. And Agata, the good aunt, after witnessing in rapt admiration the ceremony by which Padre Ambrosio made a lady of her dear child, Bianca, found herself thereafter comfortably installed as housekeeper in the lordly home of the young Sieur Valentine di Montaldi. And perhaps all, save Francesca, in the light of their future happiness, forgot the dark shadow which had fallen athwart their path from the evil destiny of that unhappy spirit-Berthold the vine-dresser.</p>

               <p>"IT is an honest calling, wife," said Paul Gregory, as he shook the ashes from his pipe and laid it in its accustomed corner of the mantel-piece. "An honest calling, and I have followed it for twenty years, and my father did the same before me."</p> 
               <p>"The more reason you should give it up now, husband. It is well enough to stick to one trade until you see your way clear to do something better; but I suppose you have no particular fancy for having your sons and grandsons follow in the same beaten track. On their account I wish you to engage in some business a little more respectable than that of a milkman."</p> 
               <p>"It is an honest calling, as I told you before, wife, and as respectable a business as can be found in the country. I should like to hear any one say it is not respectable."</p> 
               <p>"We wont quarrel about words, Paul. Keeping a milk farm and driving the milk cart yourself, are certainly not the most genteel mode of earning a living. I never said a word while we could afford nothing better, but now we have Uncle George's legacy, I think it our duty to try to rise a peg higher in the world."</p> 
               <p>"Three thousand dollars will not do everything, Mary, but if you like, I will hire a hand to drive the cart, and I will attend to things at home a little more. And I will build a new barn, and you may have the addition to the house that you have talked of so long."</p> 
               <p>"And so spend all our money in improving this old place where we may remain buried alive all our days? No, no. Paul Gregory, I have a wiser plan than that to propose to you."</p> 
               <p>"And what may it be, Mary? I am all ready to listen to it," and like a dutiful husband, Paul turned his pleasant, sunburnt face toward his wife and placed himself in an attitude of attention.</p> 
               <p>"The truth is, husband, I am tired of living so out of the world. I do not want to scald the milk cans and fill them with milk all my life, nor to have my daughters grow up to do it for me. I feel ready for something better."</p> 
               <p>"Very well, wife. Now tell us what is better."</p> 
               <p>"Sell the farm, Paul, or rent it at a fair price and invest Uncle George's three thousand in buying goods to stock a little shop which we<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6326-00000045"/> will open in the city,-a thread and needle store for instance. My friend, Mrs. Mason, thinks we would do very well at that. She has made money since she commenced the business."</p> 
               <p>"Thread and needle store! Is the woman crazy?" ejaculated the astonished Paul Gregory; and as if at a loss how to give vent to his feelings, he refilled the pipe and whiffed away most vigorously.</p> 
               <p>"Well," continued the persevering wife, "I am not particular about that, if something else suits you better. A small dry goods store would answer, or a hat store, or-in fact almost any kind of a store you can mention."</p> 
               <p>"Who do you expect to attend to it?" condescended the husband, slightly relaxing his efforts at the pipe.</p> 
               <p>"You would, of course, have the superintendence. I have no time to spare from the children. James is old enough to assist you. You will lead an easy life to what you do now, husband."</p> 
               <p>"But do you not see, wife, that it would be like taking a fish out of the water and expecting him to live and thrive upon dry land! What do I know about tending a store? I can drive my milk cart merrily enough, and I am as good a judge of cattle as you will find in a day's journey, and a tolerable farmer besides; but this is all that can be said of Paul Gregory. Put him behind the counter with a yard stick in his hand, and the cows themselves might laugh."</p> 
               <p>But Mrs. Gregory was not at all dismayed at the conclusiveness of this speech. She had set her heart upon carrying her point, and long experience had taught her that much might be accomplished by patience and perseverance.</p> 
               <p>In fact, Paul Gregory was not one of those stubborn men who pride themselves upon never yielding to the influence of their wives. He often said good humoredly that Mary could wind him round her little finger if she chose, and so it proved in this case. Ere three months had elapsed, the old homestead was rented, and the whole family of Gregories, great and small, were snugly established in a tolerably comfortable house in a close, confined street of the city. A great change it was from the fresh air and green fields of the country. The wife said they should like it well enough when they got used to it, but the husband shook his head mournfully as if implying it would be long before that time would arrive. The younger members of the family, who were thus suddenly cut off from all their childish pleasures, were full of lamentations and entreaties to return. But there they were, and there, also, was a smart looking sign informing the passer-by that Paul Gregory, who had lately driven his milk cart through that very street at the earliest dawn of day, had now arrived at the dignity of selling ready-made clothing to whoever might wish to become a purchaser.</p> 
               <p>This particular branch of business was Paul's own choice. "If I must keep shop, give me something that I can handle," he said. "None of your tapes and ribbons for me." He would have preferred a grocery, but Mrs. Gregory was quite decided for something in the dry goods line, and after much discussion the ready-made clothing was decided upon.</p> 
               <p>The amount of their funds would not permit them to commence on a very extensive scale or in a very eligible situation, but then, as Mrs. Gregory justly observed, they must be willing to creep before they could walk; and as to the street being a retired one, there were plenty of people in it, and there was no reason why there should not be good shops. So the place was taken, and after the preliminary steps of washing windows, scrubbing floors, and arranging the new goods, the window shutters, were duly unfastened at an early hour every morning, and the door left invitingly open, as if to attract attention to the neat arrangement within.</p> 
               <p>For some weeks there appeared little prospect that there would be anything more than this to do. There had been some half dozen customers, it is true, but in some cases the articles did not suit, and in others the purchases were of trifling value. Poor Paul Gregory! It was a new life for him. Accustomed from his childhood to business of an active nature, it seemed dull work to sit with his feet on the counter, hour after hour, with nothing to diversify the scene, save an occasional visit from his own children, who found their chief amusement in standing in the shop door and watching what was passing in the street. Sometimes it is true his wife peeped in by way of consolation, and inquired if there had been any customers, and in answer to Paul's melancholy negative, reminded him that there was nothing like patience it was always darkest just before day, and other equally consolatory adages, which, however, had, by being oft repeated, lost their effect.</p> 
               <p>In this situation, his favorite pipe would have been a great comfort; but Mrs. Gregory who, to her credit be it spoken, strongly disapproved of the use of the noxious weed, had insisted that at least, the pipe must remain at the old place, and cigars be substituted instead, they being, as she observed, more genteel and suitable for people who were rising in the world. The husband submitted. How could he do otherwise? but the pipe was an old friend and its memory was cherished with that of many other friends who appeared to belong to days gone by, and he was reluctant to give it up.</p> 
               <p>Summer succeeded spring and autumn followed summer. Prospects had brightened a little. This was the time of year for doing business. New goods were purchased, and old ones sold cheap or packed away, to re-appear at some future time. Every day saw its customers now, not many to be sure, but enough for encouragement, as hopeful Mrs. Gregory said.</p> 
               <p>But now that custom was increasing, Paul's inexperience as a salesman became more strikingly manifest. He had done well enough to sit in his chair and keep the shop from running away, but selling goods was a different concern, as he was well aware.</p> 
               <p>The wife, who from a snug little room at the back of the shop which might justly have been termed her observatory, had a careful eye to all that was passing, was in despair and not without reason. If a garment was inquired for, it was exhibited. If approved, it was handed to the purchaser with as much indifference as if it had been a quart of milk. If it did not suit, no effort was made to present it in a more favorable light; the seller often agreed with the buyer that he might do better, "that it was not exactly the thing."</p> 
               <p>Paul Gregory prided himself upon his honesty. "No tricks in trade," for him. "Honest gains," had ever been his maxim, and that of his father before him. When this last clause was added, it was of no use to contend for that time at least, and Mrs. Gregory always became silent. Scenes like the following were continually occurring.</p> 
               <p>"Have you a good warm overcoat of my fit, Mr. Gregory?" inquired a brisk, business-like looking man, entering the little shop with a quick step and a hurried air. "I am just off on a journey, and the air seems so keen that I believe it is time for an outer garment. The one that I wore last winter is pretty shabby."</p> 
               <p>"I have one which will just suit you, I believe, sir," and Paul moved about with uncommon alacrity, for the door of the observatory was heard to jar slightly, indicating that the watchful Mrs. Gregory was within.</p> 
               <p>A handsome, well-made coat was produced, and was evidently viewed with satisfaction by the intended purchaser.</p> 
               <p>"Exactly the thing, if it only fits!" he exclaimed, as he drew it on. "What is the price?"</p> 
               <p>"Twenty dollars."</p> 
               <p>"Cheap at that-but how does it look? rather large, is it not?"</p> 
               <p>"Too large altogether!" frankly replied Paul. (Here the door shook violently.) "Perhaps I have one that will suit you better."</p> 
               <p>But the quality of those now presented was not approved.</p> 
               <p>"This is precisely what I want," repeated the gentleman, turning once more to the one first exhibited, "if it would only fit, and after all, it does not appear to be much out of the way. How does the back look?"</p> 
               <p>"Badly," was the quiet reply. "A large wrinkle across the shoulders."</p> 
               <p>"Well then, I suppose I must go back to the shop above. I saw one there that fitted me exactly, but the color was not the shade I wanted. But I must have one without delay, for the cars leave in half an hour."</p> 
               <p>"Buy the one that fits, by all means, sir," returned honest Paul. "A little difference in color is not to be thought of in comparison with the fit."</p> 
               <p>"Have you been in the business long, my friend?" asked the disappointed purchaser, as he turned from the desired coat.</p> 
               <p>"Some six months only," was the reply.</p> 
               <p>"I thought you were a new hand at it. And if you will take it kindly, I will give you the same advice that you have just given me. 'Buy the coat that fits.' Your present employment does not suit you. The appearance of it may seem more pleasing than that you were formerly engaged in, whatever that may have been, but it does not fit, and that is the main thing, as you have justly observed."</p> 
               <p>The stranger left the shop before Paul could reply, but his words had made an impression that could not easily be effaced. True, he had known it all before, but it is pleasant to hear ours<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6326-00000046"/> own opinions confirmed by others. It often gives strength for action, and sustains us in combating difficulties.</p> 
               <p>"Buy the coat that fits," repeated Paul, and the words seemed to comfort him even while listening to the remonstrances of his wife, who emerging from her hiding-place, expostulated on the extreme folly he had shown in the case of the overcoat.</p> 
               <p>The husband listened with his usual patience, but the expression of his countenance was different from usual, as he replied: "Never mind, wife, I am going to wake up now and do a good business. You will see how the coat will fit." This last clause was lost upon Mrs. Gregory, for she was already making her retreat as another customer entered.</p> 
               <p>It would have been difficult to have learned from Paul Gregory what had been sold that day, or at what price the goods had been disposed of.</p> 
               <p>"Some great change had come over him," his wife observed, and indeed, his demeanor was very different from usual, or from what it had been of late. He whistled lively airs, chatted gaily with his wife, frolicked with the children, and asked them how the city air agreed with them, laughing immoderately at the reply of a smart little girl of six, "that there was no air in the city-that she had not felt any since she came from home."</p> 
               <p>Toward evening, Paul announced his intention of going to take a look at the old place, as quarter-day was coming, and he wished to see if there was a good prospect of getting the rent. Mrs. Gregory made no objection, for ready money had been scarce of late, and she was glad to hear that there was some in prospect. "James could tend the shop well enough for the evening," she said.</p> 
               <p>It was wonderful how Paul's cheerfulness increased after his return from the farm. He assured his wife that everything was in prime order, but they were likely to lose their tenant soon, as he had taken the California fever.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Gregory appeared somewhat concerned at this, but her husband assured her it was of no consequence. He had already received an application. For two weeks all went on as usual, and then came another visit to the farm.</p> 
               <p>"Do not be anxious about me if I stay late, Mary," said Paul to his wife, as he left the house.</p> 
               <p>"I may visit some of our old friends this evening, and it is a long distance to come. Go to bed, and I will come in when I am ready," he added, with a merry twinkle of the eye, as if he had some queer plot in view.</p> 
               <p>Unsuspicious Mrs. Gregory obeyed, and quite unaware of her husband's prolonged absence, slept soundly, until at early dawn the shrill cry of the milkman disturbed her slumbers, and started her from the land of dreams.</p> 
               <p>"Is it possible it is so late?" she exclaimed, springing hastily to her feet. "And where is Mr. Gregory? The loud summons of the milkman was repeated, and their maid of all work, for some unknown reason, answered it not. Hastily throwing on a wrapper, Mrs. Gregory descended, and with pitcher in hand unfastened the door. There stood a well known horse and cart, and a well known voice, even that of her own husband, bade her a cheerful good-morning, and requested to know if he might have the pleasure of serving her with milk.</p> 
               <p>"What nonsense is this, Paul Gregory?" she exclaimed, quite aghast with surprise and vexation.</p> 
               <p>"No nonsense at all, wife. Sound common sense. I have bought the coat that fits, and am a milkman once more. If you like to keep on with the shop, you are welcome to do so. I will call on you every morning and attend to your wants so far as I can without neglecting my own business. Or if you prefer coming back to the old place, you will find me there alone, and ready to give you a hearty welcome," he rejoined, while a good-humored smile threw its genial beams across his sunburnt countenance, and revelled there.</p> 
               <p>The milk cart was rattling merrily down the street before Mrs. Gregory had sufficiently recovered herself to reply. Almost mechanically, she set down the milk pitcher and returned to her own room to dress, and attend to her usual morning duties. Throughout that long day she said but little, but thoughts were busy.</p> 
               <p>Several days passed away. Every morning the milk cart came rattling to the door, and regularly did Mrs. Gregory answer to the call. None knew what took place in these interviews, but ere long the observing neighbors noticed that the new clothing store was to let, and soon after this announcement, Paul Gregory, a new man, now that he had resumed his old coat, was seen actively superintending the removal of furniture, and most carefully assisting his wife and children into the comfortable looking carryall, which was to convey them once more to the old place, and there to renew the cherished scenes of their former quiet country life.</p> 
               <p>Another week, and it seemed almost like a dream, that they had ever left it. The children whose returning roses showed that they had found their home, were full of delight-the father, smiling with contentment, resumed his pipe when the labors of the day were over, and declared himself a happy man once more; while good Mrs. Gregory assiduously scalded the milk cans with cheerful zeal, and, yielding to the happiness around her, declared that after all there was nothing like wearing a coat that fits.</p>

               <head>MAY LESTER.</head> 
               <head type="sub">[FROM "THE FLAG OF OUR UNION.</head> 
               <head type="sub">MARY B. C. SLADE.</head> 
               <p>"AND so, May, you have refused young Halsey, on whom more mamas have looked approvingly, and more daughters smilingly, than upon any other "eligible" who has graced our city this winter. In truth, nay, I am vexed with you; if I had time or patience, I would count the conquests you have made this season, all of them brilliant ones, and all in vain. O naughty May."</p> 
               <p>"Unintentional, Annie, wholly unintentional."</p> 
               <p>"But you shall lay aside your book and listen to me now. I regret Halsey's repulse, for you know he is one of my favorites; but Chester rejoices at it! Ah, I thought I should rouse you. I have not seen my husband more delighted, since-"</p> 
               <p>"Since you did not refuse him?" said May. "Well, tell me why, for see, my horse is at the door, and I am in haste to ride away from scoldings and proposals."</p> 
               <p>May Lester was a lovely and beautiful woman. She had been spending the winter months with her friend in New York, and had only delayed her return to Virginia, to her own beautiful home, for she was an orphan heiress, to accompany her friends on an excursion through the Northern States.</p> 
               <p>The brilliant southern lady had won the admiration of many even in the city of beauty, but the offered homage of all hearts had, as in this last instance, been kindly, but calmly refused.</p> 
               <p>Yet was May Lester no artful coquette, for no word or tone of his had lured on the fascinated sufferers. The dying moth may not chide the flame that for him burned all too brightly. As she stood there in her beauty, with a bright smile beaming on her sweet countenance, her clear laugh, at the evident dissatisfaction of Mrs. Marsh, was like the merry tone of an innocent and guileless child.</p> 
               <p>"Come," said she, "let me know what this good husband of yours says; no wonder he rejoices in Halsey's escape. Is it so?"</p> 
               <p>"O no-he gives me far other reasons. You know I permit him to be one of your enthusiastic admirers, and he says he knows but one being on earth who is your equal, and he rejoices that you are still free, for that one will soon be here to enter the lists. One more trial," says Chester, "and then if your heart is not won, he will agree with me, that you would not love if you could, and could not if you would."</p> 
               <p>"Admirable!" cried May; "only one more trial! Meanwhile, I must burnish my armor and be in readiness for the conflict. But who is this paragon, and when shall I see him? Do give timely notice;" and May's musical laugh again rang out as she sprang into the saddle, and patting her horse gently upon the neck, added, "Tell me all about it, so that if I dread the trial, Selim and I may run away to Virginia."</p> 
               <p>"He is a schoolmate of Chester's whom he left in college and met again in France. The meeting was mutually pleasant, and for a short time they journeyed together. Chester left his friend in Italy. He has now returned and is with his mother in P-. He will soon be with us, for Chester has invited him to join our party, and he has friends in the North whom he is anxious to visit. You would begin to love him, should you hear Chester eulogize his many good qualities."</p> 
               <p>"And his name?"</p> 
               <p>"His name is Henry Lincoln. He is of one of the best families in the North, and very rich, withal."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Marsh had turned as she spoke, to reach a branch of the fragrant clematis that twined about the pillar against which she leaned, and she did not observe that May was silent. Turning towards her she saw her hand relax its hold of the bridle, the whole expression of her countenance had changed, the color left her cheeks, her eyes were fixed mournfully, and her pale lips moved as if struggling for the power of expression; and as Mrs. Marsh sprang forward, she sank to the ground, and murmuring, "He! Harry Lincoln," closed her eyes in deep insensibility.</p> 
               <p>It was long before consciousness returned, and then with a wild look of agony she begged to be left alone. Long after, when the anxious and sorrowing Annie stole to her door, she sat with her bowed head resting upon one hand, and without seeking to know who was the intruder, she shook her other hand in weary impatience, and Annie left her again.</p> 
               <p>In the evening she opened a note from her. "Come to me," it said, "and see how one who "could not love, can suffer." When Mrs. Marsh sat down by the side of the couch on which she lay, and clasped the feverish hand that hung by its side, between her own trembling fingers, and looked into that pale, sad face, she started with terror, for May Lester seemed no longer herself. Could it be that this was the true May, and that the smiling girl she had known so long had been, all along, a suffering and enduring woman?</p> 
               <p>After a moment of silence she said:</p> 
               <p>"Annie, I must go home to-morrow; I cannot stay here another day."</p> 
               <p>She did not pause to notice Annie's look of amazement and gush of tears, but went on, her voice feeble and trembling as a sick child's and low, plaintive and sad.</p> 
               <p>"Long ago, Annie, when we were children, O how long ago it seems! I told you all my little joys and sorrows. As I grew older I still confided in you; but there is one thing I have never told you, nor should I now but for this weakness that seems to you so strange. O Annie, your calm and quick nature can but faintly comprehend the love I bear, and long have borne to him-to Harry Lincoln.</p> 
               <p>"We met for the first time during the last year of my father's life, while we were at Niagara. His father and mine had loved each other in youth, and that love had strengthened as years passed on, and when my father learned that he was Dudley Lincoln's son, he greeted him with the same warm friendship. O, Annie, can I tell you all? When we left Niagara he went with us. I was very happy then. I was the child of wealth and unbounded love. I seldom knew an ungratified wish, and among those beautiful scenes it was not strange that I, whose greatest joy had ever been in the love of the beautiful in nature, should rejoice in spirit. But now there was a new feeling in my soul; day by day it stole into my heart-day by day it strengthened there.</p> 
               <p>"He was my companion in all my daily walks; his was the same strong, pure delight-his the same chastened feeling, as together we looked upon the sacred impersonations of the spirit of beauty. I told him all my thoughts and sang for him all my sweetest songs, and so the time flew away and I loved him, yet I knew it not!. One day-we were among the White Mountains then-my father had left us, and Harry had been speaking as only he could speak, of the beauty around us and its effect upon our souls, and then he added a regret that we must so soon leave scenes where we had been so happy-that we must so soon, part. I had not dreamed of this before, and now the thought was terrible, and I wept passionately. Then Annie, I knew that I loved him, and when, hand in hand we descended that mountain, the joy of the blessed was in my soul, for I knew that the love of that noble being was all my own.</p> 
               <p>"My father smiled on me that night, and his<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6326-00000048"/> 'God bless you, my child!' came with a more thrilling tone as he kissed my burning cheek, and whispered his joy in mine.</p> 
               <p>"With the instinctive delicacy of a first love, I begged that our engagement might be a secret with us, and my father acceded to my wish. Life was, O, so beautiful to me then, Annie. I went out Alone, early, very early upon the morning of the next day, and walked by the side of one of the pleasant streams that wind their way down the mountain, and it seemed to me that the waters smiled upon me like loving sisters, for far up in their high home they had heard the precious words of yesterday, and the little white violets that never before seemed so purely beautiful-I picked them, and impulsively kissed their pale lips-the light within made all things light without. Then I sat down upon a rock covered with green, soft moss, and I sang a new song; the words came from my heart; there were none in my memory fit for such deep thankfulness; and then a manly voice full of music repeated my words, for he had been near me all the, while. When I leaned on his arm to return, it seemed to me that we two were fit to go through the blue portals above, to our home in heaven, God only knew how much of purifying sorrow one of us still needed.</p> 
               <p>"We parted that day, and Annie, I have never seen him since! Four years only have passed by, and my head is not yet gray; but I am old, very old in heart, and ages seem to have dragged their slow length of years in my soul since that hour!</p> 
               <p>"We parted; I went to my far home to gaze in secret upon the beautiful miniature that even my father never saw, to sing the songs he loved, to finish the sketches his hand had begun, to read the books he preferred, to watch for the coming of the white-winged messengers of love he sent to me, to worship at an earthly shrine, to experience the bitter retribution of a wronged and broken heart, and to turn again to Him whose altar I had forsaken for this thing of clay.</p> 
               <p>"He returned to Yale to finish his studies. His frequent letters were perfect transcripts of himself; to the last they breathed the same endearing love; but man is fickle and his love changes like the fitful wind;</p> 
               <p>"When I received that last I was at my uncle's. He had just returned from Europe, and with him the gentleman to whom Aunt May had long been engaged, and for the love of whom she had been leading through dewy youth and sunny womanhood a life of waiting hope and patient duty. He returned rich and honored, and Aunt May became his wife.</p> 
               <p>"Then my father died. He lived only a week after the marriage of his sister; in the strength of manhood he passed a way, peacefully, joyfully, as a Christian should die. O had he known the bitterness in store for me, he had not died thus calmly.</p> 
               <p>"Many days had elapsed, bringing me no letter from Harry; I was sick with fear, for he had spoken of enfeebled health, and I knew that he was making great efforts to graduate with honor, and so when the letter came to us announcing my father's death, I dared not break its sombre seal. <emph>He</emph> still lived, but my noble father was in heaven!</p> 
               <p>"Annie, since then, life has been very dark to me. God has strengthened me, and I have striven daily to fulfil my mission on earth, and an approving conscience has not left me wholly without calm and peaceful satisfaction; but I have never been happy, I shall never be again on earth, for Annie, I love him still. I loved him once-and forever. He has failed me, but still I love him-once and forever.</p> 
               <p>"Day after day I waited and watched and hoped to hear from him; then I said I will write to him again. I wrote; I had sealed my letter, but in my haste I had taken a seal I never used before, and the clear impression of "<emph>delusion,</emph>" scornfully smiled upon me from the gleaming wax. Then first, then wholly, the bitter truth sank into my soul; at once the full consciousness swept over me that I, so deeply loving, had been too lightly loved. I was deluded no longer.</p> 
               <p>"Since then I have heard his name but twice; once Aunt May wondered I should so soon have forgotten the gentleman with whom my father had been so pleased at Niagara. Another time it was at a large party, and I laughed and chatted with the veriest butterfly of the evening, while I heard the bitter words-he had gone to Europe' they said,' suddenly; immediately indeed, after leaving college, where, 'they said, I he graduated with highest honors.' I knew why he went thus capriciously. I knew that he wished not to meet me so soon whom he had so wronged. Yet I laughed at that moment, and by-and-by I danced, and Annie, it was one of my brilliant nights' You have seen such, and you have heard them say, ah! so have I-'how happy is May Lester!' and all the while, God only knew the agony I bore within.</p> 
                
               <p>"So Annie, let me go to-morrow; I am weak and, weary-hearted now, and I must go away and nerve myself to meet him as I ought. God will strengthen me in my painful way."</p> 
               <p>It was long past midnight when Annie Marsh left that couch of misery. She, the teacher and chider of the morning, had learned in the still midnight a life-lesson of endurance.</p> 
               <p>When May Lester was alone, she prayed long and earnestly for strength for her own need, but most of all, for the happiness of him who had wronged her. Then she sweetly slept; for forgiveness of injuries is fragrant incense before God, and angels fan with their bright wings the fire of that altar on which it is burning.</p> 
               <p>The next night Henry Lincoln's voice sounded in the ears of those who had just heard her sad farewell, and her last words, "Call me Helen Lester, my mother's name, if you speak of me in his presence."</p> 
               <p>Annie Marsh strove to greet her new guest cordially and kindly. Before the close of the evening a thought had crossed her sunny spirit that some dark cloud of mystery shaded the life of her friend; at least she could not believe that Lincoln was the heartless trifler she had been ready to condemn a few hours before.</p> 
               <p>His calm, courtly manner in the presence of other guests bore no trace of suffering, but when all had gone and he was alone with Mr. and Mrs. Marsh, his voice grew sad as he spoke of old times and scenes, and when Chester alluded to the last months of his college life, he seemed lost in painful thought.</p> 
               <p>"And did you continue, across the sea, the correspondence about which we wild ones teased you so greatly?" said Chester. "Those little gems of letters must have gone tremblingly on so long a voyage."</p> 
               <p>Lincoln bowed his head, but made no reply, and Annie left them full of hope for her friend. After a brief silence Lincoln asked abruptly, "Who is this Miss Lester whose sudden departure your friends regret so much?"</p> 
               <p>Chester had not yet learned the cause of Mary's request, but he replied quickly;</p> 
               <p>"O Helen Lester is a beauty, a belle, and an heiress, who has been visiting us from her home in the South; but she has left us rather abruptly."</p> 
               <p>"I am not surprised at any act of caprice in one of her sex and name," said Lincoln, but as if regretting the remark, he hastily changed the subject; but he left Chester a ready convert to the opinion of his wife, when he had heard her story and told his own.</p> 
               <p>"There sings May's canary," said Annie, the next morning; "poor little thing, it shall not miss her loving care."</p> 
               <p>As she fed the gentle bird a calm voice bade her good-morning, and Lincoln stood by her side.</p> 
               <p>"I will know all before he leaves me," thought she, and her plan was quickly devised.</p> 
               <p>"Is not this a beautiful bird?" said she, as she smoothed his golden feathers and pressed it to her own sweet face-"and I love it the better for its pretty name, the name of her whose gift it is; "May," sweet May, it should not be a common name, unless all Mays were gentle and true like our May Lester, like the May we love, my bird," and she fondled the favorite again, hardly daring to cast a glance toward Lincoln to mark the effect of her words.</p> 
               <p>In a moment he stepped forward, and grasping her hand, said, in a voice sad even in his indignation:</p> 
               <p>"Call her not gentle and true, for I have known May Lester well, and she is a heartless woman. God grant that she may not have just heart enough for remorse. My friend, this true and gentle May married, after the briefest acquaintance, a man old enough to be her father, because he bore an honored name, and was the possessor of countless thousands; and this, too, when she knew that she must ruin the fondest hopes of one who loved her as few ever love; and not one week before her marriage she wrote to him full of love and trust to me, my friend, for I am he who loved her, and I am he whom she so bravely deceived! Her father only knew of our engagement. He died within a month. He could refuse her nothing, but his high sense of honor must have bowed humbly when he knew that his promise-and her plighted word must be broken to gratify the matrimonial ambition of a misguided girl."</p> 
               <p>Lincoln had spoken too impetuously to observe his auditor, and now, as he paused and raised his to hers, for an instant he thought she mocked him; but the sweet smile he saw had no malice in it, and those mild eyes beamed so kindly upon him as she led him to a seat in the pleasant shade by an open window, and there seemed something so joyful in her elastic step, that a strange hope stole over him.</p> 
               <p>"Listen now," she said, to my story; and she told in her sweet, artless manner, the story of May Lester, loving, forsaken, suffering!</p> 
               <pb n="100" xml:id="VAC6326-00000049"/> 
               <p>"But the marriage," said the bewildered Lincoln, "I surely saw it announced in many southern papers."</p> 
               <p>"When you see <emph>our</emph> May," said Chester, who entered at this moment, "you will not regret that you could not marry the maiden aunt, who, though she is one of earth's noblest and best, is "old enough to have been <emph>your</emph> mother."</p> 
               <p>"Four years of sorrow for my May," sighed Annie, "through a mistake!"</p> 
               <p>"Four years of bitterness," for me, "added Lincoln, "through this sad mistake!"</p> 
               <p>"Four years of pique at not being able to marry an old maid," laughed Chester. "But come," said he, "with me, and make arrangements for a journey to Virginia. Annie and I constitute ourselves your guardians, yours and May's-we shall go with you until May Lester is May Lincoln, or we shall have another trip to Europe and Asia in a fit of pique."</p> 
               <p>"It was late in the afternoon of a lovely day when the travelling carriage of Mr. Marsh approached an old but elegant country mansion in northern Virginia. Annie and Mr. Lincoln walked up the broad avenue leading to the house, and Annie felt the arm on which she leaned tremble, as they stood upon the vineshaded gallery. A female form was seen near the open window, and Annie, stepping noiselessly forward, whispered, "she is sleeping."</p> 
               <p>They passed in, and the strong man bowed his head and wept like a child, for an open casket was before her, and many letters were upon the table, and he knew their contents. One, his last, lay beneath her hand and a tear rested upon her closed eyelids. An open piano stood near, and upon it lay an old gem of song she had oftenest played for him. Her little hand was almost as thin and transparent as the paper on which it rested, and there was a hollowness to her cheek that told of a worn and chafed spirit. Annie ran her fingers lightly over the keys and filled the room with a sweet gush of music.</p> 
               <p>The poor girl awoke, and instinctively grasping that last letter, arose. Annie's smile met her eye, and then it fell on Harry Lincoln! There was a strange mingling in her face for an instant, of wild agony and old delight, and then her proud spirit rose in maidenly strength, and she stepped forward to greet him as she had schooled her heart to do; but she had overrated her strength, and she sank fainting back again. She was still conscious, and his quick words told her the story of years in a moment. They were alone, and when long afterward they joined Mr. and Mrs. Marsh in the garden, a holy trust shone on either face, and it shone from the heart.</p> 
               <p>"Was I not right?" said, Chester, as they approached, "Is he not worthy of her?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, you are always right," was the very wifely reply.</p> 
               <p>"And you are always trustful and hopeful, or this mystery had not so soon been solved."</p> 
               <p>There was a merry ringing of bells and a joyous bridal party in the old church where May Lester's father and mother were married, and when the old minister, whose hand, long years before, had sprinkled the baptismal water upon her infant brow, laid his feeble hand upon her head and blessed her, and she turned away from the altar to begin from that holy moment, from that sacred spot, the journey of life anew, her eye fell upon his grave who had blessed her young heart's choice. The rays of the setting sun rested upon it, and as the green turf and sweet flowers shone in the sunlight, her father's grave smiled upon her, and she knew that he smiled in heaven!</p>
