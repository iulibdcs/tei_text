&#xD;
This is the only prompt, efficient, and safe master of such symptoms as loss of&#xD;
appetite, heartburn, palpitation of the heart, dizziness, sleeplessness, melancholy,&#xD;
costiveness, wind, mental and physical debility, as well as many others which if&#xD;
neglected will soon place "the house we live in" beyond the reach of any remedy.&#xD;
Letter from a leading Al Taseacleuseits Lawyer and Politician.&#xD;
AnaL, 1872.&#xD;
To H. G. PARKER, Esq., Editor Saturday Evening Gazette:&#xD;
Dz&amp;amp;n P-: You ask me concerning WIIIi'E'S SPI~CIALTY FOR DYSPEP-&#xD;
SIA. I am free to say that though 1 gave it a trial without the slightest faith, I&#xD;
have been surprised by its good results. I have suffered martyrdom from Dyspep-&#xD;
sia for years. It has afflicted my stomach, any head, my spirits, and has unfitted&#xD;
me for intellectual labor. It has sometimes frightened me into the belief that I was&#xD;
dying of consumption. I did everything. I consulted four of the mn3st skilful phy-&#xD;
sIcians in Boston, without relief. I travelled through Europe, and still tile terror&#xD;
followed me. On my return home I trIed one bottle of White's 8~:eciaIty for Dys.&#xD;
pepsia. It gave me appetite and cheerfulness; relieved pain in the bowels and&#xD;
chest; enabled me to enjoy society, amid freed any head from confusion. A second&#xD;
bottle did more than the first; a third bottle restored inc fully to the work of my&#xD;
office, and a fourth bottle made inc as ~vell as when I left college. I believe in&#xD;
WHITE'S SPECIALTY k'OIt DYSPEPSIA as one of the benefactions of our time.&#xD;
J. S. A.&#xD;
From the Boston Journal.&#xD;
"Dvsrzt'sIA. White's Specialty for this aggravating complaint has been&#xD;
thoroughly tested by thousands who have been benefited by it, and are willing to&#xD;
testify to its efficacy."     _____________&#xD;
From the Congregational&amp;amp;st (Boston).&#xD;
"Wmurat's SnccmALrv ron DYSPEPSIA, from pure merit and virtue alone, is fast&#xD;
overtaking, and bids fair to exceed, in its sale, nil the old popular medicInes of the&#xD;
day."                         ____________&#xD;

DEVIL -3? U Z Z L ER S.&#xD;
BY YREP. B. PERYINS.&#xD;
&#xD;
IT will not do at all to disbelieve&#xD;
in the existence of a personal devil.&#xD;
It is not so many years ago that one&#xD;
of our profoundest divines remarked&#xD;
with indignation upon such disbelief~&#xD;
"No such person?" cried the doctor&#xD;
with energy. "Don't tell inc 1 I can&#xD;
hear his tail snap and crack about&#xD;
amongst the churches any day I"&#xD;
And if the enemy is, in truth, still&#xD;
as vigorously active among the sons&#xD;
of God as he was in the days of Job&#xD;
(that is to say, in the time of Solo-&#xD;
mon, when, as the critics have found&#xD;
out, the Book of Job was written),&#xD;
then surely still more is he vigilant&#xD;
and sly in his tricks for foreclosing&#xD;
his mortgages upon the souls of the&#xD;
wicked.&#xD;
And once more: still more than&#xD;
ever is his personal appearance prob-&#xD;
able in these latter days. The ever-&#xD;
lasting tooting of the wordy Cum-&#xD;
ming has proclaimed the end of all&#xD;
things for a quarter of a century;&#xD;
and he will surely see his prophecy&#xD;
fulfilled if he can only keep it up long&#xD;
enough. But, though we discredit&#xD;
the sapient Second-Adventist as to&#xD;
the precise occasion of the diabolic&#xD;
avatar, has there not been a strange&#xD;
coincidence between his noisy decla-&#xD;
rations, and other evidences of an ap-&#xD;
proximation of the spiritual to the&#xD;
bodily sphere of life? Is not this&#xD;
same quarter of a century that of the&#xD;
Spiritists? Has it not witnessed the&#xD;
development of Od? And of clair..~&#xD;
voyance? And have not the doctrines&#xD;
of ghosts, and re-appearancus of the&#xD;
dead, and of messages from them,&#xD;
riben into a prominence entirely new,&#xD;
and into a coherence and semblance&#xD;
&#xD;
at least of fact and fixed law such as.&#xD;
was never known before? Yea, verily.&#xD;
Of all times in the world's history,&#xD;
to reject out of one's beliefs either&#xD;
good spirits or bad, angelology or dia-&#xD;
bology, chief good being, or chief bad&#xD;
being, this is the most improper.&#xD;
Dr. Hicok was trebly liable to the&#xD;
awful temptation, under which he had&#xD;
assuredly fallen, over and above the&#xD;
fact that he was a prig, which makes&#xD;
one feel the more glad that he was so&#xD;
handsomely come up with in the&#xD;
end; such a prig that everybody who&#xD;
knew him, invariably called him (when&#xD;
he wasn't by) Ilicok-alorum. This&#xD;
charming surname had been conferred&#xD;
on him by a crazy old fellow with&#xD;
whom he once got into a dispute.&#xD;
Lunatics have the most awfully tricky&#xD;
ways of dodging out of pinches in rea-&#xD;
soning; but Hicok knew too much to&#xD;
know that; and so he acquired his&#xD;
fine title to teach him one thing more.&#xD;
Trebly liable, we said. The three&#xD;
reasons are, -&#xD;
1. He was foreign-born.&#xD;
2. He was a Seotchman.&#xD;
3. He was a physician and sur-&#xD;
geon.&#xD;
The way in which these causes&#xD;
operated was as follows (I wish it&#xD;
were allowable to use Artemus Ward's&#xD;
curiously satisfactory vocable "thus-&#xD;
ly :"like Mrs. Wiggle's smoothing&#xD;
sirup, it "supplies a real want") : -&#xD;
Being foreign-born, Dr. Hicok had&#xD;
not the unfailing moral stamina of a&#xD;
native American, and therefore was&#xD;
comparatively easily beset by sin&#xD;
Being, secondly; a Seotchman, he was&#xD;
not only thoroughly conceited, with a&#xD;
conceit as immovable as the BassRock,&#xD;
&#xD;

4                 ~~~~Devil-P uzzlerse.                                                            Dei-uze8&#xD;
&#xD;
just as other folks sometimes are, bu&#xD;
in particular, he was perfectly sure&#xD;
his utter mastery of ~metaphysics, 14&#xD;
gic and dialectics, or, as he used&#xD;
call it, with a snobbish Teutonicaliz~&#xD;
tion, dialektik. Now, in the latter tw&#xD;
the Scotch can do something, but i&#xD;
metaphysics they are simply imbecile&#xD;
which quality, in the inscrutabi&#xD;
providence of God, has been joined&#xD;
with an equally complete conviction&#xD;
of the exact opposite. Let not man&#xD;
therefore, put those traits asunder,&#xD;
not so much by reason of any divine&#xD;
ordinance, as because no man in hii&#xD;
senses would try to convince a Scotch&#xD;
man,-or anybody else, for that ma1~&#xD;
ter.&#xD;
Thirdly, he was a physician and&#xD;
surgeon; and gentlemen of this pro.&#xD;
session are prone to become either&#xD;
thoroughgoing materialists, or else&#xD;
implicit and extreme Calvinistic Pres-&#xD;
byterians, "of the large blue kind."&#xD;
And they are, moreover, positive,&#xD;
hard-headed, bold, and self-confident.&#xD;
So they have good need to be. Did&#xD;
not Majendie say to his students,&#xD;
"Gentlemen, disease is a subject&#xD;
which physicians know nothing&#xD;
about?'~&#xD;
So the doctor both believed in the&#xD;
existence of a personal devil, and be-&#xD;
lieved in his own ability to get the&#xD;
upper hand of that individual in a&#xD;
tournament of the wits. Ah, he&#xD;
learned better by terrible experience!&#xD;
The doctor was a dry-looking little&#xD;
chap, with sandy hair, a freckled face,&#xD;
small gray eyes, and aWsurd white eye-&#xD;
brows and eyelashes, which made him&#xD;
look as if he had finished off his toilet&#xD;
with just a light flourish from the&#xD;
dredging-box. He was erect of car-&#xD;
riage, and of prompt, ridiculousalert..&#xD;
ness of step and motion, very much&#xD;
like that of Major Wellington De&#xD;
Boots. And his face commonly wore&#xD;
&#xD;
.t, akindofcomplacentserenitysuch~&#xD;
f the Hindoos ascribe to Buddha. I&#xD;
~- know a little snappish dentist's-goods&#xD;
0 dealer up town, who might be mis-&#xD;
L- taken for Hicok-alorum any day.&#xD;
,   Well, well - what had the doctor&#xD;
a done? Why- it will sound absurd,&#xD;
probably, to some unbelieving peo-&#xD;
o pIe, - but really Dr. Hicok confessed&#xD;
I the whole story to me hirnself: lie had&#xD;
a made a bargain with the evil one!&#xD;
, And indeed lie was such an uncom-&#xD;
monly disagreeable-looking fellow,&#xD;
tlra1~, unless on some such hypothesis,&#xD;
itis impossible to imagine how he could&#xD;
- have prospered as he did. lie gained&#xD;
- patients, and cured them too; made&#xD;
money; invested successfully; bought&#xD;
I a brown-stone front, - a house, not a&#xD;
wiglet, -then bought other real es-&#xD;
tate; began to put Iris name on char-&#xD;
ity subscription lists, and to be made&#xD;
vice-president of various things.&#xD;
Chiefest of all, - it must have&#xD;
been by some superhuman aid that&#xD;
Dr. Hicok married his wife, the then&#xD;
arid present Mrs. Hicok. Dear me I&#xD;
I have described the doctor easily&#xD;
enough. But how infinitely more&#xD;
difficult it is to delineate Beauty than&#xD;
the Beast: did you ever think of it?&#xD;
All I can say is, that she is a very&#xD;
lovely womini now; and she must&#xD;
have been, when the doctor married&#xD;
her, one of the loveliest creatures that&#xD;
ever lived, -a lively, graceful, bright-&#xD;
eyed brunette, ivitli thick fine long&#xD;
black hair, pencilled delicate eye-&#xD;
brows, little pink ears, thin high nose,&#xD;
great astonished brown eyes, perfect&#xD;
teeth, a little rosebud of a mouth, arid&#xD;
a figure so extremely beautiful that&#xD;
nobody believed she did not pad -&#xD;
hardly even the artists who - those&#xD;
of them at least who work faithfully in&#xD;
the life-school - are the very best&#xD;
judges extant of truth in costume arid&#xD;
personal beauty. But, furthermore,&#xD;
&#xD;
sIre was good, with the innocent un-&#xD;
conscious goodness of a sweet little&#xD;
child; and of all feminine charms, -&#xD;
even beyond her supreme grace of&#xD;
motion, - she possessed the sweetest,&#xD;
the most resistless, - a lovely voice;&#xD;
whose tones, whether in speech or&#xD;
Bong, were perfect in sweetness, and&#xD;
with a strange penetrating sympa..&#xD;
thetic quality, and at the same time&#xD;
with the most wonderful half-de-&#xD;
laying completeness of articulation&#xD;
and modulation, as if she enjoyed the&#xD;
sound of hi&amp;amp;r own music. No doubt she&#xD;
did; but it was unconsciously, like a&#xD;
bird. The voice was so sweet, the&#xD;
great loveliness and kindness of soul&#xD;
it expressed were so deep, that, like&#xD;
every exquisite beauty, it rayed forth&#xD;
a certain sadness within the pleasure&#xD;
it gave. It awakened infinite, indis-&#xD;
tirict emotions of beauty arid perfec-&#xD;
tion, -infinite longings.&#xD;
It's of no use to tell me that such&#xD;
a spirit - sIre really ought riot to be&#xD;
note(1 so low down as amongst hu-&#xD;
miami beings - that such a spirit&#xD;
could have been made glad by be-&#xD;
coming the yoke-fellow of Hicok-&#xD;
alorum, by influences exclusively hu-&#xD;
luau. No! - I don't believe it - I&#xD;
won't believe it - it can't be believed.&#xD;
I can't convince you, ~f course, for&#xD;
you don't know her; but if you&#xD;
did, along ~vithi the rest of the evidence,&#xD;
arid if your knowledge was like mine,&#xD;
thmat from the testimony of my own eyes&#xD;
arid ears and judgment, - you would&#xD;
kn~nv, just as I do, that the doctor's&#xD;
~ of Iris wife was tIre keystone&#xD;
of the aich of completed proof oii which&#xD;
I found my absolute assertion that he&#xD;
had made that bargain.&#xD;
He certainly hind! A most char-&#xD;
acteristic transaction too; for while,&#xD;
after the usual fashion, it was agreed&#xD;
by tIre "party of the first part," -&#xD;
viz., Old Scratch, -that Dr. Hicok&#xD;
&#xD;
K&#xD;
&#xD;
should succeed in whatever he under'.&#xD;
took during twenty years, and by the&#xD;
party of the second part, that at the&#xD;
end of that time the D - should&#xD;
fetch him in manner and form as is&#xD;
ordinarily provided, yet there was&#xD;
added a peculiar clause. This was,&#xD;
that, when the time caine for the&#xD;
doctor to depart, he should be left&#xD;
entirely whole and unharmed, in&#xD;
mind, body, and estate, provided he&#xD;
could put to the Devil three con-&#xD;
secutive questions, of which either&#xD;
one should be such that that cunning&#xD;
spirit could not solve it on the spot.&#xD;
So for twenty years Dr. Hicok&#xD;
lived and prospered, and waxed very&#xD;
great. He did not gain one single&#xD;
pound avoirdupois however, which&#xD;
may perchance seem strange, but is&#xD;
the most natural thing in the world.&#xD;
Who ever saw a little, dry, wiry, sandy,&#xD;
freckled man, with ivhiite eyebrows,&#xD;
that did grow fat? And, besides, the&#xD;
doctor spent all his leisure time in&#xD;
hunting up his saving trinity of ques-&#xD;
tions; and hard study, above all for&#xD;
such a purpose, is as sure an anti-fat-&#xD;
tenner as Banting.&#xD;
He knew the Scotch metaphysicianis&#xD;
by heart already, ox-officio as it were;&#xD;
but he very early gave up the idea of&#xD;
trying to fool the Devil with such&#xD;
mud-pie as that. Yet be it under-&#xD;
stood, that he found cause to except&#xD;
Sir William Hamilton from the mud-&#xD;
dle-headed crew. He chewed a good&#xD;
while, and pretty hopefully, upon the&#xD;
Quantification of the Predicate; but&#xD;
lie had to give that up too, when he&#xD;
found out how small and how dry a&#xD;
meat rattled within the big, noisy&#xD;
nut-shell. He read Saint Thomas&#xD;
Aquinas, and Peter Dens, and a cart-&#xD;
load more of old casuist; Ilomanist&#xD;
and Protestant.&#xD;
He exhausted the learning of the&#xD;
Development Theory. He studied and&#xD;

6                        Devit&#xD;
experimented up to the existing lbs&#xD;
its of knowledge on the question o:&#xD;
the Origin of Life, and then poked ou&#xD;
alone, as much farther as he could, in&#xD;
to the ineffable black darkness tha&#xD;
is close at the end of our noses oi&#xD;
that, as well as most other questions&#xD;
He hammered his way through tin&#xD;
whole controversy on the Freedom ol&#xD;
the Will. He zflastered the wholi&#xD;
works of Mr. Henry C. Carey on on&#xD;
side, and of two hundred and fifty&#xD;
English capitalists and American&#xD;
college professors on the other, on&#xD;
the question of Protection or Free&#xD;
trade. He made, with vast pains,&#xD;
an extensive collection of the ques..&#xD;
tions proposed at debating societies&#xD;
and college-students' societies with&#xD;
long Greek names. The last effort&#xD;
was a failure. Dr. Hicok had got&#xD;
the idea, that, from the spontane-&#xD;
ous activity of so many free young&#xD;
geniuses, many wondrous and sugges-&#xD;
tive thoughts would be born. Having,&#xD;
however, tabulated his collection, he&#xD;
found, that, among all these innumer-&#xD;
able gymnasia of intellect, there were&#xD;
only seventeen questions debated!&#xD;
The doctor read me a curious little&#xD;
memorandum of his conclusions on&#xD;
this unexpected fact, which will per-&#xD;
haps be printed some day.&#xD;
He investigated many other things&#xD;
too; for a sharp-witted little Presby-&#xD;
terian Scotch doctor, working -to cheat&#xD;
the Devil out of his soul, can accom-&#xD;
plish an amazing deal in twenty years.&#xD;
He even went so far as to take into&#xD;
consideration mere humbugs; for, if&#xD;
he could cheat the enemy with a hum-&#xD;
bug, why not? The only pain in that&#xD;
case, would be the mortification of&#xD;
having stooped to an inadequate ad-&#xD;
versary, - a foreman unworthy of his&#xD;
steel. So he weighed such queries as&#xD;
theold scholastic brocard, An ckimaircs&#xD;
*oninan~s in vacuo, decorat secundas&#xD;
&#xD;
-Puzzlers.&#xD;
&#xD;
intentiones? and that beautiful moot&#xD;
~ point wherewith Sir Thomas More&#xD;
t silenced the challenging schoolmen&#xD;
- of Binges, An averia carrucw captors&#xD;

1 He glanced a little at the subject&#xD;
of conundrums; and among the chips&#xD;
from his workshop is a really clever&#xD;
* theory of conundrums. He has a clas-&#xD;
sification and discussion of them, all&#xD;
his own, and quite ingenious and&#xD;
satisfactory, which divides them into&#xD;
answerable and unanswerable, and,&#xD;
under each of these, into resemblant&#xD;
and differential.&#xD;
For instance: let the four classes&#xD;
be distinguished with the initials of&#xD;
those four terms, A. R., A. D., U. U.,&#xD;
and U. D.; you will find that the&#xD;
Infinite Possible Conundrum (so to&#xD;
speak) can always be reduced under&#xD;
one of those four heads. Using syma-&#xD;
bols, as they do in discussing syllo-&#xD;
gism,- indeed, by the way, a conun-&#xD;
drum is only a jocular variation in&#xD;
the syllogism, an intentional fallacy&#xD;
for fun (read Whately's Logic, Book&#xD;
III., and see if it isn't so), - using&#xD;
syiYmbols, I say, you have these four&#xD;
"figures:&#xD;
I. (A. B.) Why is A like B? (an-&#xD;
swerable): as, Why is a gentleman&#xD;
who gives a young lady a young dog,&#xD;
like a person who rides rapidly up&#xD;
hill? A. Because he gives a gallop&#xD;
up (gal-a-pup).&#xD;
Sub-variety; depending upon a&#xD;
violation of something like the "prin-&#xD;
ciple of excluded middle," a very&#xD;
fallacy of a fallacy; such as the an-&#xD;
cient ~nigger~minstrel~~ case, Why&#xD;
is an elephant like a brick? A. Be-&#xD;
cause neither of them can climb a&#xD;
tree.&#xD;
II. (A. D.) Why is A unlilo B?&#xD;
(answerable) usually put thus: What&#xD;
is the difference between A and B?&#xD;
(Figure 1., if worded in the same&#xD;
&#xD;
Devil-I&#xD;
style, would become, "What is the&#xD;
similarity between A and B?): as,&#xD;
What is the difference between the&#xD;
old United-States Bank and the Ful-&#xD;
ton Ferry-boat signals in thick&#xD;
weather? A. One is a fog whistle,&#xD;
and the other is a Whig fossil.&#xD;
Ill. (U. U.) Why is A like B?&#xD;
(unanswerable): as Charles Lamb's&#xD;
well-known question, Is that your&#xD;
own hare, or a wig?&#xD;
LV. (U. D.) Why is A unlike B?&#xD;
(unanswerable): i. e., What is the&#xD;
difference, &amp;amp;c., as, What is the dif-&#xD;
f~rence between a fac simile and a&#xD;
sick family; ot between hydraulics and&#xD;
and raw-hide licks?&#xD;
But let me not diverge too far into&#xD;
frivolity~ All the hopefully difficult&#xD;
questions, Dr. Hicok set down and&#xD;
classified. He compiled a set of rules&#xD;
on the subject, and indeed developed&#xD;
a whole philosophy of it, by which&#xD;
he struck off, as soluble, question~ or&#xD;
classes of them. Some he thought&#xD;
out himself; others were now and&#xD;
then answered in some learned book,&#xD;
that led the way through the very&#xD;
heart of one or another of his biggest&#xD;
mill-stones.&#xD;
So it was really none too much&#xD;
time that lie had; and, in truth,-he&#xD;
did not actually decide upon his three&#xD;
questions, until just a week before&#xD;
the fearful day when lie was to put&#xD;
them.&#xD;
It came at last, as every day of&#xD;
reckoning surely comes; and Dr.&#xD;
I [icok, memorandum in hand, sat in&#xD;
his comfortable library about three&#xD;
o'clock on one beautiful warm sum-&#xD;
mer afternoon, as pale as a sheet, his&#xD;
heart thumping away like Mr.&#xD;
~rupp~s biggest steam-hammer ~at&#xD;
Essen, his mouth and tongue parched&#xD;
and feverish, a pitcher of cold water&#xD;
at hand from which he sipped and&#xD;
sipped, though it seemed as if his&#xD;
&#xD;
~uzzlers.                       7&#xD;
throat repelled it into "the glohulat&#xD;
state," or dispersed it into steam, as&#xD;
red-hot iron does. Around him were&#xD;
the records of the vast army of doubt..&#xD;
ers and quibblers in whose works he&#xD;
had heen hunting, as a traveller labors&#xD;
through a jungle, for the deepest&#xD;
doubts, the most remote inquiries.&#xD;
Sometimes, with that sort of hardi-&#xD;
hood, rather than reason, which makes&#xD;
a desperate man try to believe by his&#xD;
will what he longs to know to be true,&#xD;
Dr. Hicok would say to himself, "I&#xD;
know I've got him!" And then his&#xD;
heart would seem to fall out of him,&#xD;
it sank so suddenly, and with so deadW&#xD;
a faintness, as the other side of his&#xD;
awful case loomed before him, and he&#xD;
thought, "But if-.?" He would&#xD;
not finish tlwt question; he could not.&#xD;
The furthest point to which he&#xD;
could bring himself was, that of a&#xD;
sort of icy outer stiffening of ac-&#xD;
quiescence in the inevitable.&#xD;
There was a ring at the street-door.&#xD;
The servant brought in a card, on a&#xD;
silver salver.&#xD;
Mr. Apollo Lyon.&#xD;
"Show the gentleman in," said the&#xD;
doctor. He spoke with difficulty;&#xD;
for the effort to control his own ner-&#xD;
vous excitement was so immense an&#xD;
exertion, that he hardly had the self-&#xD;
command and muscular energy e~ven&#xD;
to articulate.&#xD;
The servant returned, and ushered&#xD;
into the library handsome, youngish,&#xD;
middle-aged and middle-sized gentle-&#xD;
man, pale, with large melancholy&#xD;
black eyes, and dressed in the most&#xD;
perfect and quiet style.&#xD;
The doctor arose,- and greeted his&#xD;
visitor with a degree of steadiness&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="8-9" xml:id="VAC8019-00000005"/>&#xD;
8         ~~~~Devil-Puzzlers-                             DvZTzle89&#xD;
&#xD;
and politeness that did him the great-&#xD;
est credit.&#xD;
"How do you do, sir?" he said:&#xD;
"I am happy" - but it struck him&#xD;
that he wasn't, and he stopped short.&#xD;
"Very right, my dear sir," replied&#xD;
the guest, in a voice that was musi-&#xD;
cal but perceptibly sad, or rather pa-&#xD;
tient in tone. "Very right; how&#xD;
hollow those formulas are! I hate all&#xD;
forms and ceremonies! But I am&#xD;
glad to see you, doctor. Now, that&#xD;
is really the fact."&#xD;
No doubt! "Divil doubt him!" as&#xD;
an Irishman would say. So is a cat&#xD;
glad to see a mouse in its paw.&#xD;
Something like these thoughts arose&#xD;
in the doctor's mind; he smiled as&#xD;
affably as he could, and requested the&#xD;
visitor to be seated.&#xD;
"Thanks!" replied he, and took&#xD;
the chair which the doctor moved up&#xD;
to the table for him. He placed his&#xD;
hat and gloves on the table. There&#xD;
was a brief pause, as might happen&#xD;
if any two friends sat down at their&#xD;
ease for a chat on matters and things&#xD;
in general. The visitor turned over&#xD;
a volume or two that lay on the&#xD;
table.&#xD;
"The Devil," he read from one of&#xD;
them- "H is Origin, Greatness, and&#xD;
Decadence. By the Rev. A. R4ville,&#xD;
D.D."&#xD;
"Ah!" he commented quietly.&#xD;
"A Frenchman, I observe. If it&#xD;
had been an Englishman, I should&#xD;
fancy he wrote the book for the&#xD;
sake of the rhyme in the title. Do&#xD;
you know, doctor, I fancy that in-&#xD;
credulity of his, will substitute one&#xD;
dash for the two periods in the rever-&#xD;
end gentleman's degree! I know no&#xD;
one greater condition of success in&#xD;
s~ne lines of operation, than to have&#xD;
oil's existence thoroughly disbelieved&#xD;
m.&#xD;
The doctor forced himself to reply&#xD;
&#xD;
"I hardly know how I came to have&#xD;
the book here. Yet he does make&#xD;
out a pretty strong case. I confess&#xD;
I would like to be certified that he is&#xD;
righL Suppose you allow yourself to&#xD;
be convinced?'~ And the poor fellow&#xD;
grinned: it couldn't be called a smile.&#xD;
"Why, really, I'll look into it.&#xD;
I've considered the point though, not&#xD;
that I'm sure I could choose. And&#xD;
you know, as the late J. Milton very&#xD;
neatly observed, one would hardly&#xD;
like to lose one's intellectual being,&#xD;
"though full of pain;'~ and he&#xD;
smiled, not unkindly but sadly, and&#xD;
then resumed: "A Bible too. Very&#xD;
good edition. I remember seeing it&#xD;
stated that a professional person made&#xD;
it his business to find errors of the&#xD;
press in one of the Bible Society's&#xD;
editions, -this very one, I think; and&#xD;
the only one he could discover was a&#xD;
single "wrong font." Very accurate&#xD;
work - very!~~&#xD;
He had been turning over the&#xD;
leaves indifferently as he spoke, and&#xD;
laid the volume easily back. "Cu-&#xD;
rious old superstition that," he re-&#xD;
marked, "that certain personages&#xD;
were made uncomfortable by this&#xD;
work! And he gave the doctor a&#xD;
glance, as much as to ask, in the most&#xD;
delicate manner in the world, "Did&#xD;
you put that there to scare me with?"&#xD;
I think the doctor blushed a little.&#xD;
He had not really expected, you know,&#xD;
-still, in case there should be any&#xD;
prophylactic influence -? NQ harm&#xD;
done, in any event; and that was pre-&#xD;
cisely the observation made by the&#xD;
guest.&#xD;
"No harm done, my dear fellow ! ~&#xD;
he said, in his calm, quiet, musical&#xD;
voice. No good, either, I imagine&#xD;
they both of them added to them-&#xD;
selves.&#xD;
There is an often repeated observa-&#xD;
tion, that people under the pressure of&#xD;
&#xD;
an immeasurable misery or agony&#xD;
seen to take on a preternaturally&#xD;
sharp vision for minute details, such&#xD;
as spots in the carpet, and ~prigs in&#xD;
tI e wall-paper, threads on a sleeve,&#xD;
and the like. Probably the doctor&#xD;
felt this influence. He had dallied a&#xD;
little, too, with the crisis; and so did&#xD;
hisvisitor,-from different motives, no&#xD;
doubt; and, as he sat there, his eye&#xD;
fell on the card that had just been&#xD;
brought to him.&#xD;
"I beg your pardonm~ he said; "but&#xD;
might I ask a question about your&#xD;
card?"&#xD;
"Most certainly, doctor: what is&#xD;
it?"&#xD;
"Why - it's always a liberty to&#xD;
ask questions abont a gentleman's&#xD;
name, and we Scotchmen are particu-&#xD;
larly sensitive on th~ point; but I have&#xD;
always been interested in the general&#xD;
subject of patronomatology."&#xD;
The other, by a friendly smile and&#xD;
a deprecating wave of the hand, re-&#xD;
newed his welcome to the doctor's&#xD;
question.&#xD;
"Wel!, it's this: How did you&#xD;
come to decide upon that form of&#xD;
name, - Mr. Apollo Lyon?"&#xD;
"Oh! just a little fancy of mine.&#xD;
It's a newly-invented variable card, I&#xD;
believe they call it. There's a tem-&#xD;
porary ink arrangement. It struck&#xD;
me it was liable to abuse in case of an&#xD;
assumption of aliases; but perhaps&#xD;
that's none of my business. You can&#xD;
easily take off the upper name, and&#xD;
another one comes out underneath.&#xD;
I'm always interested in inventions.&#xD;
See."&#xD;
And as the text, "But they have&#xD;
sought out many inventions," passed&#xD;
through Dr. Hicok's mind, the other&#xD;
drew forth a white handkerchief,&#xD;
and, rubbing the card in a careless&#xD;
sort of way, laid it down before&#xD;
the doctor. Perhaps the strain on the&#xD;
&#xD;
poor doctor's nerves was unsteadying&#xD;
him by this time: he may not have&#xD;
been right; but he seemed to see only&#xD;
one name, as if compounded from the&#xD;
former two.&#xD;
Apohlyon.&#xD;
And it seemed to be in red ink in-&#xD;
stead of black; and the lines seemed&#xD;
to creep nnd throb and glow, as if the&#xD;
red were the red of fire, instead of ver-&#xD;
milion. But red is an extremely try-&#xD;
ing color to the eyes. However, the&#xD;
doctor, startled as he was, thought&#xD;
best not to raise any further queries,&#xD;
and only said, perhaps with some dif-&#xD;
ficulty, "Very curious, I'm sure I"&#xD;
"Well, doctor," said Mr. Lyon, or&#xD;
whatever his name was, "I don't&#xD;
want to hurry you, but I suppose we&#xD;
might as well have our little business&#xD;
over?"&#xD;
"Why, yes. I suppose you&#xD;
wouldn't care to consider any question&#xD;
of compromises or substitutes?"&#xD;
"I fear it's out of the question,&#xD;
really," was the reply, most kindly in&#xD;
tone, but with perfect distinctness&#xD;
There was a moment's silence. It&#xD;
seemed to Dr. Hicok as if the beat-&#xD;
ing of his heart must fill the room,&#xD;
it struck so heavily, and the blood&#xD;
seemed to surge with so loud a rush&#xD;
through the carotids up past his ears.&#xD;
"Shall I be found to have gone off&#xD;
with a rush of blood to the head?"&#xD;
he tlmc~ght to himself. But- it can&#xD;
very ohen be done by a resolute ef-&#xD;
fort-' ,~ gathered himself together as&#xD;
it were, and with one powerful exertion&#xD;
mastered his disorder nerves. Thea&#xD;
he lifted his memorandum, gave one&#xD;
glance at the sad, calm face opposite&#xD;
him, and spoke.&#xD;

&#xD;
<pb  n="10-11" xml:id="VAC8019-00000006"/>&#xD;
to                       Devil-a&#xD;
"You know they're every once in&#xD;
differences know; but it seems to me&#xD;
a while explaining a vote, us they call&#xD;
it, in Congress. It don't make any&#xD;
should put you more fully in&#xD;
of my meaning, if I should&#xD;
word or two, about the rca-&#xD;
visitor               usual&#xD;
pleasant acquiescence.&#xD;
I am aware,~~ said Dr. ilicok,&#xD;
that my selection would seem thor-&#xD;
oughly commonplace to most people.&#xD;
Yet nobody knows better than you&#xD;
do, my dear sir, that the oldest ques-&#xD;
tions are the newest. The same vi-&#xD;
tality which is so strong in them, as&#xD;
to raise them as soon as thought be-&#xD;
gins, is infinite, and maintains them&#xD;
as long as thought endures. Indeed,&#xD;
I may say to you frankly, that it is&#xD;
by no means on novelty, but rather&#xD;
on antiquity, that I rely."&#xD;
The doctor's hearer bowed with an&#xD;
air of approving interest. "Very&#xD;
justly reasoned," he observed. The&#xD;
doctor went on,&#xD;
"I have, I may say,-and under the&#xD;
circumstances I shall not be suspected&#xD;
of conceit, - made pretty much the&#xD;
complete circuit of unsolved problems.&#xD;
They class exactly as those questions&#xD;
do which we habitually reckon as&#xD;
solved: under the three subjects to&#xD;
which they relate,- God, the intelli-&#xD;
gent creation, the unintelligent crea-&#xD;
tion. Now, I have selected my ques-&#xD;
tions accordingly, - omie for each of&#xD;
those divisions. Whether I have suc-&#xD;
ceeded in satisfying the conditions&#xD;
necessary will appear quickly. But&#xD;
you see that I have not stooped to&#xD;
any quibbling, or begging either. I&#xD;
have sought to protect myself by the&#xD;
honorable use of a masculine reason.~~&#xD;
"Your observations interest me&#xD;
greatly," remarked the audience.&#xD;
"Not the less so, that they are so as-&#xD;
&#xD;
('uzZler8.&#xD;
curately coincident with my own ha-&#xD;
bitual lines of thought, - at least, so&#xD;
far ns I can judge from what you&#xD;
have said. Indeed, suppose you had&#xD;
called upon me to help youyrepare in-&#xD;
soluble problems. I was bimnd, I sup-&#xD;
pose, to comply to the best of my abil-&#xD;
ity; and, if I had done so, those state-&#xD;
ments of yours are thus far the very&#xD;
preface I supplied - I beg your par-&#xD;
don -should have supplied - you&#xD;
with. I fancy I could almost state the&#xD;
questions. Well?" -&#xD;
All this was most kind and compli-&#xD;
mentary; but somehow it did not en-&#xD;
courage the doctor in the least. Ho&#xD;
even fancied that lie detected a sneer,&#xD;
as if~l:is interlocutor had been saying,&#xD;
"Flutter away, old bird! That was&#xD;
my bait that you have been feeding&#xD;
on: you're safes en~uglm; it is my net&#xD;
that holds you."&#xD;
".Fb'st Question," said Dr. Hicok,&#xD;
with steadiness: "Reconcile the fore-&#xD;
knowledge and the fore-ordination of&#xD;
God with the free will of man?"&#xD;
"I thought so, of course," remarked&#xD;
the other. Then lie looked straight&#xD;
into the doctor's keen little gray eyes&#xD;
with his deep melancholy black ones,&#xD;
and raised his slender forefinger.&#xD;
"Most readily. The reconciliation is&#xD;
your own conscience, doctor! Do&#xD;
what you know to he right, and you&#xD;
will find that there is nothing to rec-&#xD;
oncile, - that you and your Maker&#xD;
have no debates to settle!"&#xD;
The words were spoken with a&#xD;
weighty solemnity and conviction&#xD;
that were even awful. The doctor&#xD;
had a conscience, though he had&#xD;
found himself practically forced, for&#xD;
the sake of success, to use a good deal&#xD;
of constraint with it, - in fact, to lock&#xD;
it up, as it were, in a private mad-&#xD;
house, on an unfounded charge of lu-&#xD;
nacy. But the obstinate thing would&#xD;
not die, and would not lose its wits;&#xD;
&#xD;
and now all of a sudden, and from&#xD;
the very last qitarter where it was to&#xD;
be expected, came a summons before&#xD;
whose intensity of just requirement&#xD;
no bolts could stand. The doctor's&#xD;
conscience walked out of her prison,&#xD;
and came straight up to the field of&#xD;
battle, and said, -&#xD;
"Give up the first question."&#xD;
And he obeyed.&#xD;
"I confess ~ he said. "But how&#xD;
could I have expected a great basic&#xD;
truth both religiously and psycholo-&#xD;
gically so, from - from you?"&#xD;
"Ah I my dear sir," was the reply:&#xD;
"you have erred in that line of&#xD;
thought, exactly as many others have.&#xD;
The truth is one and the same, to God,&#xD;
man, and devil."&#xD;
"Second Question," said Dr. Hic-&#xD;
ok. "Reconcile the development&#xD;
theory, connection of natural selection&#xD;
aiid sexual selection, with the respon-&#xD;
sible immortality of the soul."&#xD;
"Unquestionably," assented the&#xD;
other, as if to say, "Just as I ex-&#xD;
pected."&#xD;
"No theory of creation has any&#xD;
logical connection with any doctrine&#xD;
of immortality. What was the mo-&#xD;
tive of creation? - that would be a&#xD;
question I If you had asked me that!&#xD;
But time question, 'Where did men&#xD;
come from?' has no bearing on the&#xD;
question, 'Have they any duties now&#xD;
that they are here?' The two are&#xD;
reconciled, because they do not differ.&#xD;
You can't state any inconsistency be-&#xD;
tween a yard measure and a fifty-six&#xD;
pound weight."&#xD;
The doctor nodded; he sat down;&#xD;
lie took a glass of water, and pressed&#xD;
his hand to his heart. "Now,&#xD;
then," he said to himself, "once&#xD;
more! If I have to stand this fifteen&#xD;
minutes I shall be in some other&#xD;
world!"&#xD;
The door from the inner room&#xD;
&#xD;
11&#xD;
&#xD;
opened; and Mrs. Ilicok came singing&#xD;
in, carrying balanced upon her pretty&#xD;
pink fore-finger something or other&#xD;
of an airy bouquet-like fabric. Upon&#xD;
thisshe waslooking with much delight.&#xD;
"See, dear,!" she said: "how per-&#xD;
fectly lovely!"&#xD;
Both gentlemen started, and the&#xD;
lady started too. She had not known&#xD;
of the visit; and she had not, until&#xD;
this instant, seen that her husband&#xD;
was not alone.&#xD;
Dr. 1-licok, of course, had never&#xD;
given her the key to his skeleton-&#xD;
closet; for lie was a shrewd man. He&#xD;
loved her too; and he thought he&#xD;
had provided for her absence dur-&#xD;
ing the ordeal. Sue had executed&#xD;
her shopping with unprecedented&#xD;
speed.&#xD;
Why the visitor started, would be&#xD;
difficult to say. 1~erlxaps her voice&#xD;
startled him. The happy music in it&#xD;
was enough like a beautified duplicate&#xD;
of his o~vn thrilling sweet tones, to&#xD;
have made him acknowledge her for&#xD;
a sister, - from heaven. He started,&#xD;
at any rate.&#xD;
"Mr. Lyon, my wife," said the&#xD;
doctor, somewhat at a loss. Mr. Lyon&#xD;
bowed, and so did the lady.&#xD;
"I beg your pardon, gentlemen, I&#xD;
am sure," she said. "I did not know&#xD;
you were busy, dear. There is a&#xD;
thunder-shower coming up. I drove&#xD;
home just in season."&#xD;
"Oh! -only a little wager, about&#xD;
some ~ said the doctor.&#xD;
Perhaps he may be excused for his&#xD;
fib. He did not want to annoy her&#xD;
unnecessarily.&#xD;
"Oh, do let me know I" she said,&#xD;
with much eagerness. "You know&#xD;
how I enjoy them!'~&#xD;
"Well," said the doctor, "not ex-&#xD;
actly the ordinary kind. I was to&#xD;
puzzle my friend here with one ont&#xD;
of three questions; and he hiss beaten&#xD;

me in two of them already. I've but&#xD;
one more&#xD;
"Only one?" she asked, with a&#xD;
smile. "What a bright man your&#xD;
friend must be! I thought nobody&#xD;
could puzzle you, dear. Stay; let&#xD;
me ask the other question."&#xD;
Both the gentlemen started again:&#xD;
it was quite a surprise.&#xD;
"But are you a married man, Mr,&#xD;
Lyon?" she asked, with a blush.&#xD;
"No, madam," was the reply, with&#xD;
a very graceful bow, - "I have a&#xD;
mother, but no wife. Permit me to&#xD;
say, that, if I could believe there was&#xD;
a duplicate of yourself in existence,&#xD;
I would be as soon as possible."&#xD;
"Oh, what a gallant speech!" said&#xD;
the lady. "Thank you, sir, very&#xD;
much;" and she made him a pretty&#xD;
little courtesy. "Then lam quite sure&#xD;
of my question, sir. Shall I, dear?"&#xD;
The doctor quickly decided. "I&#xD;
am done for, any how,~~ he reflected.&#xD;
"I begin to see that the old villain&#xD;
put those questions into my head&#xD;
himself. He hinted as much. I&#xD;
don't know but I'd rather she would&#xD;
ask it. It's better to have her kill&#xD;
me, I guess, than to hold out the&#xD;
carving-knife to him myself.~~&#xD;
"With all my heart, my dear,"&#xD;
said the doctor, "if Mr. Lyon con-&#xD;
sents."&#xD;
Mr. Lyon looked a little disturbed;&#xD;
but his manner was perfect, as he re-&#xD;
plied that he regretted to seem to dis-&#xD;
oblige, but that he feared the condi-&#xD;
tions of their little bet would not al-&#xD;
low it."&#xD;
"Beg your pardon, I'm sure, for&#xD;
being so uncivil," said the lively little&#xD;
beauty, as she whispered a few words&#xD;
in her husband's ear.&#xD;
This is what she said, -&#xD;
"What's mine s yours, dear. Take&#xD;
it. Ask him buzz, buzz, buzz."&#xD;
Tue doctor nodded. Mrs. Hicok&#xD;
&#xD;
Puzzler8.&#xD;
stood by him and smiled, still holding&#xD;
in her pretty pink fore-finger the&#xD;
frail shimmering thing just men-&#xD;
tioned; and she gave it a twirl, so&#xD;
that it swung quite round. "Isn't it&#xD;
a love of a ~ she said.&#xD;
~ the doctor said aloud. "I&#xD;
adopt the question."&#xD;
"fPlrird Question. Which is the&#xD;
front side of this?"&#xD;
And he pointed to the bonnet. It&#xD;
must have been a bonnet, because&#xD;
Mrs. Hicok called it so. I shouldn't&#xD;
have known it from the collection of&#xD;
things in a kaleidoscope, bunched up&#xD;
together.&#xD;
TIme lady stood before him, and&#xD;
twirled the wondrous fabric round and&#xD;
round, with the prettiest possible un-&#xD;
conscious roguish look of defiance.&#xD;
The doctor's very heart si '~ )d still.&#xD;
"Put it on, please," said Mr. Lyon,&#xD;
in the most innocent way in the world.&#xD;
"Oh, no!" laughed she. "I know&#xD;
I'm only a woman, but I'm not quite&#xD;
so silly! But I'll tell you ~vhat: you&#xD;
men put it on, if you think that ~vill&#xD;
heip you!" And she held out the&#xD;
mystery to him.&#xD;
Confident in his powers of discrim-&#xD;
ination, Mr. Lyon took hold of the&#xD;
fitiry-hike combination of sparkles and&#xD;
threads and feathers and flowers,&#xD;
touching it with that sort of timid ap-&#xD;
prehension that bachelors use with a&#xD;
baby. He stood before the glass over&#xD;
the mantle-piece. First he put it&#xD;
across his head with one side in front,&#xD;
and then with the other. Then he&#xD;
put it lengthways of his head, and&#xD;
tried tIme effect of tying one of the&#xD;
two couples of strings under each of&#xD;
his ears. Then lie put it on, the&#xD;
other side up; so that it swam on his&#xD;
head like a boat, with a high mounted&#xD;
bow and stern. More than once he&#xD;
did all this, with obvious care and&#xD;
thoughtfulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
Devil-a&#xD;
Then he came slowly back, and re-&#xD;
sumed his seat. It was growing very&#xD;
dark, though they had not noticed&#xD;
it; for the thunder-shower had been&#xD;
hurrying on, and already its advanced&#xD;
guard of wind, heavy laden with the&#xD;
smell of the rain, could be heard, and&#xD;
a few large drops splashed on the&#xD;
window.&#xD;
The beautiful wife of the doctor&#xD;
laughed merrily to watch the growing&#xD;
discomposure of the visitor, who re-&#xD;
turned the bonnet, with undinainishdd&#xD;
courtesy, but with obvious constraint&#xD;
of manner.&#xD;
He looked down; he drummed on&#xD;
the table; he looked up; and both&#xD;
the doctor and the doctor's wife were&#xD;
startled at the intense sudden anger&#xD;
in the dark, handsome face. Then&#xD;
he sprang up, and went to the window.&#xD;
He looked out a moment, and then&#xD;
said,&#xD;
"Upon my word, that is going to&#xD;
be a very sharp squall! The clouds&#xD;
are very heavy. If I'm any judge,&#xD;
something will be struck. I can feel&#xD;
the electricity in the air."&#xD;
While he still spoke, the first thun-&#xD;
der-bolt crashed overhead. It was one&#xD;
of those close, sudden, overpoweringly&#xD;
awful explosions from clouds very&#xD;
heavy and very near, where the light-&#xD;
ning and the thunder leap together&#xD;
out of the very air close about you,&#xD;
even as~if you were in them. It was&#xD;
an unendurable burst of sound, and of&#xD;
the intense white sheet light of very&#xD;
near lightning. Drcadfally fright-&#xD;
ened, the poor little lady clung close&#xD;
to her husband. He, poor man, if&#xD;
&#xD;
Puzzler8.                      18&#xD;
possible yet more frightened, exhaust.&#xD;
ed as he was by what he had been&#xD;
enduring, fainted dead away~ Don't&#xD;
blame him: a east-iron bull-dog&#xD;
might have fainted.&#xD;
Mrs. Hicok, thinking that her hus-&#xD;
band was struck dead by the light-&#xD;
ning, screamed terribly. Then she&#xD;
touched him; and, seeing what was&#xD;
really the matter, administered cold&#xD;
water from the pitcher on the table.&#xD;
Shortly he revived.&#xD;
"Where is he ? ~ he said.&#xD;
"I don't know, love. I thought&#xD;
you were dead. He must have gone&#xD;
away. Did it strike the house?"&#xD;
"Gone away? Thank God! Thank&#xD;
you, dear I" cried out the doctor.&#xD;
Not knowing any adequate cause&#xD;
for so much emotion, she answered&#xD;
him,-~&#xD;
"Now, love, don't you ever say&#xD;
wonwn are not practical again. That&#xD;
was a practical question, you Bee.&#xD;
But didn't it strike the house? What&#xD;
a queer smell. Ozone: isn't that&#xD;
what you were telling me about?&#xD;
How funny, that lightning should&#xD;
have a smell ~&#xD;
"I believe there's no doubt of it,"&#xD;
observed Dr. Hicok.&#xD;
Mr. Apollo Lyon had really gone,&#xD;
though just how or when, nobody&#xD;
could say.&#xD;
"My dear," said Dr. Hicok, "I do&#xD;
so like that bonnet of yours! I don't&#xD;
wonder it puzzled him. It would&#xD;
puzzle the Devil himself. I firmly be-&#xD;
lieve I shall call ityourDevil-puzzler."&#xD;
But he never told her what the&#xD;
puzzle had been.&#xD;

THE POLE'S STOI~Y.&#xD;
&#xD;
I SET out from St. Petersburg one&#xD;
fine evening in January, to join a&#xD;
stag-hunt, the next morning, one&#xD;
hundred and thirty versts distant.&#xD;
Five sleds, occupied each by two&#xD;
hunters and drawn by a troika, flew&#xD;
one after the otlaer like a rapid cara-&#xD;
van, over the grand highway which&#xD;
led to Moscow, through Novgorod.&#xD;
Our Automedon, his arms extended&#xD;
and his reins rolled around his hands,&#xD;
standing like the driver of an antique&#xD;
chariot, directed his three horses,&#xD;
which were harnessed abreast; one&#xD;
of them trotting rapidly between&#xD;
the two others, who galloped on each&#xD;
side. We were stretclled out on the&#xD;
seat, lying rather than sitting, com*&#xD;
fortably wrapped in our pelisses, and&#xD;
we counted on sleeping* there as&#xD;
well as on a luxuriously cushioned&#xD;
ottoman. But we hInd reckoned with-&#xD;
out those terrible oukhdbi, a kind of&#xD;
furrows, or rather ditches; wide&#xD;
gutters hollowed in the road, deep&#xD;
enough for an equipage to disappear&#xD;
entirely in them, like a fishing boat&#xD;
between the billows of the ocean.&#xD;
Thus kept awake by frequent jolt-&#xD;
ings, we watched - passing on each&#xD;
side of the road, after the manner of&#xD;
the figures in a magic-lantern&#xD;
sometimes the pines or birch trees,&#xD;
bending their branches like tired&#xD;
~srms, under the weight of the scin-&#xD;
tillating hoar-frost; sometimes the&#xD;
black and uniform isl~cik of a sleeping&#xD;
village. The night was clear and&#xD;
serene, and cold in proportion. Under&#xD;
the silvery rays of the full moon,&#xD;
which had just risen above the hori-&#xD;
zon, the snow sparkled like a cloth&#xD;
studded with diamonds1 sending back&#xD;
&#xD;
even to the sky the reflection of the&#xD;
white shroud which covered the earth,&#xD;
and gave to all nature its immacu-&#xD;
late tint.&#xD;
My bed-fellow, or rather my com-&#xD;
panion in tile sled, was a Pole, or at&#xD;
least a Russian of Polish descent,&#xD;
which was illdicated sufficiently ivell&#xD;
by the termination of his name&#xD;
ski, which, as every one knows, is&#xD;
equivalent to the prefix de of nobility.&#xD;
He had smoked, without saying a&#xD;
word, as many cigars, one after the&#xD;
otlser, as our caravan counted ~sleds;&#xD;
then ile hind turned over on his side,&#xD;
nild I tllought him sound asleep, not-&#xD;
withstansling the pitching of tlao&#xD;
vehicle, when suddenly he raised the&#xD;
visor of his otter-skin cap, and look-&#xD;
ing at the moon said, with a burst&#xD;
of hoarse laughter,-&#xD;
"All I Ahi There's Pkn Twar-&#xD;
dowski I"&#xD;
"Who is this PIta Twardowski?"&#xD;
I asked.&#xD;
"Do you see," replied he, "that&#xD;
little black man on the face of the&#xD;
moon, who raises his arms and opens&#xD;
his legs like Punchinehlo?"&#xD;
"Yes. Well?"&#xD;
"Well! that is PItn Twardowski."&#xD;
"Tell me the story," cried I imme-&#xD;
diately. "There is some legend un-&#xD;
derneath this; and I am as impatient&#xD;
for your narrative as the sultan of&#xD;
'The Thousand and One Nights' was&#xD;
for one of the tales of Scheherazade."&#xD;
"Very willingly," replied he, "if I&#xD;
can get to the end of it; but I fear&#xD;
tilat an oukh4bi will make me bite&#xD;
off my tongue; or that the icy wind&#xD;
will glue my lips together as it&#xD;
has already glued my eyelids. The&#xD;

He lighted a new cigar, to make&#xD;
vp the half-dozen; and as soon as&#xD;
the first puffs of smoke had warmed&#xD;
a little his stiffened lips, he asked, -&#xD;
"Have you read the ~ of&#xD;
Goethe?~'&#xD;
~ I answered' "but only in&#xD;
a translation, for I have the misfor-&#xD;
tune to be ignorant of German, as I&#xD;
am of a thousand other things; and&#xD;
none knows better than I, humble&#xD;
translator as I am of some master-&#xD;
pieces, all the distance which sep-&#xD;
arates "-&#xD;
"No matter," said he, interrupting&#xD;
sue; "the form is of no importance if&#xD;
the substance is understood. Since&#xD;
you have read 'Faust,' either in tile&#xD;
original or in the translation, you&#xD;
know the popular legend on which&#xD;
the great poet of Weiniar has found-&#xD;
ed his admirable drama. You know&#xD;
the history of that famous doctor,&#xD;
John Faust, born at the same time,&#xD;
it is said, in Anhalt, Suabia, and&#xD;
Brandenburg; who learned all tile&#xD;
sciences of his time; knew magic;&#xD;
and who, always pushed forward by&#xD;
tile ardent desire of knowing all&#xD;
things and enjoyiiig all things, ended&#xD;
by giving himself to the Devil, who&#xD;
appears in the shape of a little gray&#xD;
monk, on condition that this little&#xD;
monk would gratify him in all his&#xD;
caprices during twenty-four years;&#xD;
at the end of ~vhich time, the soul of&#xD;
Faust, in its turn tile slave of the&#xD;
evil one, should go to roast in hell&#xD;
the rest of eternity. This history is&#xD;
old in Poland, ~vhere we ilave a Faust,&#xD;
much anterior to that of the Ger-&#xD;
mans, whose neck the Devil wrings&#xD;
towards the end of the sixteenth&#xD;
century. Ours is called P&amp;amp;n Twar-&#xD;
dowski, or, translating jute French,&#xD;
&#xD;
'8  Story.                          15&#xD;
Monsieur de Twardow. He lived' at&#xD;
Cracow, when this poor little republic&#xD;
(our interview took place before the&#xD;
month of February, 1848) was the&#xD;
proud capital of Lech the White.&#xD;
Loch the Black, and the other Piasts,&#xD;
precursors of the Ja.gellons. The&#xD;
Polish, like the German doctor, cub&#xD;
tivated the entire tree of human&#xD;
science, was a great necromancer far&#xD;
beyond any other, and in his despair&#xD;
at the incompleteness of his knowl-&#xD;
edge, ever realizing only his igno-&#xD;
rance at the end of all that he&#xD;
learned, he also finished by signing&#xD;
a compact with the Devil. Then,&#xD;
knowing every thing and enjoying&#xD;
every thing, he exhausted the er~v-&#xD;
ing of his soul for science and pleas-&#xD;
ure.&#xD;
"Until this point, every thing cor-&#xD;
responds in the two legen~ls: which&#xD;
proves, by the way, that that of Faust&#xD;
is none the less a satire fabricated by&#xD;
the monks against Doctor John Fust&#xD;
of Mayence, who was one of the in-&#xD;
ventors of printing. Thus in Ger-&#xD;
many, as in Poland, it is aptly shown&#xD;
in a popular apologue, that a just&#xD;
punishment follows the pride and&#xD;
temerity of science. It is again,&#xD;
under another form, the forbidden&#xD;
fruit, the tempting serpent, the ex~&#xD;
pulsion from paradise, and the fall&#xD;
of man. But towards the end there&#xD;
is a radical difference hetevcen tI~e two,&#xD;
narratives. Now, then, attention !"&#xD;

often his words were frozen in coming&#xD;

the parties did that which all litigious&#xD;
persons ought to do: they made an&#xD;
amicable settlement. One put back&#xD;
his conjuring-book into his pocket,&#xD;
the other laid the child in his cradle;&#xD;
and, without witnesses, they signed a&#xD;
new contract, in ~vhich Phn Twar-&#xD;

the Devil as soon as the said Devil&#xD;
should have fulfilled three conditions,&#xD;
imposed upon him by the said Pha&#xD;
Twardowski; which if not fulfilled,&#xD;
the compact became void.&#xD;
"The trial began immediately. P~n&#xD;
Twardowski straightway ordered the&#xD;
Devil to take a horse which was&#xD;
painted on the fatal sign of the inn,&#xD;
and gallop three times aroi~nd the&#xD;
to~ver of the church. Every one&#xD;
knows that hell, like heaven, is nl~vays&#xD;
controlled by the number three. With-&#xD;
out further parley, Ozermibog picked&#xD;
up a bit of straw from the earth,&#xD;
and transformed it into a horsewhip.&#xD;
Touched by the end of this wand, the&#xD;
painted horse obediently descended&#xD;
from the sign, all saddled and bridled,&#xD;
his nostrils breathing fire. The Devil&#xD;
got astride his steed, and three times&#xD;
made an infernal circuit around the&#xD;
church more rapid than that of the&#xD;
ballad, 'Les morts vont vite:~ and&#xD;
more furious than a galop of de'bar-&#xD;
deurs at the marked ball of your opera&#xD;
at Paris.&#xD;
"By the ease with which the Devil&#xD;
had accomplished this first trial, Phn&#xD;
Twardowski saw very well that the&#xD;
twelve labors of Hercules would be&#xD;
mere bagatelles to him; and in order&#xD;
to oblige such an antagonist to&#xD;

acknowledge himself conquered, it&#xD;
was necessary to quit the physical&#xD;
order of things, and try something in&#xD;
the moral. Recalling to his mind the&#xD;
recent adventure with the child,&#xD;
and the miraculous protection that&#xD;
he had received from his god-daugh-&#xD;
ter, he ordered the Devil to take a&#xD;
bath in the vessel of holy water that&#xD;
the priest had brought hither for the&#xD;
baptism. At this order, Czera6bog&#xD;
made a horrible grimace. He trembled&#xD;
from head to foot, ground his teeth,&#xD;
rolled his eyes, and for some moments&#xD;
showed himself irresolute. But at&#xD;
length the desire to snatch a soul&#xD;
from paradise - which is the inces-&#xD;
sant and exclusive occupation of the&#xD;
evil one - got the mastery over his&#xD;
natural hQrror of holy water. He&#xD;
began to shrink, to curl hii~self up,&#xD;
to fold himself over and over, until&#xD;
he became about the size of a mouse.&#xD;
Then, approaching the basin in which&#xD;
is washed away all the sins of men,&#xD;
he resolutely plunged in, and dived&#xD;
head-foremost as from the bridge of&#xD;
the Neva. One heard that kind of&#xD;
dull hissing that red-hot iron makes,&#xD;
when being tempered in cold water;&#xD;
only, it was not the Devil who burnt&#xD;
the holy water, but the holy water&#xD;
that burnt the Devil; for strong odor&#xD;
of scorched flesh was spread around&#xD;
throughout the house. Nevertheless,&#xD;
Czcrn~bog came out of the baptistery,&#xD;
scalded, but triumphant.&#xD;
"When he presented himself before&#xD;
Phn Twardowski, having resumed his&#xD;
natural form, laughing with that sa-&#xD;
tanic sneer by which all devils express&#xD;
their contentment after having per-&#xD;
formed some trick of their trade, the&#xD;
poor doctor, in his turn, trembled: one&#xD;
would have said he felt the roasting of&#xD;

18                      The P014&#xD;
what a terrible adversary he had to&#xD;
overcome, Pim Twardowski resolved&#xD;
to strike the decisive blow, and to&#xD;
bring into battle hi~ last reserve; to&#xD;
play, as we say at cards, his ace of&#xD;
trumps. He ordered the Devil to pass&#xD;
on entire month in company with&#xD;
Pkni Twardowska, - his wife. The&#xD;
Devil knew her, as well as he did the&#xD;
wife of Socrates; for she was one of&#xD;
those dame Honestas who necessarily&#xD;
are the curse of their husbands.&#xD;
"At this magic name he instantly&#xD;
cried out, ' Abremuntio / I give it up!'&#xD;
and leaving P&amp;amp;n Twardowski, he ran&#xD;
to hide his shame and defeat at the&#xD;
farthest depth of hell. Let no one&#xD;
say after this, that a bad woman is&#xD;
good for nothing!"&#xD;
My companion, laughing in his icy&#xD;
beard, coughed that little dry cough&#xD;
of the orator who pauses to give place&#xD;
to the applause of his audience.&#xD;
"This history," said Ito him, "like&#xD;
the bad woman, is worth more than&#xD;
nothing, and I am satisfied with it;&#xD;
but I do not see the least connection&#xD;
between Pita Twardowski and the&#xD;
light of the~moon."-"Ah!it is true,"&#xD;
replied he. "I forgot to tell you&#xD;
there were two versions of the history&#xD;
of my Polish sorcerer. The first -&#xD;
thatwhich I havcjust related to you-&#xD;
is that of the scandal-loving tongues&#xD;
of persons who pretend that the doc-&#xD;
tor was married. But the serious and&#xD;
rational men, who affirm that Pita&#xD;
Twardowski remained all his life a&#xD;
bachelor, these relate his contest with&#xD;
the Devil in another way. They say,&#xD;
that, instead of ordering the malicious&#xD;
spirit to pass an entire month with&#xD;
the wicked woman, living, like a&#xD;
legitimate husband, undcr the same&#xD;
roof, at the same tables in the same&#xD;
bed, he proposed for a last trial&#xD;
something easier and more accepta-&#xD;

former times, who fulfilled in all the&#xD;
ordeals the conditions of certain ad-&#xD;
ventures, which destiny had reserved&#xD;
for them to accomplish-caine off con-&#xD;
queror. And poor 1'&amp;amp;n T~vardowski,&#xD;
like a true gentleman, the slave of his&#xD;
word, of his ucrbuim noble, delivered&#xD;
himself with a good grace to the ene-&#xD;
my of the human race. Hung as&#xD;
soon as taken! Czerndbog seized&#xD;
him by the collar of hi~ double, and,&#xD;
like an eagle holding it lamb in his&#xD;
claws, he carried off his p~ey through&#xD;
the air.&#xD;
Squeezed in his throat by the grip&#xD;
of the Devil, and suffocated by the&#xD;
rapidity of this aerial flight, Pita&#xD;
T~vardowski lost his breath. Feeling&#xD;
himself ready to expire, he cried&#xD;
aloud with a stifled voice, like the&#xD;
dying man who recommends his soul&#xD;
to God, 'Ace AT(u'ht parissimncr.'&#xD;
These sacred words, the joy of heaven&#xD;
and the terror of hells struck the&#xD;
Devil like the blow of a thunderbolt.&#xD;
He let go his hold, was precipitated&#xD;
downwards, and Pimn Twardowski&#xD;
remained suspended in space, like an&#xD;
anatomical preparation in mi jar of&#xD;
alcohol. And there lie is yet, pre-&#xD;
served in ethereal vapor. Aiid the&#xD;
people of my country, at the time of&#xD;

ty theatres. The representative of&#xD;
one class meets me with the observa-&#xD;
tion, that he has never been there be-&#xD;
fore, and has only dropped iu this&#xD;
time out of curiosity. It is needless&#xD;
to remark, that this representative,&#xD;
who always has an eminently respect-&#xD;
able look, is a liar. He has been&#xD;
there before; and he will be there&#xD;
again. The representative of the&#xD;
other class knows what is coming.&#xD;
His assertions as to what the next&#xD;
performer is going to do create plens~&#xD;
ant anticipations in the circle around&#xD;
him; and I have often wondered&#xD;
whether the representatives of this&#xD;
class might not be minions of the&#xD;
management, employed to keep the&#xD;
interest of those around them unflag-&#xD;
ging, from the beginning to the end&#xD;
of the performance.&#xD;
As I had been somewhat bored by&#xD;
the performances of two wizened bal-&#xD;
let dancers, and had been really&#xD;
stunned by the remarkably unpicas-&#xD;
sat manner in which a remarkably&#xD;
'mapleasant song, entitled, "I'm the&#xD;
Wrl that's Jolly, Boys,"had been sung&#xD;
a fat woman, in a short, blue vel-&#xD;
ret skirt, I looked through the pro-&#xD;
~ramme in search of something inter-&#xD;
a~ting. My eye fell upon the follow-&#xD;
tag:&#xD;
"Tss~ IMPROVISATORE,&#xD;
MORDAUNT E. HILL, EsQ.&#xD;
Tm miscellaneous extenrpor~zations."&#xD;
"1103 just great," said the repre-&#xD;
&#xD;
The .tn~pro?.isatore and the Heeler.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE IMPIROVISATORE AND THE HEELED~&#xD;
ar FRIID W. LOllING.&#xD;
&#xD;
tentative of class number two, enthu-&#xD;
siastically. "He is an improvisatoar,&#xD;
he is."&#xD;
"What does he ~ I asked.&#xD;
"He makes up songs as he goes&#xD;
along," said the representative. "Some&#xD;
of them are funny, and some ain't;&#xD;
but he makes 'em all up, without stop-&#xD;
ping to think."&#xD;
At this moment, as if to verify my&#xD;
informant's description, Mordaunt B.&#xD;
Hill, Esq., stepped upon the stage.&#xD;
The personal appearance of Mordaunt&#xD;
E. Hill, Esq., was certainly not pre-&#xD;
possessing. He wore a large brown&#xD;
wig, which seemed obtrusively to&#xD;
show that it was a wig, and under no&#xD;
circumstances to be mistaken for real&#xD;
hair. One eye was a dingy blue in&#xD;
color, the other apparently sightless.&#xD;
Hislipswere thin and parched, his skin&#xD;
yellow and mottled, his teeth-which&#xD;
were horrible - were few in number,&#xD;
and scattered at intervals along his&#xD;
gums. The singular ugliness of his&#xD;
whole appearance was enhanced by&#xD;
the remarkable manner in which he&#xD;
was dressed. He wore a forlorn old&#xD;
brown sack coat, in the button-hole&#xD;
of which was an unwieldy bunch of&#xD;
bright pink and blue flowers,- a deco-&#xD;
ration which crowned the grotesque&#xD;
repulsiveness of his whole appearance.&#xD;
Received with the usual amount of&#xD;
applause, he bowed, and immediately&#xD;
began to sing in a dismally cracked&#xD;
and dissonant voice, to the air of "The&#xD;
Cork Leg," -&#xD;
"Kind friends, I've come in here to sing a song&#xD;
And it won't be short, end it won't ho long:&#xD;
And I hope yen won't consider it wrong&#xD;
If I mike itslinguige somewhat strong&#xD;

20               The Improvisator&#xD;
This opening verse was evidently a&#xD;
formula. The real work of improvi-&#xD;
sation was about to begin. There&#xD;
was a curious fascination to me&#xD;
watching, him. His sallow face, all&#xD;
the more sa!lo~v for the dot of rouge&#xD;
on each cheek-bone, gleamed with a&#xD;
ghastly smile, as the burst of applause&#xD;
told him that his first verse had suc-&#xD;
ceeded with his hearers: but, in the&#xD;
midst of this horrible smile, a look of&#xD;
pain came over his face; and I saw&#xD;
that his feeble old brain was making&#xD;
desperate efforts to grind out another&#xD;
verse. To my great surprise, this&#xD;
verse, when it came, was slightly pa-&#xD;
thetic: -&#xD;
"When I was a child, I used to be&#xD;
A-standing beside of my mother's knee:&#xD;
But now I'm a grown-up man; and she&#xD;
Is bur-i-ed far away from me&#xD;
llitoo, ralino, rallee, really,&#xD;
Ritoo, ralloo, really."&#xD;
Again the ghastly smile, again the&#xD;
look of painful effort; and this time,&#xD;
to tile great delight of his audience,&#xD;
he beame personally abusive. Ex-&#xD;
tending his hand, he pointed to the&#xD;
right of the house, and sang, -&#xD;
"It wouldn't do that young man no hurt&#xD;
If he was to go home and put on a clean shirt;&#xD;
For the one ho's got on is covered with dirt,&#xD;
And the girl beside him is trying to flirt&#xD;
Ritoo, ralloo, rallon, really,&#xD;
Ritee, ralloo, really."&#xD;
"I guess," said the representative,&#xD;
reflectively, "that he's pretty full to-&#xD;
night. He does pitch in awful when&#xD;
he's full."&#xD;
Whether the Improvisatore was full&#xD;
or not, I cannot say; but he certainly&#xD;
did pitch in. A tall man in the par-&#xD;
quet circle was alluded to as a "bean-&#xD;
pole;" a woman in front of me was&#xD;
accused of being too fat, and "lapping&#xD;
over~~ her seat; and a young gentle-&#xD;
man, with bushy red hair, in the or-&#xD;
cheatra, was made so unpleasantly&#xD;
&#xD;
e and the Heeler.&#xD;
conspicuous by the delicate raillery of&#xD;
the Improvisatore, that he finally rose,&#xD;
and left the house. The audience&#xD;
applauded every thing that came from&#xD;
the Improvisatore; yet I fancied that&#xD;
most people seemed relieved from in-&#xD;
definite apprehensions when he had&#xD;
finished.&#xD;
"He is a lusby old fellow," said the&#xD;
representative, - "a kind of boiled&#xD;
maniac. He'll probably go and get&#xD;
drunk now that his work is ~&#xD;
Three years elapsed before I again&#xD;
saw the Improvisatore. I was in the&#xD;
bar-room of the Continental, with my&#xD;
friend, Dr. Max Schweigenthnl. The&#xD;
doctor is a charming young fellow,&#xD;
with a beautiful wife. In some curi-&#xD;
ous way, he has acquired the monopoly&#xD;
of practice among the theatrical cir-&#xD;
cles of his city. If a heavy tra~edian&#xD;
has a deeper hoarseness than usual, lie&#xD;
summons Dr. Sehweigenthal. If a&#xD;
dancer sprains her ankle, or a trapeze-&#xD;
performer shatters a couple of ribs,&#xD;
Dr. Schweigeuthal is sent for at once.&#xD;
He has attended stars and supernu-&#xD;
meraries, he has prescribed for 11am-&#xD;
let and Jem Bags.&#xD;
I was talking with the doctor, when&#xD;
I saw the hideous but familiar face&#xD;
of the Improvisatore at the farther&#xD;
end of the room. lIe seemed a trifle&#xD;
shabbier than when I had last seen&#xD;
him, but still was little changed.&#xD;
"Who is that man?" I asked my&#xD;
friend.&#xD;
"Hill, the concert-saloon perform-&#xD;
er," was the reply.&#xD;
"Sure enough," I said; "I remem-&#xD;
ber him now."&#xD;
"Do you see that heavy-looking&#xD;
brute, just behind him?" asked the&#xD;
doctor.&#xD;
~ said I. "Is he a singer&#xD;
too?"&#xD;
Myfriend laughed. "It's a curious&#xD;
story," he said, -" one ef the most&#xD;
&#xD;
The Improvisaic&#xD;
curious I ever heard. That man is a&#xD;
heeler."&#xD;
"A wheeler ~ I repeated, in uttee&#xD;
bewilderment.&#xD;
"Yes;" said the doctor. "Light&#xD;
your cigar, and sit do~vn here where&#xD;
you can ~vatch them, and I will tell&#xD;
you the story, such as it is."&#xD;
The doctor's story was indeed a&#xD;
singular one. Mr. Samuel Bangs was&#xD;
mauiager of the Concordia Theatre.&#xD;
The Concordia Theatre is devoted to&#xD;
the variety business. "We go ahead;&#xD;
but we aim to be chaste and refined&#xD;
in our style," are the words that head-&#xD;
ed the Coacordia programme at the&#xD;
opening of the last season. Now, un-&#xD;
fortunately for Mr. Samuel Bangs,&#xD;
his associates were brief and concise&#xD;
in their manner of addressing him,&#xD;
and so reduced his first name to a&#xD;
monosyllabic form. To be called Sam&#xD;
Bangs was not a very great annoy-&#xD;
ance; but Mr. Bangs didobjeettothe&#xD;
nickname that gradually grew out of&#xD;
his being thus addressed. Th~ "1',&#xD;
which had been taken from one end&#xD;
of his name was attached to the other&#xD;
end; and the manager of the Con-&#xD;
cordia was known, even among the&#xD;
dirty little ragamuffins who fre-&#xD;
quented his upper gallery, as Slam&#xD;
Bang.&#xD;
In spite of his name, Slam Bang&#xD;
was a man of peaceful disposition~.&#xD;
his chief ambition, as he oftea told&#xD;
Dr. Schweigenthal, was to buy a farm&#xD;
in the country, and take Mrs. Bangs&#xD;
and the children there, and never see&#xD;
the inside of a theatre again. The&#xD;
Concordia Theatre was certainly not&#xD;
the place for such a man, as the emi-&#xD;
nent artists who appeared there were&#xD;
turbulent and quarrelsome: so that&#xD;
personal encounters, in which Slam&#xD;
Bang was invariably defeated, were&#xD;
of frequent occurrence. One day, in&#xD;
a state of depression f~c~i these facts,&#xD;
&#xD;
and the Ileeler.           21&#xD;
a brilliant idea struck Slam Bang&#xD;
He ivent away from home for a few&#xD;
days, and, when he returned, re-ap-&#xD;
peared in the bar-room opposite the&#xD;
(loucordia. There was a complacent&#xD;
expression about his mouth, and a de-&#xD;
termined look in his eye. Behind&#xD;
him was a thickset, powerfully built&#xD;
man, of about thirty years of ago.&#xD;
"Gentlemen," said Slam Bang to&#xD;
a group of idlers in front of the coun-&#xD;
ter, "What will you take?"&#xD;
This question having received a&#xD;
practical answer, Slam Bang said to&#xD;
the thickset man, -&#xD;
"Heeler, settle the bills U'&#xD;
The thickset man thereupon pro-&#xD;
duced a pocket-book, and paid for the&#xD;
drinks.&#xD;
"This, gentlemen, is my Heeler,"&#xD;
said Mr. Bangs. "Perhaps I calls&#xD;
him my Healer because he heals my&#xD;
wounds, and perhaps I calls him my&#xD;
Heeler because lie follows at my heels;&#xD;
you can spell his name out for your-&#xD;
self. Anyhow, I hope there won't&#xD;
none of you give me no occasion to&#xD;
show what his professional duties is."&#xD;
The loungers were evidently aston-&#xD;
ished. Prof. Walters, - the great&#xD;
performer on the xylophone, which&#xD;
he was in the habit of informing&#xD;
his audiences was named from two&#xD;
Greek words, zyloe, wood, and phony,&#xD;
a sound, - Prof. Walters, who, forced&#xD;
to appear before the audiences of the&#xD;
Concordia in the unromantic trap-&#xD;
pings of a dress suit, made up for this&#xD;
by assuming, when off the stage, an&#xD;
exaggerated ferocity of mien, - was&#xD;
heard audibly tb wonder, "What on&#xD;
earth old Slam was up to now!"&#xD;
"Old Slam," said Mr. Bangs, in a&#xD;
sweet and gentle tone, "did them&#xD;
words apply to me, Professor?"&#xD;
"What'll you do if they did?"&#xD;
growled Prof. Walters.&#xD;
"I will tell you what I shall do,"&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="22-23" xml:id="VAC8019-00000012"/>&#xD;
22            The Improvisatol&#xD;
replied Mr. Bangs. "Heeler, you're&#xD;
wanted!"&#xD;
Upon this, the Heeler drew back&#xD;
his fist, and calmly, ~vith a pleasant&#xD;
smile upon his face, knocked Prof.&#xD;
Walters down. Having knocked him&#xD;
down, the Heeler seized him by the&#xD;
collar, and pulled him up. "Now,"&#xD;
said the Heeler conclusively, "get!"&#xD;
The professor withdre~v. Then Nfr.&#xD;
Bangs said, -&#xD;
"I wish here to state, that the name&#xD;
of Slam is obnoxious to me; and,&#xD;
ftnrthermore, hereafter I intend to be&#xD;
treated with the respect due to the&#xD;
manager of a theatre." And, followed&#xD;
by the Heeler, Mr. Bangs also left the&#xD;
room. Awe, though not silent awe,&#xD;
filled the bosoms of the company; and,&#xD;
for several weeks, every thing went&#xD;
smoothly with Mr. Bangs. The fame&#xD;
of the Heeler spread through profes-&#xD;
sional circles; and other managers&#xD;
determined to adopt the same plan.&#xD;
Among these was the celebrated Harry&#xD;
Frock of Cincinnati, whose abilities&#xD;
and whose diamond pin are well&#xD;
known through the United States.&#xD;
Mr. Frock, as it happened, was&#xD;
obliged to come East soon after the&#xD;
Heeler had begun his work. Mr.&#xD;
Freck brought his own Heeler with&#xD;
him; and Mr. Frock came to visit Mr.&#xD;
Bangs. He entered the bar-room&#xD;
opposite the Concordia. Mr. Bangs&#xD;
greeted Mr. Freck with the utmost&#xD;
cordiality; and the Heeler, recogniz-&#xD;
ing in Mr. Frock's Heoler an old friend&#xD;
and associate, greeted him with equal&#xD;
warmth, though in a manner which&#xD;
might to many people seem somewhat&#xD;
peculiar. First, he looked intently&#xD;
at the stranger; and a fat smile crept&#xD;
gradually over his face, which smile&#xD;
was answered by one of equal breadth.&#xD;
Then, as if unable to express his feel-&#xD;
ings in words, the Heeler swung out&#xD;
his left' arm, and gave his friend a&#xD;
&#xD;
~e and the Ileeler.&#xD;
tremendous blow on the side of the&#xD;
head. This demonstration of affection&#xD;
was answered by Mr. Freck's Heeler&#xD;
with a resounding thwack upon our&#xD;
Heelei~s chest, his countenance fairly&#xD;
beaming with delight. The Ilecler&#xD;
then gave his friend a gigantic tap on&#xD;
the nose, receiving in return a playful&#xD;
punch in the ribs that nearly doubled&#xD;
him up. Then both these worthies&#xD;
descended, to the use of simple lan-&#xD;
guage.&#xD;
"Well, old horse," said the Heeler,&#xD;
"and how are you?"&#xD;
To this interrogatdry, the Heeler&#xD;
from Cincinnati returned the irrele-&#xD;
vant, but ap~arontly satisfactory, re-&#xD;
mark, "Let's liquor.~~&#xD;
This delightful and amicable state&#xD;
of affairs had lasted a day and a half,&#xD;
when some cause of war arose to&#xD;
destroy the unnatural tranquillity that&#xD;
was temporarily surrounding the Con-&#xD;
cordia. What it was, no one can tell;&#xD;
but some untoward event caused a&#xD;
disagreement, and a conflict between&#xD;
the Heeler aiid his friend, severe but&#xD;
decisive, ensued. The Heeler was&#xD;
defeated, ingloriously and terribly&#xD;
defeated, and retired for a while from&#xD;
public life, enshrouded in solitude and&#xD;
brown paper. On hi~ re-appearance,&#xD;
lie found himself disi~issed from the&#xD;
service of Siam Bang forever. At a&#xD;
loss what to do, he went and took a&#xD;
drink. Then dull ide~ that he should&#xD;
like to see what was going on in the&#xD;
theatre seized his mi~d; and he en-&#xD;
tered the doors of th&amp;amp; Concordia. It&#xD;
was the first appearance there of&#xD;
Mordaunt E. Hill, Esq., who was to&#xD;
improvise a series o~ "Musical and&#xD;
Metrical Reflections up~n Topics of&#xD;
the Day."&#xD;
The Improvisatore ivas not the mnn&#xD;
that he had been. His abusive re-&#xD;
marks towards the audience lacked&#xD;
their former pungency; and he was&#xD;
&#xD;
The Improvisato&#xD;
beginning to show the effects of his&#xD;
wretched, wearing life. But to-night&#xD;
he was brilliant: he alluded to the&#xD;
recent municipal election in the city, to&#xD;
an elopement that had recently taken&#xD;
place, and to other pieces of local&#xD;
scandal, with immense effect. Having&#xD;
heard of the battle of the Heelers,&#xD;
which had been the subject of green-&#xD;
room conversation for several days, he&#xD;
rose to the occasion, and, inspired by&#xD;
the theme, cave vent to the following&#xD;
outburst to the air of "The Flying&#xD;
Trapeze:&#xD;
"Dlii a rising young man for a fighter he went,&#xD;
And fur hi~ opponents lie cared not a cent;&#xD;
But, on beiiig a Ileeler, his miiid it was bent:&#xD;
So lie cams to the Concordi-a.&#xD;
This malinger therefore engaged him:&#xD;
Ho got whipped; but 'tw:is in a fair fight,&#xD;
And now for to go and dismiss him,&#xD;
I say it ain't serving him right.&#xD;
~horus : -&#xD;
The things of this world folks are sure to con-&#xD;
fuss;&#xD;
Ani so I've come in here to tellyon the news:&#xD;
Aiid I hops that your patience I shall not&#xD;
abuse&#xD;
Until I've concluded my lay."&#xD;
This verse was pci~fectly meaningless&#xD;
to the greater part of tiac audience,&#xD;
and so received but little applause;&#xD;
but the Heeler, standing at the back&#xD;
of the theatre, listened with delight.&#xD;
ceTliat there song's ~hout me!" he&#xD;
declared to several people about him.&#xD;
"A song about me I To dismiss the&#xD;
poor Heeler ain't right. Why that&#xD;
man is a regular genius I I'll go and&#xD;
ask him to take a drink."&#xD;
And so he did. The Improvisatore&#xD;
accepted the proffered civility, and&#xD;
then returned the invitation. A sec-&#xD;
ond invitation, and a third from the&#xD;
1-Leeler, met with similar results; and&#xD;
the Heeler finally offered to escort the&#xD;
Improvisatory home.&#xD;
That night, after the Improvisatore&#xD;
had rcaehed his boarding-house under&#xD;
&#xD;
re and the Ileeler.            23&#xD;
the Heeler's care, he was seized with&#xD;
a violent fit. Alone, and without a&#xD;
friend, lie would probably have died,&#xD;
had the Heeler not been present. Dr.&#xD;
Sehweigenthal was sent for imme-&#xD;
diately.&#xD;
"Are you his friend?" asked the&#xD;
doctor of the Heeler, after he realized&#xD;
what was the matter with his pa-&#xD;
tient.&#xD;
"Yes, sir," said the Heeler enthu-&#xD;
siastically. "He made a song up about&#xD;
me, he did, which ~&#xD;
"There, there," said the doctor,&#xD;
checking him, "that's enough. What&#xD;
I wish to say is this, The old man&#xD;
here is dying from the effects of drink-&#xD;
ing; and, unless lie has some one to&#xD;
take care of him, he will not live very&#xD;
long; even with the greatest possible&#xD;
care, he is liable to go off at any mo-&#xD;
ment."&#xD;
"Well," said the Heeler, in ~ slow,&#xD;
half stupid sort of way, "I wouldn't&#xD;
like thnt, sir. He made up a song about&#xD;
me, lie did; and it was really beautiful.&#xD;
It would be a great pity to lose a&#xD;
tal-ented man like he is, sir; now,&#xD;
wouldn't it?"&#xD;
"Perhaps," said the doctor di~yly.&#xD;
"Now, my good fellow," he added,&#xD;
"the best plan, I think, will be to&#xD;
send him to the hospital "-&#xD;
"Now, don't say so, sir," said the&#xD;
Heeler, with more eagerness than he&#xD;
had yet shown. "He'd hate it, sir,&#xD;
like" -&#xD;
"No swearing," said the doctor de-&#xD;
cisively; and, a little abashed, the&#xD;
Heeler continued, -&#xD;
"I've made some money, sir, and so&#xD;
has he; and I can afford to take care&#xD;
of him: I think it would do me good,&#xD;
sir. Folks needs something to take&#xD;
care on, sir; andy when they don't have&#xD;
it, they gets to be sort of beasts, I&#xD;
7~&#xD;
think, sir.&#xD;
"Ah," said the doctor, pleased ~t&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="24-25" xml:id="VAC8019-00000013"/>&#xD;
24                      The La&#xD;
this gleam of intelligence, "if you&#xD;
realize that you're a beast, you are in&#xD;
a fair way of becoming something&#xD;
better than a ~&#xD;
This epigrammatic observation was&#xD;
lo~t upon the Heeler, who simply&#xD;
said, -&#xD;
"Well, sir, may I try my hand on&#xD;
him?"&#xD;
~ said Dr. Schweigenthal, "I&#xD;
think I can trust you."&#xD;
"And ~ asked the Heeler,&#xD;
"must I settle folks as comes up and&#xD;
"Let me feel your biceps," said the&#xD;
doctor. "Splendid, - though fight&#xD;
shy of drinking, my fine fellow. You've&#xD;
got an arm that ought to atop any&#xD;
meddling."&#xD;
"Well," said the Heelerwith along&#xD;
sigh of satisfaction, "I knows my&#xD;
prospects now, and I like them."&#xD;
It was six weeks before the linpro-&#xD;
visatore was able to resume his work&#xD;
again. During all this time, the Heeler&#xD;
watched him as tenderly as a woman&#xD;
would; and, at the end of the illness,&#xD;
there was a tie formed between them&#xD;
which was as strong as it was curious.&#xD;
This was the substance of Dr. Schwei-&#xD;
genthal's story.&#xD;
"I think it has done them both&#xD;
good," said he. "It is only a question&#xD;
of time and circumstances as to when&#xD;
&#xD;
st Week.&#xD;
Hill will die; but I don't believe he&#xD;
can last a year. Meanwhile, he enjoys&#xD;
the luxury of having some one who&#xD;
cares for him, - old wretch though&#xD;
he is."&#xD;
"And how has it benefited the&#xD;
Heeler, ~ I asked.&#xD;
"It is slowly humanizing a brute,"&#xD;
said the doctor. "The process is slow;&#xD;
but, the action once begun, I have&#xD;
faith in its continuance. When the&#xD;
Improvisatore dies, I shall take the&#xD;
other fellow into my service."&#xD;
"Look, Max!" I said, "there is a&#xD;
curious performance."&#xD;
Even as I spoke, the Heeler had&#xD;
taken a glass of liquor out of the 1w-&#xD;
provisatore's trembling hand.&#xD;
"There, old man," he said roughly,&#xD;
yet with a certain tenderness, "you've&#xD;
had your two glasses to-night; and&#xD;
you can't have no more."&#xD;
And, with these words, he drew his&#xD;
friend slowly away from the bar into&#xD;
the street. The old man looked wist-&#xD;
fully back: the Heeler, catching the&#xD;
doctor's nod of approval, smiled in a&#xD;
~say that, for the moment, made his&#xD;
face seem absolutely beautiful: then&#xD;
the door opened and closed, revealing&#xD;
a glimpse of the black street without,&#xD;
as they passed from the evil, glitter-&#xD;
ing splendor of the bar-room into the&#xD;
cold winter darkness.&#xD;

THE TWO PRINCES:&#xD;
A STORY FOR CHILDREN.&#xD;
BY II. II. HALE.&#xD;
THRRE was a King of Hungary towers, and many halls, and many stair.&#xD;
whose name was Adelbert. ways, in the city of Buda, by the side&#xD;
When he lived at home, which was of the river Donau.&#xD;
not often, it was in a castle of many  He had four daughters, and only one&#xD;
&#xD;
The Two&#xD;
son, who was to be the King after him,&#xD;
whose name was Ladislaus. But it&#xD;
was the custom of those times, as&#xD;
hoys and girls grew up, to send them&#xD;
for their training to some distance from&#xD;
their home, even for many mouths at&#xD;
a time, to try a little experiment on&#xD;
them, and see how they fared; and so,&#xD;
at the time I tell you of, there was&#xD;
staying in the castle at linda the&#xD;
Prince Bela, who was the son of the&#xD;
King of Bohemia,-and he and the&#xD;
boy Ladislaus studied their lessons to-&#xD;
gether, and flew their kites, and hunted&#xD;
for otters, and rode with the falconers&#xD;
together.&#xD;
One day as they were studying with&#xD;
the tutor, who was a priest named&#xD;
Stephen, he gave to them a book of&#xD;
fables, awl each read a fable.&#xD;
Ladislaus read the fable of the&#xD;
SKY-LARit.&#xD;
The sky-lark sat on the topmost&#xD;
bough of the savy-tree, and was waked&#xD;
by the first ray of the sun. Then the&#xD;
sky-lark flew and flew up and up to the&#xD;
topmost arch of the sky, and sang the&#xD;
hymn of the morning.&#xD;
But a frog, who was croaking in the&#xD;
cranberry marsh, said, "Why do you&#xD;
take such pains and fly so high? the&#xD;
sun shines here, and I can sing here."&#xD;
And the bird said, "God has made&#xD;
me to fly. God has made me to see.&#xD;
I will fly as high as He will lift me,&#xD;
and sing so loud that all shall hear&#xD;
me."&#xD;
And when the little Prince Ladislaus&#xD;
and rend the fable, he cried out, "The&#xD;
sky-lark is the bird for me, and I will&#xD;
paint his picture on my shield after&#xD;
school this mornincr"&#xD;
Then the Prince lidla read the next&#xD;
fable - the fable of the&#xD;
WATER-EAT.     U&#xD;
A good beaver found one day a&#xD;
little water-rat almost dead. His father&#xD;
&#xD;
Princes.                       25&#xD;
and mother had been swept away by&#xD;
a freshet, and the little rat was almost&#xD;
starved. But the kind beaver gave&#xD;
him of her own milk, and brought him&#xD;
up in her own lodge with her children,&#xD;
and he got well, and could eat, and&#xD;
swim, and dive with the best of them.&#xD;
But one day there wa~s a great alarm,&#xD;
that the heavers' dam was giving way&#xD;
before the water. "Come one, come&#xD;
all," sa:id the grandfather of the heavers,&#xD;
"come to the rescue." So they all&#xD;
started, carrying sticks and bark with&#xD;
them, the water-rat and all. But as&#xD;
they swam under an old oak-tree's&#xD;
root, the water-rat stopped in the dark-.&#xD;
ness, and then he quietly turned round&#xD;
and went back to the hut. "Is will&#xD;
be hard work," said he, "and thei'e are&#xD;
enough of them." There wereenough&#xD;
of them. They mended the dam by&#xD;
working all night, and by working all&#xD;
day. Bus, as they came back, a great&#xD;
wave of the freshet came pouring over&#xD;
the dam, and, though the dam stood&#xD;
firm, the beavers were swept away, -&#xD;
away and away, down the river, into&#xD;
the sea, and they died there.&#xD;
And the wat~r-ras lived in their&#xD;
grand house by himself, and had all&#xD;
their stores of black-birch bark, and&#xD;
willow bark, and sweet poplar bark for&#xD;
his own.&#xD;
"That was a clever rat," said the&#xD;
Prince Bela. "I will paint the rat on&#xD;
my shield, when school is done." And&#xD;
the priest Stephen was very sad when&#xD;
he said so; and the Prince Ladislaus&#xD;
was surprised.&#xD;
So they went to the play-room, and&#xD;
painted their shields. The shields&#xD;
were made of the bark of hemlock-&#xD;
trees. Ladislaus chipped off the rough&#xD;
bark till the shield was white, and&#xD;
made on the place the best sky-lark he&#xD;
could paint there. And Bela watched&#xD;
him, and chipped off the rough bark&#xD;
from his shield, and said, "You paint&#xD;
so well, now paint my water-rat for&#xD;
&#xD;

26                       The Two&#xD;
me." "Nor said Ladislaus, though&#xD;
he was very good-natured, "I cannot&#xD;
paint it well. You must paint it your-&#xD;
self." And Bela did so.&#xD;
'I.&#xD;
So the boys both grew up, and&#xD;
one became ~Kiag of Hungary, and&#xD;
one was the King of the Bohemians.&#xD;
And King Ladislaus carried on his&#xD;
banner the picture of a sky-lark; and&#xD;
the ladies of the land embroidered&#xD;
sky-larks for the scarfs and for the&#xD;
pennons of the soldiers, and for the&#xD;
motto of the banner were the Latin&#xD;
words "Propior Deo," which mean&#xD;
"Nearer to God." And King Bela car-&#xD;
ried the water-rat for his cognizance:&#xD;
and the ladies of his land embroidered&#xD;
water-rats for the soldiers; and his&#xD;
motto was "Enough."&#xD;
And in these times a holy man from&#xD;
Palestine came through all the world;&#xD;
and he told how the pilgrims to the&#xD;
tomb of Christ were beaten and starved&#xD;
by the Saracens, and how many of&#xD;
them were dying in dungeons. And&#xD;
he begged the princes, and the lords,&#xD;
and ladies, for the love of God and the&#xD;
love of Christ, that they would come&#xD;
and rescue these poor people, and se-&#xD;
cure the pilgrims in all coining time.&#xD;
And King Ladislaus said to his people&#xD;
"We will do the best we can, and&#xD;
serve God as He shows us how!" And&#xD;
the people said, "We will do the best&#xD;
we can, and save the people of Christ&#xD;
from the infidel!" And they all came&#xD;
together to the place of arms; and&#xD;
the King chose a hundi~ed of the brav-&#xD;
est and healthiest of the young men,&#xD;
all of whom told the truth, and no&#xD;
one of whom was afraid to die, and&#xD;
they marched with him to the land of&#xD;
Christ; and as they marched they sang,&#xD;
"Propior Deo," "Nearer to Thee."&#xD;
And Peter the Hermit went to Bo-&#xD;
hemia, and told the story of the&#xD;
cruel Saracens and the sufferings of&#xD;
ihe pilgrims to King Bela and his peo-&#xD;
&#xD;
Princes.&#xD;
pIe. And the King said, "Is it far&#xD;
away?" And the Hermit said, "Far,&#xD;
far away." And the King said, "Ah&#xD;
well, - they must get out as they got&#xD;
in. We will take care of. Bohemia."&#xD;
So the Hermit went on to Saxony, to&#xD;
tell hjs story.&#xD;
And King Ladislaus and his hundred&#xD;
true young men rode and rode day by&#xD;
day, and came to the Mount of&#xD;
Olives just in time to be at the side&#xD;
of the great King Godfrey, when he&#xD;
broke the Paynim's walls, and dashed&#xD;
into ihe city of Jerusalem. And King&#xD;
Ladislaus and his men rode together&#xD;
along the Way of Tears, ivhcre Christ&#xD;
bore the cross-beam upon his shoul-&#xD;
der, and he sat on the stone whcre the&#xD;
cross had been reared, and he read the&#xD;
gospel through again; and there he&#xD;
prayed his God that he might always&#xD;
bear his cross bravely, and that like the&#xD;
Lord Jesus, he might never be afraid&#xD;
to die.&#xD;
IlL&#xD;
And when they had all come home&#xD;
to Hungry, their time hung very&#xD;
heavy on their hands- And the young&#xD;
-men said to the King, "Lead us to&#xD;
war against the Finns, or lead us to&#xD;
war against the Russ."&#xD;
But the King said, "No! if they&#xD;
spare our people, we spare their peo-&#xD;
ple: Let us have peace." And he&#xD;
called the young teen who had fought&#xD;
with him, and he said, "The time hangs&#xD;
heavy with us; let us build a temple&#xD;
here to the living God, and to the honor&#xD;
of his Son. We will carve on. its walls&#xD;
the story we have seen, and while we&#xD;
build we will remember Zion and the&#xD;
Way of Tears."&#xD;
And the young men said, "We are&#xD;
not used to building."&#xD;
"Nor am I," said the king; "but let&#xD;
us build and build as best we can, and&#xD;
give to God the best we have and the&#xD;
best we know."&#xD;
So they dug the deep trenches for&#xD;
the foundations, and they sent north and&#xD;
&#xD;
The Tw6&#xD;
south, and cast and west for the wisest&#xD;
builders who loved the Lord Christ;&#xD;
and the builders came, and the carvers&#xD;
came, and the young men learned to&#xD;
use the chisel and the hammer; and&#xD;
the great Cathedral grew year by year,&#xD;
- as a l)il)e-trce in the forest grows above&#xD;
the birches and the yew-trees on the&#xD;
ground.&#xD;
And once King Bela came to visit&#xD;
his kinsman, and they rode out to see&#xD;
the builders. And King Ladislans dis-&#xD;
mounted from his horse, and asked&#xD;
Bela to dismount, and gave to him a&#xD;
chisel and a hammer.&#xD;
" ~ said the King Bela, "it will&#xD;
hurt my hamids. In my land we have&#xD;
workuien whom we pay to do these&#xD;
things. But I like to see you work."&#xD;
So lie sat upou his horse till dinner&#xD;
time, anil he went home.&#xD;
And year by year the Cathedral grew.&#xD;
And a diousand pinnacles were built&#xD;
ispoma the towem's, and on the roof, and&#xD;
along the ~valls; and on each pinnacle&#xD;
there fluttered a golden sky-lark. And&#xD;
on the altar iii the Cathedral was a&#xD;
scroll of crimson, and on time crimson&#xD;
scroll were letters of gold, and the let-&#xD;
ters were in the Latin language, and&#xD;
said, "Propior Dco," and on a blue&#xD;
scroll underneath, in the language of&#xD;
the people, they were translated, and&#xD;
it said, "Nearer to Thee."&#xD;
Iv.&#xD;
And another Hermit came, and lie&#xD;
told the King that the Black Death&#xD;
was ravaging tIme cities of time East;&#xD;
that half the people of Constantinople&#xD;
were dead; dint the gremit fair at 4&#xD;
Adrianople was closed; that the ships&#xD;
on time Black Sea had no sailors; and&#xD;
that there would be no food for the&#xD;
people on the lower river.&#xD;
And the King said, "Is the Duke&#xD;
dead, whom we saw at Bucharest; is&#xD;
the Emperor dead, who met me at&#xD;
Constantinople?"&#xD;
&#xD;
Princes.                      2Z&#xD;
"No, your Grace," said the Hermit,&#xD;
"it pleases tIme Lord that in the Black&#xD;
Death only those die who Jive in hov-&#xD;
els and in towns. The Lord has spared&#xD;
those who live in castles and in pal-&#xD;
aces."&#xD;
"Then," said King Ladislaus, "I&#xD;
will live as my people live, and I will&#xD;
die as my people die. The Lord Jesus&#xD;
had ~so pillow for his head, and no&#xD;
house for his lodging; and as the least&#xD;
of his brethren fares so will I fare,&#xD;
and as I fare so shall they."&#xD;
So the King and the hundred braves&#xD;
pitched their tents on the high land&#xD;
above the old town, around the new&#xD;
Cathedral, and the Queen and the ladies&#xD;
of the court went with them. And&#xD;
day by day the King and the Queen and&#xD;
the hundred braves, and their hundred&#xD;
ladies, went up and down the filthy&#xD;
wynds and courts of the city, and they&#xD;
said to the poor people there, "Come,&#xD;
live as we live, and die as we die."&#xD;
And the people left tIme holes of pes-&#xD;
tilence and came and lived in the open&#xD;
air of God.&#xD;
And when the people saw that the&#xD;
King fared as they fared, the people&#xD;
said, "'We also will seek God as the&#xD;
King seeks Him, and will serve Hun as&#xD;
he serves Him."&#xD;
And day by day they found others&#xD;
who had no homes fit for Christian men,&#xD;
sad brought them upon the high land&#xD;
and built all together their tents, and&#xD;
booths and tabernacles, open to the sun&#xD;
and light, and to the smile, and kiss,&#xD;
and blessing of the fresh air of God.&#xD;
And there grew a new and beautiful&#xD;
city there.&#xD;
And so it was, that when the Black&#xD;
Death passed from the East to the&#xD;
West, the Angel of Death left the city&#xD;
)f Buda on one side, and 4he people&#xD;
cever saw the pestilence with their eyes.&#xD;
['lie Angel of Death passed by them,&#xD;

&#xD;
V.&#xD;
And King Ladislaus grew old. His&#xD;
helmet seemed to him more heavy. His&#xD;
sleep seemed to him more coy. But&#xD;
he had little care, for he ha-I a loving&#xD;
wife, and he had healthy noble sons&#xD;
and daughters~who loved God, and who&#xD;
told the truth, and who were not afraid&#xD;
to die.&#xD;
But one day, in his happy prosperity,&#xD;
there came to him a messenger running,&#xD;
who said in the Council, "Your Grace,&#xD;
the Red Russians have crossed the Red&#xD;
River of the north, and they are march-&#xD;
ing with their wives and their children&#xD;
with their men of arms in front, and&#xD;
their wagons behind, amid they say they&#xD;
a-rn find a land nearer the sun, and to&#xD;
this land are they coming."&#xD;
And the old King smiled; and he&#xD;
said to those that were'left of the&#xD;
buadmed brave men who took the cross&#xD;
with him, "Now we will see if our&#xD;
boys could haVe fought at Godfrey's&#xD;
side. For us it matters little. One&#xD;
way or another way we shall come&#xD;
~mearer to God."&#xD;
And the armorers mended tIme old~&#xD;
armor, and the young men girded on&#xD;
swords which had never been tried in&#xD;
tight, and the pennons that they bore&#xD;
were embroidered by their sweethearts&#xD;
and sisters as in the old days of the&#xD;
Crusades, and with the same device&#xD;
of a sky-lark in mid-heaven, and&#xD;
the motto, "Nearer, my God, to&#xD;
Thee."&#xD;
And there came from the great Cathe-&#xD;
d"al the wise men who had come from&#xD;
.11 the lands. They found the King, and&#xD;
they said to him, "Your Grace, we&#xD;
&amp;amp; now how to build the new defenses&#xD;
for the land, and we will guard the river&#xD;
ways, that the barbarians shall never&#xD;
.~ntcr them."&#xD;
And when the people knew that the&#xD;
lied Russians were on the way, they met&#xD;
~n the square and marched to the palace,&#xD;
isad Robert the Smith mounted the steps&#xD;
sf the palace and called the King. And&#xD;
&#xD;
he said, "The people are here to bid&#xD;
the King lie of good heart. The people&#xD;
bid me say that they will die for their&#xD;
King and for his land."&#xD;
And the King took from his wife's&#xD;
neck the blue ribbon that she wore,&#xD;
with a golden sky-lark on it, and bound&#xD;
it round time blacksmith's arm, and lie&#xD;
said, "if I die, it is nothing; if I live,&#xD;
it is nothing; that is in God's hand.&#xD;
But whether we live or die, let us draw&#xD;
as near Him mis we may."&#xD;
And the Blacksmith Robert turned&#xD;
to the people, and with his loud voice,&#xD;
told what the King had said.&#xD;
And the people answered in the&#xD;
shout which tIme Hungarians shout to&#xD;
this day, "Let us die for our king I&#xD;
Let us die fbr our king!"&#xD;
And the King called the Queen has-&#xD;
tily, and they and their children led the&#xD;
host to the great Cathedral.&#xD;
And the old priest Stephen, who was&#xD;
ninety years old, stood at the altar,&#xD;
and lie read the gospel where it says,&#xD;
"Fear not, little flock, it is your Fath-&#xD;
er's good pleasure to give you the king-&#xD;
dom."&#xD;
And lie read the other gospel where&#xD;
the Lord says, "And I, if I be lifted&#xD;
up, will draw all men unto me." And&#xD;
lie read the epistle where it says, "No&#xD;
man liveth to himself, and no man&#xD;
dieth to' himseW" And he chanted the&#xD;
psalm, "The Lord is my rock, my for-&#xD;
tress, and my deliverer."&#xD;
And fifty thousand men, with one&#xD;
heart and one voice, joined with him.&#xD;
And the King joined, and the Queen&#xD;
to sing, "The Lord is my rock, my&#xD;
fortress and my deliverer."&#xD;
And they marched from the Cathe-&#xD;
dral, singing in the language of the&#xD;
country, "J.'ropior Deo," which is to&#xD;
say in our tongue, "Nearer, my God, to&#xD;
Thee."&#xD;
And the aged braves who had fought&#xD;
with Godfrey, and the younger men&#xD;
who had learned of arms in time Uni-&#xD;
versity, went among the people and&#xD;
&#xD;
The Two Princes.&#xD;
&#xD;
TkeT~&#xD;
divided them into companies for dii&#xD;
ivar. And Robert the Blacksmith, aii~&#xD;
all the guild of the blacksmiths, and o&#xD;
the braziers, nuul of the coppersmiths&#xD;
and of time whitesmiths, even the gold&#xD;
smiths an(I the silversmiths, mad&#xD;
weapons for the war ; mind the ma~on~&#xD;
afl(l the ciirj)enter~, anti the ditclieri&#xD;
and delivers marched out with tin&#xD;
catlmc(lral hinilders to the narrow passed&#xD;
of the river, and built new the fur.&#xD;
tresses.&#xD;
And the Lady Constance and hem&#xD;
daughters, aimd evemy lady in the land~&#xD;
went to die churches and the convents&#xD;
an(l threw them wide open. And in&#xD;
the kitchens they baked bread for the&#xD;
soldiers ; and in tIme churches they&#xD;
sjuread coaches for the sick or for the&#xD;
wounded.&#xD;
Amid when tIme Red Russians came&#xD;
in their host, there was not a man, or&#xD;
woman, or child in all hungry bitt&#xD;
was in the place to which God hal&#xD;
called him, and was doing his best in&#xD;
his J)lace for his God, for th~ Church of&#xD;
Christ, amid for his brothers and sisters&#xD;
of the land.&#xD;
And the host of the Red Russians&#xD;
was turned aside, as at the street cor-&#xD;
ncr yon have seen time dirty water of a&#xD;
gutter turnc(l asi(le hiy the curbstone.&#xD;
They fought one battle against the&#xD;
I hungarian host, and were driven as the&#xD;
blackbirds are driven by the fideons.&#xD;
And they gathered themselves and&#xD;
swept westward; and came down upon&#xD;
the passes to Bohemia.&#xD;
And there were no fortresses at the&#xD;
entrance to Bohemia; for King Bela&#xD;
had no learned men who loved him.&#xD;
And there was no army in the plains&#xD;
of Bohemia; for his people had been&#xD;
swept away in the pestilence. And&#xD;
there were no brave men who had&#xD;
fought with Godfrey, and knew the art&#xD;
of arms, for in those old days time King&#xD;
had said, "Jt is far away; and we have&#xD;
'enough' in Bohemia."&#xD;
&#xD;
29&#xD;
&#xD;
e So the Red Russians, who call them.&#xD;
I selves the Szechs, took his land from&#xD;
f him; and they live there till this day.&#xD;
Amid the King, without a battle, fled&#xD;
- from the back-door of his palace, in the&#xD;
disguisee of a charcoal-man; and he left&#xD;
his queen and his daughters to be cin-&#xD;
der-girls in the service of the Chief of&#xD;
the Red Russians.&#xD;
And tIme false charcoal-man walked&#xD;
by day, and walked by night, till lie&#xD;
fouiid refuge in the castle of the King&#xD;
Ladislaus; and he met him in the old&#xD;
schoolroom where they read the flibles&#xD;
together. And lie remembered how the&#xD;
water-rat came to tIme home of the&#xD;
beavers.&#xD;
And he said to King Ladislaus, -&#xD;
"AIm, me I do you remember when&#xD;
we were boys together? Do you re-&#xD;
member the fable of the Sky-lark, and&#xD;
the fable of the Water-rat?"&#xD;
~' I remember both," said the King.&#xD;
And lie was silent.&#xD;
"God has been very kind to you,"&#xD;
said the beggar; "and He has been very&#xD;
hard to me."&#xD;
And the King said nothing.&#xD;
But tIme old priest Stephen, said,&#xD;
"God is always kind. But God will&#xD;
not give us other fruit than we sow&#xD;
seed fir. The king here has tried&#xD;
to serve God as lie knew how; with&#xD;

the scat, she held with the other hand finish 11cr sentence before she was&#xD;
a somewhat larger one. Although assailed by a furious storm of abuse&#xD;
she was squeezed into her corner, so as from the two Englishwomen. Her&#xD;

others by keeping her bag beside her her satchel in her hand, and rose; and&#xD;
on the seat; but a glance at the floor her adversary instantly appropriated&#xD;
showed that there was 110 vacant the seat. She stood there alone with&#xD;
place there for it either. The young her burden, and 11cr tearful glance&#xD;
girls embarrassment soon increased seemed to say, -&#xD;
s:ill more. Two Englishwomen, with "If I receive such treatment from&#xD;

ladies seated herself in all her amupli- the hubbub and cOnfusion which pre-&#xD;
tude in the place thus vacated, occupy- vails in a waiting-room, had, as it hap-&#xD;
ing the space which ought to have pened, an attentive spectator.&#xD;

82                    IntheWi&#xD;
At the opposite side of the room&#xD;
sat a man, who, to judge by appear-&#xD;
ances, might be a little past thirty.&#xD;
He had been surevyung the assembled&#xD;
crowd with indifference, until his&#xD;
glance fell on the troubled young girl.&#xD;
His accustomed eye perceived iinme-&#xD;
diately that she was without any pro-&#xD;
tector or company. It was while he&#xD;
was looking at her that the two Eng-&#xD;
lishwomea appeared; and he thus&#xD;
witnessed the scene between the three.&#xD;
He put his hat on the seat he occupied,&#xD;
and requested his neighbor to have&#xD;
the kindness to keep it for a lady: he&#xD;
then went and invited the young girl&#xD;
to take it, and she shyly and grate-&#xD;
fully accepted. As she raised her&#xD;
large blue eyes to thank him for this&#xD;
civilityy , she met a manly countenance,&#xD;
whose features expressed satisfaction&#xD;
at being able to do even so slight a&#xD;
service to an unprotected woman.&#xD;
He wore a black Spanish cape, and&#xD;
had a crape on his hat. The blue&#xD;
eyes were far calmer now. The con-&#xD;
sciousness of being an object of consid-&#xD;
erate attention, even if ever so slight,&#xD;
is al~vays agreeable to the unprotected,&#xD;
but especially if they have freshly&#xD;
been made to feel their unprotected&#xD;
condition.&#xD;
She found herself far better off than&#xD;
while uncomfortable~ squeezed up in&#xD;
her corner. She threw a glance over&#xD;
there, and saw that the Englishwomen&#xD;
had usurped several more seats.&#xD;
"They are strange people,~~ thought&#xD;
she. "They do not seem to think of&#xD;
others at all, but only of themselves."&#xD;
But she repented this thought di-&#xD;
rectly, as it seemed to her that it was&#xD;
mean, and showed spite on her part.&#xD;
"They may be just as good, although&#xD;
they have such a manner," said she to&#xD;
herself. "Probably they are people&#xD;
of rank, who are accustomed to com-&#xD;
fort."&#xD;
&#xD;
de World.&#xD;
The doors now opened, and all hur-&#xD;
ried out and into the cars. The lone-&#xD;
ly one also hastened along, with a&#xD;
beating heart, and succeeded in get-&#xD;
ting a seat iminediatelyin the first&#xD;
eoup~ which she caine to.&#xD;
"It would have been pleasant if he&#xD;
had happened to sit in the same car&#xD;
as I," thought she. "lie looked so&#xD;
friendly and good. I should have felt&#xD;
so safe. Still, the worst is over now,&#xD;
until we come to Cologne; but there it&#xD;
will be bad again. To stay alone in&#xD;
a large hotel is disagreeable enough."&#xD;
She now ventured to cast a hasty&#xD;
glance around upon her travelling&#xD;
companions. There was one lady be-&#xD;
sides herself, who, however, did not&#xD;
look very friendly. All the others&#xD;
were gentlemen, who were hanging&#xD;
their things on the hooks.&#xD;
The door opened. A head was&#xD;
thrust in: it was the conductor, who&#xD;
said, "Here is a seat; hurry up! The&#xD;
train is just starting."&#xD;
She looked up at the late comer.&#xD;
It was he, her protector in the wait-&#xD;
ing-room. He seemed to be vcry&#xD;
well pleased, and seated himself in&#xD;
the vacant place nt her side.&#xD;
"I have been looking for you, for&#xD;
I thought that I might perhaps be of&#xD;
some service to you. You seem to be&#xD;
alone."&#xD;
"You are very kind, sir," said she.&#xD;
But just then she seemed to become&#xD;
afraid of having said too much to a&#xD;
stranger; so she took a book out of her&#xD;
satchel, and began to read. To tell&#xD;
the truth, she only held it before her&#xD;
eyes; but her thoughts were occupied&#xD;
with something else.&#xD;
"How stupid of me," said she to&#xD;
herself, "when a person shows me so&#xD;
much kindness, to set myself to read-&#xD;
ing, just as he opens a conversation&#xD;
with me. What if I should say some-&#xD;
thing to him? Ko: that will not do&#xD;
&#xD;
In t1~e W&#xD;
now. Poor Gertrude! you have been&#xD;
stupid again; but it is not the first&#xD;
time, Heaven knows.,~&#xD;
She now began to read in reality.&#xD;
The stranger took a book from his&#xD;
pocket, and also began to read; but, as&#xD;
the rest of the company were soon&#xD;
engaged in a political discussion, he&#xD;
laid aside his book, and took a lively&#xD;
part in it. Gertrude's attention was&#xD;
now drawn from her book, and she lis-&#xD;
tened eagerly to the conversation.&#xD;
"They are a restless people, those&#xD;
Italians," said a light-complexioned,&#xD;
thick-set gentleman, with an a&#xD;
ance which indicated physical well-&#xD;
being as well as German origin.&#xD;
"They make a great uproar down&#xD;
there, as if fire had broken out in&#xD;
every corner; andyet all this commo-&#xD;
tion ends in -nothing."&#xD;
"Are you sure of that?" asked&#xD;
Gertrude's protector.&#xD;
"Have you not seen it before? Do&#xD;
you not remember 1848? What did&#xD;
they accomplish with their Mazzinis&#xD;
and Garibaldis? Pooh I"&#xD;
"One need not always fail because&#xD;
he has failed once, sir. Least of all&#xD;
should we doubt a nation's success be-&#xD;
cause it cannot be achieved at once.&#xD;
I will only ask you, Do you consider&#xD;
your own position in Germany - for,&#xD;
if I am not mistaken, you are a Ger-&#xD;
man - so very perfect? Is there 1&#xD;
nothing left for you to desire and&#xD;
strive for ~&#xD;
"Gott behiite /" said the German,&#xD;
who felt that the other now began to 1&#xD;
tread on his corns. " Gott behUte /&#xD;
We are certainly no model; but you&#xD;
see, in Germany, affairs go on at an I&#xD;
easy pace. The enlightenment of the&#xD;
people, the enlightenment of the&#xD;
people, sir: it does not stand so high&#xD;
in any land in Eurcpe as in Germany; s&#xD;
and that is the true basis of all ad-&#xD;
vancement."&#xD;
&#xD;
ide World.                     38&#xD;
"In certain parts of Germany,"&#xD;
said Gertrude's seat-mate, "the er,-&#xD;
lightenment of the people stands high&#xD;
enough; but in others I apprehend it&#xD;
cannot compete with that of the Ital-&#xD;
ians. And, besides, how do you ex-&#xD;
pect the Italians to become enlight-&#xD;
ened under the conditions in which&#xD;
they now live? The pope and the&#xD;
secular princes are pretty much alike&#xD;
in that respect: they are about equally&#xD;
good promoters of enlightenment."&#xD;
Two lively Frenchmen now joined&#xD;
in the conversation. One of them&#xD;
said, -&#xD;
"Where liberty is concerned&#xD;
Frenchmen are always ready to assist;&#xD;
and ~with our help the Italians will&#xD;
soon free themselves, both from their&#xD;
own hateful princes and from the&#xD;
Austrian yoke."&#xD;
The German listened to this with a&#xD;
half sarcastic smile.&#xD;
"L'enpire c'est 1w pain!" said he,&#xD;
restraining a laugh over his own wit,&#xD;
with apparent difficulty. "How can&#xD;
the peaceful French Empire busy it-&#xD;
self with other's strifes ?"&#xD;
"As the enlightened Germans,"&#xD;
answered the other Frenchman point-&#xD;
edly, "as the enlightened Germans do&#xD;
not consider it incompatible with their&#xD;
principles to practise oppression in&#xD;
Italy, where they have no business to&#xD;
be, the peaceful Frenchmen must not&#xD;
considerr it incompatible with theirs&#xD;
bo drive them away."&#xD;
"A people who allow themselves to&#xD;
'e oppressed,~~ said the German some-&#xD;
vhat more moderately, "is not worthy&#xD;
better fate. They are not ripe for&#xD;
freedom ; and, as far as the French as-&#xD;
istance is concerned, it remains to be&#xD;
cen what good it will do."&#xD;
"That is what you will soon see,"&#xD;
aid the first Frenchman.&#xD;
"And as for the theory,~~ said the&#xD;
ther, "that a people who are op.&#xD;

84                    I~t the Wi~&#xD;
pressed are not worthy any thing bet-&#xD;
ter, it is one of those truths where an&#xD;
error lurks behind it. With precisely&#xD;
as much reason might you assert that&#xD;
a single traveller, who is attacked in&#xD;
the mountains by a band of highway-&#xD;
men, and plundered and maltreated&#xD;
by them, is not worthy any thing bet-&#xD;
ter, because he does not put them all&#xD;
to flight."&#xD;
The man with the crape, or Ger-&#xD;
trude's protector, as we have also&#xD;
calledhim, replied smilingly to this:-&#xD;
"You Germans are men of thought.&#xD;
You frame theories and systems with&#xD;
peculiar acumen; but exactly on ac-&#xD;
count of your strict systematizing,&#xD;
your theories do not work well in&#xD;
practic5.~~&#xD;
"To what nation does he belong&#xD;
himself?" thought Gertrude. "Ger-&#xD;
man he is not, neither is he Italian;&#xD;
for they can be easily recognized by&#xD;
their strong accent." She made sev-&#xD;
eral guesses, but could not satisfy her-&#xD;
self. Finally she was inclined to&#xD;
take him for an American of French&#xD;
origin. Her attention was turned&#xD;
from these reflections by her compan-&#xD;
ion's beginning to look up his pass-&#xD;
port; for they were near a boundary-&#xD;
station, where it was to be shown.&#xD;
"Mon iDieu I j'ai perdu mon passe-&#xD;
port I" exclaimed Gertrude, after she&#xD;
had also looked for her own in vain&#xD;
in her satchel.&#xD;
The man with the crape, who heard&#xD;
this cry of distress, regarded her&#xD;
with great compassion, and asked if&#xD;
she was sure that she had lost her&#xD;
passport.&#xD;
"Ah, yes!,~ said she. "I was so&#xD;
afraid of losing it that I carried it in&#xD;
my hand. When I paid for my tick-&#xD;
et, I laid it down; and, as the crowd&#xD;
pressed, I hurried away as soon as I&#xD;
received the ticket, without remem-&#xD;
bering the passport."&#xD;
&#xD;
1e World.&#xD;
"How far have you taken a ticket ?"&#xD;
"To Hamburg. Good heavens I&#xD;
how unlucky I am I,,&#xD;
She covered her face, and wept bit.&#xD;
terly.&#xD;
"Be easy," said her companion.&#xD;
"It will all be ~ight. I will be re-&#xD;
sponsible for your getting to Ham-&#xD;
burg without difficulty."&#xD;
"God bless you, sir, if you will&#xD;
help me; but"&#xD;
She wished to ask how this could&#xD;
be done; but just then the conductor&#xD;
thrust his hand through the window.&#xD;
"Vos passports, messieurs et mes-&#xD;
dames!" said he.&#xD;
All delivered their passports, one&#xD;
after another. Gertrude's heart&#xD;
throbbed violently; and,~~vlien the&#xD;
conductor turned to her, she was&#xD;
going to say that she lad forgotten&#xD;
her pass in Paris; but she was&#xD;
checked by her neighbor, who, bend-&#xD;
ing before her, handed his pass to the&#xD;
conductor, and said, -&#xD;
"For both madame and me."&#xD;
The conductor, who very well re-&#xD;
m~mbered that the man with the&#xD;
craps on his hat had peeped into&#xD;
several cars before he stepped into&#xD;
this one, only threw a fleeting glance&#xD;
at Gertrude, and ~vcnt off with the&#xD;
papers.&#xD;
"I do not understand how that&#xD;
was," said she, fastening her large,&#xD;
expressive eyes on her neighbor;&#xD;
"but I thank you very munch for your&#xD;
assistance. I hope I shall make no&#xD;
further difficulties by my careless-&#xD;
ness."&#xD;
"You may be entirely at your ease,&#xD;
madame," said her neighbor. "If&#xD;
you will have sufficient confidence in&#xD;
a stranger to trust yourself to his&#xD;
protection, ho will render it with real&#xD;
pleasure. I can well understand that&#xD;
this may not be agreeable to you; but&#xD;
it seems to be the only way, at pres-&#xD;
&#xD;
In the Wi&#xD;
ent, unless you wieh to stay here and&#xD;
wait until you can get a new pass-&#xD;
port."&#xD;
"That would be impossible." Then&#xD;
she added, in a lower tone, but with&#xD;
confidential frankness, "My travel-&#xD;
ling expenses are closely calculated;&#xD;
and it is therefore extremely impor-&#xD;
tant for me to go on without de-&#xD;
lay."&#xD;
"Then make yourself entirely com-&#xD;
fortable. My passport is sufficient&#xD;
for us both."&#xD;
"How?"&#xD;
"I went south with my wife for&#xD;
the benefit of her health. She found&#xD;
her grave there instead, and I am re-&#xD;
turning alone; so that of course my&#xD;
passport would do for us both. Your&#xD;
journey is only a day and a half&#xD;
longer: if you will accept my escort&#xD;
for that time, under the circumstances,&#xD;
I will, with great pleasure, see that you&#xD;
come safe through."&#xD;
"But what shall I do when I leave&#xD;
Hamburg? I am going straight on&#xD;
to Finland."&#xD;
"To Finland I" said her neighbor:&#xD;
~' that is very pleasant news."&#xD;
"Do you know Finland?"&#xD;
"Somewhat," answered he. "You&#xD;
can be perfectly easy about your&#xD;
journey. If I am not too much&#xD;
mistaken, a steamer sails within a&#xD;
few days from Liibeck to Helsing-&#xD;
fors."&#xD;
"That is just the one I wished to&#xD;
take; but now"-&#xD;
"You shall not have any trouble;&#xD;
never fear. But what can have occa-&#xD;
sioned you to take so long a journey&#xD;
alone?"&#xD;
"I had company when I came&#xD;
away. The family with whom I left&#xD;
Finland, a year ago, to cultivate my&#xD;
voice in Paris, are now residing in&#xD;
Italy. They were tim come for me a&#xD;
year from this time; but my longing&#xD;
&#xD;
de World.                     85&#xD;
for home became so strong, all at ouce,&#xD;
that. I could not wait longer."&#xD;
"Then it is a northernprima donna&#xD;
that I have the pleasure of travelling&#xD;
with?"&#xD;
"I have been persuaded to choose&#xD;
that career, but I shall not pursue it.&#xD;
]Vwould rather risk a whole life full of&#xD;
trials and difficulties than appear in&#xD;
public."&#xD;
"But to delight others, and win&#xD;
applause and fame: that is not a lot&#xD;
which one ought carelessly to throw&#xD;
away."&#xD;
"It may be so for one who has the&#xD;
taste for it, or the courage. I have&#xD;
neither; and therefore do not feel in&#xD;
any way qualified for it."&#xD;
"You must love your poor native&#xD;
land very much, however, if you&#xD;
could feel such a great longing for&#xD;
home in Paris, the centre of pleasure&#xD;
and art."&#xD;
"Yes, indeed I"&#xD;
"Perhaps you have many relations,&#xD;
who are longing for you, as much as&#xD;
you for them?"&#xD;
"No, not one: my mother is dead,&#xD;
my father is dead; all are dead."&#xD;
"Permit me to ask your name&#xD;
"Gertrude Sj~iding."&#xD;
Gertrude was on the point of in-&#xD;
quiring, in her turn, about her com-&#xD;
panion's name and residence; but she&#xD;
refrainedd, considering that he would&#xD;
tell her whatever he chose, without&#xD;
any questions.&#xD;
The conversation between the two&#xD;
soon became extremely lively. He&#xD;
seemed to interest himself very much&#xD;
in her native country, and made many&#xD;
inquiries about matters and things in&#xD;
Finland. Then it happened that he&#xD;
found he had met an unusually well-&#xD;
cultivated and thoughtful girl. She,&#xD;
on her side, perceived that her travel-&#xD;
ling companion had a far greater&#xD;
acquaintance with Finland than i&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="36-37" xml:id="VAC8019-00000019"/>&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
86                   intheWi&#xD;
commonly found outside of it; and&#xD;
this gave her so much delight that&#xD;
she finally expressed her pleasure&#xD;
aloud.&#xD;
"You have discovered already,&#xD;
then," said he, looking at her with&#xD;
obvious interest, "that your country&#xD;
and its remarkable features are little&#xD;
known abroad?"&#xD;
"Ah, yes!" said she sadly. "I&#xD;
had prepared myself for it when I&#xD;
started; but I thought that among&#xD;
cultivated persons, at least, I should&#xD;
find some knowledge of Finland; but&#xD;
I soon perceived that they scarcely&#xD;
knew its name."&#xD;
"And this grieved you?"&#xD;
"How could I help its doing so?"&#xD;
He regarded her long in silence;&#xD;
then he said,&#xD;
"A new era will dawn for Finland,&#xD;
one day, when all women will be as&#xD;
well informed about it as you."&#xD;
They reached Cologne in the even-&#xD;
ing. The train was to start the fob&#xD;
lowing morning at nine o'clock from&#xD;
the town of Deutz, on the other side&#xD;
of the Rhine. Gertrude's companion&#xD;
attended to every thing. He had&#xD;
their baggage examined; and, when&#xD;
that was done, he took a carriage, and&#xD;
they went to a hotel in Deuts, where&#xD;
he secured two rooms near each other.&#xD;
When the time came, he knocked at&#xD;
Gertrude's door, and invited her to go&#xD;
down to the dining-hall and take tea&#xD;
with him; which she did. She had&#xD;
in the mean time taken off her hat,&#xD;
and arranged her beautiful hair. Her&#xD;
naturally fresh color was heightened&#xD;
by the journey; and her eyes shone&#xD;
with confidence. She was really very&#xD;
pretty; and it was not wonderful&#xD;
therefore that her protector's eyes&#xD;
rested upon her innocent face with&#xD;
great delight.&#xD;
During the short time since theix&#xD;
arrival at the hotel, while she wa~&#xD;
&#xD;
de World.&#xD;
making her toilet, she had reflected&#xD;
upon the singular events of that day.&#xD;
"Am I doing right," said she to her-&#xD;
self, "to place myself in such de-&#xD;
pendence upon a person whose name&#xD;
even I do not know? of whom T.&#xD;
know nothing, except that he has&#xD;
shown me friendliness? Might he&#xD;
not abuse my confidence? No: he is&#xD;
too noble for that. His look is so&#xD;
pure, that it cannot conceal any guile;&#xD;
and so much goodness shines from&#xD;
his eyes that it would be unworthy&#xD;
not to feel confidence in him. It&#xD;
would be cruel to always be obliged&#xD;
to distrust people. No: my intuition&#xD;
tells me when I see a face that I&#xD;
ought to be afraid of."&#xD;
In the dining-hell of the large&#xD;
hotel a great company was assembled,&#xD;
all in full career of satisfying their&#xD;
appetite, considerably stimulated by&#xD;
the journey. All conceivable tongues&#xD;
were spoken; but English, French,&#xD;
and German predominated. Gertrude&#xD;
was conducted by her companion to&#xD;
a small private table, set for two, at&#xD;
whi~h they seated themselves.&#xD;
"Many languages are spoken&#xD;
here," said Gertrude; "and yet how&#xD;
pleasant itwould be to hear my mother-&#xD;
tongue again!~~&#xD;
"Which do you mean ~ asked her&#xD;
travelling companion, smiling, "Swe-&#xD;
dish or Finnish?"&#xD;
"At this moment they would be&#xD;
equally dear: they are both my na-&#xD;
tive languages."&#xD;
He allowed the conversation to drop,&#xD;
and served Gertrude, who ate with&#xD;
good appetite. After they had fin-&#xD;
ished, a waiter brought a half-flask&#xD;
of champagne and two glasses.&#xD;
"You must now drink a toast with&#xD;
me," said her escort. Gertrude re-&#xD;
ceived the proposition with a cer-&#xD;
tain anxiety, but one glance at his&#xD;
honest and benignant face calmed her&#xD;
&#xD;
In the W&#xD;
immediately. He filled the glasses,&#xD;
and clinked his against hers.&#xD;
"Isiinmaan muistoksi I" said he,&#xD;
draining his glass.&#xD;
She stared at him an instant, then&#xD;
offered him her hand with an. ani-&#xD;
mated gesture, and exclaimed en-&#xD;
raptured, -&#xD;
"You are a Finn! you are a Finn!&#xD;
God in heaven be praised!"&#xD;
"You need not cry, need you, for&#xD;
that?" said he, while his own eyes&#xD;
grew moist at her lively outburst of&#xD;
feeling. "I think myself fortunate&#xD;
to have been of service to you. But&#xD;
Finland's health," continued he;&#xD;
"you must not forget to drink it;&#xD;
and, in order that you may not be&#xD;
obliged to do it alone, I will drink it&#xD;
once more, and this time in Swedish:&#xD;
Lefve Finland I"&#xD;
Had Gertrude Sj~iding possessed a&#xD;
brother, and met him unexpectedly,&#xD;
she would not have felt happier than&#xD;
she now did. All remaining uneasi-&#xD;
ness about her home journey was now&#xD;
at once dispelled. It almost seemed&#xD;
to her at this moment as if she were&#xD;
already in her native land again.&#xD;
"Now, you may reasonably think&#xD;
it high time that you learned some-&#xD;
thing more about your travelling com-&#xD;
panion," said he. "Hitherto you I&#xD;
have been kind enough to have confi-&#xD;
dence in his, as I hope, honest face.&#xD;
I am Lorenzo Fridland; physician by 1&#xD;
profession. Your name was known&#xD;
to me before, but I have only known t&#xD;
you personally to-day."           o&#xD;
"You would have spared me a part I&#xD;
of my anxiety, doctor," said Ger- c&#xD;
trade, playfully reproaching him, tJ&#xD;
"if you had told me at once that you e:&#xD;
were a countryman of mine."       e&#xD;
"That would have destroyed a r~&#xD;
great pleasure for myself, and there- s&#xD;
fore my selfishness made me do what ri&#xD;
I did. It an~se4 u~e to e~.amiue you i~&#xD;
&#xD;
~de World.                    87&#xD;
first, and see how much of a Finn you&#xD;
were."&#xD;
"And the verdict?"&#xD;
"Is the highest possible, and that&#xD;
with all my heart."&#xD;
"It is to my advantage that you&#xD;
have been away from your country&#xD;
for a time: it makes you see me in a&#xD;
favorable light. How long have you&#xD;
been abroad, Dr. Fridland?"&#xD;
"Since a year last spring. My Wife,&#xD;
in consequence of a violent cold there&#xD;
at home, brought on quick consump..&#xD;
tion, and died in the month of Octo-&#xD;
ber, in Vevey, where we had taken&#xD;
refuge for the mild climate. Since&#xD;
then I have roamed in many direc-&#xD;
tions. I have now for the last four&#xD;
monVhs been studying in Paris, where&#xD;
we thus resided at the same time, al-&#xD;
though unknown to each other."&#xD;
"Withoutmy carelessnesswe might,&#xD;
perhaps, not have become acquainted&#xD;
with each other now."&#xD;
"It is very possible, for you were&#xD;
alone and unprotected, and conse-&#xD;
~uently timid and retiring; and I&#xD;
should have taken good care not to&#xD;
annoy you by commencing an ac-&#xD;
juaintance if I had found it disa-&#xD;
~reeable to you. As events have&#xD;
now shaped themselves, however, I&#xD;
bhink that we might empty another&#xD;
;lass, just for this acquaintanceof ours.&#xD;
Co speak frankly, I believe it has&#xD;
een pleasant to us both."&#xD;
We might have ended this little&#xD;
ravelling sketch here; for probably&#xD;
ur readers will be convinced that&#xD;
)r. Fridland's passport served ta&#xD;
conduct Gertrude Sj~iding safely all&#xD;
be way to Finland. We nmst, nev-&#xD;
rtheless, in conformity with the truth,&#xD;
yen at the risk of alarming our lady&#xD;
mders, acknowledge that we have&#xD;

BURNETT'S FLAVORING EXTRACTS.&#xD;
THE SUPERIORITY OF THESE EXTRACTS CONSISTS IN THEIR PERFECT PURITY AND&#xD;
GREAT STRENGTH. They are walTanted free from poisonous oils gnd acids which enter into&#xD;
the composition of many of the factitious fruit flavors now in the market. They are not only&#xD;
true to their names, but are prepared from fruits of the best quality, and are so highly con-&#xD;
centrated that a comparatively small quantity only need be used.&#xD;

REBECCA'S MA.&#xD;
BY FRED. W. LORIb~G.&#xD;
&#xD;
REBECCA POTTLESEY is the late&#xD;
soubrette of tile Plimnix. The Pham-&#xD;
nix~ as I need not inform my read-&#xD;
ers, is one of the leading theatres&#xD;
in the country. Its company is com-&#xD;
posed of performers of the highest&#xD;
class, none of whom can be induced&#xD;
to play secondary parts. This is&#xD;
according to the American principle&#xD;
of theatrical management. In the&#xD;
Phamnix, therefore, you see a few&#xD;
favorites from time to time, and many&#xD;
who are not favorites. If Mrs. Agga,&#xD;
who is one leading lady, plays Ju-&#xD;
Cia, in "The Hunchback." Miss&#xD;
Baggs, who is the other leading lady,&#xD;
cannot be induced to play Helen. In&#xD;
the same way, when "Love's Sacri-&#xD;
fice"is put up for the next week, and&#xD;
Miss Baggs appears as Margaret El-&#xD;
were, Mrs. Aggs is heard calmly to&#xD;
&#xD;
remark, that she "should like to see&#xD;
anybody make her play Herminie de&#xD;
Vaudmont," meaning that she should&#xD;
not like to see anybody make her play&#xD;
the part alluded to.&#xD;
This state of affairs, though vexa-&#xD;
tious to the manager, and disappoint-&#xD;
ing to the public, is beneficial to the&#xD;
soubrette, who is not only left in pos-&#xD;
session of the impossibly pert chaul-&#xD;
bermaids, and boys with curly hair&#xD;
and feminine contours (two classes&#xD;
of characters, I may here renlark,&#xD;
found only on the stage and never in&#xD;
Nature), but at times has a ellanco to&#xD;
sparkle through the light comedy&#xD;
parts disdained by the Aggscs and&#xD;
the Baggses of our theatres. So&#xD;
Rebecca Pottlesey took all she could&#xD;
get from the manager in the way&#xD;
of business, and all she could get&#xD;
&#xD;
Rebec&#xD;
from the public in the way of ap-&#xD;
plause, bouquets and presentations.&#xD;
Heartsease and Ilobb, the florists1&#xD;
whose store is in profitable proximity&#xD;
to the theatre, have so realized the&#xD;
blessing that Miss Pottlesey has been&#xD;
to them in the way of business, that, on&#xD;
her last annual benefit, they presented&#xD;
her with all the unsold bouquets in&#xD;
their front window, making twenty-&#xD;
seven in all, that the victorious Re-&#xD;
becca received on that memorable&#xD;
occasion, which number was five snore&#xD;
than Miss Baggs received on her ben-&#xD;
efit, and eight more than were be-&#xD;
stowed upon Mrs. Aggs, when that&#xD;
worthy and deserving artist was a&#xD;
beneficiary.&#xD;
"Miss Baggs," said Miss Pottlesey,&#xD;
"took occasion to say, in her spiteful&#xD;
way to me, that, since my benefit came&#xD;
later in the season than hers, flowers&#xD;
were cheaper, which might account&#xD;
for my having more bouquets thass&#xD;
she did; but my only answer to this&#xD;
outburst of spleen was a contemptis-&#xD;
ous smile, which I am sure she&#xD;
felt."&#xD;
Now, iebecca Pottlescy has one&#xD;
serious drawback as an actress. She&#xD;
can sing, she can dance, she is not&#xD;
troubled with diffidence. She has&#xD;
versatility. When you hear her de-&#xD;
clare, on Thursday night, that she is&#xD;
a poor orphan with nO protector but&#xD;
I-Leaven, you are so moved by her&#xD;
sweet ingenuousness, by the plaintive&#xD;
tone of her voice, by the graceful way&#xD;
in which her long brown hair flows&#xD;
over her shoulder, that you cannot&#xD;
realize that she is the boy in stylish&#xD;
coat and trousers, who smoked a cigar,&#xD;
said "You bet ~' ,and "Old horse," and&#xD;
winked in a fascinating manner, dur-&#xD;
ing the progress of the rattling farce&#xD;
of Wednesday. With all these quali-&#xD;
ties of a successful actress, what can&#xD;
be the deficiency of Rebecca Pettle-&#xD;
&#xD;
ca's Ma.                .        39&#xD;
sey? My ans~ver is brief, but telling.&#xD;
- She has 110 soother.&#xD;
Here I pause, for the purpose of&#xD;
* allowing the kind-hearted to say,&#xD;
"Poor girl! The stage is indeed a&#xD;
terrible place to be in, or on, without&#xD;
* a mother's sympathy, influence, and&#xD;
protection." Tile kind-hearted people&#xD;
who say this are right. But it is not&#xD;
so much on account of these things,&#xD;
as in a business point of view, that&#xD;
Ilebecca's lack of a mother is to be&#xD;
regretted. Miss Baggs has a mother.&#xD;
Miss Caggs, the walking-lady, has a&#xD;
soother. Even the ladies of tile bal-&#xD;
let are accompanied from the theatre&#xD;
by dingy-looking females, whom they&#xD;
are heard to address as "Ma!~~&#xD;
The use of a mother to a popular&#xD;
actress is obvious. Who can so ur-&#xD;
gently and indefatigably besiege a&#xD;
manager ~vith applications for tile&#xD;
privileges and perquisites which every&#xD;
actress desires? Who can so well&#xD;
guard tile tender flower from too close&#xD;
ol)servation? Who can so ~vell watch&#xD;
in the dressing-room while the per-&#xD;
former is on the stage? And who&#xD;
can so well discourse on the artistic&#xD;
merits and general popularity of an&#xD;
actress as the ma of that actress. The&#xD;
first time I went behind tile scenes&#xD;
at tile Phe Ilix was in tile morning.&#xD;
Unused to the place, I stopped at the&#xD;
green-room door, wondering if that&#xD;
was where the rehearsal was, and if&#xD;
there I should find the manager, with&#xD;
whom I had business to transact.&#xD;
Four ladies, elderly, dingy, nnd of&#xD;
severe aspect, were wildly gesticulat-&#xD;
ing. I supposed it ~vas a scene from the&#xD;
new piece, and stood observing them.&#xD;
"How impressive," thought I, "is&#xD;
this devotion to art! These women,&#xD;
absorbed in their elsarneters, forget&#xD;
tile existence of the outside world, and&#xD;
do not notice my presence, absorbed&#xD;
as they ate in the ideg~L"&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="40-41" xml:id="VAC8019-00000021"/>&#xD;
40                        Rebecc&#xD;
It was at this moment that the&#xD;
doorkeeper touched me, and said, -&#xD;
"The manager is this way, at re-&#xD;
hearsal, sir."&#xD;
"Why," said I, in some surprise,&#xD;
"isn't this rehearsal ?"&#xD;
"No, sir," said the doorkeeper, with&#xD;
a smile.&#xD;
"Who are these ladies?" I asked.&#xD;
"I thought surely they were acting;&#xD;
they seemed so earnest."&#xD;
The doorkeeper grinned. "Them,"&#xD;
said he, "is inns of different ladies&#xD;
in the company, and they're going on&#xD;
about their daughters. They almost&#xD;
always does when they gets together.~~&#xD;
It was then, for the first time, that&#xD;
I realized how much a mother was to&#xD;
a dramatic performer. The life of&#xD;
the stage is terribly full of temptation,&#xD;
and quite as likely to destroy feminine&#xD;
modesty and reserve as a course of&#xD;
fashionable society flirtations.&#xD;
Rebecca Pottlesey was a shrewd,&#xD;
sensible, and energetic girl. She en-&#xD;
joyed her profession, and worked hard&#xD;
at it. She was, however, a woman, and&#xD;
alonein theworld,-adisadvantageous&#xD;
position, which she fully appreciated.&#xD;
She feltthatshemusthaveaprotectress&#xD;
at least; and on one night, when Miss&#xD;
Baggs made some spiteful remark&#xD;
about girls who had no one to look&#xD;
after them, - no pa nor ma, - being&#xD;
deserving of pity rather than blame,&#xD;
Itebecca, raging inwardly, replied,-&#xD;
"I quite agree with you, Miss&#xD;
~3aggs. I've thought so, all along&#xD;
this season; and I wrote to Ma, last&#xD;
week, telling her she must come and&#xD;
stay with me."&#xD;
In dismayed astonishment, Miss&#xD;
Jlaggs stared at Rebecca. "Why,"&#xD;
said she, "I didn't know you had a&#xD;
mother!"&#xD;
"I trust,~' said Rebecca, "I don't&#xD;
need to carry my ma with me all the&#xD;
time, as a certificate of character."&#xD;
&#xD;
a's Ma.&#xD;
And Miss Bagge, crushed and de&#xD;
fated, could only console herself by&#xD;
the thought that she had now some-&#xD;
tIming in the way of news to tell her&#xD;
companions; and, before an hour had&#xD;
passed, the very walls of the dressing-&#xD;
rooms re-echoed with the words, -&#xD;
"Rebecca Pottlesey has got a ma!,,&#xD;
This conversation took place on&#xD;
Saturday night. The next fortnight&#xD;
was devoted to a piece in which Re-&#xD;
becca did not appear: Taking ad-&#xD;
vantage of this fact, Rebecca went to&#xD;
Now York, and there secured a com-&#xD;
panion in the shape of an elderly&#xD;
lady, by name Bullington. The ex-&#xD;
act articles of confederation between&#xD;
Rebecca and her ma have never been&#xD;
made public; but they amounted to&#xD;
this:-&#xD;
Rebecca agreed to supply her nomi-&#xD;
nal ma with board, lodging, and a&#xD;
moderate weekly stipend.&#xD;
The ma agreed to supply Rebecca&#xD;
with apparent parental affection.&#xD;
She was to accompany her, as a rule,&#xD;
to the theatre; she was to decline in-&#xD;
vitations for her; she was to aid her&#xD;
in the composition of dresses for the&#xD;
stage; she was to gaze on her fondly&#xD;
when they were together, and to be&#xD;
lojid in her praises when they were&#xD;
apart; and, in short, was to fulfil all&#xD;
the duties that may reasonably be ex-&#xD;
pected from the mother of an actress.&#xD;
I was fortunate enough to witness&#xD;
the advent of Rebecca's Ma. Stand-&#xD;
ing at the green-room door in conver-&#xD;
sation with tIme manager, I beheld&#xD;
Rebecca descending the stairs from&#xD;
her dressiug-room, arrayed in the&#xD;
jaunty costume of ,Susan, the bar-&#xD;
maid, in the roaring farce of "Trot-&#xD;
ting 11cr Out." Around the green-&#xD;
room were seated several ladies and&#xD;
gentlemen, some studying, others&#xD;
talking.&#xD;
~ said Rebecca, addressing&#xD;
&#xD;
Rebece&#xD;
her comrades comprehensively "is my&#xD;
Ma."&#xD;
"I am glad to see you," said Re-&#xD;
becca's Ma, in a somewhat agitated&#xD;
tone of' voice. She was a small wo-&#xD;
man dressed in deep black, with a&#xD;
damp and tearful voice. I think I&#xD;
never saw a woman who appeared, if&#xD;
I may be allowed the expression, so&#xD;
crapy and so bombaziny. As she&#xD;
stood gazing upon the crowd, which&#xD;
comprised a stage-baron, who was a&#xD;
respectable sort of villain; his minion,&#xD;
who had a false hump on, and was&#xD;
therefore plainly a low and degraded&#xD;
villain; and a faithful old family ser-&#xD;
yant with a red nose, - she appeared&#xD;
to be somewhat alarmed.&#xD;
"Don't be frightened, ma," said&#xD;
Rebecca. Then, turning to the com-&#xD;
pany, she explained that her mother&#xD;
had never been in a theatre before,&#xD;
as she had only recently arrived from&#xD;
her country home. A beam of de-&#xD;
light simultaneously illuminated the&#xD;
features of the baron, his minion, and&#xD;
the faithful family servant; and any&#xD;
one familiar with them might readily&#xD;
have perceived that they saw in Re-&#xD;
becca's ma material for future hoaxes.&#xD;
It took a long time for Rebecca's&#xD;
ma to accustom herself to the mys-&#xD;
teries of the stage. In the begin-&#xD;
ning, she was continually getting en-&#xD;
tangled in the ropes, or sinking slowly&#xD;
through what she alluded to in a dis-&#xD;
gusted tone as "them traps." She&#xD;
could not be cleared off the stage, at&#xD;
the commencement of the act. As&#xD;
the curtain rose, her dress would be&#xD;
seen vanishing at the wings. On one&#xD;
occasion, she was caught in the cur-&#xD;
tain, and her venerable ankles were&#xD;
elevated some six feet before the&#xD;
amused audience. After this, she&#xD;
never went upon the stage, without&#xD;
carefully pinning up her skirt, as&#xD;
though she were about to cross a pud-&#xD;
&#xD;
~as Ha.                        41&#xD;
die in a thunder-shower. The remon-&#xD;
strances of the manager, and the di..&#xD;
reactions of Rebecca, gradually im-&#xD;
proved her behavior. She would see&#xD;
the play, and would stand at the&#xD;
wings t~ do so. This habit~although&#xD;
not objectionable in itself, became&#xD;
somewhat annoying, as Rebecca's Ma&#xD;
gave way easily to her feelings, some.&#xD;
times to an absurd extent. On the&#xD;
comic passages, she gazed with a stony&#xD;
severity. This was not owing to&#xD;
any deficiency in the appreciation of&#xD;
humor; but may be explain&amp;amp;rby a&#xD;
remark that she addressed to Flyn-&#xD;
ders, the low comedian, one night af-&#xD;
ter he had finished singing his cele-&#xD;
brated song, "The Roasted Cat." "I&#xD;
declare," said she, "it's too bad that&#xD;
them folks in frcnt laugh so, and put&#xD;
you out! I want to laugh myself,&#xD;
but I'm happy to say I can restrain&#xD;
myself."&#xD;
Her power of self-control, however,&#xD;
utterly failed her when she witnessed&#xD;
any thing pathetic. On such occa-&#xD;
sions she sobbed audibly. Remon-&#xD;
strance caused her to define her posi-&#xD;
tion thus: -&#xD;
"Emotion," said Rebecca's Ma, "is&#xD;
not a thing that can be repressed by&#xD;
a feeling heart; and a feeling heart&#xD;
is what I have always been known to&#xD;
have, therefore I cannot repress it.&#xD;
Had I been Constance, I should have&#xD;
cried, and took on dreadful. Not be-&#xD;
ing Constance, I cries, and takes on&#xD;
dreadful all the same."&#xD;
Notwithstanding her slight eccen-&#xD;
tricities, Rebecca's Ma soon became a&#xD;
great favorite with the company.&#xD;
She was devoted to Rebecca, who&#xD;
treated her in the sweetest possible&#xD;
way. She was of great help in&#xD;
dressing and sewing, and attending to&#xD;
the thousand little niceties of a the-&#xD;
atrical wardrobe. Only once did she&#xD;
lose her temper while she was in the&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="42-43" xml:id="VAC8019-00000022"/>&#xD;
42                        Rebee&#xD;
theatre. The good lady ~vore a fals&#xD;
front and a cap. A clumsy sceae~&#xD;
shifter left a ~nail in the framework of&#xD;
a screen which caught the cap and&#xD;
front, and pulled them off together~&#xD;
disclosing I~ebecca's Ma in all he:&#xD;
baldness to the passing members of&#xD;
the company. No words can describe&#xD;
the lqok of disgusted wrath with&#xD;
which ~ebecca's Ma gazed on him as&#xD;
he sto~d there laughing, and said, -&#xD;
"Elijah was mocked at by boys for&#xD;
being bald. Do you know what hap-&#xD;
pened to them boys?"&#xD;
"No,~~ said the man half sullenly.&#xD;
"They was ate up by bears," re-&#xD;
turned Rebecca's Ma impressively;&#xD;
"and let it be a warning." She then&#xD;
burst into tears, and retreated to Re-&#xD;
becca's dressing-room, where she re-&#xD;
mained the rest of the evening.&#xD;
One night, the performance ended&#xD;
with "Black-eyed Susan," Douglas&#xD;
Jerrold's beautiful and touching little&#xD;
play. The trial scene, ~vhere William,&#xD;
is condemned to death, was on, whena&#xD;
low, smothered cry, audible only to&#xD;
those on the stage, ~vas heard; and&#xD;
Rebecca's Ma was seen to fall fainting&#xD;
at the wing. A crowd of sympa-&#xD;
thetic friends gathered around her, as&#xD;
she was carried into the green-room,&#xD;
and inquired the cause of her fainting-&#xD;
fit; to which she replied that it arose&#xD;
from seeing the play.&#xD;
"Really, Miss Pottlesey," said the&#xD;
manager, half vexed, to Rebecca, "if&#xD;
your mother will take acting so much&#xD;
to heart, she must not be allowed to&#xD;
come to the wings.~~&#xD;
Upon this, Rebecca's Ma sat up.&#xD;
"It isn't always, nor yet often, that&#xD;
I take on so," said she; "but that&#xD;
play brings up about my son George,&#xD;
who went away to sea, and whom I&#xD;
shall never see again."&#xD;
And then she told her story.&#xD;
George was on the ship "Falconia."&#xD;
&#xD;
ca'8 .35a.&#xD;
&#xD;
The men mutinied, and George among&#xD;
them. The captain seized the iing-&#xD;
leaders, and bad them shot. George,&#xD;
I who was a mere boy, was left with&#xD;
two others on an island in the Pacilic.&#xD;
Then his father died at home; and&#xD;
his mother was left in destitution and&#xD;
solitude.&#xD;
"Until she," said Rebecca's Ma,&#xD;
"came to my aid like a angel as she is,&#xD;
and saved me from starvation. And&#xD;
if," said Rebecca's Ma, suddenly flani-&#xD;
ing up, "I could ketch a-hold of that&#xD;
critic of 'The Daily Investigator,'&#xD;
which Rebecca was crying over yes-&#xD;
terday, I'd let him kmiow what the&#xD;
Bible says about them as judges oth-&#xD;
ers, and considerest not the beam that&#xD;
is in thine own eye."&#xD;
With this somewhat mixed sen~&#xD;
tence, Rebecca's Ma concluded. No&#xD;
one laughed; for the story she had&#xD;
told was a sad one; and she told it&#xD;
as one who had suffered, and not like&#xD;
a repeater of bare facts. But, after&#xD;
this time, there was a vague report&#xD;
that Rebecca's Ma was not the real&#xD;
article, but a substitute. Still Rebec-&#xD;
ca's Ma and Rebecca herself had by&#xD;
this time grown to be so much liked&#xD;
by the other members of the compa-&#xD;
ny, that even Miss Baggs refrained&#xD;
from unpleasant remarks. The mild&#xD;
behavior of Miss Baggs, though, may&#xD;
perhaps be explained by the fact that&#xD;
she now reigned undisputed in the&#xD;
position of leading lady; Mrs. Aggs&#xD;
having taken umbrage and departed.&#xD;
My story must now leap over the&#xD;
winter holidays into the spring. Busi-&#xD;
ness was light, except on the benefit&#xD;
nights; and Rebecca fell into the&#xD;
habit of glancing over the partially&#xD;
filled house night after night to see&#xD;
whom she knew there. This habit&#xD;
caused her to notice a man of some&#xD;
twenty-five years of age, with bronzed&#xD;
face and full brown beard, who wildly&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
liebece&#xD;
applauded h~r, and seemed complete-&#xD;
ly absorbed in watchingg hcr umove-&#xD;
ments. One night he appeared ~vith&#xD;
an enormous bouquet, ~vhich he es-&#xD;
sayed to throw two or three times;&#xD;
but then his courage failed him, and,&#xD;
after flourishing it before the eyes of&#xD;
the audience, he held it placidly in his&#xD;
lap during the rest of the evening.&#xD;
Rebecca found herself, as it were,&#xD;
fascinated by him. She saw that she&#xD;
pleased him; and yet he was modest&#xD;
and abashed, - a sort of behavior&#xD;
that was new to Miss Pottlesey both&#xD;
on and off the stage.&#xD;
One night in April, Rebecca's Ma&#xD;
complained of a toothache, and de-&#xD;
clined to accompany Rebecca to the&#xD;
theatre. Rebecca was perfectly con-&#xD;
tented at this, and determined to&#xD;
take a street-car home after the per-&#xD;
formance. In doing so, an adven-&#xD;
ture with a drunken man fell to her&#xD;
lot.&#xD;
I am now going, by ~ bald and un-&#xD;
varnished narration of facts, to sacri-&#xD;
fice na opportunity of making fame&#xD;
and fortune as a writer. With my&#xD;
knowledge of the exquisite humor of&#xD;
the farce of "Toodles," I might fill&#xD;
several pages with descriptions of the&#xD;
person and behavior of this drunken&#xD;
man. His language, too, might flow&#xD;
from this fertile pen with fine effect,&#xD;
it is so easy, by dropping every alter-&#xD;
nate vowel and every third consonant,&#xD;
to transfer to paper the drunken dia-&#xD;
lect of fiction and the drama. But I&#xD;
will not. With a sigh, I simply re-&#xD;
cord that the drunken man asked Re-&#xD;
becca for a kiss, and Rebecca told him&#xD;
to "go away; " that the drunken man&#xD;
then moved forward, and some one&#xD;
behind him knocked him down on the&#xD;
sidewalk, where he lay peaceably.&#xD;
Here, again, I nip my description in&#xD;
the bud, and briefly state that Re-&#xD;
becca immediately recognized in her&#xD;
&#xD;
es's Ala.                      48&#xD;
defender her modest admirer with&#xD;
the full beard.&#xD;
"I am very much obliged to you,&#xD;
sir," said she.&#xD;
"Not as much as I am to you," he&#xD;
returned. Then, in a disconnected&#xD;
manner, he broke forth, -&#xD;
"0 Miss Pottlesey I I think you are&#xD;
the greatest actress I ever saw."&#xD;
Rebecca laughed. "Then you&#xD;
can't have seen many," said she.&#xD;
"But I cannot stop here any longer.&#xD;
I shall be pleased if you would call on&#xD;
me next Sunday evening, that I may&#xD;
more fully thank you."&#xD;
Need I say that the invitation was&#xD;
accepted with effusion; that he went&#xD;
one way, perfectly silent for joy, and&#xD;
that she hummed comic songs to her-&#xD;
self all the way home in the horse-&#xD;
car.&#xD;
Sunday came in its time, and Re-&#xD;
becca sat waiting for her visitor. She&#xD;
did not have to wait long. As soon&#xD;
as it could possibly be called evening,&#xD;
the hell rang, and he appeared. Re-&#xD;
becca and Rebecca's Ma both arose.&#xD;
"I am so glad to see you!" said&#xD;
Rebecca, taking his hat. "This is my&#xD;
ma, Mr. - Do you know, I forget&#xD;
to ask your name."&#xD;
"My name," said the stranger, "is&#xD;
Bulhington, - George Bullington."&#xD;
"George Bullington!" said Re-&#xD;
becca's Ma.&#xD;
He looked at her an instant; and&#xD;
then, with one tremendous cry of&#xD;
"Mother!" he caught her to his&#xD;
breast. Rebecca's Ma did not die;&#xD;
she did not even faint: she only cried,&#xD;
and he cried; and Rebecca herself&#xD;
had just presence of mind enough&#xD;
left to go out of the room and cry and&#xD;
laugh, finally winding up her per-&#xD;
formanceby giving three small piping&#xD;
cheers to herself, and indulging in a&#xD;
sort of war-dance. Then she went&#xD;
back, and heard George Builington&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="44-45" xml:id="VAC8019-00000023"/>&#xD;
What happened to the Kkan.&#xD;
&#xD;
tell how he worked his way around&#xD;
the world back home, and how he&#xD;
grew rich by luck in China, and how&#xD;
he came back and hunted vainly for&#xD;
the mother he supposed he had lost&#xD;
forever.&#xD;
"That was all owing to me," said&#xD;
Rebecca remorsefully.&#xD;
"I forgive you," said George Bul-&#xD;
lington.&#xD;
Of course, every one rloAw sees the&#xD;
end. Of course, Rebecca couldn't do&#xD;
without her Ma; and, of course,&#xD;
George Bullington wasn't going to be&#xD;
deprived of his natural parent with-&#xD;
out a struggle. Then, on subsequent&#xD;
visits, instead of Rebecca's leaving&#xD;
the room, as at first, Rebecca's Ma&#xD;
herself disappeared. The result of&#xD;
all this has been, that Rebecca Pot..&#xD;

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE KHAN AND THE POOR MAN'S SON.&#xD;
A TARTAR FAIRY TALE.&#xD;
(Translated by J. P. Lesley.]&#xD;
[Tna following is the "Second Talc" of the narrative of Siddhi-Kilr, of which&#xD;
we have previously given one.~ For introduction, it is only necessary to recall, that&#xD;
the King has been allotted the task of bringing under the power of one who has&#xD;
befriended him, Siddhi-Kiir (Death endowed with supernatural power). He has&#xD;
the means of compelling this; but one condition is, that, after he has got possession&#xD;
of Siddhi-Kiir, he must himself speak no word until he has accomplished his return.&#xD;
He has already failed in one attempt, and now addresses himself again to the task.&#xD;
The resemblance of some of the details of this &amp;amp;iry tale to those of Europe - For.&#xD;
tunatus, Cinderella, Puss in Boots, &amp;amp;e. - will occur to every reader; but the charming&#xD;
naivet6 of the narrative, and its simple directness and spirited action, has never been&#xD;
excelled. Its Tartar dress is well marked, and the primitive manners of a nomadic&#xD;
people are always taken for granted.]&#xD;
&#xD;
SECOND TALE.&#xD;
Tuu King returned to the cool&#xD;
Grove of the Dead, as in the former&#xD;
trial, to recover the Siddhi-Kllr;&#xD;
and putting himself in attitude, as if&#xD;
to hew down the Mango-tree, cried,&#xD;
"Ho, Death I come down, or I will fell&#xD;
the tree."&#xD;
"Fell not the tree," it replied, "I&#xD;
shall come down;" and it came down&#xD;
accordingly. Then he stuck it into&#xD;
his sack, bound it with the cord, ate&#xD;
of his provender, threw it across his&#xD;
shoulders, and marched off with it.&#xD;
After the lapse of several days,&#xD;
spake Siddhi-Kiir: "Because the day&#xD;
is long, we ennui ourselves; tell thou&#xD;
me a pretty story; if not, then will I&#xD;
tell one thee." The Khan made no&#xD;
reply, but only gave a sign with his&#xD;
~)ead~ and so the Siddhi-Kiir began&#xD;
Another tale.&#xD;
Long, long ago, there reigned over&#xD;
a great, far distant country, a mighty&#xD;
Khan. And at the head of a certain&#xD;
river in it was a great pool, and in&#xD;
this pool lived two Dragon-Frogs, who&#xD;
had the power to stop the flow of the&#xD;
&#xD;
fertilizing river-waters, which then no&#xD;
longer overspread the fields. So must&#xD;
they send yearly to these Dragon-&#xD;
Frogs a man, and alternately, without&#xD;
distinction, noble and low-born, to be&#xD;
devoured.&#xD;
Once upon a time, it happened that&#xD;
the lot fell upon the Khan. Now, if&#xD;
he would not go, why, seeing that the&#xD;
thing was indispensable for the king-&#xD;
dom, it was impossible not to go. If,&#xD;
on the contrary, he would go, why,&#xD;
then, both father and son (for nobody&#xD;
except Khan pare and Khan fils was&#xD;
there to go), tortured themselves with&#xD;
the questionwhich of the two should go.&#xD;
The father said, "I am now old;&#xD;
it is no hurt for me. I will go; let&#xD;
our country, 0 my son! expatiate&#xD;
itself under instruction."&#xD;
On the other hand, replied the son,&#xD;
"Howl 0 my father! Thou, my&#xD;
Khan and father, who hast so care-&#xD;
fully considered my inheritance, and&#xD;
brought me up, shalt thou go? That&#xD;
were never proper. Since the Khan&#xD;
and his lady still live, they can have&#xD;
another son if they please. I go for&#xD;
food to the frogs." And, as he went,&#xD;

46               What h~ppene&#xD;
the entire nation betook themselves&#xD;
to attend him, weeping and wailing,&#xD;
and then turned back.&#xD;
The young man had had, from child-&#xD;
hood up, a poor man's son for friend.&#xD;
To this friend he now went, and said,&#xD;
"Walk after the words of thy father&#xD;
and mother, farewell, and be happy.&#xD;
To preserve the precious royal realm,&#xD;
and to make the Khan's command ir-&#xD;
reversible, I go as food for the Frogs."&#xD;
All sad and weeping, spake the poor&#xD;
man's son, "Thou hast, 0 Khan! from&#xD;
children up, entreated me with good-&#xD;
will and goodness: in stead of thee, I&#xD;
will go." But the Khan ivould lend&#xD;
no ear to this proposal. Then went&#xD;
they both, the Prince and his friend,&#xD;
together.&#xD;
And, as they drew' nigh the pool,&#xD;
they heard the two Frogs, the yellow&#xD;
and the green, upon its bank, convers-&#xD;
ing; and thus they spake to one an-&#xD;
other: "Did but this Khan's son nnd&#xD;
his companion know, that if they&#xD;
were to smite off with a club the head&#xD;
of each of us two, and the Klian's son&#xD;
were to eat me, the gold-yellow frog,&#xD;
and the poor man's son, you, the em-&#xD;
erald-green frog, they would both spit&#xD;
pure gold and precious stones, and&#xD;
this foddering of' frogs in future&#xD;
would be made impossible. But they&#xD;
know nothing about it."&#xD;
Listening to this conversation, the&#xD;
Khan understood the saying of the&#xD;
Frog; for he understood the language&#xD;
of every kind of creature. So the&#xD;
Prince and his servant smote off the&#xD;
Frogs' heads with a club; and when&#xD;
they had eaten each his one, they&#xD;
could spit gold and jewels as mueh as&#xD;
they chose. Then said the servant,&#xD;
"Since we have killed the Frogs, and&#xD;
caused the water to flow, let us now&#xD;
get home." But the Khan's son was&#xD;
not for that. "If we return," said&#xD;
he, "to our own land, they will cry,&#xD;
&#xD;
ci to the Khan.&#xD;
'The dead have arisen and are come&#xD;
again!~ If, on the contrary, we travel&#xD;
far from here into another land, that&#xD;
will be better." With that they&#xD;
crossed over a mountain pass and&#xD;
were gone.&#xD;
Almost at the foot of the mountain,&#xD;
on the other side, they came to the&#xD;
home of two exquisitely fair women,&#xD;
mother and daughter, whosold brandy.&#xD;
"We would buy some brandy,~~ they&#xD;
said. The women asked, "What&#xD;
price will you give for the brandy?"&#xD;
They spat some gold and jewels, and&#xD;
handed them over. The two women&#xD;
found that pleasant, let them come in,&#xD;
and, giving them brandy in abun-&#xD;
dance, made them drunk, forced them&#xD;
to spit more gold and precious stones,&#xD;
took it all, and finally turned them&#xD;
into the street.&#xD;
When conic again to themselves,&#xD;
they travelled on; for they knew no&#xD;
other way, farther and further, to the&#xD;
mouth of a river. Here they encoun-&#xD;
tered a troop of youngsters quarrel-&#xD;
ling among themselves in the middle&#xD;
of a grove of palms. "What fight ye&#xD;
over?,~ asked they them. The young-&#xD;
sters answered, "We have found a&#xD;
bonnet on this palm, and are fighting&#xD;
for it." "What can one do with it,&#xD;
then?~~ asked they. The youngsters&#xD;
answered, "Whoever wears it is in-&#xD;
visible from gods and men and de-&#xD;
mons." "Now, then, if so, go all of&#xD;
you to the end of this palm-tree&#xD;
woods, and then come running back&#xD;
for a wager. I will hold the cap in&#xD;
stake, and give it to the one who first&#xD;
arrives." So enid the Khan's son.&#xD;
But when the youngsters came run-&#xD;
ning from the end of the palm-grove&#xD;
for the wager, they could not see them,&#xD;
although they remained there all the&#xD;
while, the poor man's son with the&#xD;
bonnet on his head. "They were&#xD;
here just then," cried the youngsters;&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
What happene&#xD;
&#xD;
"now they are gone." And as, with&#xD;
all their searching, they could not find&#xD;
the cap, they made their way back,&#xD;
crying and howling loud.&#xD;
A little farther yet, upon a great,&#xD;
broad road, the travellers fell upon a&#xD;
troop of devils, quarreling among&#xD;
themselves. "What fight ye over?"&#xD;
asked they both. "Over these boots,"&#xD;
they cried. And ivhen the question&#xD;
came, what could one do with them,&#xD;
they answered, "Whoever has them&#xD;
upon his feet can reach whatever&#xD;
place he thinks of." "Well, if that&#xD;
be so, come, run a race from the end&#xD;
of this broad bit of road, and whoever&#xD;
gets here first shall have the boots."&#xD;
When they nil got through the race,&#xD;
he had the boots in his bosom, and&#xD;
stuck the cap on his head, and the de-&#xD;
mons could not see him; and they&#xD;
could not find the boots, and so they&#xD;
beat a retreat.&#xD;
Now Prince and follower each&#xD;
dre~v on one boot, and wished that&#xD;
they might be in some country which&#xD;
had now no Khan, and exactly before&#xD;
the throne was to be occupied. The&#xD;
wish expressed, they fell asleep.&#xD;
When they a~voke next day, and&#xD;
looked about, they found themselves&#xD;
on an election-ground, at a throning-&#xD;
time, in the midst of a great hollo~v&#xD;
tree. A great assembly had this day&#xD;
assembled. "Under tIme decision of&#xD;
heaven," - such was the prescribed&#xD;
form, - "we thmroiv a figure of dough&#xD;
from off the height ivith a scatter-&#xD;
offering; on whoever head this Baling&#xD;
lights, him ~ve install our Khan."&#xD;
The fateful Baling struck the hol-&#xD;
low tree. All cried out, "What,&#xD;
shall a king's throne over inca come&#xD;
out of a tree?" But seine said,&#xD;
"What is in the inside of the tree?&#xD;
No man knows, let us look." As&#xD;
they looked, the Khan's son and&#xD;
his companion made their appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
ci to the Khan.                47&#xD;
But nobody felt any confidence in&#xD;
them. "They are folks from a far-off&#xD;
land," said they to one another. "To-&#xD;
morrow we will try the spitting-test."&#xD;
And so they dissolved the assembly.&#xD;
Next day, some, who had drunk&#xD;
milk, spat white; others, who had&#xD;
eaten greens, spat green; in short,&#xD;
each spat after his own sort. But&#xD;
when the Khan's son had spitten gold,&#xD;
and the hungcr-bitten man's son pre-&#xD;
cious stones, both of them said, "Khan&#xD;
and Minister of this kingdom are we;"&#xD;
and so they were, both of them, Kha4l&#xD;
and Minister.&#xD;
The late Khau had a charming&#xD;
daughter, whom our Khan's son took&#xD;
to wife. In the neighborhood of the&#xD;
Prince's residence wa~ a great high&#xD;
palace. Because the Princess betook&#xD;
herself to this every day, the Minister&#xD;
considered, "Why goeth the Princess&#xD;
every day to that palace?" So think-&#xD;
ing, he clapped his bonnet on his head,&#xD;
followed the Princess thither, opened&#xD;
the doors, and by a light ladder&#xD;
reached the palace-top. Here com-&#xD;
fortable, high, silken bolsters were&#xD;
outspread, inviting to sit down, and&#xD;
here, where all kinds of eatables and&#xD;
drinks stood ready, the Princess&#xD;
whiled away her time, having changed&#xD;
herconiinon garments and other things&#xD;
to suit, and clad herself in silks, and&#xD;
prinked herself up most charmingly&#xD;
with bathing nnd anointments of&#xD;
sweet odors and the like, while san-&#xD;
dal-~vood and other perfumed wood8&#xD;
were burnt before her.&#xD;
The Minister, with his cap ~n,&#xD;
visible to gods, demons, and men,&#xD;
seated himself near her; and, after a&#xD;
~vhile, there cam~ down rushing out&#xD;
of the air, a very charming bird.&#xD;
The Princess welcomed it, burning&#xD;
more perfumed wood. With the cry,&#xD;
"Tok! tok 1"it alighted upon a very&#xD;
fine stone slab on the palace-roof;&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="48-49" xml:id="VAC8019-00000025"/>&#xD;
48                What happene&#xD;
and out of the bird stepped forth&#xD;
the charming god's son, Cuklaketu,&#xD;
of beauty beyond the reach of man's&#xD;
imagination. After mutual embraces,&#xD;
he reclined himself upon the soft silk&#xD;
bolster-cases, and they regaled him&#xD;
with all kinds of food and drink.&#xD;
Then said the god's son, "Now thou&#xD;
hast a heaven-appointed husband;&#xD;
how does he behave?" At which&#xD;
words the Princess replied, "How the&#xD;
Prince promises to be, I do not know;&#xD;
he is yet young; as yet, I have ac-&#xD;
quired no information respecting his&#xD;
early good qualities or failings."&#xD;
After this interview, they separated&#xD;
for the day. The Princess put on&#xD;
again her common clothes, and went&#xD;
back to the Khan. When, some days&#xD;
afterwards, she did the same again,&#xD;
and the Minister followed her, the&#xD;
god's son said to her, that day, "To-&#xD;
morrow, early, I will appear in the&#xD;
likeness of a lark, to visit thy hus-&#xD;
band." The Princess answered, "So&#xD;
let it be," upon which they separated&#xD;
for that day.&#xD;
ButtheMinisterinformedtheKhan,&#xD;
that in that palace the charming,&#xD;
beautiful god's son Cukiaketa dallied;&#xD;
in short, recounted the whole story.&#xD;
"Early to-morrow morning," he con-&#xD;
tinued, "will this person appear, to&#xD;
yisit you, in the form of a lark.&#xD;
Order a tremendous fire to be built&#xD;
to-morrow, in the place where he&#xD;
alights. I will seize him by his tail-&#xD;
feathers, and throw him into the fire;&#xD;
then hew hm and kill him with the&#xD;
sword." In this wise made the Min-&#xD;
ister his preparations.&#xD;
Now, the next day, in the early&#xD;
morning, as the Khan and his wife,&#xD;
with the rest, sat all together in a row,&#xD;
came the god's son, in the form of a&#xD;
little parti-colored, larklike bird, over&#xD;
the threshold and alighted. Whilst&#xD;
the Princess, with her heart full of&#xD;
&#xD;
d to th~ K/tan.&#xD;
&#xD;
inward joy, looked around, the Minis-&#xD;
ter set upon his head his invisiblc-&#xD;
making cap, seized suddenly, at the&#xD;
right moment, the lark by the tail,&#xD;
and threw it into the fire. Just as&#xD;
the Khan bethought himself of hew-&#xD;
ing it to pieces with his sword, and&#xD;
stood near her; the Princess grasped&#xD;
his hand so that he could not draw&#xD;
his sword; and the bird rose with his&#xD;
fire-singed wings through the air and&#xD;
flew away. "Ah, the poor thing!"&#xD;
cried the Princess, and was seized&#xD;
with an anguish which amounted to&#xD;
a swoon.&#xD;
When, now, some days afterwards,&#xD;
she went again, the Minister followed&#xD;
her as usual. As before, she spread&#xD;
her coverlets. When all was ready,&#xD;
and the god's son, in spite of her long&#xD;
waiting for him, did not appear, then&#xD;
tortured she herself sorely, and sat,&#xD;
with an unwanted look, merely gazing&#xD;
out up into heaven. At last, and late,&#xD;
the bird came flying crookedly, badly&#xD;
ill-used by his late accident, covered&#xD;
with blisters, and dripping with dirty&#xD;
blood and watery matter. Thus step-&#xD;
pedhe forth from out his bird disguise.&#xD;
The Princess wept at the sight of him~&#xD;
The god's son said, "Weep not; thy&#xD;
present husband is armed with a high-&#xD;
er powerfulness; unhappily, I have&#xD;
been fire-burnt; since this, my body,&#xD;
has been singed, I cannot come to&#xD;
thee." The Princess answered, "Oh,&#xD;
say not so I thou must come as hereto-&#xD;
fore." So they agreed to meet on the&#xD;
fifteenth of every month. Thereupon&#xD;
the god's son flew off through the air.&#xD;
But the Princess, from now on, enter-&#xD;
tained more and always more confi-&#xD;
dencein, and incli.nationfor, the Khan.&#xD;
In conclusion, the Minister once&#xD;
more put his bonnet on, andwent forth.&#xD;
He arrived at a temple. As here he&#xD;
peeped through a crack of the door,&#xD;
he remarked how a watchman of the&#xD;
&#xD;
temple spread out the image of an&#xD;
ass, painted on a paper roll; and,&#xD;
when he had rolled upon it to and fro,&#xD;
he became changed into a great ass,&#xD;
stood up, brayed loud, and galloped&#xD;
hither and thither; and, when he had&#xD;
rolled upon it a second time, he am&#xD;
feared once more in his true human&#xD;
form. Thea he folded his paper to-&#xD;
gether, and stuck it into the hand of&#xD;
a Buddha.&#xD;
After Ise had gone out, and was at a&#xD;
distance, the Minister stepped in, and&#xD;
took the paper to himself. With this&#xD;
he went to the two brandy-selling wo-&#xD;
men, mother and daughter, who had&#xD;
formerly behaved so ill. Said he, "I&#xD;
am come to pay you for your noble be-&#xD;
havior;" and ~vith these words, he&#xD;
handed them three pieces of gold, in&#xD;
order to deceive them. "Ah 1" said&#xD;
the two females, "thou art an excel-&#xD;
lent man. Through what fortunate&#xD;
chance art thou possessed of such an&#xD;
exhaustless fount of gold?" "Now,"&#xD;
replied the Minister, "this, my gold,&#xD;
have I earned by rolling to and fro&#xD;
upon this folded paper sheet." The&#xD;
&#xD;
49&#xD;
&#xD;
women said, "If so, let both of us&#xD;
roll on it." Said he, "Yes, that may&#xD;
be."&#xD;
And, when they h~sd rolled, they&#xD;
were changed into two she-asses. He&#xD;
led them to the Khan, and advised&#xD;
him to put them to hauling stone and&#xD;
dirt. The Khan assigned to them&#xD;
that sort ofwork; and, after they had&#xD;
dragged earth and stones three years,&#xD;
their backs were rubbed quite raw,&#xD;
dropping foul blood and matter.&#xD;
From their eyes, which looked towards&#xD;
the Khan, tears started; and the&#xD;
Khan said to the Minister, "Do those&#xD;
two asses no more harm, although they&#xD;
be worthy of punishment." After&#xD;
they had rolled a second time on th~e&#xD;
paper, they became two old and&#xD;
scarcely living women.&#xD;
"Oh, the poor things!" cried out,&#xD;
at these words of the story, the King;&#xD;
and Siddhi-Ktlr replied, "Trilling&#xD;
away his luck, the King has let words&#xD;
slip from out of his mouth!" and&#xD;
with the exclamation, "In the world&#xD;
it is not good to stay," he stormed in&#xD;
flight away.&#xD;

The Companion of Paradise.&#xD;
THE COMPANION OF PARADISE.&#xD;
BY IIENiSY A. MILES.&#xD;
&#xD;
ETHEBE has come down to us quite a&#xD;
body of Hebrew legends, which have at-&#xD;
tracted little notice, but are worthy of&#xD;
study. Many of them are far more beau-&#xD;
tiful and instructive than the legends of&#xD;
the Roman Catholic Church. These deal&#xD;
largely in astounding miracles; while the&#xD;
Hebrew legends are more frequently&#xD;
founded on natural events, and offer no&#xD;
violence to prpbability. Beautiful aspects&#xD;
of Divine Providence, a sweet and tender&#xD;
humanity, the duty of cheerful resigna-&#xD;
tion and trust, take the place of the wild&#xD;
stories of saints with which the "Golden&#xD;
Legend" abounds ; while we are occa-&#xD;
sionally surprised at the simple and beau-&#xD;
tiful manner in which are suggested&#xD;
~limpses of what we call, at the present&#xD;
Jay, the most advanced spiritual truth.&#xD;
We offer to our readers a little story of&#xD;
'isis kind. It is found in "Christiani ed&#xD;
~ibrei nel Medio Evo," by Prof. Giuseppe&#xD;
uevi, published in Florence in 1806, from&#xD;
the celebrated press of Monnier, in that&#xD;
city. We translate from the Italian the&#xD;
legend which is called "The Companion&#xD;
of Paradise."&#xD;
Our aim has been to present the storu&#xD;
in its essential facts, without any attempt&#xD;
at a lexicographical translation. We&#xD;
have therefore felt at liberty to omit some&#xD;
sentences, to blend others together, and,&#xD;
while we follow the order of events, to&#xD;
give, in the idiom of our own language, a&#xD;
narrative which we think wili reward at-&#xD;
tention.]&#xD;
RABBI SOLOMON of Worms had&#xD;
reached his sixtieth year. He was&#xD;
now employed wholly in the thought&#xD;
of heaven and eternity. Passing in&#xD;
review the sacred studies and honored&#xD;
works of his long life, he would at&#xD;
times abandon himself to a ravishing&#xD;
confidence of being welcomed after&#xD;
death among the blessed, and admit-&#xD;
fed to taste eternal felicity. In the&#xD;
&#xD;
ecstasy of his hope he would imagine&#xD;
himself as already in heaven, seated&#xD;
on a throne of gold, crowned with&#xD;
gems, at a banquet of celestial joys,&#xD;
for which no human tongue has name.&#xD;
But at that banquet the blessed sit&#xD;
opposite one another, two by two; and&#xD;
the souls of each couple are mingled&#xD;
together as one, so that they have one&#xD;
sense, one joy, for eternity.&#xD;
Who ~vill be his companion at that&#xD;
celestial feast?&#xD;
The desire to know this took such&#xD;
a hold upon the mind of Rabbi Solo-&#xD;
mon, that lie could not abandon it. It&#xD;
accompanied him in all his studies, in&#xD;
his ~vatchings and dreams, withoutt&#xD;
one moment of respite. Of course,&#xD;
God alone could reveal to him that&#xD;
grand secret of heaven; so to God he&#xD;
applied himself devoutly. By long&#xD;
fasts, ~tad protracted at~d fervent&#xD;
prayer, lie tried to obtain the favor&#xD;
so dear to him.&#xD;
One night it seemed in his sleep&#xD;
that there stood before him a female&#xD;
form of angelic aspect; and a voice&#xD;
whicli sounded more than human said&#xD;
to him, "Your companion of paradise&#xD;
shall be Abraham Ben Gerson, called&#xD;
the Righteous, in Barcelona."&#xD;
"Abraham Ben *Gerson!', said&#xD;
Rabbi Solomon to himself, when lie&#xD;
a~voke. "This is a strange thing. I&#xD;
do not know such a man, and never&#xD;
heard of him."&#xD;
Now, the good rabbi had imagined&#xD;
that his companion would be one of&#xD;
those great doctors whose fame then&#xD;
filled the Hebrew ~vorld. Only such&#xD;
a person was worthy, as it appeared&#xD;
to him, to be at his side in heaven.&#xD;
And that name5 so obscure, so un-&#xD;
&#xD;
50&#xD;
&#xD;
The C'ompanio&#xD;
known, sounded in his mind as an&#xD;
affront.&#xD;
"Never mind," at length he said&#xD;
to himself. "This may be one of&#xD;
those learned men who through great&#xD;
modesty jealously hide from the world&#xD;
their wisdom, and the sanctity of&#xD;
their works, and in thg secrecy of&#xD;
domestic life pass all their dais in&#xD;
sacred study.~~&#xD;
So in imagination he represented.&#xD;
his future companion as a venerable&#xD;
old man, with his long beard covering&#xD;
his breast, leaning on his elbow over&#xD;
the sacred writings, worn, wasted, and&#xD;
fleshless, through fasting and prayer,&#xD;
absorbed late at night in profound&#xD;
and devout meditation.&#xD;
Then there entered into his mind&#xD;
an ardent desire to know in this world&#xD;
that holy old man who was to be his&#xD;
inseparable companion in eternity,&#xD;
and to form here one link in that&#xD;
interminable chain which would thie:re&#xD;
forever join them together. He re-&#xD;
solved to go to Barcelona to find his&#xD;
predestined companion.&#xD;
- Arrived in that city, he made im-&#xD;
mediate inquiries for one Abraham,&#xD;
called the Righteous. But no one&#xD;
couhi give him the least account of&#xD;
such a person. Among the Hebrews&#xD;
of that place there were many who&#xD;
bore the name of Abraham; but no&#xD;
one of these could merit the title&#xD;
righteous.&#xD;
Rabbi Solomon was bewildered.&#xD;
"So the celestial vision has mocked&#xD;
me I But perhaps my future com-&#xD;
panion so hides the sanctity of his&#xD;
life that no perfume of it has got&#xD;
abroad. I will inquire farther. I do&#xD;
not see how I cnn be mistaken."&#xD;
Accordingly he said to the first&#xD;
person he met, who, for reverence of&#xD;
this rabbi's vast learning kept his&#xD;
eyes fixed on the ground and his head&#xD;
bowed down, "We will omit the title&#xD;
&#xD;
n of Paradise.                51&#xD;
righteous, which may be the source&#xD;
of some mistake. Pray tell me if you&#xD;
know one Abraham Ben Gerson?"&#xD;
"Abraham Ben Gerson I" said the&#xD;
man in reply, with a voice of great&#xD;
surprise, mingled with disdain.&#xD;
"Abraham Ben Gerson! Is it of&#xD;
him, most renowned rabbi, that you&#xD;
speak? Do you want any account&#xD;
of that fellow? Who could possibly&#xD;
give to him the title righteous? Oh,&#xD;
holy rabbi, you can have nothing to&#xD;
do with him! A wretch! He calls&#xD;
himself a Hebrew, but he is worse&#xD;
than a Gentile. He never puts his&#xD;
foot into the synagogue. He eats&#xD;
- horrible to say- flesh prepared by&#xD;
the Christians. It would be better if&#xD;
he were baptized. There would be&#xD;
one hypocrite less."&#xD;
"This my companion in paradise!"&#xD;
said Rabbi Solomon, seized with an&#xD;
indefinable fear. "Companion in par-&#xD;
adise! My God! Have Vbeen, with.&#xD;
out knowing it, a great sinner?&#xD;
Could it be of a companion in hell&#xD;
that the celestial vision spoke?"&#xD;
An icy chill ran through his veins.&#xD;
He was upon the point of despair,&#xD;
when a new thought comforted him.&#xD;
"May not this be a great sinner," he&#xD;
said to himself, "who is destined to&#xD;
become great saint? Oh if the Lord&#xD;
has reserved to me the grace to conduct&#xD;
this wanderer to salvation 1 What&#xD;
glory, what triumph!"&#xD;
Full of this thought and hope, he&#xD;
went in search of the house of Abra-&#xD;
ham Ben Gerson. "Can you tell me&#xD;
where he lives ? "he said to one he&#xD;
net in the way. The man walked&#xD;
with him a short distance, and then&#xD;
pointing with his finger said, "There,&#xD;
~hat is his house."&#xD;
The rabbi looked and wondered.&#xD;
lie beheld before him a vast palace&#xD;
f splendid magnificence, even exter-&#xD;
ially. In a spacious court-yard were&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="52-53" xml:id="VAC8019-00000027"/>&#xD;
52               The C'ompanio&#xD;
sumptuous equipages, which had&#xD;
brought affluent and noble guests.&#xD;
Many servants in rich livery stood in&#xD;
readiness to welcome visitors and&#xD;
friends. As he entered the palace, all&#xD;
the pomp of human grandeur seemed&#xD;
to be before his eyes.&#xD;
Wondering and hesitating, he did&#xD;
not dare to advance. "What display,&#xD;
what splendor, for a son of exiled&#xD;
Israel! What part have I here?&#xD;
How can I b~ welcomed, I a humble&#xD;
teacher, in the midst of all this superb&#xD;
magnificence? Better withdraw than&#xD;
expose myself to the raillery of the&#xD;
proud."&#xD;
But, as he turned to depart, some of&#xD;
the servants who had observed him&#xD;
came forward, and, with the humble&#xD;
and respectful manners with which&#xD;
they served princes, begged him to&#xD;
present himself to their master, and&#xD;
to open his thoughts without hesi-&#xD;
tancy.&#xD;
Rabbi Solomon, re-assured, said that&#xD;
wished to speak to Abraham Ben&#xD;
Lte.. dad upon this he was at once&#xD;
eonducte~ into a large, rich hall, wher~&#xD;
he was told he would have to wait&#xD;
only a moment or two before he would&#xD;
have the desired interview.&#xD;
"My companion in paradise! "he&#xD;
said. "He? Hehashisparadise here&#xD;
in this world. No mortal can enjoy&#xD;
two. No: I will no more think of&#xD;
him as my companion in heaven.&#xD;
At least may he be worthy so vast&#xD;
earthly bliss. I will hope. There is&#xD;
still time. Oh if it might please God&#xD;
to make me an instrument, though so&#xD;
unworthy, of the repentance of this&#xD;
man!"&#xD;
Soon Abraham Ben Gerson entered.&#xD;
He was of high and majestic stat-&#xD;
ure, of a noble and somewhat youth-&#xD;
ful aspect. He came forward with&#xD;
outstretched hand to meet his visitor,&#xD;
and welcomed him with a cordiality so&#xD;
&#xD;
n of Paradise.&#xD;
frank and affectionate that the rabbi&#xD;
was at once charmed.&#xD;
"I repute it a great honor to have&#xD;
you for my guest. Your piety, your&#xD;
learning, your sanctity, are well&#xD;
known to me, and are a precious gem,&#xD;
the like of which I have not in all&#xD;
this pomp that surrounds me. I&#xD;
should be the most happy of men,&#xD;
could Iadd this to the gold and jew-&#xD;
els that here abound. The compas-&#xD;
sion of God is great, and I will not&#xD;
despair of this favor."&#xD;
Rabbi Solomon looked at him with&#xD;
an air of profound surprise, to which&#xD;
these last words a4ded an emotion of&#xD;
tenderness. Uttering a deep sigh,&#xD;
and with eyes brimming with tears,&#xD;
which he tried in vain to suppress,&#xD;
and with a voice full of grief, he at&#xD;
length said, "Then you do not de-&#xD;
spair? You have reason. We should&#xD;
never doubt the divine mercy. It&#xD;
may yet reach you. But, alas!&#xD;
pardon my boldness, - the path you&#xD;
pursue does not conduct to hope, but&#xD;
to desperation. You desire the gem&#xD;
of purity and holiness; but your con-&#xD;
duct, the tenor of your life, your&#xD;
unpardonable freedoms, your auda-&#xD;
cious transgressions ~ -&#xD;
Don Abraham, without the least&#xD;
sign of auger or disturbance, with a&#xD;
gentle and friendly tone of voice, in-&#xD;
terrupted him by saying, "Do you&#xD;
believe, then, that I am on the road&#xD;
to perdition?'~&#xD;
"Alas!" said the rabbi, "my heart&#xD;
is overwhelmed with grief. You are&#xD;
indeed on that road; nor can you pos-&#xD;
sibly be saved without a potent energy&#xD;
of will, without a sincere and thorough&#xD;
repentance, without a radical change&#xD;
of life."&#xD;
"My good rabbi," said Don Abra-&#xD;
ham, smiling, "you inspire me with&#xD;
fear; or rather, let me say it frankly,&#xD;
you think you will inspire it. And&#xD;
&#xD;
The Companion of Paradise.           53&#xD;
&#xD;
yet my conscience is unshaken in ih&#xD;
trust. But tell me, 11 pray yo~i, whal&#xD;
is the true road to heaven ~&#xD;
"There is but one way that leads&#xD;
to heaven," replied the rabbi. "II&#xD;
has been clearly traced by all ow&#xD;
doctors from the beginning, devo.&#xD;
tion, prayer, fast, sacred studies~&#xD;
charity.~~&#xD;
~ interrupted Don Abraham~&#xD;
with a certain decision of tone&#xD;
"No; the way is not one, but many.&#xD;
You, my revered master, mortify&#xD;
yourself with fasts and studies.&#xD;
Your lips utter only prayers and&#xD;
holy words. Your heart has no&#xD;
palpitation for earthly enjoyments.&#xD;
This is ~vell. You are a saint. It is&#xD;
an honest life, even this, and very&#xD;
profitable to you, though less profit-&#xD;
able to others. Your path will un-&#xD;
doubtedly conduct you to heaven.&#xD;
But let us not deceive ourselves.&#xD;
The road to that felicity does not&#xD;
run solely in rigorous rites, in morti-&#xD;
fications of the flesh, in idle prayers.&#xD;
God has opened many ways to bring&#xD;
poor mortals to himself; and perhaps&#xD;
that which I pursue, though it is not&#xD;
yours, may run parallel with yours,&#xD;
and we both meet at the same goal.~~&#xD;
"What horrors ~" thought Rabbi&#xD;
Solomon. "There is no hope of sav-&#xD;
ing this man. And this fellow my&#xD;
companion in paradise! No. It&#xD;
must have been some mocking vision&#xD;
1 had. A malign spirit has deluded&#xD;
mc."&#xD;
At that moment &amp;amp;~ servant entered&#xD;
and said to Don Abraham, "Sir,&#xD;
there is a poor woman without, who&#xD;
earnestly begs to speak with you.~~&#xD;
"Why have you made her wait?"&#xD;
said Abraham. "Adn~it her in-&#xD;
stantly."&#xD;
"Thea he is not proud,~~ thought&#xD;
the rabbi, glad t~ find one good&#xD;
quality in the suon,&#xD;
&#xD;
A woman, poorly dressed, with&#xD;
eyes fulLof tears, entered precipi-&#xD;
tately, and casting herself at the feet&#xD;
of Abraham said in accents of unut-&#xD;
terable grief, "Oh, my lord, save my&#xD;
son!"&#xD;
"Save your son? How? Speak I&#xD;
If gold will do it, my gold is yours."&#xD;
"Then he is charitable," thought&#xD;
the rabbi; "and 'charity saves from&#xD;
death,' saith the wise. But he pro-&#xD;
fanes the sacred rites, treads under&#xD;
foot the prescriptions of the law"-&#xD;
"No," said the woman. "Gold&#xD;
cannot save him. Alas, my only&#xD;
son dies I I cannot survive him.&#xD;
The only comfort of my life! he dies&#xD;
he dies!"&#xD;
"But speak. Explain yourself. Is&#xD;
he sick? What can I do for him?"&#xD;
"Ah, he is sick indeed! He loves&#xD;
to desperation a young woman of&#xD;
a poor family, and they have&#xD;
exchanged their vows, and friends&#xD;
have given their benediction, all&#xD;
but the father; for he, dazzled by&#xD;
the prospect of wealth, has promised&#xD;
her to a rich lord. She is silent, but&#xD;
death is in her soul. My poor son-&#xD;
my God! my God! if you were to&#xD;
see him I In a few days he is so&#xD;
changed that he seems already a&#xD;
corp5e.~~&#xD;
"What is the name of your son?"&#xD;
"Abraham Ben Manuel."&#xD;
"What is the name of the dam-&#xD;
sel 'i'"&#xD;
The woman hesitated to answer,&#xD;
and looked down.&#xD;
"Speak. Tell me freely."&#xD;
"Rebecca Emmanuel."&#xD;
Don Abraham instantly turned&#xD;
pale. He staggered as if unable to&#xD;
support himself. Falling upon' a&#xD;
seat that was near, he covered his&#xD;
eyes with both hands. He remained&#xD;
for some time in a silence which no&#xD;
one dared to interrupt.&#xD;

&#xD;
At length he aroused himself, as&#xD;
if by a strong resolution, and show-&#xD;
ing his face, now lined with tears, he&#xD;
said to the woman, " Leave me for&#xD;
the present. I will not forget your&#xD;
son." .&#xD;
Remaining alone with the rabbi,&#xD;
he said, in a tone of the utmost grief,&#xD;
" This is indeed a great trial which&#xD;
God sends me. Do you know who&#xD;
that Rebecca is ? She was to be my&#xD;
bride."&#xD;
"And do you love her?"&#xD;
"Do I love her ? Who could help&#xD;
loving her? Poor young man! I&#xD;
know well how much to pity you.&#xD;
She is the lily of Jericho, and the&#xD;
rose of Sharon. She is the flower&#xD;
and light of my life. Take her from&#xD;
me, and what is left? Nothing but&#xD;
darkness, desolation, and bitterness of&#xD;
heart. Poor young man, how much&#xD;
I pity you! But we are all unhappy&#xD;
together. Pardon, my good father,&#xD;
my raving and delirium." -&#xD;
"You have need to be alone, and I&#xD;
will leave you."&#xD;
"But will you return? Perhaps -&#xD;
perhaps-I shall have need of your&#xD;
offices. Will you come at once when&#xD;
I call?"&#xD;
The rabbi'promised and departed.&#xD;
&#xD;
After a few days a select corn-&#xD;
pany was gathered in one of the halls&#xD;
of Don Abraham. Every thing&#xD;
breathed perfumes and flowers and&#xD;
joy. It was a marriage. Among&#xD;
the guests was our rabbi. e&#xD;
Don Abraham came in, as pale as&#xD;
death, and gave his hand to a young&#xD;
woman, beautiful as an angel-.&#xD;
"Behold Rebecca," he said with&#xD;
a trembling voice to the company.&#xD;
"Behold the spouse. Signor Rabbi,&#xD;
will you record the nuptial vosn&#xD;
Rabbi Solomon complied. He.&#xD;
asked for the name of the maid.&#xD;
"Rebecca Emaue,       was the&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
"And your name ?" he said to&#xD;
Don Abraham.&#xD;
"Ah! " sighed the unhappy man.&#xD;
"You want the name of the destined&#xD;
husband. It is Abraham Manuel.&#xD;
Record it so. I am here only to offer&#xD;
the nuptial gifts. Write, my good&#xD;
master, and give me your hand; for&#xD;
I leave suddenly, and you will not&#xD;
see me again for some time."&#xD;
The rabbi, overcome with his feel-&#xD;
ings, cast himself io the arms os&#xD;
Don Abraham and wept. "No, noi!&#xD;
I am unworthy," he said, "to have&#xD;
such a companion in paradise."&#xD;

the name of Garbha, - Be, who, having&#xD;
'nmade the pure vase (of Buddhism) to&#xD;
Jhine within and without while he lived,&#xD;
finished the comprehension of' the Mid-&#xD;
dle Doctrine (Madhjamika) of' the true&#xD;
sense (parasmartha), the second Teach-&#xD;
er, before whom I bow myself'. In the&#xD;
hav recited that wonderful cadaton-&#xD;
ishing history of this Master NAgar-&#xD;
nuna and the Prince travelling the&#xD;
happy and good path, which is told&#xD;
with this object, that men may attain&#xD;
supreme perfection by receiving into&#xD;
their hearts, as they need, its chief' con-&#xD;
tents as collocated by the wise, through&#xD;
tradition, hearing and reading of the&#xD;
same. The occasion for the recital be-&#xD;
ing as follows-.&#xD;
THE INTRODUCTION'.&#xD;
In the Middle Kingdom of India&#xD;
dwelt seven brothers, enchanters. At&#xD;
the same time, and a mile off, lived two&#xD;
brothers, princes. The elder arose and&#xD;
went to learn sorcery from the enchant.-&#xD;
er's. But though they had him under&#xD;
their instru stion for seven years, yet&#xD;
taught they him not the key to actual&#xD;
enchantment. On a time the younger&#xD;
brother arose to carry food to his elder&#xD;
brother, and scarcely had he, during&#xD;
thia stolen opportunity, peeped through&#xD;
,a crack in the door, but at once he&#xD;
,found the key ; then, regardless of the&#xD;
food, both brothers returned together&#xD;
to the royal castle.&#xD;
'rhen said the younger broth'er;&#xD;
&#xD;
54A&#xD;
&#xD;
5&#xD;
&#xD;
"The magicians will perhaps discover&#xD;
that we have learned magic; an excellent&#xD;
horse is in our stall; lead him forth by&#xD;
the bridle, but turn not toward the seven&#xD;
sorcerers, but betake thee into another&#xD;
land, sell it there, and bring the pro-.&#xD;
ceeds back."&#xD;
So saying he transformed himself&#xD;
into that horse. But the elder brother&#xD;
did not govern his conduct by the&#xD;
younger brother's words ; for he thought&#xD;
thus: " Although they taught me&#xD;
magic seven years, yet have I not&#xD;
learned it ; my younger brother has&#xD;
found so excellent a horse, why should&#xD;
I not ride." With this he mounted.&#xD;
But scarcely was he in the saddle, when&#xD;
he found himself (in consequence of the&#xD;
usual power of magic, because he had&#xD;
not power to guide the- horse) before&#xD;
the magiians' htore and although he&#xD;
Then the thought occurred to him:&#xD;
"Well then, I will just sell the steed to&#xD;
these enchanters." He asked the en-&#xD;
chanters : " My younger brother has&#xD;
found this excellent horsee; will you&#xD;
examine him ?" The enchanters knew&#xD;
that it was a magic beast, and thought:&#xD;
If' every body learns magic at this rate,&#xD;
we shall lose all our reputation and can&#xD;
excite no more astonishment by our art ;&#xD;
we will take the horse and kill him. To&#xD;
this end they trafficked, paid the price&#xD;
asked, took possession, and bound the&#xD;
horse in a dark stall. But when the&#xD;
time to kill it came, they led it in by&#xD;
the bridle, to shed its blood, while some&#xD;
held it fast by the head and mane,&#xD;
others by the tail, by the thick of the&#xD;
fore leg, and by thme hinderpart, to pre-.&#xD;
vent the possibility of its escape.&#xD;

&#xD;
During this treatment thought the&#xD;
horse: "Ab, my brother could not&#xD;
manage properly, and I am in the hands&#xD;
of these magicians; yet 0, if only some&#xD;
sort of living creature would come&#xD;
along to give me a chance to make my&#xD;
transformation l"&#xD;
Scarcely had the horse so thought,&#xD;
when he saw a fish swim by in the&#xD;
water, and changed himself instantly&#xD;
into it. The seven magicians became&#xD;
seven sea-mews, and when in their pur-&#xD;
suit of the fish they were just about to&#xD;
seize him, he saw a dove fly by in the&#xD;
air and changed himself into it. The&#xD;
magicians became seven hawks, anul&#xD;
pursued the dove over hill and river,&#xD;
and as they neared it, it flew to a shin-&#xD;
ing mountain in the land of Bede in&#xD;
~ south country, into the depths of a&#xD;
eave, which bore the name of "the&#xD;
Peace-giving," and glided down into&#xD;
the lap of the Master N&amp;amp;g~r~una who&#xD;
resided there.&#xD;
The seven hawks came also to the&#xD;
entrance of the cavern and changed&#xD;
themselves into seven men in cotton&#xD;
clothes.&#xD;
Then thought the Master within&#xD;
himself: "What can be the reason&#xD;
for seven hawks pursuing this one&#xD;
dove?" So thinking lie asked the&#xD;
dove: "Why art thou so terribly&#xD;
afraid?"&#xD;
'I~hen told the dove all the above&#xD;
tale, and further said: "Now stand&#xD;
seven men in cotton clothes before thy&#xD;
cave's mouth. These will present them-&#xD;
selves before the Master and ask for the&#xD;
rosary in his band. At that moment I&#xD;
will change myself into the top bead&#xD;
of the rosary; when the Master then&#xD;
reaches out the rosary, let him take&#xD;
the top bead in his mouth and scatter&#xD;
the rosary."&#xD;
So spake the dove. Accordingly ap-&#xD;
peered just then the seven men in cot-&#xD;
ton clothes and seized the rosary. The&#xD;
Master took the topmost bead in his&#xD;
wouth, and scarcely were the beads&#xD;
&#xD;
scattered when they became in arm&#xD;
instant worms, and the seven mcii&#xD;
changed into seven liens and picked up&#xD;
and swallowed the worms. Then tIm:&#xD;
Master let the top bead fall from liii&#xD;
mouth, and there arose a mami tlmerefromim&#xD;
holding a stick in his hand. Scarcely&#xD;
had the man killed die liens than seven&#xD;
human corpses lay upon the tloor. Themi&#xD;
was the heart of the Master sore&#xD;
troubled, and he said: "Whilst I pro-&#xD;
tected thy single life have I thereby&#xD;
caused the lives of these seven to be&#xD;
destroyed. That is in truth a very bad&#xD;
affair."&#xD;
To these words the man replied: "I&#xD;
am the son of a king (Chan). If the&#xD;
Master to save my single life alone has&#xD;
helped to kill these others, so will I, to&#xD;
atone for the sin and show my gratitude&#xD;
to the Master, joyfully undertake and&#xD;
pumictually execute whatever comumis-&#xD;
sion thou shalt give me."&#xD;
Then said the Master: "Now if&#xD;
that be so, Siddhi-ktlr (Death endoweul&#xD;
with supernatural power) is in the hiol-&#xD;
low tree on the place of corpses Qita-&#xD;
vans); from the waist .upwards he is&#xD;
of gold, downward of smaragd, on the&#xD;
head of mother-of-pearl, and provided&#xD;
with a head band ; - so is he made.&#xD;
Thou canst bring him for penance. If&#xD;
thou art able to accomplish it, I could&#xD;
indeed through him obtain gold; men&#xD;
could attain from 'Gambu-dvlpa a thou-&#xD;
sand-year term of life and the highest&#xD;
wonderful perfection."&#xD;
Of this requisition then the prince&#xD;
gave such a promise, and inquired&#xD;
further: "Be pleased t~ give me the&#xD;
road which I must travel, the way and&#xD;
manner I must behave, and to compre-&#xD;
hend all food and what else is needful&#xD;
I will follow thy instruction."&#xD;
Then spake the Master: "Now&#xD;
then, when thou hast gone a mile from&#xD;
this, there is, at a mountain stream in&#xD;
an uncommonly dark, woody, fearful&#xD;
ravine, a crowd of very great dead&#xD;
people. So soon as thou hast reached&#xD;
&#xD;
them, they will arise and approach thee.&#xD;
Call to them: 'All ye great dead,&#xD;
hala, bela sv~hft I' and scatter among&#xD;
them these barleycorns consecrated&#xD;
with magical words. Further on, thou&#xD;
shalt find a multitude of little dead men.&#xD;
When thou hast cried to them, '0&#xD;
all ye little dead, hulu, hulu sv&amp;amp;h&amp;amp; I'&#xD;
make them also a scatter-offering&#xD;
Again beyond these are a troop of dead&#xD;
in the form of children. Make to&#xD;
these an offering, with the address: 'ye&#xD;
dead in child-forms, nra phad I' Out of&#xD;
their midst Siddhi-K~r will issue, will&#xD;
clamber up a mango-tree and will seat&#xD;
himself on the top of it. If thou wilt&#xD;
with this axe, which is named White&#xD;
Moon, pretend angrily to attack the foot&#xD;
of the tree, lie will descend. Then stick&#xD;
him into this many-colored sack, in which&#xD;
there is room for a hundred, tie it with&#xD;
this many colored-cord of a thousand&#xD;
threads, eat from this butter-cake, which&#xD;
will not be exhausted by consumption,&#xD;
take the Death upon thy back, travel&#xD;
away with him, without letting a single&#xD;
word escape thee, and return hither.&#xD;
Thy name is Prince. Since thou hast&#xD;
succeeded in reaching the Peace-secur-&#xD;
ing rock-grotto thou shalt be called the&#xD;
King that travels the fortunate good&#xD;
path."&#xD;
When he had bestowed on him this&#xD;
name, he showed him the way and let&#xD;
him go upon his wanderings. When the&#xD;
Price had overcome all its horrors and&#xD;
the Siddhi-Ktir came in sight, he set&#xD;
himself to its pursuit, but it had&#xD;
clambered up the mango-tree. ~om-&#xD;
ing up to the foot of the tree he&#xD;
shouted: "My master is Nag&amp;amp;r~una&#xD;
Garbha; my axe is called White Moon;&#xD;
my provender is inexhaustible butter-&#xD;
cake; my servant a fancy-colored sack&#xD;
with a hundred places in it; my rope&#xD;
is a cord of a hundred colored twist;&#xD;
I myself am the King on the fortunate&#xD;
good path. Death! descend, or I will&#xD;
hew down thy tree."&#xD;
To these words the Siddhi-Kiir re-&#xD;
&#xD;
plied: "Hew the tree not down; I&#xD;
will descend ;" and the King put him&#xD;
into his sack, fastened it with the cord,&#xD;
ate of his butter-cake, put him on his&#xD;
back, and journeyed so with him many&#xD;
days.&#xD;
At last Siddhi-Kdr spake: "As the&#xD;
day is long it will be tedious to us;&#xD;
either tell me a story, or I will narrate&#xD;
one." But the Prince journeyed in&#xD;
silence on. Then Siddhi-Kdr began&#xD;
anew: "If thou wilt narrate, shake&#xD;
thy head; if on the contrary thou wilt&#xD;
say to me, narrate thou I give me to&#xD;
understand that also with a nod of the&#xD;
bacl~ of your head." Without replying&#xD;
a word, the King gave the sign with&#xD;
his head, that meant that he was free to&#xD;
do what he pleased. So Siddhi-Kdr&#xD;
began the following story: -&#xD;
THE STORY.&#xD;
In very early times, in a great&#xD;
kingdom lived a rich man's son, a physi-&#xD;
cian's son, an artist's son, a mathema-&#xD;
tician's son, a carpenter's son, and a&#xD;
blacksmith's son, and all these six leib&#xD;
their parents for a distant land, with&#xD;
provisions for the journey. When they&#xD;
reached a place where the mouths o~&#xD;
several rivers came together, they&#xD;
planted there each one his life-tree; and&#xD;
since each was to seek his fortune by&#xD;
ascending a different branch of the&#xD;
river, they appointed this spot as a rezi-&#xD;
dezvous where they should again find&#xD;
one another. Should any one of us,&#xD;
said they, fail to return, and his life-tree&#xD;
be withered, or anything of that sort&#xD;
happen, the rest of us will seek for,&#xD;
him in the direction which he took.&#xD;
Now after the rich man's son had&#xD;
travelled up a river, he reached at its&#xD;
fountain head, where a wood and mead-&#xD;
ow joined, a little hut, and enterca by&#xD;
the door. Here lived an aged man with&#xD;
his grey-headed wife, who asked him: -&#xD;
"Young man, whence comes thou?&#xD;
and whither wilt thou go?"&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
A Tartar Faiq,' Thie lz~teraIe~y tran8lated.&#xD;
&#xD;
The young man answered: "I have&#xD;
come from afar, to seek my fortune."&#xD;
The two old folks said: "Now under&#xD;
these circumstances thy coming is good;&#xD;
we have a charming, wonderfully beauti-&#xD;
ful daughter, of noble form and lovely&#xD;
nature ; - take her and be our son."&#xD;
With these words the daughter ap-&#xD;
peared, and scarcely had theyoung man&#xD;
seen her when he thought within him-&#xD;
self; "Since I have left father and&#xD;
mother, my coming hither has happened&#xD;
well; this is far more wonderful and&#xD;
charming than the daughters of the&#xD;
heaven-gods. I will take her and settle&#xD;
here." But the maiden said, "0 youth,&#xD;
it is very good?'&#xD;
And after that they had asked and&#xD;
narrated many things to and fro, they&#xD;
entered the home and lived in love and&#xD;
happiness.&#xD;
Over that country ruled a mighty&#xD;
king. One day in the early spring, his&#xD;
courtiers betook themselves to the&#xD;
water-side to ei~joy their sport, anil found&#xD;
a ring floating in the ~vater, which be-&#xD;
longed to the wife of the rich young&#xD;
man who dwelt at the head of the riv-&#xD;
er, and set with various jewels. This&#xD;
wonderful object they captured and&#xD;
took to the king, who spake to his ser-&#xD;
vants in astonishment: "At the head&#xD;
of this river surely lives a woman, who&#xD;
wore this ring; bring her hither to&#xD;
me."&#xD;
With this commission he sent his&#xD;
servants off. They went, and when they&#xD;
had seen the woman, they said to them-&#xD;
selves in wonder: "This woman is really&#xD;
so beautiful that one can never look at&#xD;
her enough;" but to her they said, "The&#xD;
king has called thee to go to him," and&#xD;
they took her with the rich young man,&#xD;
and brought her to the king, who when&#xD;
he saw her said: "This is truly a&#xD;
laughter of the gods; my other wives&#xD;
are hounds and swine compared with&#xD;
her." Thus he spake, and gave this&#xD;
woman by far the preference. But she&#xD;
thought in her heart only and alone of&#xD;
&#xD;
the rich young man. lint she was in&#xD;
the power of the king. When the king&#xD;
rcmark~d it, he said to his servants:&#xD;
'Get this rich young man out of the&#xD;
way.' So the servants did as they&#xD;
were bid; invited the yonng man to a&#xD;
game, selected a place on the bank of&#xD;
the river, buried him there, and cov-&#xD;
ered him with a mighty rock ; - and&#xD;
so they killed him.&#xD;
Now, when at the appointed time his&#xD;
companions found themselves all togeth-&#xD;
er again, returned from various direc-&#xD;
tions to the spot where the life-trees&#xD;
stood a~ their rendezvous1 and the rich&#xD;
young man had not appeare(l, they saw&#xD;
at once that his life-tree had withered.&#xD;
Then they could not rest in their hearts,&#xD;
and sought for him along the river, up&#xD;
which he had travelled, but they found&#xD;
him uot~ Now when the matliemati-&#xD;
chin's son had made his calculation ho&#xD;
deduced therefrom that the rich man's&#xD;
son lay dead at such atar such a 'ha-&#xD;
tance, covered with a ereat rook. Al..&#xD;
though after a search they found this&#xD;
rock, their strength did not avail to lift&#xD;
it off. Since they knew no other&#xD;
means,'the blacksmith's son took a ham-&#xD;
mer and broke the rock to pieces; and&#xD;
when they had dug, the dead man caine&#xD;
to ligltt. The doctor's son mixed a&#xD;
healing drink good against death, and&#xD;
when he had poured it into his mouth&#xD;
he was whole again, without any hurt&#xD;
whatever.&#xD;
With conversation and questioning&#xD;
from all sides: "Under what circum-&#xD;
stances didat thou die?" and when lie&#xD;
had told them all his history, his com-&#xD;
panions said: "If it is such a charm-&#xD;
ing woman she must indeed be wonder-&#xD;
ful. Yet now by what means shall we&#xD;
snatch her from the king? "-so spake&#xD;
they with one another. Then the car-&#xD;
penter's son prepared a Garuda out of&#xD;
wood. If one mounting into it knock-&#xD;
ed upwards then it nscended~ if ono&#xD;
knocked downwards, then it descend-&#xD;
ed; if one knocked sideways then it&#xD;
&#xD;
turned sideways, - such a magic bird&#xD;
lie made. But the painter's son streaked&#xD;
it with all kinds of colors, aiid gave it&#xD;
thereby a very fair appearance. The&#xD;
rich young man entered it then, and ris-&#xD;
ing into the air flew away. Floating&#xD;
above the royal residence he stoppeti,&#xD;
circling it round. When the king and&#xD;
his followers saw it, they spake aston-&#xD;
ished to each other: "Such a bird we&#xD;
have hitherto never seen, nor even heard&#xD;
of." And telling the news to the prin-&#xD;
cess the king said to her, "Ascend to&#xD;
the roof of the palace and reach the&#xD;
bird all sorts of food."&#xD;
The wife ascended the palace with&#xD;
provisions, and while sIte tarried there,&#xD;
the bird came down to her. They met&#xD;
at the door of the wooden Garuda.&#xD;
The woman, rejoicing in her heart, said,&#xD;
"To meet thee never once came into&#xD;
my imagination, and yet this has hap-&#xD;
peiied. How hast thou accomplished&#xD;
this bird iii such deceptive guise ?"&#xD;
After the young man had circum-&#xD;
stantially related to her the adventure,&#xD;
he spake thus: "Now thou livest in-&#xD;
deed as the king's wife; but if we&#xD;
wish to uiiite ourselves both in love as&#xD;
man and wife, enter this wooden Gar-&#xD;
uda, and we will fly through the air,&#xD;
and no especial harm shall threaten us."&#xD;
The woman answered: "I also re-&#xD;
joice to be united again with thee; of&#xD;
all the husbands I have ever had thou&#xD;
hast for me the highest value."&#xD;
With these words she entered the&#xD;
wooden Garuda and flew away through&#xD;
the air. When the king and his fol-&#xD;
lowers became aware of this, he said:&#xD;
"Alas, in return for sending my wife&#xD;
to feed this charming bird, he has now&#xD;
carried her away through the air;" and&#xD;
casting himself on the ground, and&#xD;
rolling about, he gave himself up to his&#xD;
chagrin.&#xD;
Now struck the rich young man the&#xD;
spring of the wooden Garuda in the&#xD;
direction downwards, and alighted near&#xD;
bis companions. At first he stepped&#xD;
&#xD;
out alone. His companions said! "Is&#xD;
thine affair cared for?"&#xD;
"My affair is excellently well eared&#xD;
for," he replied, and he let his wife&#xD;
then out. At sight of her, his compan-&#xD;
ions kindled with ardent desires in&#xD;
their hearts for her (for she was charm-&#xD;
ingly beautiful). Then said the rich&#xD;
young man: "Ye my companions have&#xD;
assisted me, a dead man, called me hack&#xD;
to life, and invented a method for regain-&#xD;
ing this my wife; now I will pay you&#xD;
my thanks; rob me not of her."&#xD;
In spite of this the mathematician's&#xD;
son arose and said: "Since no man knew&#xD;
whether or not thou wert in life, it was&#xD;
only after hearing my calculation, re-&#xD;
lying on it that they got the wife ; -&#xD;
give her then to me."&#xD;
But the blacksmith's son opposed&#xD;
him saying: "If thot~ didst accomplish&#xD;
this by thy calculation, who could have&#xD;
got him from under. Thou didst get&#xD;
thy wife again because I broke the&#xD;
rock to pieces and got thee out ; - the&#xD;
womaii is mine.&#xD;
Against him the doctor's son main-&#xD;
tamed: "Although thou didst deliver&#xD;
the dead man by breakiiig the rock in&#xD;
pieces, how could the corpse g~ fetch&#xD;
the woman? Therefore because I&#xD;
brought the dead to life again by mcdi-&#xD;
chic, thou hast got her from the ground.&#xD;
I take the woman."&#xD;
The carpenter's son said: "Verily&#xD;
thou didst call to life; but without the&#xD;
wooden Garuda, how could ye have&#xD;
reached the woman? Ye were in no&#xD;
condition to overcome the king. Since&#xD;
no man is allowed to penetrate the pal-&#xD;
ace, to get the woman was an impos-&#xD;
sibility. By my wooden Garuda was&#xD;
she won. The woman is decidedly&#xD;
mine.&#xD;
The painter's son opposed this: "The&#xD;
queen would never have gone up to&#xD;
feed thy dried-wood manufactured Oar-&#xD;
uda. The woman has been recovered&#xD;
only because a beautiful aspect was&#xD;
given itby the handling of my various&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="60-61" xml:id="VAC8019-00000031"/>&#xD;
60                     T4e Queen&#xD;
colors. To keep the woman is my&#xD;
due."&#xD;
Thus they strove together, and could&#xD;
come to no agreement.&#xD;
"Now then," said they, "if it he so,&#xD;
we will all take her;" and with shouts&#xD;
of" Slash! Slash I " they each cut away&#xD;
a piece of her with his knife; and so&#xD;
they killed the woman.&#xD;
At these words the King exclaimed:&#xD;
&#xD;
and Eli~~or~&#xD;
"Ah, the poor thing! The pitiable&#xD;
lady!"&#xD;
Then autwered the Siddhi-Kfir:&#xD;
"Playing away his luck the king has&#xD;
let his words escape," and with the&#xD;
shout of "It is not good to remain in&#xD;
the world I" he freed himself, and flew&#xD;
hastily away.&#xD;
This is the first chapter from the&#xD;
story-telling of the Siddhi-K~r: "How&#xD;
iL went with the rich man's son."&#xD;
&#xD;
SPOONS IN A WHERRY.&#xD;
BY MARK SIBLEY SEvERANcE.&#xD;
&#xD;
I.&#xD;
WATER, and a wherry. In the&#xD;
wherry a woman. In fact, in the&#xD;
wherry a young woman. Or, as Nor-&#xD;
ris would say, "A gentlewoman, and,&#xD;
to add to thy wonder, a young gentle-&#xD;
woman."&#xD;
But who?&#xD;
Shall I tell you? Ani how? Shall&#xD;
I trace her ancestry from farthest&#xD;
Norse progenitor, like genealogical&#xD;
Thackeray, down through semi-rural&#xD;
Englishman, slashing Ronadhead, and&#xD;
emigrating Pilgrim, to this fairest&#xD;
daughter of the line, drifting yonder&#xD;
in her wherry, while the ~vcst wind&#xD;
makes music under its bows with&#xD;
gentle ripples?&#xD;
Or shall Iwith pre-Raphaclite Judd,&#xD;
throw a phantasmagoric halo about&#xD;
her, and usher in Victoria the queen,&#xD;
and Maloney the scrub, her of the&#xD;
almond eyes and her of the Cannibal&#xD;
Islands, each in her patois claiming&#xD;
the maiden, and each exhibiting the&#xD;
touch of nature that "makes the&#xD;
whole world kin"?&#xD;
Neither; for has she not chosen&#xD;
to seat herself in a wherry? And&#xD;
does not that restrict her to easily-&#xD;
recognized nationality? She is&#xD;
neither squat Esquimnaux maid,&#xD;
training for the kyak-somersault, the&#xD;
aztimrna cun~ laude of hyperborean&#xD;
&#xD;
sports, nor Indian beauty, gliding,&#xD;
noiseless as the voice of dreams, in&#xD;
her birch though Colambian waters;&#xD;
but thee most charming of Caucasians,&#xD;
lithe as the one, tireless as either,&#xD;
resting at present from a rapid spin&#xD;
up the winding river, her lips parted,&#xD;
and her whole form exhilarated by&#xD;
her race with an imaginary compet-&#xD;
itor.&#xD;
What matter, then, who was her&#xD;
grandmother to the fiftieth: remove,&#xD;
when we have the substantial beauty&#xD;
of the radiant granddaughter?&#xD;
No~v she takes her sculls again,&#xD;
and with a fe~v po~verful strokes, in&#xD;
strict 'Varsity form, drives her wherry&#xD;
through a narrow entrance into a&#xD;
small lagoon, ~vhite with water-lilies,&#xD;
startling a log-full of demure turtles&#xD;
from their senatorial slumbers; they&#xD;
give an awakening stare at the bold&#xD;
intruder, and roll off to moister quar-&#xD;
ters below, to continue their session&#xD;
on the water-rates.&#xD;
Who, then, is the bold intruder?&#xD;
Miss Midsummer, a half-year resi-&#xD;
dent at Riverbank, wt. 19+, whole-&#xD;
souled, whole-hearted, bro~vn-eyed,&#xD;
low-voiced; ~vith a form like Hebe's;&#xD;
no, better then: that, such as Hebe&#xD;
might have, after a m~nthi's gentle&#xD;
wherry-training for some Olympiui~&#xD;
regatta. A child of natures and yet&#xD;
&#xD;
Sp)oon8 in7&#xD;
&#xD;
not a child of nature; for that sug-&#xD;
gests mawkishness and verdancy;&#xD;
still, although town-bred herself, yet&#xD;
fi~rthest removed from what the last-&#xD;
century song calls&#xD;
The city lass&#xD;
With wainscot face."&#xD;
Dame Nature, kindliest of colonists,&#xD;
had indeed wainscoted her face, but&#xD;
with far different cosmetics from those&#xD;
on the toilet-table of the "city lass."&#xD;
"health," Hebe's sister, had stood&#xD;
godmother over her at birth, and&#xD;
~vatched her ever since. She led her&#xD;
out into the fields, and Nature kissed&#xD;
approval on her cheek. She pointed&#xD;
to the wildest horses and the most&#xD;
dangerous boats, and told her to ride&#xD;
and to row. And she galloped and&#xD;
rowed and swam, and was an Arab&#xD;
in endurance. The same sun that&#xD;
bronzed the Arab in the desert put&#xD;
the richest of browns on her check,&#xD;
but still the ruddy Caucasian Health&#xD;
glowed through it all, and said with&#xD;
a smile, "She is my daughter." But&#xD;
why catalogue her virtues? Is not&#xD;
all said, or implied, ~vhea ~ve find her&#xD;
in a wherry? Did ever young wo-&#xD;
man enter one who had not pluck&#xD;
and self-reliance aud independence?&#xD;
To these add beautiful muscles and&#xD;
nerves of steel, a wit keen though&#xD;
seldom displayed, and a manner&#xD;
marked with just enough of hauteur&#xD;
to repel familiarity, and withal a&#xD;
Spartan hatred of flirtation, and you&#xD;
have Miss Midsummer in a nutshell,&#xD;
- or a wherry. For see, she is just&#xD;
selling out from the lagoon with&#xD;
easy stroke; she has wreathed the&#xD;
~vash-hoards of the wherry with trail-&#xD;
ing feathery clematis, and oh! sight&#xD;
for a Brabmin, a single water-lily,&#xD;
~vhite as her own bosom, hangs over&#xD;
the middle of her forehead, like the&#xD;
Lotus on the brow of a Hindoo god-&#xD;
des~.&#xD;
&#xD;
a  Wherry.                    61&#xD;
II.&#xD;
PRESENTLY as she rounds jitto the&#xD;
open river, a doable scull, and in it a&#xD;
couple of sophomores from the neigh.&#xD;
boring university, who are passing&#xD;
the summer in Riverhank.&#xD;
What a sophomore does not know&#xD;
about rowing is hardly worth know-&#xD;
ing. He takes to it as naturally as&#xD;
a freshman to the rank-list, a junior&#xD;
to his ease, and a senior to his rOle&#xD;
of "heavy dignity." To do our&#xD;
friends justice, these two young oars-&#xD;
men, as they rose and fell in regular&#xD;
rhythm, driving their boat on with&#xD;
an even course which was the perfec..&#xD;
tion of motion, seemed far from tyros&#xD;
at the oar, and brought up, as I&#xD;
watched them from the bank, memo-&#xD;
ries, both happy and sad, of early&#xD;
Winnipiseogee, with its first inter-&#xD;
collegiate race and its brave crew, of&#xD;
whom hardly a member remains&#xD;
above the sod.&#xD;
They are abreast of the lagoon, as&#xD;
the Hindoo goddess comes forth, like&#xD;
the tutelary deity of the stream,&#xD;
from the inner shrine.&#xD;
"By jove! what a stunner! ~&#xD;
comes from the double-scull; and the&#xD;
training injunction, "Eyes in the&#xD;
boat," receives a liberal construction,&#xD;
by being referred to another boat&#xD;
than thEir own. They have rowed&#xD;
up and down the navigable length of&#xD;
the river for a week (ever since tak-&#xD;
ing quarters at the farm-house yon-&#xD;
der); they have pulled into all the&#xD;
seductive nooks, explored all the in-&#xD;
flowing streams to the uttermost,&#xD;
plunged into all the cool bathing-&#xD;
pools, and met never a soul but&#xD;
parties of pudgy rustics pulling a&#xD;
barbarous stroke which outraged&#xD;
their msthetie canons, or indulging in&#xD;
demonstrative and wholesale "spark-&#xD;
ing" by moonlight which shocked&#xD;
them still more; these, and the inev-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="62-63" xml:id="VAC8019-00000032"/>&#xD;
62                   Spoons in&#xD;
itable youth bobbing for eels, moored&#xD;
in the same spot daily, as though he&#xD;
had sent down roots and become fast&#xD;
like a lily-pad, were the only signs&#xD;
of nautical humanity that they had&#xD;
discovered; and just as they are be-&#xD;
ginning to vote Riverbank a "bore,"&#xD;
out glides this fair and mysterious&#xD;
naiad, purity crowning her brow, and&#xD;
grace in every movement of her&#xD;
body.&#xD;
This swarm of reflections has&#xD;
rushed through their minds at once,&#xD;
elbowving and waking up other little&#xD;
associated ideas, their eyes all the&#xD;
time telegraphing up new facts, until&#xD;
their brains become bee-hives of buzz-&#xD;
ing wonder, admiration, expectation,&#xD;
mystery, doubt, -- when -~ "Good&#xD;
heavens, Bob; I've caught a crab!"&#xD;
Bob did not need to be told of the&#xD;
fact, my dear young friend: are not&#xD;
a hundred and fifty pounds of avoir-&#xD;
dupois falling -on the frail bottom of&#xD;
a wherry only equally heavy, suf-&#xD;
-ficient, without this ex post facto an-&#xD;
nouncement ?&#xD;
" Up, man, and right the boat be-&#xD;
fore she sees us."&#xD;
And indeed they do so, and are set-&#xD;
tling into their steady swing again,&#xD;
when another " Good heavens! hit&#xD;
her up !" -an academic nautical&#xD;
phrase, gentle reader, of exhortation&#xD;
to the crew, is muttered under&#xD;
breath; and they bend their straight&#xD;
backs to their work, as they see-&#xD;
can it be possible? ?-the clematis-&#xD;
wreathed wherry creeping up closer&#xD;
and closer fo them, evidently trying&#xD;
to overhaul them. The Cosarean&#xD;
spirit of the sophomores prevails over&#xD;
the ordinary gallantry of the acade-&#xD;
micians, and they smother their curi-&#xD;
osity in their desire to be "head of&#xD;
ghe river." A year later, they will&#xD;
tscorn with indignation the unchival-&#xD;
ric imputation of having raced with&#xD;
&#xD;
a Wherry.&#xD;
a woman; and wve shall find them,&#xD;
under similar circumstances, allowing&#xD;
themselves to be beaten with naive&#xD;
equanimity, and afterwards bound&#xD;
wherry to wherry, conqueror and&#xD;
conquered, mayhap, with the self-&#xD;
same wreaths of clematis, oblivious&#xD;
of the world.&#xD;
So they give themselves to their&#xD;
stroke, reaching well beyond the toes,&#xD;
and lifting the bow almost clear of&#xD;
the water; while their astonishment&#xD;
changes to dismay, to see clearer and&#xD;
clearer the delicate spray of the&#xD;
clematis, and nearer and nearer the&#xD;
firm profile, lily-crowned, as she&#xD;
turns now and then to note the&#xD;
course.&#xD;
What a disgrace the old university&#xD;
might have incurred that day, if /&#xD;
their boat-house, happy sight!i had '&#xD;
not come to their relief above the '&#xD;
next bend, 'twvere fearful to think on !&#xD;
They barely escaped a " bump " from&#xD;
the on-coming wherry, as they&#xD;
turned in to their house, looking&#xD;
back with wide-eyed wonder and in-&#xD;
finit'e relief at the marvellous stroke -&#xD;
of their weird antagonist, as she&#xD;
sped up the river. Bob vowed that&#xD;
he detected something very like a *&#xD;
smile on her face, and worse than&#xD;
that, a satirical smile, as she bent&#xD;
one look on them in passing; but&#xD;
she was gone so suddenly, and they&#xD;
felt so little like smiling themselves,&#xD;
that they did not stop to argue the&#xD;
point, but stepped out upon their&#xD;
landing with slightly spavined knees&#xD;
and whitish lips. It was only after&#xD;
lifting their boat upon its stays with&#xD;
quivering bicipites, that they found&#xD;
voice to utter the usual expletives,&#xD;
and discuss this unexpected break in -&#xD;
the monotony of Riverbank life. ,&#xD;
This discussion outlasted the process&#xD;
of dressing and the after-cigar, and&#xD;
broke out afresh in their walk across&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
fields to their "den." But after&#xD;
every theory had been discussed, and&#xD;
every classical parallel suggested,&#xD;
they were forced to be content with&#xD;
their original verdict, that whether&#xD;
woman or goddess, ponderable flesh&#xD;
and blood or phantom Lady of the&#xD;
Mist, she was certainly a"sunr"&#xD;
as she had proved herself to them in&#xD;
more than hyperbole.&#xD;
III'&#xD;
.OF THE sOPHIOMOREs.&#xD;
Bon had been an exemplary fresh-&#xD;
man: he had been put to bed with-&#xD;
out a murmur or a pound of resist-&#xD;
ance by Ku-klux sophomores, had&#xD;
never missed a morning prayer, and&#xD;
had scored high up the eighty-per-&#xD;
cents in the rank-list. He had&#xD;
.caught the boating fever in the first&#xD;
term of the sophomore year, and&#xD;
had been favorably reported by Sharp-&#xD;
eye, the "' bowv" bf the 'Varsity,&#xD;
for a place in the six of the next&#xD;
summer. But not even possible bays&#xD;
of glory at Quinsigamond, nor shad-&#xD;
owvy sunmmu cums, could keep him at&#xD;
his winter work, either in study or at&#xD;
the rowing-weights. He fell off in&#xD;
muscle and in rank, but went steadily&#xD;
up in the scale of dancing men. The&#xD;
mighty trophies of his saltatory pow-&#xD;
wvows were hung about his room, as&#xD;
priceless spolia opima; a cherry rib-&#xD;
bon about the neck of his Venus de&#xD;
Mile, party-colored rosettes on his&#xD;
broken cricket-bat Ihung up on the&#xD;
wall to the god of sports, a circle of,&#xD;
flashing stars against his black man-&#xD;
tle, with a mass of tiny bells on his&#xD;
stag-horns over the door, that clinked&#xD;
a silvery welcome to every in-comner.&#xD;
"Germans," and what the sanguinary&#xD;
Irreverent dub "tea-fights," were his&#xD;
ruin; and at the end of first term,&#xD;
wye find him rusticated for six months&#xD;
to Riverbank, where he is now busy&#xD;
&#xD;
Spoons in a Wherry.                63&#xD;
&#xD;
"cramming " for the fall examina-&#xD;
tions, not daring to trust himself in&#xD;
July. His chum Alfred, a slight,&#xD;
wiry youth of twenty, ranking ten&#xD;
in his class, had generously offered&#xD;
himself as "coach " during the sum-&#xD;
mer recess ; and was most thankfully&#xD;
accepted, of course.&#xD;
On yonder hill-side, a furlong from&#xD;
the river, they had a " den " in a&#xD;
cosey red farm-house, where they&#xD;
battened on such toothsome viands&#xD;
as Puckle's Conic Sections, grew&#xD;
plethoric on "Birds and Frogs," and&#xD;
such-like ancient game, and drank in&#xD;
copious Chem. Phys. for a post-pran-&#xD;
dial cordial.&#xD;
To this "den " they returned after&#xD;
their river adventure. But how can&#xD;
be told the changed spirit that came&#xD;
over their rooms and themselves I&#xD;
How Puckle was thrown out at open&#xD;
window, and Aristophanes became,&#xD;
like ancient Commodus,' a " foot-ball&#xD;
of fortune !" How the faithful coach,&#xD;
still attempting his tasks, drew from&#xD;
his absent-witted pupil the astound-&#xD;
ing announcement that the fourth&#xD;
foot of an Aristophanean verse was&#xD;
a truncated prism, and that the prim-&#xD;
itive form of the Athenian galley&#xD;
was the trochaic tetrameter catalec-&#xD;
tic ! Until patience was worn thread-&#xD;
bare, and "coach" and pupil threw&#xD;
aside their books with a decisive,&#xD;
"N{o use!1 Digging's out of the&#xD;
question, till we find out who she is."&#xD;
A difficult matter ? By no means.&#xD;
Two gentlemanly young fellows, and&#xD;
not half a mile off a wide porched&#xD;
country-house, with hospitable Mr.&#xD;
and Mrs. Midsummer, and nautical&#xD;
Miss Midsummer. What easier ?&#xD;
What more natural ? A very uniin-&#xD;
tended stroll country-houseward, a&#xD;
very casual rencontre in the fields&#xD;
with Mr. Midsummer pire, a few&#xD;
civil interchanges, - "Harvard Col-&#xD;

lege? Oh! -my wife and daughter,&#xD;
gentlemen,~~ - and the Gordian knot&#xD;
is cut. You think, perhaps, that&#xD;
another knot is to be tied before we&#xD;
leave them? We shall see.&#xD;
Iv.&#xD;
Manly youth and maidenly beauty&#xD;
and a summer life together, - what&#xD;
are the natural results? Look across&#xD;
your tea-cups, Mrs. Cozee, at the sub-&#xD;
stantial trophy of your last summer&#xD;
at Conway, crunching buttered toast&#xD;
behind "The Evening Transcript," -&#xD;
the aggravating fellow! Or open&#xD;
your green box, Miss Megrim, and&#xD;
take out a dead wild-flower, "covered&#xD;
with dust like the quince," a half of&#xD;
a neck-tie, and the handle of a rid-&#xD;
ing-whip, mayhap, which have lain&#xD;
there these fifteen years.&#xD;
But no; there was no such serious&#xD;
work at Riverbank yet. The rosy&#xD;
little god ha~ not yet popped in upon&#xD;
the scene. At first it was a tea, at&#xD;
which the wherry adventure was ap-&#xD;
plauded by papa, reprobated by ma-&#xD;
dame, and laughed over by the young&#xD;
people. Then it was a call or two,&#xD;
with the chronic college-songs from&#xD;
the callers, and the last "Strauss"&#xD;
from the young entertainer. Then&#xD;
came walks and drives and rides and&#xD;
rows, until the whole country round-&#xD;
about was threaded with a net-work&#xD;
of romantic memories. Of course,&#xD;
they galloped through "Lover's&#xD;
Lane," - what suburb in Christen-&#xD;
dom Jim not its "Lover's Lane ~&#xD;
* Of course, they drifted many a&#xD;
dreamy afternoon on the river, in&#xD;
sweetest far niente, - no racing now.&#xD;
"Let's drift ~ exclaimed&#xD;
Alfred one evening, as the moon&#xD;
came up over I'iny Point, and they&#xD;
floated on a stream of liquid silver,&#xD;
Miss Midsummer sitting with chin&#xD;
on hand, gazing eastward. Of&#xD;
&#xD;
a Wherry.&#xD;
course, they read "The Lotus-Eators"&#xD;
at the waterfall, with hippy allusions&#xD;
to&#xD;
"Slow-dropping veils of thinnest lawn,"&#xD;
and unspoken convictions in the&#xD;
minds of the young men that the&#xD;
Lotus-eaters were about right, after&#xD;
all, if their island bore any resem-&#xD;
blance to Riverbank.&#xD;
Gradually the little god began to&#xD;
pop his head out from behind the&#xD;
scenes: at first only to smile a&#xD;
wicked little smile at the tableaux&#xD;
and the thickening plot; then to&#xD;
let fly an arrow or two; until at last&#xD;
he was rushing about in his "veiling&#xD;
~ on the very stage, dealing&#xD;
wounds to right and left, marring the&#xD;
entr'-acte, turning romance into non-&#xD;
sense by a well-directed shaft, and&#xD;
setting the triumvirate by the ears&#xD;
most wofully.&#xD;
The athletic Bob was the first to be&#xD;
hit (boating-men ar.e always the first&#xD;
married of a class); but Alfred was of&#xD;
too sympathetic a nature to listen&#xD;
long unmoved to his chum's ardent&#xD;
admirittion, even if he were the&#xD;
Stoic to resist the first cause herself.&#xD;
Bob's exclamation-points, and a stray&#xD;
dart or two at his own heart, brought&#xD;
him down too; so that soon, by a&#xD;
sort of assimilation, they arrived at&#xD;
a condition of utter slavery to Miss&#xD;
Midsummer, - moody without her,&#xD;
lackadaisical in her presence, abjectly&#xD;
sub mellifluo imperio, as Fortescue&#xD;
has it, -which was the one thing&#xD;
above all others to disgust and enrage&#xD;
healthy Miss Midsummer.&#xD;
It is a psychological fact, that,&#xD;
given two impressible and persistent&#xD;
youths and a single inamorata, we&#xD;
are sure to have, in due time, either&#xD;
three firm friends, or two remarkably&#xD;
brilliant "spoons" and a much dis-&#xD;
gusted, if sensible, young woman.&#xD;
Indeed, matters were rapidly tending,&#xD;
&#xD;
Spoon i~l a Wherry.             65&#xD;
&#xD;
if not already come, to this latter&#xD;
issue. The nearer they approached&#xD;
it, the oftener the collegians noticed&#xD;
a strange smile on Miss Midsummer's&#xD;
face, which they could neither inter-&#xD;
pret nor forget; as when the three&#xD;
sitting on a breezy knoll, under a&#xD;
canopy of oak-trees, Miss Midsummer&#xD;
weaving a chaplet of leaves on Bob's&#xD;
hat, and the young men watching&#xD;
her, with fingers in the books that&#xD;
they had lirought to read, Bob felt&#xD;
a murtherous little dart planted&#xD;
plump in his heart, causing him to&#xD;
utter a sudden "Oh ~&#xD;
"What's the matter, Mr. Ray-&#xD;
~&#xD;
"Oh, I was thinking, how beau-&#xD;
tiful I"&#xD;
"It isn't finished yet; I want you&#xD;
to find me a spike of cardinal flower&#xD;
for a pompon in front."&#xD;
"I wasn't thinking of the hat," he&#xD;
returned with a sigh.&#xD;
Miss Midsummer looked at him&#xD;
a moment in a silent, abstracted&#xD;
way peculiar to her, handed him his&#xD;
hat, and led the way without a word&#xD;
to the wherries, tied at the bank be-&#xD;
neath them.&#xD;
Many repetitions of such scenes, of&#xD;
which Miss Midsummer had an&#xD;
almost morbid loathing, if any thing&#xD;
about her could be said to be morbid,&#xD;
drove her to desperation, and she was&#xD;
at her wits' end to devise some escape&#xD;
from such nauseating attentions; and&#xD;
when at last Alfred the erudite,&#xD;
drawing on his extensive reading&#xD;
at the University, quoted something&#xD;
from the Gulistan, she didn't kno~v&#xD;
nor care to know what that was,&#xD;
about "the incurvated back of the&#xD;
sky" becoming "straight (with joy)&#xD;
at thy birth," - which he meant for&#xD;
a compliment I - her patience re-&#xD;
ceived its last straw, and she vowed&#xD;
that she would not let the sun go&#xD;
&#xD;
down on her perplexity, but would&#xD;
find deliverance, even if at the price&#xD;
of politeness.&#xD;
Which vow led to the more sub.&#xD;
stantial oath of the next chapter.&#xD;
Stopping in the middle of a song&#xD;
that evening, she astonished a young&#xD;
man leaning on either end of the&#xD;
piano, like misplaced caryatides, by&#xD;
the following speech, as oratorical as&#xD;
it was unexpected from her: -&#xD;
"Come, my gallant cavaliers; these&#xD;
attentions are becoming smothering&#xD;
in the extreme. I have been pelted&#xD;
with compliments and bon-mots as&#xD;
you pelt aprima donna with bouquets&#xD;
in winter, you toilsome, over-worked&#xD;
students, for aye 'in shady cloister&#xD;
mewed I' I'm sure, I ought to feel&#xD;
very much flattered; but for variety,&#xD;
I propose a wherry-race, for the&#xD;
championship of the river; and I&#xD;
promise you, ~pon honor, as you say,&#xD;
that the winner shall be sole dictator&#xD;
over my valuable affection&amp;amp;~for a&#xD;
twelve-month, - I'd say longer, but I&#xD;
think that's about as long as any one&#xD;
would be able to endure it. What do&#xD;
you say? I think it's about time for&#xD;
a little healthy excitement; and in-&#xD;
stead of entering the lists and tilting&#xD;
at each other, a~ you might have&#xD;
been ready to do for me half a dozen&#xD;
centuries ago, we shall have a less&#xD;
bloody but equally exciting joust&#xD;
with the oars; and I'm sure I shall&#xD;
be delighted, if I shall be the means&#xD;
of putting you into good 'form' for&#xD;
next year's work; for I feel that you&#xD;
must be dreadfully demoralized, if I&#xD;
may judge from my own feelings, by&#xD;
the lazy life that we've been leading&#xD;
for the last month."&#xD;
This was delivered with a well-&#xD;
assumed gravity, which disarmed the&#xD;
suspicions raised by the novelty of&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="66-67" xml:id="VAC8019-00000034"/>&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
Spoons in a Wherry.&#xD;
&#xD;
the proposal in the minds of the youig&#xD;
men ; and, to say truth, they were&#xD;
not themselves so soft-brained as not&#xD;
to be thankful for a breeze from some&#xD;
other quarter than the Lotus Isles,-&#xD;
whence languid airs had been blowing&#xD;
for many a day. ~&#xD;
" Are you joking ?" .&#xD;
"By no means," she said; and see-&#xD;
ing the young men eying each other's&#xD;
figures, as though to weigh the&#xD;
chances of a race, she feared for her&#xD;
plan, and raised her right hand as if&#xD;
preparing for a judicial oath. Alfred,&#xD;
the future lawgiver, interpreting this&#xD;
correctly, ordered Bob to follow suit,&#xD;
and, raising his own hand, with mock&#xD;
gravity propounded the following&#xD;
Burmese '&#xD;
OATH.&#xD;
This solemn uplifting of hands&#xD;
witnesseth, that, owing to sundry and&#xD;
divers causes not herein specified, a&#xD;
race for the championship is to be&#xD;
rowed on the Meander River, on" -&#xD;
"What day shall it be?"&#xD;
"Let's see. What do you say to&#xD;
a ,veek from Saturday ?"&#xD;
"Saturday it is."&#xD;
-"on Saturday, the - 25th inst.;&#xD;
starting opposite the stone boat-house,&#xD;
thence down stream, rounding the&#xD;
island known as Wolf Island " -&#xD;
" How's that ?"&#xD;
" Capital ! couldn't be better."&#xD;
- "and returning to the starting-&#xD;
point. The winning of said race to&#xD;
reside with the person rowing over the&#xD;
whole course, as herein described, and&#xD;
arriving first at the starting-point,&#xD;
and to entitle said winner to 'the&#xD;
head of the river,' so nautically called,&#xD;
and to the sole right, title, and inter-&#xD;
est for a twelvemonth in the affec-&#xD;
tions of one Midsummer, summer&#xD;
resident at Riverbank, spinster, beauti-&#xD;
ful as"-&#xD;
"You wretch ! proceed!"&#xD;
&#xD;
- "and all persons laying, or pra&#xD;
suming to lay, claim to said affections,&#xD;
saving only the winner as above de-&#xD;
scribed, shall immediately thereafter&#xD;
'vamose the ranche ' and leave said&#xD;
winner an open field, or river, in the&#xD;
full and undisturbed enjoyment of&#xD;
said affections'aforesaid. Wind and .&#xD;
weather permitting. So help me,5&#xD;
gracious I" ,&#xD;
"Well done, my learned Grotius!&#xD;
And now, remember your oath and&#xD;
the inestimable prize."&#xD;
Saying which, she excused herself&#xD;
on the plea of going to her mother,&#xD;
who was confined to her room, but in&#xD;
reality to rush to the billiard-room,&#xD;
prance wildly about it, seize an In-&#xD;
dian club and whirl it desperately&#xD;
about her head, make astonishing&#xD;
lunges with cues at an imaginary foe,&#xD;
and indulge in other excited actions,&#xD;
all the while breaking into extrava-&#xD;
gant laughter as though something&#xD;
had been engineered with peculiar&#xD;
adroitness.&#xD;
The young men left, considerably&#xD;
mystified, and not exactly sure wheth-&#xD;
er they were being quizzed or not-.&#xD;
But they were oath-bound now, and&#xD;
really what harm could there be in a&#xD;
race, whether it decided any thing or&#xD;
not ? After being invited so charm-&#xD;
ingly, in so mysterious a manner too,&#xD;
how could they retreat ?&#xD;
So they ordered up their single&#xD;
sculls from Cambridge, and went into&#xD;
a moderately severe course of train-&#xD;
ing. They alarmed their, landlady&#xD;
by their increase of appetite, and all&#xD;
Riverbank, gazing from the shore, by&#xD;
their diminution of rowing-shirt; in-&#xD;
deed, at the University, success at the&#xD;
oar seems to be in inverse ratio to size&#xD;
of boating-shirt.&#xD;
They saw less of Miss Midsummer.&#xD;
They were more frequently met with&#xD;
a "Not at home " when they called,&#xD;
&#xD;
67&#xD;
&#xD;
Spoons in a Wherry.&#xD;
&#xD;
and puzzled by that peculiar smile,&#xD;
now more sphinx-like than ever,&#xD;
when they found her in. She was&#xD;
continually quizzing them about their&#xD;
oath, and begging them to be partic-&#xD;
ularly careful to remember its phra-&#xD;
seology. " Oh, yes," they said ;&#xD;
" we remember it!" and they tried&#xD;
to look very wise, but felt very un-&#xD;
comfortable. They rarely met her&#xD;
in her wherry now, but came across&#xD;
her path once, as she was hurrying&#xD;
home through the fields, looking very&#xD;
much excited and trying to avoid&#xD;
them; but when they came up with&#xD;
her, she explained that she had been&#xD;
down to arrange something in her&#xD;
boat-house, and had heated herself&#xD;
hurrying home to dinner.&#xD;
They were becoming brown and&#xD;
burned, as the day of the race came&#xD;
on; and they noticed that she, too,&#xD;
was very much bronzed, more than&#xD;
. usual; but she said that she was de-&#xD;
voting herself* to her flower- gzen;&#xD;
"which has become fearfulI yover-&#xD;
grown with weeds since you've been&#xD;
here,"~ she added, with a pointed ear-&#xD;
nestness, at the recollection of which&#xD;
she laughed outright, after they had&#xD;
left, - good deal for her to say,&#xD;
and more than enough to launch them&#xD;
upon a fresh rhapsody on their way&#xD;
home.&#xD;
VI.&#xD;
SThe day of the race came. Every&#xD;
suspicion that had hatched in the&#xD;
brains of the young men had received&#xD;
its quietus from Miss Midsummer&#xD;
as soon as brought before her; but&#xD;
still they ate their oatmeal on Satur-&#xD;
day morning with the firm conviction&#xD;
that the day's sport was to have an&#xD;
episode ; what, or to whose discomfit-&#xD;
,ure, neither could imagine.&#xD;
Miss Midsummer had suggested to&#xD;
them the propriety of allowing a pri-&#xD;
vate announcement of the race in&#xD;
&#xD;
Riverbank, and of permitting her&#xD;
father to put up a silver cup as a&#xD;
prize, which she said he had been anx&#xD;
ious to do so soon as he heard that&#xD;
they were to row. They sniffed dan-&#xD;
ger in this proposal at once, and&#xD;
thought they saw through her plot.&#xD;
It was all very well, they thought, to&#xD;
have a quiet race by themselves, and&#xD;
even an episode or two, if Miss Mid-&#xD;
-summer desired, provided they were&#xD;
the only spectators: but this crowd&#xD;
and this cup, - what sudden traps&#xD;
might not be sprung under cover of&#xD;
them! The river swarmed, to their&#xD;
imaginations, with a riotous rabble,&#xD;
each individual rioter fired with&#xD;
intensest "town-gnd-gown" frenzy,,&#xD;
and each brandishing a prohibitory&#xD;
bludgeon atthem defenceless. The air&#xD;
glittered with a shadowy legion of&#xD;
silver cups, fair without, but treach-&#xD;
erous, subtly armed with Medicean&#xD;
poison within, mayhap. But again&#xD;
their suspicions were allayed, and&#xD;
Riverbank and cup were on hand,&#xD;
open-mouthed for the excitement of&#xD;
the day.&#xD;
The sun came up with a grin on&#xD;
his round face, as though he knew&#xD;
what fun was afloat, or to float. He&#xD;
winked at some clouds down in the&#xD;
east, and said to them, "Come up&#xD;
with me, and see the sport ;" but the&#xD;
delicate creatures were frightened at&#xD;
his familiarity, and vanished from&#xD;
sight at his very look. So he climbed&#xD;
up alone and secured a high place,&#xD;
with a clear view of the entire course.&#xD;
He saw all Riverbank embark for the&#xD;
race and wet feet; every boat that&#xD;
would float pressed into service, from&#xD;
puits long ago discarded as hope-&#xD;
lessly waterlogged, to the gorgeous&#xD;
barge " Cleopatra," filled with city-&#xD;
folk from the hotel. Rustic swains,&#xD;
effulgent with red flannel, pt-opelled&#xD;
sturdily hither and thither their&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="68-69" xml:id="VAC8019-00000035"/>&#xD;
08                     Spoons in&#xD;
blushing sweethearts, while the&#xD;
double-scull of our friends was&#xD;
manned by a couple of classmates,&#xD;
lured hither by rumors of the race,&#xD;
and at present monopolizing the coy&#xD;
glances which should have been the&#xD;
rustic swains'. Juvenile Riverbank&#xD;
"shinned " the tallest trees on shore,&#xD;
squeezed itself into the best places in&#xD;
the boats, and fell overboard at con-&#xD;
venient points, but was fished up,&#xD;
moist, but alive,- too much alive,.&#xD;
The sun looked down and saw this&#xD;
motley crowd separate into two irreg-&#xD;
ular lines on the sides of the river,&#xD;
and two narrow wherries, "like water-&#xD;
snakes," glide up and lie side by side&#xD;
in front of the stone boat-house. Hie&#xD;
saw a portly gentleman in a punt&#xD;
(Miss Midsummer's uncle) take a&#xD;
huge watch from his fob and glance&#xD;
at it, which was too good a chance&#xD;
to lose; so he popped a reflected sun-&#xD;
beam straight into the old fellow's&#xD;
eye. The judge rubbed his eye,&#xD;
and from behind his red bandana,&#xD;
while doing so, announced, " Two&#xD;
minutes to three, young gentlemen; ~&#xD;
which the sun overheard, and re-&#xD;
turned, "Correct, old party, to a sec-&#xD;
ond !" Then the judicial voice in&#xD;
apoplectic tones inquired, " Are you&#xD;
ready ?" and after five seconds&#xD;
shouted ineffectually, in broken treble,&#xD;
"Go" I,&#xD;
Off they -went, the two wherries,&#xD;
amid shouts of "Ki-i!1" from the&#xD;
small boys, and cheers from the rest.&#xD;
" La ! how strong they must be !&#xD;
See how they've bent them oars!"&#xD;
exclaimed a country girl, standing in&#xD;
a boat, and collapses into her lover's&#xD;
lap, as an excited youth collides vio-&#xD;
lently with them amidships. And if&#xD;
any one had been watching the sun,&#xD;
he would have seen him laughing&#xD;
until tears rolled down his cheeks;&#xD;
causing, by the way, quite a summer&#xD;
&#xD;
a Wherry.&#xD;
shower down in the tropics, where&#xD;
they fell; but at what? Surely not&#xD;
at this country girl's falling into her ,&#xD;
lover's lap ; for that can hardly be a&#xD;
novel sight to him, although he does&#xD;
keep such early hours. ,&#xD;
But look! Here is what has kept&#xD;
him dancing in the sky all day!I&#xD;
Here is the sport to which he invited&#xD;
the cloudlings ! Here comes the epi.-&#xD;

taken a dozen plunges, before the&#xD;

Bob harpoons with his wherry a whale&#xD;
imported for the occasion ? By no&#xD;
means; but - a third wherry comes&#xD;
sweeping by the boat-house, past the&#xD;
wheezy judge, past the boy hung out&#xD;
to dry, past the " Cleopatra," down&#xD;
through the gap left for the racers.&#xD;
How beautiful the stroke ! How&#xD;
measured the rhythm! Surely we&#xD;
have seen this stroke before ! The&#xD;
crowd looks on, silent with admnira--&#xD;
tion; only one enraptured youth ven-&#xD;
tures an explosive "Golly !" as she&#xD;
disappears around the bend of the&#xD;
river. But admiration for her art is&#xD;
the only sentiment that they feel;&#xD;
it is no novelty to most of them to&#xD;
see Miss Midsummer pulling in&#xD;
her wherry, and they have not the&#xD;
vaguest idea of connecting her with&#xD;
this-race, -what matter to her, if two&#xD;
young students choose to row a race&#xD;
at Riverbank ? And so they imagine&#xD;
that she is out to see the race, like&#xD;
themselves, but, more inquisitive, is&#xD;
pulling below the headland for a bet.-&#xD;
ter view; and Galatea goes on pelt-&#xD;
ing Damotas with apples, in true bu-&#xD;

The racers have been too busy with&#xD;
each other to notice her until they&#xD;
are rounding the headland, which&#xD;
conceals the rest of the course from&#xD;

Glorious Miss Midsummer! How&#xD;
her resolute face glows with excite-&#xD;

covered in water, out and in without&#xD;
a drop of spray! Heavens, how she&#xD;
"recovers"! With what a spring&#xD;
she rises to each stroke, until her oars&#xD;
seem never in the air!&#xD;
The sun is right; she may be trust-&#xD;
ed. He has~not watched over her for&#xD;
nineteen odd years in vain, nor given&#xD;
her "nerves like his own sunbeams"&#xD;
to no purpose. Now comes the re-&#xD;
ward of years of divine health; how&#xD;
she revels in it! She is Hebe!&#xD;
Inch by inch, again they separate;&#xD;
but this time it is Hebe who leads.&#xD;
How Bob despises himself! How the&#xD;
last winter's life comes up before him!&#xD;
How the wraiths of all the "Ger-&#xD;

mocking him: "Ab, my fine fellow!&#xD;
you were facileprinceps by gas-light;&#xD;
but what are you in the light of the&#xD;
sun?" And from high in the air&#xD;
comes an orbicular little laugh, sliding&#xD;
on a sunbeam, and striking the water&#xD;
with a derisive "That's so!"&#xD;
Miss Midsummer is drawing rapidly&#xD;
away from him. As she does so, she&#xD;
smiles to herself, for the first time,&#xD;
and begins repeating to Bob, between&#xD;
her strokes, "'And all persons - lay-&#xD;
ing - or presuming to lay - claim&#xD;
- to said affections - saving only&#xD;
- the winner - as above described ~&#xD;
(and this she repeated with empha-&#xD;
sis) -"'the winne~' - as above de-&#xD;
scri bed -shall immediately -there-&#xD;
after"' (altering the slang) -" 'go&#xD;
back- to - Camin-idge I"&#xD;
&#xD;
a Wherry.&#xD;
No wonder Bob's oars dropped&#xD;
motionless, as the last word came&#xD;
over, his shoulder and popped into&#xD;
his ear. No wonder he wished him-&#xD;
self bodily in the place to which he&#xD;
was ordered by his oath.&#xD;
For the oath now comes back to&#xD;
him with its full force, for the first&#xD;
time, strangely enough, since the race&#xD;
began; and he sees too distinctly the&#xD;
double plot in which they are caught.&#xD;
They had reasoned thus, before the&#xD;
race: "Here we are, in for a race;&#xD;
we'll go in and see what turns up.&#xD;
Miss M. assures us that' the cup and&#xD;
the crowd are all right and the race&#xD;
is to be square. We'll have some&#xD;
sport, at least, and after it see what&#xD;
she means to do about her valuable&#xD;
affections." Then, in the race, seeing&#xD;
her pursuing them, -" Ah, yes! this&#xD;
is it. She's gotten us into the race&#xD;
by that absurd oath, which was a&#xD;
mere blind; she has hoodwinked us&#xD;
by her mysterious references to its&#xD;
phraseology, and it is only a decoy&#xD;
duck, after all; while here ~s her real&#xD;
game, to carry off the cup and huzzas&#xD;
of the crowd. Very well schemed,&#xD;
yoimg lady; but we'll see about it!"&#xD;
With this reasoning, they had dis-&#xD;
missed all thought of the oath,&#xD;
thought that they saw the whole plot,&#xD;
and resolved of course that the cup&#xD;
and huzzas should be theirs.&#xD;
They had never dreamed of her&#xD;
being Machiavelli enough to include&#xD;
herself in th9 oath, though her hand&#xD;
was up with theirs; and through all&#xD;
the struggle up to this point, they&#xD;
had supposed themselves contending&#xD;
for the cup and the empty honors of a&#xD;
cheer. But now that the oath is&#xD;
brought back to their minds so point-&#xD;
edly, with so evident a hint, and they&#xD;
see that there, after all, is the real&#xD;
plot, and not only that, but that they&#xD;
are caught in it, they are beside&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
Spoonful U&#xD;
themselves. They are not so foolish&#xD;
as not to interpret the phraseology,&#xD;
now that it is thrown in their teeth&#xD;
in this way. They see that there is&#xD;
nothing in it to exclude Miss Mid-&#xD;
summer (" as~ above described");&#xD;
why didn't they think of that before?&#xD;
Tle~ remember the prize mentioned&#xD;
in the oath, and they see that she is&#xD;
to be dictator over her own affections!&#xD;
The idea of thinking that she was&#xD;
rowing for a mere cup! They re-&#xD;
member too well the condition of de-&#xD;
feat, and they are bright enough to&#xD;
take a hint when it is shouted at them&#xD;
in italics.&#xD;
But how to get out of their entan-&#xD;
glement? Bob and Alfred consult a&#xD;
half minute, Miss Midsummer rowing&#xD;
on..................&#xD;
Miss Midsummer appears to the&#xD;
crowd above the point rowing lei-&#xD;
surely, fresh from her inquisitive look-&#xD;
out; she hugs the western shore&#xD;
(happy shore!), leaving a clear place&#xD;
for the racers, and telling her friends,&#xD;
"They're coming. It's a very close&#xD;
race; almost neck and neck!"&#xD;
She rows to the stone boat-house.&#xD;
The wherries come in aigl~t, round&#xD;
the point, lapping each other, and&#xD;
presenting, to all but Miss Midsum-&#xD;
&#xD;
t a Wherry.                   71&#xD;
mer, the appearance of a most des-&#xD;
perate struggle. The cr~wd cheers,&#xD;
swains grow savage at the admiration&#xD;
diverted from themselves, and juve-&#xD;
nile Riverbank throws its cap into&#xD;
the water with excitement. They&#xD;
pass the perplexed judge so nearly&#xD;
abreast #hat his decision costs him&#xD;
several pounds of cerebral phosphorus&#xD;
and a tremor of apoplexy; while the&#xD;
sun laughs "Ho-ho I"&#xD;
The judge, however, recovered his&#xD;
wits sufficiently to discharge a heavily-&#xD;
ballasted oration at the young men,&#xD;
in presenting the cup, alluding in&#xD;
feeling terms to the glory of the an-&#xD;
cient University and the prowess of&#xD;
her nautical sons, "who could outstrip&#xD;
even swift Atlanta in her course."&#xD;
Whether the judge was in his niece's&#xD;
confidence, they never knew; but&#xD;
they feared.&#xD;
The crowd which had gathered to&#xD;
hear a classical speech of thanks&#xD;
from Bob turned on its heel disap-&#xD;
pointed, as he received the cup with&#xD;
a simple, "Thanks, very much!" and&#xD;
paddled off with Alfred to their boat-&#xD;

WAYELINE, THE LITTLE MERMAID.&#xD;
A STORY FOR ChILDREN.&#xD;
BY ANNIE MOORE.&#xD;
How cross she was, and how she played truant.&#xD;
Also what befell her.&#xD;
&#xD;
Oxos there was a little mermaid,&#xD;
and her name was Waveline.&#xD;
She had beautiful yellow eyes like&#xD;
the amber, and long, flowing hair, of&#xD;
a lovely green.&#xD;
She had a kind father and mother,&#xD;
Mr. and Mrs. Deepwater, who did&#xD;
all they could for her happiness.&#xD;
She had a pleasant little grotto, all&#xD;
for herself, and a soft, comfortable&#xD;
bed of sea-moss.&#xD;
She had a very nice comb, made of&#xD;
a shark's jaw and teeth, and a mirror&#xD;
cut from a polished shell.&#xD;
And she could sit all day upon the&#xD;
rocks, and comb her long hair, and&#xD;
sing most charmingly.&#xD;
She had pets, -a cat-fish, and a&#xD;
faithful dog-fish who delighted to&#xD;
follow her about, and who would have&#xD;
saved her life any time, if she had&#xD;
given him an opportunity.&#xD;
She had a necklace of pearl, and&#xD;
a necklace of lovely pink coral.&#xD;
What more could she have asked,&#xD;
if she had been a princess? and yet&#xD;
her father was only a well-to-do mer-&#xD;
man.&#xD;
But, notwithstanding all these ad-&#xD;
vantages, this little mermaid was&#xD;
discontented. "My patience!" said&#xD;
she one morning, pushing away her&#xD;
plate and a shell of nice bread and&#xD;
milk in disgust, "what a disagree-&#xD;
able breakfast!"&#xD;
"Hush! hush! Wavy, my dear,"&#xD;
said her father: "the least said&#xD;
about your patience the better."&#xD;
"I can't help it," said she.&#xD;
"There's water in this milk, I know;&#xD;
&#xD;
for it tastes so salt; and these clams&#xD;
are as clammy as they can be."&#xD;
"You are mistaken about the&#xD;
milk, my darling," said her mother;&#xD;
"there's no water in it. I attended&#xD;
to it myself, this morning. It's&#xD;
very good for sea-cow's milk; and, as&#xD;
to the clams, you know your father&#xD;
prefers them clammy."&#xD;
"I should think I might have an&#xD;
eel, then," said Wavy.&#xD;
Mrs. Deepwater turned pale as the&#xD;
sea-foam. Mr. Deepwater dropped&#xD;
his fork in horror; and his hair stood&#xD;
on end, as much as such wet hair&#xD;
could.&#xD;
~ said he, "how can&#xD;
you say so, after what we promised&#xD;
the sea-serpent?"&#xD;
At this, Waveline began to cry,&#xD;
and pushed back her chair, and left&#xD;
the room, only stopping on her way to&#xD;
the door to say "Scat!" in rather a&#xD;
fierce voice.&#xD;
She said it to an affectionate cat-&#xD;
fish and two dear frisky little kitten-&#xD;
fishes, that wanted to play with her;&#xD;
and they were so frightened, that they&#xD;
bid away, and didn't show their little&#xD;
noses again that day.&#xD;
"What is the matter with the child,&#xD;
and what shall we do with her?"&#xD;
said her mother.&#xD;
"Send her to school, I should say,"&#xD;
said Mr. Deepwater. "I saw a school&#xD;
of porpoises yesterday, when I went&#xD;
up. They looked as happy and as fat&#xD;
as possible. They were learning to&#xD;
jump out of water; all in classes,&#xD;
the best scholar at the head."&#xD;
&#xD;
f&#xD;
&#xD;
Waveline, The Little Mermaid.            '78&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am afraid the sun would be too&#xD;
hot for her up there," said Mrs. Deep-&#xD;
water.&#xD;
"No trouble about that, my dear,"&#xD;
said Mr. Deepwater: "she'll be per-&#xD;
fectly safe with a fresh sun-fish on&#xD;
her head; and th~ knowledge she'll&#xD;
gain may be useful to her.&#xD;
"If the sea-serpent should forget&#xD;
his part of the bargain, and come on&#xD;
the rampage again, she could dodge&#xD;
him by jumping out of water, and&#xD;
coming down behind him."&#xD;
"As you think best," said Mrs.&#xD;
Deepwater; "but how can we per-&#xD;
suade her to go?"&#xD;
"Leave that to me, my dear~~~ said&#xD;
Mr. Deepwater.&#xD;
Now, Mr. Deepwater was at the&#xD;
head of a large Meerschaum Factory.&#xD;
It was a harassing business.&#xD;
To be sure, the white of egg for the&#xD;
sea-foam was all beaten by machin-&#xD;
ery, but then there were the eggs&#xD;
to be collected; and sea-birds will&#xD;
steal their nests in such rocky and&#xD;
dangerous places.&#xD;
Besides, in order to do much in the&#xD;
factory, there must be a good stirring&#xD;
wind from the " nor'ard and eastward ~&#xD;
so they lost a great many days.&#xD;
But, notwithstanding he was so&#xD;
busy, Mr. Deepwater took time to at-&#xD;
tend to the matter of the school; and&#xD;
fortunately Waveline favored the plan&#xD;
instead of op~ksing it.&#xD;
So, one bright morning, she put a&#xD;
delicate rose-colored sun-fish on her&#xD;
head, and tied it neatly under her chin&#xD;
with a knot of fresh seaweed, - for&#xD;
she knew it was becoming, -bade&#xD;
her mother good-by, and swam along&#xD;
by her father's side to the school&#xD;
in a very amiable mood.&#xD;
The schoolmaster was a middle-&#xD;
aged merman, a friend of her father's.&#xD;
lie was one of those who are "born&#xD;
to command;" and, when persons of&#xD;
&#xD;
that kind meet with those who are&#xD;
"born to be commanded," all goes&#xD;
merry as a diving-bell. Otherwise, not.&#xD;
But he was admirably fitted for a&#xD;
school-teacher. lie could hardly be&#xD;
with you a minute without telling&#xD;
you some better way to light your&#xD;
pipe, or arrange your hair.&#xD;
The schoolmaster received his new&#xD;
pupil very kindly, and put her in the&#xD;
middle class. There were three class-&#xD;
es in his school. She would have&#xD;
preferred the highest; but- that was&#xD;
unreasonable, as she had never been&#xD;
at school before.&#xD;
The young mermaids were learning&#xD;
to jump out of water; also to tell&#xD;
the points of the compass, the signs&#xD;
of the weather, and which way the&#xD;
wind blew; and to polish shells, and&#xD;
write on the sand, besides other&#xD;
accomplishments.&#xD;
In most ot these studies, she was&#xD;
behind the rest, -jumping out of the&#xD;
water, for example. She had never&#xD;
practiced that.&#xD;
But she knew all about the wind,&#xD;
it was so connected with her father's&#xD;
business; and she knew how to write&#xD;
on the sand, for she had often helped&#xD;
her father with his accounts.&#xD;
She took the first prize in that&#xD;
branch immediately, - a fan made of&#xD;
the wing of a flying-fish.&#xD;
This pleased her, and made her&#xD;
father and mother very proud.&#xD;
For a while, all went on quite swim-&#xD;
mingly; but by and by, wh~en the nov-&#xD;
elty began to 'wear off a little, it be-&#xD;
came rather a task to go to school:&#xD;
and at last -sad to tell! - this little&#xD;
mermaid played truant.&#xD;
Now, Mr. Deepwater disliked steal-&#xD;
ing, and telling fibs, and all such&#xD;
things, of course; but, if there was&#xD;
one thing he disliked more than an-&#xD;
other, it was playing truant.&#xD;
So he was obliged to have a serious&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="74-75" xml:id="VAC8019-00000038"/>&#xD;
74              Waveline, The.&#xD;
talk with his daughter, the result of&#xD;
which was, that she ivent back to&#xD;
school, but was extremely cross for&#xD;
several days; and thea she ra:j away&#xD;
again.&#xD;
Now comes the sad part of the&#xD;
story.&#xD;
She ran away again; that is, she&#xD;
swanr away, at recess, very fast, and&#xD;
very far, lest they should overtake her,&#xD;
and bring her back.&#xD;
When she thought she was far&#xD;
away enough to be safe, she seated&#xD;
herself on a rock, took her comb out&#xD;
of her pocket, and arranged her hair&#xD;
in the most be~vitohing manner,&#xD;
singing at the same time a lovely song,&#xD;
and thinking how much pleasnater it&#xD;
was to be free, in the open sea, than&#xD;
to be even at the head of the longest&#xD;
class, in the largest school that was&#xD;
ever heard of.&#xD;
Alas I unfortunate young mer-&#xD;
maid!&#xD;
The evening sky was bright and&#xD;
rosy. The waves played a light run-&#xD;
ning accompaniment to her song, as&#xD;
they broke upon the shore. The&#xD;
echoes joined in the chorus; and all&#xD;
was peaceful apparently.&#xD;
But she little knew that she had&#xD;
strayed into the dominion of her&#xD;
father's enemy, the sea-serpent, and&#xD;
that, attracted by her sweet song, he&#xD;
was even now waiting round the cor-&#xD;
ner, chuckling to himself at the&#xD;
thought that he would carry her away&#xD;
in a few minutes, when he was ready,&#xD;
to sing for him.&#xD;
He was ready as soon as she had&#xD;
finished her song.&#xD;
She heard a splash; and, at the&#xD;
same moment, he took a double turn&#xD;
round her waist, and swam off with&#xD;
her, at the rate of I don't know&#xD;
how many knots an hour, before she&#xD;
had time to think, or even to wink.&#xD;
She had always been remarkably&#xD;
&#xD;
Little .Afermaid.&#xD;
brave; but of course she was startled,&#xD;
to say the least.&#xD;
You would have been, I am sure,&#xD;
to have a sea-serpent suddenly tied&#xD;
in a knot round your waist, and to&#xD;
find yourself rushing througls the&#xD;
water at such a rate.&#xD;
However, she didn't mind the&#xD;
water, it was only time sea-serpent.&#xD;
Her first thought was, - for she&#xD;
was somewhat familiar with such&#xD;
matters, -" What kind of a knot is&#xD;
it? If it is a granny knot, all is&#xD;
well; I can slip away. If not, not."&#xD;
Her second thought ~vas, "I ~vish&#xD;
I had a little more school-learning,&#xD;
so that I could dodge him, as father&#xD;
said, by jumping out of the water,&#xD;
and coming down behind him."&#xD;
But she could not "dodge him;"&#xD;
and it was not a granny, but a&#xD;
square knot.&#xD;
The serpent was wiser than she&#xD;
thought.&#xD;
There was nothing for it but to&#xD;
await the result.&#xD;
It was unpleasant. She was never&#xD;
so situated before but that by mak-&#xD;
ing what might be called a touse, she&#xD;
could have her own way.&#xD;
This was a new experience. What&#xD;
would her mother say, if she could&#xD;
see her?&#xD;
What would her father say, if Ito&#xD;
could see her?&#xD;
She knew what the schoolmaster&#xD;
would say.&#xD;
He would say, "I could have told&#xD;
you so. You had better have taken&#xD;
my advice, and attended to your&#xD;
studies."&#xD;
But, as I said before, there was&#xD;
nothing to be done but to await the&#xD;
result; and the result was, she sud-&#xD;
denly found herself in a large cave,&#xD;
brilliantly lighted, and with a nice&#xD;
supper of fried eels, waiting to be&#xD;
eaten.&#xD;
&#xD;
Waveline, The&#xD;
~ the reason we can't have&#xD;
eels," thought she; 'the selfish fel-&#xD;
low wants them all himself!" And&#xD;
she was right. He did.&#xD;
As soon as they entered the cave,&#xD;
the sea-serj)ent clasped a magnificent&#xD;
aquamarine l)racelet on her arm.&#xD;
She ~vas (lazzled for a moment.&#xD;
She had not expected such kindness.&#xD;
But in the next moment she saw&#xD;
that the guar(l-chain was unusually&#xD;
long and strong, and that the other&#xD;
end of it was fiis~tened to the wall.&#xD;
In short, she was a prisoner. How-&#xD;
ever, cross though she was, and&#xD;
truant though site was, she had one&#xD;
good quality, something derived,&#xD;
perhaps, from her native shores.&#xD;
That ~vas, "grit."&#xD;
So she did not cry, or "take on,"&#xD;
so to speak.&#xD;
But she still awaited tIme m~esult.&#xD;
She was to have a good supper of&#xD;
eels, at all events, if she could find&#xD;
an appetite; for the sea-serpent had&#xD;
called his housekeeper, an elderly,&#xD;
many-handed cuttle-fish, and given&#xD;
her orders to put on another plate.&#xD;
Waveline could not understand&#xD;
their language; but "actions speak&#xD;
louder than words." She saw the&#xD;
plate, napkin, &amp;amp;c., prepared for her.&#xD;
The eels were savory. The sea-&#xD;
serpent was apparently' an epicure.&#xD;
After supper, she was left to her-&#xD;
self, the idea being, evidently, that&#xD;
she needed rest. I say left to her-&#xD;
self; the cuttle-fish sat in the cor-&#xD;
ner, wide awake and vigilant.&#xD;
This experience was bringing out&#xD;
Waveline's character.&#xD;
Instead of distressing herself in any&#xD;
way, she thought, "Here's a comfort-&#xD;
able sofa. This chain is so long and&#xD;
light that I never should notice it if&#xD;
I shut my eyes."&#xD;
So she shut her eyes, and didn't&#xD;
open them again till daylight; when&#xD;
&#xD;
Little Mermaid.                7b&#xD;
she awoke refreshed, and saw the cut-&#xD;
tIe-fish preparing breakfast.&#xD;
On the principle that "many hands&#xD;
make light work," this housekeeper&#xD;
was admirably fitted for her position.&#xD;
Now daylight had come, Waveline&#xD;
knew that she must have her wits&#xD;
about her, and not lose an opportunity&#xD;
of making her escape.&#xD;
They had eels for breakfast, fresh&#xD;
an(l sweet.&#xD;
After breakfast, the sea-serpent&#xD;
came in, and said something that she&#xD;
could not understand, because she was&#xD;
not familiar with his language; but&#xD;
seeing she did not understand, he&#xD;
made a rough attempt at a song,&#xD;
something like this: -&#xD;
~:~4r~ Then she knew&#xD;
that he wanted her&#xD;
Mi, Sol." to sing.&#xD;
That was just what she was not&#xD;
disposed to do. She always felt a&#xD;
little "stuffy," as we may say, in the&#xD;
morning, so she ignored his request.&#xD;
Luckily he was called away on&#xD;
business, and did not come back un-&#xD;
til dinner-time.&#xD;
They had eels for dinner crisp&#xD;
and delicious: Waveline was very&#xD;
fond of eels.&#xD;
After dinner, the sea-serpent went&#xD;
out fishing, and, fastening the end of&#xD;
her chain round his neck, took her&#xD;
with him.&#xD;
While he was fishing, he renewed&#xD;
his request that she would sing forlmim.&#xD;
And this time, as she felt more in&#xD;
the mood of it, and thought perhaps&#xD;
it would be wiser to oblige him, she&#xD;
tang all her best songs.&#xD;
Here is one which she had heard a&#xD;
tailor singing, on a homeward-bound&#xD;
tliip.&#xD;
Oh! 'tis seven years and more,&#xD;
Since I left my native shore,&#xD;
For to sail upon the sea,&#xD;
Where the winds do blow, -&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="76-77" xml:id="VAC8019-00000039"/>&#xD;
76                 Wavelin&#xD;
Seven long and weary year&#xD;
And now, with many fears,&#xD;
For to seek my little home&#xD;
On the hills I go.&#xD;
There I left my lovely Sue,&#xD;
With her heart so warm ani&#xD;
And her eyes wet with tears&#xD;
/     When we said farewell.&#xD;
Oh I if any harm hetide,&#xD;
I shall wish that I hatl died,&#xD;
Ere I left the little house&#xD;
That 1 loved so ivell.&#xD;
But while she was sing&#xD;
took the opportunity to wri&#xD;
thing upon the sand, which s.&#xD;
her father would see if he&#xD;
search of her. It was this:&#xD;
"Wavy's a slave&#xD;
In the sea-serpent's cave.'&#xD;
Then they went back to t&#xD;
where supper was waiting foe&#xD;
Fried eels. Waveline iv&#xD;
of eels, but she would not I&#xD;
ejected to an occasional c&#xD;
variety. After 5UpJ.)ei', she&#xD;
to herself again, with the&#xD;
keeper for a guard; and again&#xD;
asleep on the sofa.&#xD;
But this time her sleep we&#xD;
quiet.&#xD;
She dreamed of her fati&#xD;
her mother, and of her little&#xD;

"CHARLIR, do you know that your&#xD;
bosom-friend, Ethan Grey, is dead?&#xD;
He died suddenly last night," cried&#xD;
Jack Allain, rushing unceremoniously&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="78-79" xml:id="VAC8019-00000040"/>&#xD;
78                      ANiqId&#xD;
eleven last night, in as good health as&#xD;
ever."&#xD;
But as I spoke, I saw from Mr.&#xD;
Allain's pale face that there was no&#xD;
mistake, and there immediately flashed&#xD;
across my mind the remembrance of&#xD;
an old promise that I had made to&#xD;
Ethan Grey, which I had renewed&#xD;
the night before. I am not ashamed&#xD;
to say that this memory brought cold&#xD;
dews of terror to my body. My com-&#xD;
panion observed my sudden pallor, and&#xD;
strove in his rough way to comfort me.&#xD;
lie was a next-door neighbor of the&#xD;
Greys, and had been summoned to&#xD;
their house by the cries of Mrs. Grey,&#xD;
who, on going to her son's room to&#xD;
awaken him, had found him stiff and&#xD;
dead in his bed.&#xD;
"The old lady is dreadfully cut-up,&#xD;
Charlie," he said in conclusion, "and&#xD;
there is no one but Ethan's sister Edith&#xD;
to see to anything. It was she that sent&#xD;
me to you."&#xD;
"My poor girl," I cried, as I hastily&#xD;
dressed myself, for Edith and I were&#xD;
engaged to be married. As 1 walked&#xD;
rapidly to Mrs. Grey's, I could only re-&#xD;
member that Ethan was dead, and that&#xD;
I should be called upon to fulfil the&#xD;
promise already referred to. The&#xD;
thought was a selfish one, I will admit,&#xD;
but I have ever been of a nervous,&#xD;
sensitive temperament.&#xD;
Ethan Grey and I had been school-&#xD;
mates; we graduated from college at&#xD;
the same time, and started in life to..&#xD;
gather, - he as a disciple of law, and&#xD;
I as a doctor. We disagreed on many&#xD;
subjects, without any bitterness, how-&#xD;
ever. When about eighteen, and&#xD;
while we were still at college, Ethan&#xD;
wandered from the church of which&#xD;
we were both members, to follow after&#xD;
a false teacher. He had by chance&#xD;
come in contact with an infidel, a man&#xD;
of great talent, who had been a minis-&#xD;
ter of the gospel, but who had been&#xD;
degraded from his sacred calliiig for ir-&#xD;
regularity of life. Specious and do-&#xD;
&#xD;
of Terror.&#xD;
quent, this man was a dangerous com-&#xD;
panion.&#xD;
Unfortunately Ethan, who was easily&#xD;
influenced, fell nuder his influence and&#xD;
became fully imbued with his views.&#xD;
After knowing this preacher for a while,&#xD;
he horrified me by the denial of a&#xD;
higher and more perfect state of ex-&#xD;
istence, and by declaring that the "next&#xD;
world was a coffin."&#xD;
At college we passed many long&#xD;
nights in arguing the question. I at&#xD;
that period being very orthodox, was&#xD;
uncharitable, insisting that for my&#xD;
frieiid there would be no salvation, if&#xD;
he did not return to the old belief.&#xD;
Ozie night after a hotter argument than&#xD;
usual, 1 made some remark indicative&#xD;
of pity for his soul when it should&#xD;
leave his body. Turning to me grave-&#xD;
ly, after a moment's pause, he said,&#xD;
"Charlie you may be right in ~your&#xD;
belief of a future state, yet I cannot as&#xD;
cribe to the Great Unknown the cruel&#xD;
attributes with which the orthodox de-&#xD;
light to clothe Him. I believe that if&#xD;
there is a hereafter my soul will enjoy&#xD;
it as well as yours. We are both&#xD;
seekers' after truth. Should I die first&#xD;
and the spiritual essence called the&#xD;
soul leave my body, if it is permit-&#xD;
ted, it shall make itself mamiifest to&#xD;
you - to more than one of your&#xD;
seuises shall it appeal, and that within&#xD;
twenty-four hours after my death. if&#xD;
we continue to live in the same village,&#xD;
- as is most likely, - sit up alone with&#xD;
my body the first night, and I will then&#xD;
visit you. Is it a bargain, Charlie?"&#xD;
"Yes, Ethan, I will willingly agree;&#xD;
and should I die first you will sit up&#xD;
with me, and I will come and warn you&#xD;
to repent and believe," was my eager&#xD;
answer.&#xD;
At the time that we made this&#xD;
strange compact my health was by no&#xD;
menus robust. I was of a nervous, sen-&#xD;
sitive temperament, fostered by close&#xD;
apphicatioui to study, and I believed that&#xD;
I should die early. For the salvation&#xD;
&#xD;
A N0At of Terror.                70&#xD;
&#xD;
of my friend I almost hoped that I&#xD;
sli ould. Shortly after this we left col-&#xD;
lege. In more active life aiid the&#xD;
rough struggle a young man with his&#xD;
own way to make encounters, many&#xD;
morbid ideas were dispelled; my&#xD;
health had improved, and I had almost&#xD;
forgotten my engagement with Ethan,&#xD;
though we were still much together,&#xD;
his gentle sister Edith being my affi-&#xD;
anced.&#xD;
Our old discussions on religion were&#xD;
never resumed. Ethan attended church&#xD;
regularly with his family, and seemed&#xD;
to - have forgotten his infidel friend.&#xD;
Whether he had or not I cannot say.&#xD;
The evening before his death was spent&#xD;
by me as usual with Edith. Ethan was&#xD;
present, joyous and hopeful of the fu-&#xD;
ture. 1 observed nothing uncommon&#xD;
in his manners or conversation till lie&#xD;
accompanied me to the door. He stood&#xD;
beside me looking at the stars while I&#xD;
lighted a cigar, when suddenly catch-&#xD;
ing my hand, he said, "Charlie, all&#xD;
looks very quiet and beautiful up there.&#xD;
I hope you have not forgotten our col-&#xD;
lege compact. You are strong now&#xD;
and will see me out."&#xD;
"Hush, Ethan I" I replied almost an-&#xD;
grily. "What folly to talk so, you&#xD;
who have never had a day's sickness&#xD;
in your life."&#xD;
"True, Charlie, yet all is not right&#xD;
here, I am sure," he replied, touching&#xD;
his heart in a half-laughing manner;&#xD;
"don't forget your promise, old fellow,&#xD;
if you are called upon."&#xD;
"Luve-sick?" I asked, jestingly;&#xD;
"all right, I will keep my promise&#xD;
any time within the next fifty years.&#xD;
Good-bye," I continued, puffing my&#xD;
cigar into brightness sal shook hands&#xD;
with him.&#xD;
And now he was dead and I should&#xD;
have to keep my word.&#xD;
I spent the day at Mrs. Grey's com-&#xD;
forting Edith, and, as she had no rel-&#xD;
atives in the village, ordering every-&#xD;
thing for the funeral, which was to&#xD;
&#xD;
take place the next day. In my ac.&#xD;
tive and unaccustomed duties the long&#xD;
night yet to come was almost forgot-&#xD;
ten.&#xD;
The comfortable old farm-house had&#xD;
already put on a strange, forlorn look,&#xD;
and each hour I missed more and&#xD;
more my poor friend's cheerful voice&#xD;
and genial presence. We had placed&#xD;
the corpse in the long, dark, oak-pan-&#xD;
elled sitting-room. The coffin stood&#xD;
on the table directly before the wide&#xD;
old chimney, up whose capacious fun-&#xD;
nel Ethan atid more than one of his&#xD;
ancestors had shouted childish prayers&#xD;
to old Santa Claus, and in the blaze&#xD;
of whose roaring fires, as* men and&#xD;
boys, they had warmed themselves.&#xD;
It was a quaint, comfortable old&#xD;
room. At one side stood an old fhsh-&#xD;
ioned English buffet, on the other a&#xD;
tall Dutch clock, such as our ancestors&#xD;
used, which had been ~n the family for&#xD;
generations, - brought over from the&#xD;
old homestead when the Cavaliers first&#xD;
fled to Virginia, so it was said.&#xD;
A few minutes past eleven I pressed&#xD;
my lips to the cheek of the still weep-&#xD;
ing Edith and entered the room where&#xD;
the corpse lay, to commence my lone-&#xD;
ly vigil.&#xD;
Eestlesa and excited I paced the&#xD;
room, or stood silent by the body gaz-&#xD;
ing at all that remained of poor Ethan,&#xD;
and allowing memory to wander back,&#xD;
till the real had passed from my phys-&#xD;
ical vision and I was living over the&#xD;
past. My deep reverie was suddenly&#xD;
dispelled by hearing a dull heavy blow&#xD;
struck near me on the coffin, - such a&#xD;
thud as a clod of earth would make&#xD;
if thrown upon it. At the same mo&#xD;
ment the clock commenced striking,&#xD;
and a huge black creature rushed from&#xD;
under the coffin past me, disappearing&#xD;
through the door. Trembling I fell&#xD;
upon a chair, and sat staring at the&#xD;
corpse, expecting each nioment to hear&#xD;
its voice break the dreadful silence.&#xD;
It did not move; ghastly pale m&#xD;

I.&#xD;
"WELL, my dear, as you please;&#xD;
but, if I might be allowed to ask the&#xD;
question, Why do you object to merely&#xD;
allowing my young friend an oppor-&#xD;
tunity to commend himself to you?&#xD;
I ask no more at present."&#xD;
"For a thousand reasons: it would&#xD;
be an absurd and cruel thing to let&#xD;
your friend visit here with the faintest&#xD;
idea that I would ever even dream of&#xD;
marrying him; he might have an&#xD;
opportunity any day for ten years, and&#xD;
he could never commend himself to&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"You are extravagant, my dear, and&#xD;
violent; but, being a young woman,&#xD;
I suppose you cannot help it. You&#xD;
* will concede, I suppose, that young&#xD;
women have changed their minds on&#xD;
that and other subjects?"&#xD;
"Certainly, I will concede it with&#xD;
pleasure; but that does not prove that&#xD;
Twill change my mind."&#xD;
"No," lie murmured; "it only&#xD;
makes it very possible."&#xD;
"Every thing is possible, Uncle&#xD;
Roger; but my changing my mind&#xD;
has nothing to do with what we were&#xD;
speaking ,about. Do you really in-&#xD;
tend to refuse your consent to my&#xD;
being declared of age next March?&#xD;
Do you mean to keep me like a child&#xD;
until I am twenty-six?"&#xD;
"I certainly do, my dear, unless you&#xD;
will receive the addresses of an honest,&#xD;
reliable young man like Joseph&#xD;
Lawson, who is capable of taking care&#xD;
of you and your money."&#xD;
"You have a bad opinion of women,&#xD;
Uncle Roger; you think they are&#xD;
silly, unreasonable idiots, unfit to be&#xD;
trusted with money."&#xD;
"You are growing angry: we had&#xD;

better hasten to put an end to this&#xD;
conversation. My opinion of women&#xD;
is not as high as their opinion of&#xD;
themselves. It is true that I con- s 4&#xD;
sider them extravagant, unreasonable,&#xD;
and unfit to be trusted with money;&#xD;
but I have never intimated that they&#xD;
wAere idiots, or that they were invari-&#xD;
ably without principle."&#xD;
"Thank you," answered the young&#xD;
girl sarcastically, rising quickly and&#xD;
turning to the door.&#xD;
"One moment, my dear! Will you&#xD;
give me one reason (I suppose you&#xD;
have a thousand, but one will do) why&#xD;
you will not marry Mr. Lawson?"&#xD;
"I will he more liberal, Uncle&#xD;
Roger," she answered, turning to&#xD;
him, with one hand still on the handle&#xD;
of the door; "I will give you three:&#xD;
in the first place, I do not want to&#xD;
marry anybody; in the second place,&#xD;
I do not love Mr. Joseph Lawson,&#xD;
who, in the third place, is a solemn,&#xD;
ineffable prig."&#xD;
Mr. Pierrepoint leaned back in his&#xD;
chair, and passed his delicate hand&#xD;
over his mouth to conceal a smile. It&#xD;
amused him to see the indignation of&#xD;
the young girl, though he really&#xD;
understood her no b~ter than an&#xD;
old greyhound understands a young&#xD;
shepherd dog. "Mr. Lawson appears&#xD;
to be a well-meaning, high-principled&#xD;
young man, with a tolerable amount&#xD;
of information," he continued after a&#xD;
pause.&#xD;
"He may be a king of men, Uncle&#xD;
Roger, but I would rather work as a&#xD;
cook and housemaid than live with him&#xD;
~1&#xD;
for one year. You need not call that&#xD;
an extravagance," she continued has-  JJ11~&#xD;
tily, as her uncle glanced at her deli-&#xD;

I would be cook or housemaid gladly&#xD;

8          "Cook and housemaid, I think&#xD;
you said."&#xD;
"Yr~ry well, Uncle Roger, cook&#xD;
and housemaid."&#xD;
"If you are in earnest, Kate, you&#xD;
will have an opportunity to prove it."&#xD;
Kate looked at him with surprise,&#xD;
as, having arrived at a crisis in the&#xD;
affair, he rose and stood majestically&#xD;
with his back to the blazing fire,&#xD;
and the supercilious look in his face&#xD;
that always stirred her 4o deep&#xD;
"I 'will take you at your word,&#xD;
and try you with your own test. If&#xD;
you will serve as cook and house-&#xD;

mind you), as any respectable girl&#xD;
would, for six months, I will declare&#xD;
you age on the first of March, and&#xD;
never mention Joseph Lawson to you&#xD;
again. I do not wish an answer."&#xD;
His niece had made an eager step&#xD;
forward; but at this she turned,&#xD;
laughing lightly. "Good-by, sir.&#xD;

planning. She would start from Mrs.&#xD;

look ruefully about, at the pretty,&#xD;
luxurious room, its books and pictures,&#xD;
the harmonious brown and gold and&#xD;
crimson. The chair was very com-&#xD;

lovely to the eye; on one side she&#xD;
could look into the glowing heart of&#xD;
the green, sunny conservatory, and&#xD;
on the other into her large bedroom,&#xD;
delicately and completely appointed.&#xD;

"Are we going to have breakfast&#xD;
this morning, my dear?"&#xD;
Mr. Austin asked this question in&#xD;
a good-humored, suggestive way, as&#xD;
he came into the sunny breakfast-&#xD;
room, about t~venty minutes past&#xD;
eight, to find his wife, flushed an(l&#xD;
weary, putting a loaf with a very&#xD;
burnt top on the table, as a finishing&#xD;
stroke.&#xD;
"Hullo! What's the matter?&#xD;
Where's Belinda?"&#xD;
"You know she went last night,&#xD;
John."&#xD;
"So she did, little woman. Why&#xD;
didn't you wake me? I'd have helped&#xD;
you: it wouldn't have been~-the first&#xD;
time."&#xD;
"It was no use; the horrid thing&#xD;
left every thing in rather better order&#xD;
than the others did, and I made a&#xD;
wood fire."&#xD;
She sat down as she spoke, and&#xD;
began to pour out the coffee. It was&#xD;
very weak; but Mr. Austin pretended&#xD;
to enjoy it, and not to know that the&#xD;

The Hou8ek~&#xD;
water was badly smoked. "John,&#xD;
you needn't look so delighted with&#xD;
your breakfast. I know every thing&#xD;
is disgusting, but you see I forgot&#xD;
Belinda had gone, and slept too late.&#xD;
I can do better than this; you know&#xD;
I can."&#xD;
"Certainly you can, dear; and&#xD;
really, it might have been worse."&#xD;
"I don't see how."&#xD;
"Why, the milk might have been&#xD;
burned." Then, after a moment's&#xD;
l)ause, he continued, "What are you&#xD;
going to do now? advertise?"&#xD;
"Oh, no indeed! Did you bring&#xD;
the paper up from the office last&#xD;
night? I am going to take the first&#xD;
'Wanted I see, and work my way&#xD;
down the list."&#xD;
"Poor little soul, come here on my&#xD;
knee, and we'll go on the voyage of&#xD;
discovery togethcr.~~&#xD;
So she perched herself on his knee,&#xD;
and unfolded the paper.&#xD;
The first "want" was a "young&#xD;
~C~5Ofl who fishedd to do dining-room&#xD;
work in a small family with no&#xD;
children."&#xD;
"II~r work wouldn't keep her long&#xD;
lucre, John; she might take in plain&#xD;
serving and make a&#xD;
"Hullo I Elsie, here's something&#xD;
promising, very: 'Wanted, by a&#xD;
young woman, a place in a small&#xD;
family as cook and housemaid; can-&#xD;
not do the washing; wages ten dol-&#xD;
lars; small country town preferred.'&#xD;
There, what do you think of that?&#xD;
Somebody has heard of our necessities,&#xD;
and is rushing to our aid."&#xD;
"But ten dollars is a good deal&#xD;
without the washing."&#xD;
"Not for a superior young womlin&#xD;
who prefers a country town."&#xD;
"How do you know she is supe-&#xD;
riot, John? Don't be absurd; it's too&#xD;
serious a matter; if you had to" -&#xD;
"There, there, dear! I know it,&#xD;
&#xD;
~eper's Story.                 83&#xD;
it's confoundedly hard on you. You&#xD;
needn't think I ever forget it." He&#xD;
looked so really distressed that she&#xD;
reproached herself for being cross,&#xD;
and her little penitent kiss restored&#xD;
his good spirits immediately, and he&#xD;
continued gayly, "You write to this&#xD;
young woman, Elsie. I feel in my&#xD;
bones, as you women say, that she'll&#xD;
turn up a trump: we'll call her m~ij&#xD;
venture."&#xD;
"Do you remember big Margaret?&#xD;
She was one of your ventures, and&#xD;
got drunk and smashed a dozen tea-&#xD;
cups, and then cried for two days."&#xD;
"'True, my dear; but we will not&#xD;
touch the ashes of the past. I advise&#xD;
you to try this young woman."&#xD;
When Mr. Austin had gone to his&#xD;
office, Mrs. Austin sat down to her&#xD;
pretty desk, and wrote to the young&#xD;
woman to come immediately. In a&#xD;
day or two, Mr. Austin brought his&#xD;
tired wife a letter. "News of the&#xD;
coming woman, perhaps."&#xD;
"Yes. I am thankful to say she is&#xD;
coming to-morrow. Somebody has&#xD;
written the letter for her. See, John,&#xD;
what a nice hand I"&#xD;
"By George! a splendid hand! Re-&#xD;
member, she is m~y venture. By the&#xD;
way, I'll not be here to see her debut.&#xD;
I am' going to Lyne on business."&#xD;
"0 John! for how long?"&#xD;
"' I can't be back to-night, and per-&#xD;
haps my business will keep me all to-&#xD;
morrow. In that case, I will get&#xD;
home at midnight."&#xD;
"Well, I am not very sorry. I&#xD;
will send for Judith, and have the&#xD;
kitchen cleaned within an inch of its&#xD;
life; and your venture shall have a&#xD;
fair chance. 0 John! if she is only&#xD;
deccuit, I will be thankful."&#xD;
"Elsie, you must do as the old&#xD;
housekeeper advised, 'learn to&#xD;
wink."'&#xD;
"Wink! why, I have shut my eyes&#xD;

tight; but I can't shut my~nose, and&#xD;
you won't shut" -&#xD;
"My mouth? Well, dear, good-by.&#xD;
Keep a good heart. I'll be back to&#xD;
dinner; and will you have my bag&#xD;
ready?"&#xD;
"Yes; I'll see to your bag; butl&#xD;
don't know what kind of a dinner&#xD;
you'll get. Will hash and potatoes do,&#xD;
and apples for dessert?"&#xD;
"Delicious! Good-by."&#xD;
Mrs. Austin was an active manager&#xD;
of the Industrial School in Bideford,&#xD;
and also of the Benevolent Society.&#xD;
She had a tolerably large correspond-&#xD;
ence; she liked to read; she wished&#xD;
to keep up her music, of which she ~vas&#xD;
passionately fond, and to read the&#xD;
newspapers; - which last she did as&#xD;
much for John's sake as for her own.&#xD;
He must have somebody to talk to&#xD;
about free trade and the French war.&#xD;
She had the sewing arLdmending to do;&#xD;
to take a list of the clothes ~vhich&#xD;
~vent out to wash, and to see that&#xD;
they were right when they came&#xD;
back; she had visits to pay and to&#xD;
receive; she had dusting and super-&#xD;
vising to do; and, in the frequent gaps&#xD;
in the procession of coming and de-&#xD;
parting foreigners, she had to add&#xD;
their work to her own, and to do it,&#xD;
after a certain fashion, and with what&#xD;
outside help she could get. There&#xD;
are but twenty-four hours in the day,&#xD;
and some of these are of necessity&#xD;
passed in bed; so she was forced to&#xD;
leave many things undone, and she&#xD;
was wearied and harassed and vexed&#xD;
with trying vainly to do double duty,&#xD;
and to do it well.&#xD;
III'&#xD;
THE train by which she expected&#xD;
the "venture" would be in at three&#xD;
o'clock. The sunny kitchen was&#xD;
shining with cleanliness; every thing&#xD;
was in order. The bin in the out-&#xD;
&#xD;
eper's Story.&#xD;
house close at hand was full of coal,&#xD;
the wood-box full of kindling. Old&#xD;
Judith stood contemplating her work&#xD;
with satisfaction.&#xD;
"Shure, an' its dane to begin wid;&#xD;
and the flure and table as white as a&#xD;
hound's tooth; but's (with an inde.-&#xD;
scribable gesture of hands and head)&#xD;
"by Sunday night ye might plant&#xD;
petatys all over the pleace.~~&#xD;
"0 Judith! not so bad as that! but&#xD;
I suppose it will be bad enough;" and&#xD;
the poor woman sighed as she spoke.&#xD;
She turned away, saying, "Judith,&#xD;
will you wait here for her? I must&#xD;
go down to Mrs. Bolton's, and may&#xD;
be I won't be at home in time."&#xD;
"I will, ~ said Judith cheer-&#xD;
fully. There are exceptions to every&#xD;
rule, and Judith was "clean and&#xD;
kind."&#xD;
It was late when Mrs. Austin re-&#xD;
turned home, nervous and tired~ Old&#xD;
Judith opened the door for her.&#xD;
"Is she come?"&#xD;
"Yis, main, the lady's in beyan~.~~&#xD;
"Lady!. what do you mean, Ju-&#xD;
dith?"&#xD;
"Oh, ye'11 see, main!~~ with many&#xD;
winks and chuckles. "Ye've got a&#xD;
lady this time;" and she went along&#xD;
to the kitchen, nodding sagaciously.&#xD;
"I may as ~vell have it over," poor&#xD;
little Mrs. Austin muttered, follow-&#xD;
ing closely, with despair in her&#xD;
heart.&#xD;
The afternoon sun was streaming&#xD;
in the window over a bunch of rose-&#xD;
colored asters, in a blue and white&#xD;
jug on the sill, and surrounding the&#xD;
young ~voman who "preferred a coun-&#xD;
try town~' ~vith a sort of glory.&#xD;
She stood in the light, a sweet, grace-&#xD;
ful figure, with a crown of splendid&#xD;
hair, wound round her head in close,&#xD;
heavy braids~ She wore a dress of&#xD;
shepherd's plaid, simply made and&#xD;
trimmed; and on the table lay little&#xD;
&#xD;
The IIouse~&#xD;
plain bonnet, and a pair of dark kir&#xD;
gloves, carefully mended. The in-&#xD;
stinct of caste told Mrs. Austin in an&#xD;
instant that this was no servant, in&#xD;
spite of the attempt to look respect.&#xD;
ble, instead of elegant. She blushed&#xD;
crimson as she stepped forward, and felt&#xD;
so furious at old Judith, nodding in&#xD;
the background, that she could will-&#xD;
ingly have shaken her. The young&#xD;
woman rook the initiative, saying in&#xD;
a quiet, educated voice, "I am the&#xD;
person you expected from New York,&#xD;
Mrs. Austin."&#xD;
"But I think it must be a mistake.&#xD;
I wanted a cook and housemaid." She&#xD;
glanced at the new-coiner's lady-like&#xD;
hands as she spoke.&#xD;
"That is the kind of place I adver-&#xD;
tised for. You said nothing about a&#xD;
character, but I thought you would&#xD;
prefer to have one. You will see&#xD;
that I understand my business."&#xD;
Somewhat re-assured by this talk of&#xD;
"character," Mrs. Austin took the&#xD;
paper extended to her.&#xD;
"Kate Horton is an excellent cook,&#xD;
perfectly honest and sober and tidy."&#xD;
This certificate was signed by a lady&#xD;
whose character and whose handwrit-&#xD;
ing were well known to Mrs. Austin,&#xD;
and was therefore perfectly satisfac-&#xD;
tory; but the dismay at having a&#xD;
lady on her hands, instead of a ser-&#xD;
vant, grew greater and greater; and in&#xD;
her disappointment and nervousness&#xD;
she could hardly keep back the tears.&#xD;
She had suffered with quasi ladies&#xD;
and their airs and graces: What would&#xD;
she do with a real one? She could&#xD;
summon only the ghost of the cor-&#xD;
diality with which she was wont to&#xD;
~vpThome and propitiate each new&#xD;
trial; and, committing Kate Horton to&#xD;
Judith for the present, she ran up&#xD;
stairs, and falling on the bed, began to&#xD;
cry like a baby; and like a baby, cried&#xD;
herself to sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
deeper's Story.&#xD;
In the mean time, Judith showed&#xD;
Kate over her new territory, and took&#xD;
shrewd mental notes as she ivent. It&#xD;
was a nice, convenient kitchen, with a&#xD;
good floor, painted and well varnished;&#xD;
a round table in the middle, a sink&#xD;
with a good pump, and convenient&#xD;
closets. In an outhouse, close by the&#xD;
back door, was a good-sized bin full&#xD;
of coal, with a small compartment&#xD;
near for kindling-wood. These were&#xD;
filled once a week by a man who came&#xD;
for the purpose, and old Judith also&#xD;
came for one day's cleaning every&#xD;
week. The outhouse was nicely fin-&#xD;
ished inside, and weather-tight, so&#xD;
that a good deal of work could be&#xD;
done there in mild weather. The ser-&#xD;
vant's room was over the kitchen, and&#xD;
was a clean, airy chamber, with a bed,&#xD;
a table, a washstand and bureau, a&#xD;
chair, and a strip of carpet by the bed.&#xD;
The sheets were whole and white, and&#xD;
the window had a clean white curtain;&#xD;
the basin and pitcher were good; but&#xD;
the watchful Judith saw a little rue-&#xD;
ful look come into Kate's face, and put&#xD;
down in her note-book, that a clean,&#xD;
bare little room, like this, was some-&#xD;
thing new to her experience. She&#xD;
also noted the new-corner's anxious&#xD;
inquiries about the Jast occupant, and&#xD;
her look of relief at hearing that she&#xD;
was "as clans as she was upsettin'."&#xD;
At last Judith went off, saying, in&#xD;
a respectful tone, "Good-night, Miss&#xD;
Kate."&#xD;
"Why do you call me 'miss,' Ju-&#xD;
dith? You make me ridiculous.&#xD;
Kate, if you please."&#xD;
"Very well, main; I will."&#xD;
Left alone, Kate began to think&#xD;
about the mistress of the new home.&#xD;
She had seen at a glance that she&#xD;
was tired and anxious and disap-&#xD;
pointed, and she decided that a good&#xD;
tea would do her as much good as&#xD;
any thing so she tied on a brown&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="86-87" xml:id="VAC8019-00000044"/>&#xD;
86                  The llousek&#xD;
apron (her trunk was already in the&#xD;
little room up stairs), and ~~'ent into&#xD;
the dining-room. She set the table,&#xD;
arra[Iging the pretty chum and silver&#xD;
after her own fancy, as she had no&#xD;
rule to go by. The table 'vas round&#xD;
and polished, and therefore needed no&#xD;
cloth for tea; but she spread the little&#xD;
oval waiter with a fair white napkin,&#xD;
and set the tea-pot and water-kettle in&#xD;
their places. Then she went back to&#xD;
the kitchen, where the kettle was&#xD;
singing on the stove, and took down&#xD;
a saucepan, a bowl, and a soup-plate.&#xD;
From the egg-basket she took three&#xD;
eggs for the omelette which she intend-&#xD;
ed; and, after a moment's hesitation&#xD;
(for she was very much afraid of rats),&#xD;
she went heroically down into the cel-&#xD;
lar with a pitcher and a plate, and&#xD;
brought up the milk and a piece of&#xD;
butter. She made one more journey&#xD;
for the ice, which she cracked off&#xD;
carefully, and brought up stairs for&#xD;
the butter and the water-pitcher.&#xD;
It was now within a quarter of an&#xD;
hour of six, which Judith had told&#xD;
her was the tea-hour. So, putting&#xD;
her saucepan on the stove to heat, she&#xD;
went up stairs to call Mrs. Austin.&#xD;
She knocked softly at the door&#xD;
which Judith had pointed out as be-&#xD;
longing to Mrs. Austin's room.&#xD;
"It is nearly six, Mrs. ~&#xD;
The little lady woke up suddenly.&#xD;
"Nearly six! I will be down in&#xD;
two minutes." And as she hurriedly&#xD;
bathed her face, and changed her&#xD;
dress, she kept vituperating herself&#xD;
for her stupidity. "The first day, and&#xD;
every thing strange! Oh, how foolish&#xD;
to go to sleep!,,&#xD;
When Kate carried in the quiver-&#xD;
ing golden-brown omelette, and the&#xD;
boiling tea-kettle, she found Mrs. Aus-&#xD;
tin already standing by the table. The&#xD;
dainty arrangement of every thing,&#xD;
and the vase with one late rose, which&#xD;
&#xD;
eeper's Story.&#xD;
crowned the whole, filled her with&#xD;
amazed delight; and, being hungry.&#xD;
the omelette smelled savory and allur-&#xD;
ing. As she sat down and made the&#xD;
tea, she thanked God, and took cour-&#xD;
age. As long as she did not see Kate,&#xD;
she ~vns content: but the sight of her&#xD;
graceful figure filled her with con-&#xD;
fused ideas of asking her to sit down,&#xD;
and keep her company; so that she&#xD;
was relieved when Kate quietly put&#xD;
a bell beside her, and left the room.&#xD;
She made a good meal, and enjoyed&#xD;
it; and determined to leave the break-&#xD;
fast in such skilful hands, and think&#xD;
no more about it. As she lingered&#xD;
over her second cup, Kate in the&#xD;
kitchen had "cleaned up," and was&#xD;
standing in the twilight, looking&#xD;
somewhat wistfully at the red wes-&#xD;
tern sky, shining between some tall&#xD;
pine-trees. The tinkle of the bell&#xD;
startled her, and very unreasonably.&#xD;
provoked her for an instant; then she&#xD;
quickly answered it. "I have done,&#xD;
Kate; take your tea, and then wash&#xD;
the tea-things in here," said Mrs.&#xD;
Austin, in a scared tone: for the&#xD;
twilight seemed to enhance the in-&#xD;
congruity of such as Kate being or-&#xD;
dered to do any thing. However, she&#xD;
left her, and went into the parlor;&#xD;
where she lighted the student's lamp,&#xD;
and sat down to think. Kate's sup-&#xD;
per was a slice of brown bread and&#xD;
cutter, as she despised tea, and had&#xD;
lost her appetite for the present. By&#xD;
seven, all her work was done; and she&#xD;
sat down on a little seat under the&#xD;
grape-arbor, and felt very blue. Mrs.&#xD;
Austin was almost as blue in the par-&#xD;
lor. Tt seemed absurd that she should&#xD;
be alone in the parlor, and Kate, a&#xD;
lady by every token, alone in the&#xD;
kitchen. "If the millennium ever&#xD;
comes, and ladies do take such places&#xD;
as this, one might have a charming&#xD;
society in the house; but I don't&#xD;
&#xD;
know, the drawbacks would be&#xD;
great. It would be embarrassing to&#xD;
have your friend eating in the kitchen,&#xD;
and waiting on the table, if you had a&#xD;
dinner-party."&#xD;
At nine o'clock Kate made her&#xD;
preparations for morning. Oh, the&#xD;
morning I And to have to getup, and&#xD;
make a fire, and co~pk a breakfast, in-&#xD;
stead of dressing leisurely in a warm&#xD;
room, finding a table spread with good&#xD;
things from one cares very little&#xD;
where.&#xD;
Iv.&#xD;
The breakfast hour was eight: by&#xD;
half-past six, Kate - who, thanks to&#xD;
youth and fatigue, had slept as&#xD;
soundly in her little iron bedstead as&#xD;
she had ever done at home was in&#xD;
the kitchen.&#xD;
She shook the fire well and opened&#xD;
the araughts, shivering a little in the&#xD;
chill morning air, and thinking of the&#xD;
coming Winter. The morning was&#xD;
charibing; and there was something&#xD;
wonderfully pure and exhilarating in&#xD;
the atmosphere, and lonely in the&#xD;
long, long shadows from the east.&#xD;
By the time the "firing-up" was&#xD;
done, the milk-boy was beating a tat-&#xD;
too on the kitchen door. He was a&#xD;
fresh-faced, saucy boy, who stood&#xD;
amazed and suddenly struck dumb,&#xD;
by the apparition which opened to&#xD;
him; 'an apparition clad in a violet&#xD;
calico dress, with a big check apron&#xD;
tied about a graceful waist. It took&#xD;
the three-quart can from him, with a&#xD;
smile, and thanketi him in a pretty&#xD;
voice, and made him its slave for-&#xD;
ever.&#xD;
Mr. Austin had duly returned in&#xD;
the middle of the night, and had&#xD;
been informed of the arrival of the&#xD;
"venture."&#xD;
"Is she a paragon, or a failure?~~&#xD;
"You'll see to-morrow she is a&#xD;
little of both."&#xD;
&#xD;
The Hou8eleeeper'8 Story.&#xD;
&#xD;
So in the morning Mr. Austin pre-&#xD;
pared for breakfast, with an agreeable&#xD;
sense of expectation.&#xD;
Mrs. Austin refused to go down tc&#xD;
superintend. She said Kate had&#xD;
done well enough the night before,&#xD;
and that it would be a good lesson to&#xD;
leave her to her own resources. Mr.&#xD;
Austin accused her of being afraid to&#xD;
venture down alone. At eight o'clock&#xD;
they heard the tinkle of the breakfast&#xD;
bell, and weAjt down prepared for&#xD;
any thing.&#xD;
Mr. Austin almost started, and was&#xD;
as much amazed as the milk-boy had&#xD;
been an hour before, at the sight of&#xD;
his new servant, standing behind Mrs.&#xD;
Austin's chair. Her fresh beauty&#xD;
and her exquisite neatness, the lady-&#xD;
hood that was not to be mistaken or&#xD;
obscured, made him understand why&#xD;
his wife had pronounced this paragon&#xD;
a little of a failure too. It was em-&#xD;
barrassing to be waited upon by a&#xD;
woman who was in every way fit to&#xD;
sit at your table; but the feeling&#xD;
vitnished before Kate's matter-of-fact&#xD;
manner, and the charms of the de-&#xD;
licious coffee and delicate rolls; and&#xD;
lie afterwards pronounced it a break-&#xD;
fast too good for a king, and good&#xD;
enough for a lawyer.&#xD;
Life began to put on bright colors&#xD;
for Mrs. Austin. She began to prac-&#xD;
tise, to read, to enjoy herself; the&#xD;
work that was left for her could be&#xD;
done perfectly and in its own time.&#xD;
It did her heart good to look about&#xD;
the little kitchen, which had taken on&#xD;
an air of refinement which it would not&#xD;
be easy to define. Kate did her own&#xD;
scrubbing with a long-handled scrub-&#xD;
bing-brush; and as she never dropped&#xD;
her potato-parings on the floor, or&#xD;
filled a slop-pail to overflowing, there&#xD;
was little dirt to scrub up. Old Ju-&#xD;
dith came once a week, and gave pots&#xD;
and pans an ez±ra scouring. Illvery&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="88-89" xml:id="VAC8019-00000045"/>&#xD;
88                  The Ilouseke&#xD;
thing was delicately clean, and Kate&#xD;
was as much an ornament as the blue-&#xD;
and-white jnr alwa3 s full of flowers&#xD;
or leaves. There were a few books&#xD;
on a shelf by the window; and by&#xD;
half-past three, often earlier, the&#xD;
strange spectacle of a kitchen table&#xD;
covered with books and papers might&#xD;
be seen, and a woman studying as&#xD;
serenely as if she had not just washed&#xD;
up all the dishes from a dinner she&#xD;
had herself cooked. Her only fault,&#xD;
in Mrs. Austin's eyes, was a persistent&#xD;
refusal to be drawn over a certain&#xD;
line. It would have been pleasant if&#xD;
she would sometimes have forgotten&#xD;
that Mrs. Austin was the employer&#xD;
and she the employed; and yet it had&#xD;
to be confessed that it was better&#xD;
upon the whole, and saved embarrass-&#xD;
ments. She was interested, kindly,&#xD;
obliging, suggestive, but iiever step-&#xD;
ped out of her place, or seemed&#xD;
conscious that Bideford was ringing&#xD;
with her name and fame.&#xD;
By that perception which seems&#xD;
keener in the laboring class than in&#xD;
the one above it, the butcher, the&#xD;
baker, and candlestick-maker, and all&#xD;
the neighboringcooks and housemaids,&#xD;
recognized from the first her superi-&#xD;
ority, and accepted her kind words&#xD;
and deeds as from one above them, in&#xD;
spite of the absence of all pretension.&#xD;
As she was not obliged to sew for&#xD;
herself at present, as most women at&#xD;
service are obliged to do, and as she&#xD;
had no inclination to walk about the&#xD;
streets or pay visits, she was at leisure&#xD;
not only to read and study, but to&#xD;
help others. Twice a week, in the&#xD;
evening, she had an audience of half&#xD;
a dozen decent women, who brought&#xD;
their work, and to whom she read&#xD;
and talked, and also taught them to&#xD;
do their household sewing and house-&#xD;
work with greater ease and perfection.&#xD;
11 any one asks how a girl brought&#xD;
&#xD;
eper '8 Stpry.&#xD;
up in luxui~y from her childhood had&#xD;
a correct knowledge of these things,&#xD;
the answer is, that Kate Pierrepont&#xD;
had lived for some years after her&#xD;
mother's death with a maternal aunt,&#xD;
who had her hobbies, and who taught&#xD;
her young niece to know by experi-&#xD;
ence how to cook and sew, and also&#xD;
how to use her common-sense intelli-&#xD;
gently. Old Judith had to thank&#xD;
Kate for more than one warm gar-&#xD;
ment; and the old woman had repaid&#xD;
her with many a welcome service,&#xD;
which would spare those pretty hands&#xD;
from rough labor.&#xD;
One day Mrs. Austin, who had long&#xD;
given up attempts at evening enter-&#xD;
tainments, owing to repeated disap-&#xD;
pointments and failures, bethought&#xD;
her, that, with such a treasure in the&#xD;
kitchen, the hour had come for&#xD;
another effort. So she sprang up&#xD;
from her piano, at which the idea had&#xD;
seized her, and ~vent into the kitchen.&#xD;
It was late in November, and the&#xD;
days were short. The kitchen was&#xD;
warm and. comfortable, and exquisite-&#xD;
ly neat. By the window, perched on&#xD;
the sill, was the presiding genius,&#xD;
bending over a book, economizing the&#xD;
fading light.&#xD;
Mrs. Austin stood still a moment,&#xD;
looking curiously at the pretty picture.&#xD;
When at last she spoke, Kate was so&#xD;
absorbed in her book that she started&#xD;
at the sudden sound, axid spring&#xD;
hastily down from the window-seat.&#xD;
"What are you so interested in.&#xD;
Kate?~' said Mrs. Austin.&#xD;
"A queer old book I found here in&#xD;
a book-stall, 'The Memorial of Ma-&#xD;
dame de Cr~qui.' Did you want me&#xD;
for any thing, Mrs Austin?"&#xD;
"It looks attractive," continued&#xD;
Mrs. Austin, looking over the book.&#xD;
"Would you like to see it?"&#xD;
"'When you have finished, yes.&#xD;
0 Kate I I came to consult you&#xD;
&#xD;
The IIousek~&#xD;
about giving a tea-party. I want to&#xD;
invite the iiembers of the Book Club.&#xD;
Coul'l we manage it, do you think?&#xD;
there arc only ten ladies."&#xD;
"Certainly we could manage it.&#xD;
What kind of a tea do you want to&#xD;
give?"&#xD;
"I don't know exactly: they al-&#xD;
ways have lots of sweetmeats here,&#xD;
and oysters and jellies; hut all that&#xD;
is frightful trouble, and, besides, I&#xD;
have very fe~v s~veetn~eats this year.&#xD;
What would you do?"&#xD;
"Why don't ~ou have an oyster-&#xD;
supper, and not try to have cakes and&#xD;
jellies? They arc only in the way;&#xD;
thiorgli I will be glad to make wkat-&#xD;
ever you wish."&#xD;
~~Irow - no cake nt all?"&#xD;
"I iveuld have tea and coffee and&#xD;
oysters, wi'h hot rolls and cheese i~d&#xD;
cracked. s. ~nd nothing else."&#xD;
"It v mId save a great deal o&#xD;
trouble."&#xD;
"Yes. ~ think a tea with a char-&#xD;
acter to i~ is dwuys pleasanter; ihere&#xD;
is a want oi l'a~Luony between straw-&#xD;
berry sweetm'ats and stewed oys-&#xD;
ters."&#xD;
"Let us hav~ it that way, then.&#xD;
It is less cxpen3l ~e, at any rate; and&#xD;
I have no money to spare," concluded&#xD;
Mrs. Austin, laugl'ir~g~. This was&#xD;
Monday; and on the following Thurs-&#xD;
day the "tea-fight" wmld take place.&#xD;
And Mrs. Austin felt in her heart that&#xD;
it was a great relief to hwe no cake&#xD;
or jelly on her mind. Yn fact, she&#xD;
took very little thought ~bont the&#xD;
material part of her entertainment,&#xD;
assured as she was of Kate entire&#xD;
competency. Ga Thursday afteracon,&#xD;
when her arrangements were com-&#xD;
pleted in the parlor, the poitiTolios&#xD;
opened and placed on their staLde,&#xD;
the places for the lights arranged, ai'd&#xD;
* the final re-adjustment of the prett~'&#xD;
things in the parlor completed, sh'~&#xD;
&#xD;
~eper's Story.                 89&#xD;
could go and lie down for a while,&#xD;
and dress at her leisure, sure that the&#xD;
table would do her credit, and every&#xD;
thing on it would be good to eat;&#xD;
which is a state of blessedness rarely&#xD;
known by a country housekeeper an&#xD;
hour before a tea-party.&#xD;
About six o'clock she came down,&#xD;
to find the tea-table charming, in its&#xD;
arrangement of blue and gold china,&#xD;
silver, and snowy napkins, reflected&#xD;
in the shining table. Every thing&#xD;
was ready; and she took it all in with&#xD;
a sigh of enjoyment, enhanced by the&#xD;
remembrance of the confusion and&#xD;
weariness preceding by-gone tea-par-&#xD;
ties, - the cleaning of knives, and&#xD;
scrubbing up of leaden-looking silver;&#xD;
the washing of china that had been&#xD;
put away half clean, and the dreadful&#xD;
anticipation of heavy biscuit and&#xD;
muddy coffee. She peeped into the&#xD;
kitchen. Kate was pouring the boil-&#xD;
ing water on the coffee in the biggin,&#xD;
and on the boiler stood pans of snow-&#xD;
white, delicate-looking biscuit, almost&#xD;
ready for the oven.&#xD;
Kate was dressed in a fresh calico,&#xD;
with a little frilled white apron, and&#xD;
a black cravat on her white collar.&#xD;
Over all this was tied a wide check&#xD;
apron, and her beautiful hair was, as&#xD;
usual, neatly and closely braided.&#xD;
Judith's Fttle granddaughter was&#xD;
ready to open the door for the ex-&#xD;
pected guests, wino came in twos and&#xD;
threes; and by six ~"ciock were all as-&#xD;
sembled in the diui~-"oom, around&#xD;
the inviting-looking taMe. The sec-&#xD;
retary of the club - for N~r. Asi&amp;amp;ia&#xD;
made convedent pretence of businen',&#xD;
which called him away at such mee*&#xD;
ings - took the foot of the table&#xD;
She was the oldest member, a house&#xD;
keeper of credit and renown, before&#xD;
whose keen glance Mrs. Austin even&#xD;
mw c~uake4 a little, but before which&#xD;
iL b~-~one attempts she had inward-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="90-91" xml:id="VAC8019-00000046"/>&#xD;
90                  The Housek~&#xD;
ly groaned with horror. There was&#xD;
nothing now to find fault with; ex-&#xD;
cept, perhaps, with the innovation on&#xD;
the custom of crowding the table&#xD;
with cake and sweetmeats, and little&#xD;
glass saucers to hold them. Every&#xD;
thing was delicious, coffee, rolls,&#xD;
and oysters and Kate's services&#xD;
were perfection, quiet and silent.&#xD;
It may easily be imagined, that&#xD;
this anomaly in the kitchen regions&#xD;
was the chief theme of discourse that&#xD;
enlivened the evening; varied by&#xD;
talk on mlsic, books, and pictures,&#xD;
but returning steadily to the primary&#xD;
idea, like a well-constructed piece of&#xD;
music.&#xD;
V.&#xD;
One grows ambitious with success;&#xD;
and Mrs. Austin's triumphant ac-&#xD;
count of the evening moved Mr. Aus-&#xD;
tin to wonder, in the recesses of his&#xD;
heart, ~vhether a dinner to the judges,&#xD;
who would hold court shortly in Bide-&#xD;
ford, might be dreamed of.&#xD;
Some of them were men who lived&#xD;
off the cream and honey of the land,&#xD;
and dined su~ptuously every day. It&#xD;
was clear that too vaulting an ambi-&#xD;
tion would overlap itself; but, again,&#xD;
a very plain dinner must be a very&#xD;
perfect one.&#xD;
He consulted Mrs. Austin, who sat&#xD;
tranquilly in the cosey parlor, enjoying&#xD;
her book. He had first looked for&#xD;
her in the kitchen, where Kate was&#xD;
concocting some delicate dessert for&#xD;
to-morrow's dinner.&#xD;
"Could not we manage it with this&#xD;
paragon of yours? We may as well&#xD;
use her while we have her, for there&#xD;
is some hocus-pocus about it all; one&#xD;
might say of her, as they say of con-&#xD;
sumptives, the spring flowers will not&#xD;
find her here."&#xD;
Mrs. Austin looked dismayed at&#xD;
the idea, and it required some effort to&#xD;
&#xD;
~eper'8 Story.&#xD;
bring her resolution up to the point&#xD;
of actually undertaking the dinner&#xD;
hut the point was at last reached.&#xD;
Kate, on being consulted next day,&#xD;
entered into the scheme ~vith a readi-&#xD;
ness and wealth of resource that fully&#xD;
established Mrs. Austin's courage.&#xD;
The dinner was arranged to be, first,&#xD;
soup; second, roast turkey and ham,&#xD;
hominy, cakes, fricasseed potatoes,&#xD;
tomatoes and cranberries; third,&#xD;
mince-pies and custard; fourth, frnit&#xD;
and nuts; fifth, coffee. And little&#xD;
Judith was to help.&#xD;
Mrs. Austin told her husband, in&#xD;
the evening, that he might ask his&#xD;
guests; but he must promise to look&#xD;
immovable, no matter what contre-&#xD;
temps occurred. The dinner was to&#xD;
be on the next Thursday.&#xD;
VI.&#xD;
As Judge Lorton and a companion&#xD;
walked up the street, under the arch&#xD;
of leafless trees, with their beautifully&#xD;
interlacing branches, looking as if&#xD;
they were carved against the glitter-&#xD;
ing sky, they talked a little about&#xD;
country dinners; and told more than&#xD;
one absurd story of melancholy fail-&#xD;
ures and wretched hostesses. It was&#xD;
rather hard on them. The hotel at&#xD;
Bideford was celebrated for its good&#xD;
dinners; but it was the custom to ac-&#xD;
cept the hospitalities of the various&#xD;
towns, and there was no escape.&#xD;
"If they would give us a good&#xD;
roast and potatoes, I would he thank-&#xD;
ful; but would-he entries, and burned-&#xD;
up oysters, and distracted hostesses,&#xD;
play the devil v;itla any dinner."&#xD;
"Austin is a sensible fellow; he&#xD;
won't have any such nonsense."&#xD;
"Yes; but his wife is a New-York&#xD;
girl, Mr. Ledyard's daughter. They&#xD;
lived in great style. She will be sure&#xD;
to give us a caricature of her father's&#xD;
celebrated ~&#xD;
&#xD;
The flowek~&#xD;
"Well, we can go to the hotel&#xD;
after~vards."&#xD;
"Too late, my dear sir. This must&#xD;
line Austin's house; he said there was&#xD;
a pine grove across the road."&#xD;
A bright-looking young girl, with a&#xD;
white apron on, opened the door; and&#xD;
Judge Lorton and his friend found&#xD;
their brother lawyers assembled in&#xD;
the drawing-room, with its crimson&#xD;
hangings, and bright wood fire crack-&#xD;
ing on the hearth. Mrs. Austin 'vas&#xD;
talking merrily, dressed in her pret-&#xD;
tiest toilette, and looking quite unlike&#xD;
the heated, weary, anxious women,&#xD;
of whom Judge Lorton hind been&#xD;
talking. Presently young Judith&#xD;
aplicared at the door, and said, in a&#xD;
sInill treble, -&#xD;
"Dinner is ready, my lady."&#xD;
Old Judith persisted in calling&#xD;
Mrs. Austin " my lady; ~ and young&#xD;
Judith, who looked up to the grand-&#xD;
mother as an oracle, persisted in do-&#xD;
ing the sanac.&#xD;
"Do you observe my dignity?" said&#xD;
Mrs. Austin, taking the arm of the&#xD;
gentleman who had come in with&#xD;
Judge Lorton. "Little Judith would&#xD;
not deprive me of that title for the&#xD;
world." But, as she spoke, they I&#xD;
stepped across the threshold of the&#xD;
dining-room, and she felt her compan-&#xD;
ion start violently. She looked at him&#xD;
amazed, land then around the room:&#xD;
there was nothing there but the pret- ~&#xD;
tily-arranged dining-table, and Kate, t&#xD;
standing behind her chair, with a lit- ~&#xD;
tle salver in her hand. To besure, i:&#xD;
slm~ was wonderfully pretty, and had ~&#xD;
a color like a rose; but Judge Pierre- a&#xD;
pont was not tlae man to start at the s~&#xD;
sight of a pretty girl. All these a&#xD;
thoughts went headlong through ti&#xD;
Mrs. Austin's mind, as she took her d&#xD;
seat, and gave a quick, comprehdn- tl&#xD;
sive g~anee at the table. Judge n&#xD;
Pierrepomat was still staring at Kate,&#xD;
&#xD;
eper's Story.                   91&#xD;
with an amazed, amused expression,&#xD;
as well he might. She was his&#xD;
niece and ward, of whose general&#xD;
welfare he had lately heard through&#xD;
her aunt. Her whereabouts it&#xD;
seemed that he had too readily taken&#xD;
for granted; and this proof that she&#xD;
had carried out her mad scheme tri-&#xD;
umphantly filled him with a feeling&#xD;
in which indignation at heing thus&#xD;
outwitted, and admiration of her&#xD;
pluck, were equally mingled.&#xD;
Mrs. Austin happily forgot her&#xD;
momentary perplexity in her duties&#xD;
as hostess; and Kate, after the first&#xD;
flush at the entirely unexpected sight&#xD;
of her uncle, rose to the situation.&#xD;
Here was a magnificent, unhoped-&#xD;
for opportunity to prove her capacity&#xD;
under the eye of Uncle Roger; he&#xD;
need not take her word for it, he&#xD;
could see for himself. So she fixed&#xD;
her mind upon her work, as she had&#xD;
good reason to do, being obliged to&#xD;
change from cook to waiter at a&#xD;
moment's notice.&#xD;
The soup was delicious, clear, port-&#xD;
wine color, delicately flavored and&#xD;
not; and as the hungry lawyers ate,&#xD;
and took courage, she slipped out and&#xD;
put the turkey in its great dish, with&#xD;
an admiring look at its shining gold-&#xD;
mn-brown surface, and the compact&#xD;
ray in which it held its arms and&#xD;
egs. Then she covered it with a&#xD;
lish-cover, and went in again. Lit-&#xD;
le Judith removed the tureen and&#xD;
dates, and the dinner was brouglat&#xD;
a with all possible ease and quiet.&#xD;
frs. Austin smiled mischievously&#xD;
t the increasing satisfaction which&#xD;
pread over the faces of her guests,&#xD;
s the conviction grew upon them&#xD;
inat they were going to have a good&#xD;
inner, after all. She knew well that&#xD;
aeir experience was often sufficiently&#xD;
melanclaoly.&#xD;
As Kate moved to and fro, always&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="92-93" xml:id="VAC8019-00000047"/>&#xD;
f         92                 The&#xD;
watchful, always quiet, apparently&#xD;
absorbed in her business, and doing&#xD;
it well and thoroughly, she wns the&#xD;
ideal of a waiter, besides a great&#xD;
deal. of supererogatory excellence in&#xD;
the way of beauty and grace.&#xD;
The dessert stood ready on a side-&#xD;
table; and the fruit, a gracefully-&#xD;
arranged dish of golden oranges and&#xD;
i~rimson apples, stood all through&#xD;
dinner, as the central ornament.&#xD;
She placed the delicate custards&#xD;
and mince-pie, hot with fire and&#xD;
spice, on the table; and when they&#xD;
had been duly discussed and ap-&#xD;
proved, and the plates changed, the&#xD;
fruit was set before Mrs. Austin,&#xD;
nuts and crackers in their places,&#xD;
and Kate quietly left the room.&#xD;
There was a little shifting of chairs;&#xD;
people began a desultory cracking of&#xD;
nuts and peeling of oranges; - the&#xD;
conversation grew more informal.&#xD;
The more solid duties of dining ~ver'~&#xD;
concluded, and the more graceful&#xD;
part of dinner began.&#xD;
Old Mr. Merchant was saying,&#xD;
"Where did you find your cook, Mrs.&#xD;
Austin? she dresses a turkey better&#xD;
than Delmonico; and that mince-pie&#xD;
was a masterpiece. I suppose you&#xD;
would not forgive anybody who&#xD;
tempted her away.~~&#xD;
Then Judge Pierrepont's voice&#xD;
broke in. "Mrs. Austin, you are the&#xD;
most fortunate of modern women in&#xD;
your servants. Your cook is a para-&#xD;
gon. And what must we say of your&#xD;
waiter?"&#xD;
"That she is a beauty," said young&#xD;
Jenkins impetuously,-and then&#xD;
blushed violently, and drank, an&#xD;
immense tumbler of water.&#xD;
"What Would you say if I told&#xD;
you that the paragon and the&#xD;
you, Mrs. Austin," answered Judge&#xD;
beauty were one and the same?"&#xD;
"We would have to believe&#xD;
&#xD;
eeper's Story.&#xD;
Pierrepont politely; "but you try&#xD;
our powers to the cracking point."&#xD;
"It is indeed true, Judge Pierre-&#xD;
pont. She is my venture," said Mr.&#xD;
Austin laughingly, from his end of&#xD;
the table. "My wife failed several&#xD;
times in getting good servants, so I&#xD;
stepped in to the rescue; and you see&#xD;
the result: most of these domestic&#xD;
troubles arise from want of masculine&#xD;
judgment."&#xD;
"John, I will raise the shadow of&#xD;
'big ~argret,~ - but really," - and&#xD;
Mrs. Austin turned her laughing face&#xD;
from her husband, -" really, there&#xD;
must be some mystery about this&#xD;
girl of ours. She is a lady, and a&#xD;
cultivated, charming woman, and a&#xD;
first-rate cook and servant generally.&#xD;
Mr. Austin says he expects her to&#xD;
disappear at any time, like a friendly&#xD;
brownie of a superior type."&#xD;
"Does she do all your work?"&#xD;
asked Judge Pierrepont. "I do not&#xD;
ask from impertinent curiosity [&#xD;
will explain presently why I ~vish&#xD;
to know."&#xD;
"Yes, every thing; except the&#xD;
light dusting that I do."&#xD;
"Has she lived in the kitchen? or&#xD;
has her servitude been of the patri-&#xD;
archal description? Excuse me once&#xD;
more for asking such apparently&#xD;
impertinent questions. I have an&#xD;
object."&#xD;
"She has kept herself resolutely,&#xD;
provokingly, 'in her place,' as they&#xD;
call it. She does every thing, and&#xD;
a hundred times more than any ser-&#xD;
vant I ever had; and yet she has&#xD;
time for herself, and to do many ser-&#xD;
vices for other people. I would be&#xD;
glad to have such a woman for my&#xD;
friend, -but why do you ask, Judge&#xD;
~ierreponti~&#xD;
He looked down thoughtfully for&#xD;
a moment, and everybody looked ex-&#xD;
pectant.&#xD;
&#xD;
The ifouseke&#xD;
"I ask, my dear madam, because&#xD;
that young woman is my niece and&#xD;
ward; and her present position is&#xD;
owing to myself.~~&#xD;
"Let us go into the parlor, ex-&#xD;
claimed Mrs. Austin, rising. "Aiid&#xD;
can you tell me about her? I do so&#xD;
~vant to hear; and but she will&#xD;
leave me. Oh, how miserable 1"&#xD;
"I suppose she will," answered&#xD;
the judge, as they entered the parlor&#xD;
once more. And he proceeded to give&#xD;
a little outline of his promise to his&#xD;
niece, aiid her acceptance of it.&#xD;
"May I send for ~ asked&#xD;
Mrs. Austin.&#xD;
"If you will be so kind."&#xD;
She ~vent herself, and ran into the&#xD;
kitchen to find her treasure. Kate&#xD;
was leaning against the window,&#xD;
looking out into her favorite pines.&#xD;
There was a peculiar light in her&#xD;
eyes, as she turned; she knew in a&#xD;
moment that her uncle had spoken,&#xD;
and she seized Mrs. Austin's out-&#xD;
stretched hand, and they both laughed&#xD;
heartily. "Come in, dear Kate. I&#xD;
knew it was too good to last. Oh,&#xD;
dear I and why hadn't I the sense and&#xD;
courage to mafre you come and spend&#xD;
all your evenings with me?~~&#xD;
"It would not have been a fair&#xD;
trial; but really, fortune was kind to&#xD;
send Uncle Roger here just at my&#xD;
grand climax."&#xD;
The two pretty women entered the&#xD;
parlor together, one in her neat&#xD;
working-dress, the other bright in her&#xD;
dinner toilette.&#xD;
Judge Pierrepont rose to meet his&#xD;
niece, and embraced her more cor-&#xD;
dially than he had ever done before.&#xD;
He liked pluck, and in the excite-&#xD;
ment of the moment, that feeling&#xD;
overshadowed the annoyance that&#xD;
had a place in his heart; and, besides,&#xD;
he had fairly challenged her to the&#xD;
triaL&#xD;
&#xD;
eper'8 Story.                  93&#xD;
Miss Kate blushed a little, as hei&#xD;
uncle presented her to the company&#xD;
as his niece, and was conscious of a&#xD;
certain wrath at his betrayal of her;&#xD;
at which, in truth, he somewhat won-&#xD;
dered himself.&#xD;
There is. no catastrophe to our&#xD;
story, and so it must stop. Uncle&#xD;
Roger was completely beaten, and lie&#xD;
was man enough to accept hi~ defeat&#xD;
gracefully.&#xD;
Kate had chatted but a few min-&#xD;
utes with her old friends and new,&#xD;
when she rose with a slight start,&#xD;
saying, -&#xD;
"There! I had almost forgotten&#xD;
my coffee!"&#xD;
There was a ludicrous mixture of&#xD;
impulses in the minds of the com-&#xD;
pany.&#xD;
~ by no means I" excJaimed&#xD;
old Mr. NToyes. And then he felt so&#xD;
keenly the propriety of the coffee,&#xD;
that his polite speech made him feel&#xD;
ashamed; and the like trace of&#xD;
thoughts, whether uttered or not, was&#xD;
in every mind in the room. Kate,&#xD;
however, with that natural directness&#xD;
of hers, - the only soul there who felt&#xD;
no double motive, -- had already put&#xD;
forth her hand to leave the parlor,&#xD;
when little Judith appeared at the&#xD;
door, bearing a tray, arranged very&#xD;
neatly, which she placed oaths table&#xD;
near Mrs. Austin, with a glance of&#xD;
swelling pride at Kate, whose aston..&#xD;
ished face was the one thing desired&#xD;
to complete the little creature's satls-&#xD;
faction.&#xD;
"Shure, ma'am, it's busy ye were;&#xD;
an' I tho't best to send it in mesel';"&#xD;
and with a little courtesy, inherited&#xD;
from old Judith, she stood firm, to&#xD;
Kate's delight.&#xD;
The coffee was delicious. Kate&#xD;
could not have done better herself.&#xD;
And when the little maiden had gone,&#xD;
she said,-&#xD;

Boinotbing Entiroly Now, aI11 of Groat Iniportanco to tbo Musical Vorl~.&#xD;
By peculiar construction, for which letters patent have been granted to GEG. H.&#xD;
DAVIS, under date of Oct. 27th, 1873, we are prepared to furnish an Upright Piano&#xD;
that WILL stand in tune as iveli as any Square or Grand Piano made, thereby over-&#xD;
coming the great objection to theUpright Piano, whichhas been feitand acknowledged&#xD;
by all makers and dcaiers in the world. This patented linproveiflent is no experi-&#xD;
ment. It is not the work of a day or a year, but is the result of ,nany years of&#xD;
careful examination and study, and the result is beyond question. It is secured by&#xD;
the peculiar combInation of the sounding-board and the arrangement of the bridge&#xD;
upon the same, viz.: our patented iron frame Is so entirely different from all others,&#xD;
and so connected and bolted to the wooden frame of the Piano (one feature tif its&#xD;
great strength), that it leaves the sounding-board with the bridge and bearing&#xD;
detached, and entirely separate froma the Iron Frame, so that the objection to the&#xD;
metallic or iron tone is removed. We have also produced another feature of greqe&#xD;
value, viz.: the quantity, with the peculiar singing quality of tone, surpassing, as it&#xD;
does, any other Upright or ~quare Grand Piano, and fully equal to a Paior tirand.&#xD;
The above facts will be acknowledged by all who will call and examine the instro-&#xD;
Piano Fortes, and having fully tested the improvement referred to, we arc prepared&#xD;
meats. With an experience of between thirty and &amp;amp;rty years in tile manufacture of&#xD;
to furnish Upright Pianos that ivill meet the want so long felt, and at prices that&#xD;
cannot fail to be satisfactory. We extend a most cordial Invitation to all lovers of&#xD;
music, and all interested, to call and see, hear, and examine the great improvement&#xD;
for themselves.&#xD;
Our prices will be found within the reach of all who wish a first-class Instrument.&#xD;
