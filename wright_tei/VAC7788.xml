SKINNER. :"Inasmitmh as ye have done it unto the least of these, ye have done it unto me."  NEW  YORK. CHARLES SCRIBNER, 145 NASSAU STREET  1853.  &#xD;<pb n="0" xml:id="VAC7788-00000002"/> Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1853, BY P. H. SKINNER, In the Clerk's Oilce for the Southern District of New York.    THE scenes of this little story, as its title indi Cates,- lie among a class hitherto negieotad, and but little noticed by refined society, except with disgust and loathing. But the sun of a brighter day for them is dawn- ing. Many warm and noble hearts are now being enlisted in their behalf. The precepts of Him, who, above all others, is their best friend, are now begin- ning to move the hearts of many, and must soon sway their mighty influence far and wide. He said, Suffer the least of these (ragged though they be) to come to me and turn them not away. The fact that we have these in many of our large cities numbering to thousands and tens of thousands, has given rise to the title of this little work in the mind of the author. Its object is to enlist sym- pathy for these little defenceless ones. The fact that they are defenceless is sufficient apology, in the mind of the -author, for speaking. Shall it enlist but one more warm and generous 'heart to act for them, searching out and alleviating their sufferings, our work will not be in vain. Most of the scenes brought out in this little work are facts which have come directly under the author's notice, during his labors among this class.   &#xD;<pb n="0 (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC7788-00000003"/>   CONTENTS.

"OH, if I could put an end to it and .not hurt it," said a poor woman, as she raised her. head from her pillow of straw, and gazed upon her little, pale, emaciated, half frozen infant, only a few weeks old.

A cold gust of wind once more drives the now through the crevices in the wall against which she is lying. Her limbs are almost palsied. She has scarce rags enough to cover her body. There is no warm fire on the heath, inviting her to come near; for there is no hearth there. There is no warm food awaiting her to arise and eat; for there is no food nor oven cupboard in that dark cellar.

My hands, my feet, they are frozen! My head -oh! my head!"All is still for a moment. She is in deep medita- tion.- Poor woman I she has suffered much. Do you, my young reader, ask how?I will tell you. Her little child is but a few weeks old, its name is Thomas. She has called it' after its father, for he it is upon whom all her hopes in this world have depended. For, she said, "though he be unkind to me, yet I love -him still. Yes, if he does get drunk and beat me. If he does neglect me here alone and leave me to mourn and die. Yet he ismy husband. He is all I have in this world." But where is her husband, do you ask? Poor woman, she has no husband. He is now dead. Soon after the birth of little Tommy, his father came home almost sober, which was the first time for many weeks.  :.               .   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.   15 He had beeni laboring for a few days and had earned a little money, a part of which he had brought home with him. On seeing the little babe he seemed to be very happy. He took it in his arms and kissed it again and again; then turned to its mother, and said, "what shall we call it?" "Call it," said the mother, "I shall call it Thomas, after its father." "ThoasThomas Thomas" said the father. "What, after me! After its poor fa- ther!" Yes, after you." ' Oh, Mary," said the father, 'you' are so good to me. I have been so unkind to you. Oh, Mary, I will never get drunk again while I' live. Oh, Ma- ry, I do love you as much as ever." He was one of the kindest of men when he waws not drunk; but, step after step, in his drunken career, he had taken, until he had become so degraded that he had lost all respect for him- self. His unnatural appetite for rum has become so strong as to have the perfect control er him. He is now no more a man-but a slave.

He is led captive by the tyrant alcoholI "Here, Mary," said he, "here is some money, you take the purse and all the money I have- 'nen I shall have nothing to get drunk. with. I will never drink any more rum while I live. No, Mary, I never will. For your sake-and the sake of this dear little Tommy, I will never drink any more grog." "Oh," said the mother, "you have told me that so often, I fear you will." "No Mary, I will not. No, I will not. As true as there is a God in heaven, I will not touch another drop of grog while I live." So saying, he left the room in haste, but soon after returned, with a pistol in his hand, and placing it on the table before him, he said: "'Mary, I have ruined myself. I have destroyed your happiness in this world by drinking that infernal rum. I have promised you often to quit drinking; you know I have tried to keep my pledge; you know I have pro:ised God and man; yes, I have promised you again and again.

So saying, he got down upon his knees, by the table, and placing one hand upon the pistol, and grasping Mary's hand with the other, he said, "Mary, my dear wife, I call upon you to witness what I say, I call upon God and all the holy angels to witness what I promise you; Mary, I will never drink another drop of grog while I live." "NoI another drop of that liquid fire shall never enter these veins. I have loaded this pistol, Mary, with a double load. I shall carry it there the rest of my days," said he, placing it in his pocket, by his side. "NoW, Mary, the first drop I drink, that ball shall tear this heart into a thousand pieces." "Oh, stop," said Mary, "you frighten me. Oh, don't-don't, 'sheried. She was too weak. She could not endure it. Her cheeks turned pale. She sunk into her chair. She was breathless for a few moments. She was then seized with spasms, which lasted for hours, and from the effects of whic she never fully recovered.

He had kept his pledge with firm determination, until one day Mary was apparently asleep. He thought he would' leave her a few moments to go and get some money from his employer, as there was a 'few shillings due him. He went, but did not get the money. On returning, he passed the 'door of one of the old grog-shops that were standing so thick and fast on every corner of the streets, where he had so often spent his money, and wasted his time in drunkenness and debauchery. As he came by the door he thought of his resolutions. He started as if he would run from the temptation-but just at that moment the door opened, and he saw onesf his old companions standing at the bar, in the act of pouring down a glass of grog. The moment he saw the sparkling fluid, he felt the cravings of that horrid appetite burn- ing in his bosom. He was overcome. A sud- den trembling seized his whole being. He rushed:into the grog-shop, placed himself be- fore the bar, and reaching out his trembling hand, he cried, " give me-give me the bottle.  .    "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.   19 Yes, though it burn my soul and body up in hell, I will have it-yes-- wz-give it me." So saying, he grasped the bottle and filled the glass to its brim; then placing it- to his lips he drank the whole of it. No sooner had he replaced the glass upon the board, then he re- membered his resolutions. He drew the pistol from his pocket, and placing it at his breast, he said: "It is the last-I will' not live." Turning his fierce eyes upward, he cried, "Oh, Heaven! protect Mother, Lizzy, and dear little Tommy." In an instant the ball pierced his heart, and he fell senseless upon the floor of tthat filthy grog-shop, with the blood gushing from his mouth and nose. He was soon taken to the hospital where, in a few hours, he breathed his last. I '  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7788-00000010"/> l               r CHAPTER    II. DURING this time, the landlord had come for the rent, and the poor woman had no money to pay him. Of course, she must be removed from the upper room where they had been living, and the little furniture they had must be sold to satisfy the demands of the greedy landlord. Sick, pale, and emaciated, she is compelled to leave her dwelling, and all she has on earth that is dear to her. With her little child in her arms, she saunters forth to seek a refuge from the wintry blasts in this dark and filthy cellar. Here is where we find her now. She has no husband. He is dead- but she does not know it yet. ;. The remains of her husband, but a few days :?ii: e, were buried from all human view. No j wife has followed them to the tomb, for   "TTLE RAGGED TET THOUSAND.   21 she knows not where he is. She little thinks that that loved form which has so often been the recipient of her fond embrace, is there. She little dreams that the remains of him whom she has loved more dearly than her own life are now lying mangled and mouldering, be- neath the clod. Let us see! poor woman  she sobs aloud! the bitter tears are scalding those pale and almost frozen cheeks. But, ah! she knows not-all her grief yet I She has another child.

During her fa- ther's absence, her mother has sent her to beg something to keep them from starving, buf on returning home, she found the cold room empty and desolate. "Mother mother!" she cried, but no kind mother was there. She searched the closet again and again, then she went to the chimney, and looking up it, she cried, "mother! dear mother! oh mother! where are you and little Bub?"Thus shewalked around the room for hours, calling for h m'o- ther and her little brother until it grew dark. When she was;so chilled and fatigued that she  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7788-00000011"/> 22  LITTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND. could scarcely walk about any longer, she went to the window, and stood weeping and rubbing the tears from her little cheeks with the ragged sleeves of her dress. But she soon fell asleep, and threw herself upon the floor, where she lay until nearly midnight, when a man came up-stairs with a light in his hand, and seeing the little girl lying upon the floor, and the old basket by her side, with a few pieces of cold meat and bread in it, he seized her by the arm, and kicking the basket before him, he dragged her down stairs and laid her upon the pavement near the door, saying, "There, you little brat! Let me catch you in there again, dirtying up my house with your dirty rags and filthy bread and bones, and I'll fix you, so that you won't want to come there again." He is the agent He it is in whom much power is vested. The power to rob i widows and orphans of all they have on ? earth, and turn them empty into the street. And all this they must do to save the landlord the paltry sum of a week's rent. 3 But where did poor little Lizzy go in that   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.   2 cold, dark, and dreary night? perhaps you ask. I will tell you. She arose from the. pave- ment and felt her way around the buildings un- til she came into a filthy, narrow lane. It was so dark that she could see nothing around her. She soon fell into a hole, which was the en- trance to an old cellar. She was too much frightened and too cold to cry. She felt her way down into the cellar. There was no light there, but she thought she heard a voice in the further end which frightened her still more. She stood listening and trembling with fear. Soon she heard the sound again. Distinctly she heard these words." Oh, where is my dear little Lizzy? Where is she?"She knew the voice. It was her mother's I She screamed with all her might,-"Mother! mother I mo- ther!" and ran towards the place from whence she heard the sound; where she soon once more felt her gentle mother's kind em- brace, as she lay upon that filthy straw, only partially covered with the few rags that had been left her by the agent when she was driven out from her home into the street.  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7788-00000012"/> 24  LITTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND. "But where is Lizzy now?" perhaps you, my young reader, are ready to ask. I will tell you. Lizzy is a good: little girl. She has crept lightly away, and has gone out to beg something for her poor mother's breakfast. Poor thing, she has no shoes or stockings on her feet. She has no bonnet or hoo to cover her head, she has no cloak or shawl to ward off the blasting winds. She has nothing on her but one old tattered garment, which is so large that she is compelled to hold it with her little hands, to keep it about her body. She has been begging ever since before it was light. She has already been to many doors this morn- ing. She has stemmed the chilling blast, while others are still asleep. She tells each one as she passes, "I fear poor mother will die." And with bitter tears, she adds; "yes, sweet little Tommy, too. He lies so cold in yonder dark cellar." She is now urging her claims with great earnestness upon some passer-by. Or, perhaps, she is just now ringing the bell at some basement door. Would you, my little reader, see her gentle   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.   25 countenance and gaze upon her little sparkling eyes as they glisten through the icicles and frozen tears upon her cheeks, and meekly learn of. her sweet patience and perseverance? If yes, then go seek her in yonder street. Be not afraid of those rags. ;Ask her name. She will tell you. Take that thick shawl from your now more than warm clad shoulders, and place it upon her shivering form. Now look at her little eyes. See?  They sparkle. Wipe that tear away, and kiss that half frozen cheek. Does she not love you now?   Oh, what joy is this, that we can make another smile. Then smile. Oh, smile. 'Tis not in vain- Yes, smile, and thou shalt smile again. 3  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7788-00000013"/> CHAPTER     III. ON Lizzy's return home, she had to pass many of the low, filthy shops or dens that so infest our cities, standing forth like poisonous ulcers on every limb; which it seems almost impossible for the smallest child that prattles through our streets, even in this boasted day of temperance and purity, to avoid., Many of these dens may be readily recognised by the numerous signs painted, written, hung and stuck in every manner, way, shape and style. At the first glance, the little prattler sees stuck in the window, a stale ginger cake, or a few sticks of candy, twisted and colored in every manner to attract the little eye and catch the penny. The next that glisten in his view are the little " brandy drops," four for a penny, in each of which are just enr)ugh grog   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.   27 to form a taste for it, and create a desire for something stronger.

What's that you've got?" seizing her by the hair of her head, and pulling her  backwards down the filthy steps, and looking her in the face, she said, "I know you now; yes, I do. I know you,. you little ragged  skulk. You can't cheatme. I amtoo old for you yet. You arethe very little brat that use to come after grog for old Tom the carpenter. Yes, and he's the very old coon that killed himself-right there-the other day, and there is the very pistol that he did it with," said she,  stepping hastily behind the old board, and taking it from the shelf from among the bottles  and holding it up to her view. Poor Lizzy, she remembered the pistol. She -remembered the words of her father, when he  knelt down by the table and spoke so earnest-  ly. "Yes," said the old woman, turning to the drunken by-standers, "yes, and don't you think the old thief did it just to get rid of pay-   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.  29  ing his grog-bill? Yes, I've got ten marks there on the wall against him now.

And, don't you think, just as quick as they had taken him away, I went to find his old woman, to make her pay the bill; and sure enough she had picked up duds and skulked off; so that I couldn't find her neither. And all that jist to cheat a poor old woman out of her hard earnins'" "Yes," said a drunken bystander, "and old Bill Johnson, just over there, says he owes him a lot more. And I don't believe anybody on this 'arth knows how much he does owe." "Well, I'll have all I can get," said the old woman, as she wrenched the pennies from poor Lizzy's hand, and snatched the basket from her arm.

She is privileged far above many others around  her. She has a right to sell the liquid poison. I A right to send degradation, misery, and want,  to all around her. This, too, without endan- gering her high standing in society, for her  good character has been sworn to by the offi- cers of our government. She holds a diploma of a legalized, a licensed agent, of a highly christianized and enlightened nation. Is it be- cause of her ingenuous-her noble character in the sight of our rulers that she is thus privi- leged? Dear little Lizzie uttered not a word. She meekly endured all. But on finding herself re- leased from the powerful grasp of her enemy, she flew out of the door and ran across the street. Just as she had reached the opposite pavement, she fell senseless upon the hard   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND   -31 stone, where she lay for a few moments unno- ticed. It was too much for her. She could not endure it. She knew her father's hat and boots. She saw the blood upon his coat, which she recognized too well to be mistaken. Poor little thing! 'NWe can only imagine her feelings as she flew from that den ofinfamy; for words cannot describe them. Soon a man came along, and seeing her, he stooped down and lifted her up. She was pale. She scarcely breathed. As soon as she had recovered a little from this stupor, she burst into a flood of tears, and. said, "I want to go home to see my dear mother." It was some time before she found her way through the filthy lanes, and reached the en- trance to that dismal cellar. Her poor mother has waited long. She is sick, hungry, cold, and almost exhausted. She has left her little, babe upon the straw and found her way to the foot of the steps. She has become impatient, and has thought to go out and beg something to satisfy the cravings of hunger, but she is too weak. She could not climb those rugged  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7788-00000016"/>  steps. She has been listening to the conversa- tion of some passers-by. She could not hear  much. But she has heard one of them say,  "that a man killed himself a day or two since with a pistol, in a grog-shop, only a few squares  off."- "With a pistol!" she muttered to her-  self. "With a pistol! Can it be him." "What  was his business'?" asked one. "I do not know," replied the other, "but they say he  was a carpenter."      ! "A carpenter!" said she. "A carpenter! It must be him. Oh, gracious heaven! was that my husband?  Can it be that it was my dear, dear husband? He was a hard husband, yet he was my husband."  She listened again. "What was his name?" asked one. "I will not be certain," was the reply, "but I think they called him uncle Tom."  "Thomas! Thomas!" rehearsed the mother. "Oh, sure it must be him! Yes--I fear-I fear it was my husband! Is he dead?" she cried. "Oh, can it be that my dear husband is dead?"Just at this moment, Lizzy appeared at the en- trance. She saw her mother sitting on the   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.   33 steps below. She did not wait to go clear down the steps, but throwing herself with both arms extended upon her poor, sick mo- ther's neck, she cried; Ma! Oh, ma! dear ma! father is dead. Ma, I know he is dead! I saw the gun, ma; and father's coat, too. Oh, ma, I saw it; it was all bloody. Yes, ma, it wlas. Dear ma, I know poor father is dead, for the woman said it was my father. Yes, dear ma, poor father is dead."' The mother doubts no longer. Her husband is dead. She is alone, and her dear little children are now orphans. Her hopes for this world are de- stroyed. No friendly hand is extended to sus- tain her in her moments of disconsolatness. No kind mourners bow around to share with her the bitter tears of grief. Here is where we find her now. She is shedding those bitter tears alone.  .  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7788-00000017"/> CHAPTER IV. W"EEKS have passed away. The old woman has been watching poor little Lizzy to find where she went that she might make her mother pay the pending debt. She has at last found her, and on going down into that dismal cellar she found Lizzy's poor mother lying  upon that straw so sick as to be scarcely able to converse with her. -Yet she demands the  money for her husband's grog bill; but, on i finding no money, she took the only warm  blanket that was left, which had been given 6 little Lizzy by a good woman only a few days - previous. Not satisfied with that, she has stolen little Tommy, too, away from his poor sick and dying mother. She now carries him around in her bosom, that she may the more readily attract the sympathies of the benevo-   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.   35 lent. She has already stolen six little chil- dren in different ways, and carried them around with her to aid her in begging, until each has become so large that she can carry it no longer. Then she has turned them out to beg by themselves, and as often as she can find them, she takes from them all they have, and sends them forth weeping to beg again. Lizzy's poor sick mother's load of grief has become too great. She has sunk under it. She took Lizzy by the hand, and after com-. mending her and little Tommy to God, she said, "My dear Lizzy, you are the only pro- tector little Tommy has in this world. Your father is dead; your mother will soon die. You have no one to protect you in this cold and unfeeling world. Taking from under her head an old Bible and handing it to Lizzy, she said, "My dear child, I wish you to learn to read this Bible, and read it every day. Keep it to remember your poor dying mother by. Do you never forget to pray to God for little Tommy. Always do right, my child, and God will hear your little prayers, and bless   &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7788-00000018"/> 36  LITTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND. you. Now, my dear child, your mother must die. When I am dead, go find Tommy, and do not leave him, but watch him by day and by night.  So farewell, dear Lizzy! Farewell I Heaven will protect you, my dear child. Then farewell! farewell " Drawing Lizzy's little face close to hers, as her last effort, she kissed her, and whispered, "Fare- well! dearest Lizzy--farewell!" and breathed her. last. On that cold wintry morning that poor little girl was found by the officer in that dark, damp cellar, with her little arms clasped around the cold-,eck of her poor dead mother. The big tears were running down her pale cheeks. Her little bright eyes were gazing upward to heaven. And he heard her say, "Ma, dear Ma, will you never come and smile any more, and kiss us again so sweetly?" The officer took the corpse away and buried  them out of poor Lizzy's sight.   CHAPTERI     V. "O! mamma," said little Lucy, as she stood looking from the window of a large brick house street, in the city of , "oh! nam- ma, do see what a pretty little baby that is.

Hastening down stairs with all her-might, she ran to the base-  ment door; and on opening it, she saw the old  woman standing with her hands extended to  receive anything that might be given her.  i Little Lucy was almost frightened as she looked upon the distorted countenance, fiercer red  eyes, and filthy fattered garments of the old  woman. She shrunk back into the room, and  running to the servant girl," she said, "Betsy, Betsy, come here;i do, Betsy-do come--and  take this pretty little baby for me. I want to i see it, Betsy-and f am afraid of the old woman."  Her mother coming into the room, she said, "mamma, is'nt this a sweet little' baby? Oh I mamma, it is just about as big as little Billy! Is'nt it, mamma? Mamma,  may'nt (Betsy go and bring little Billy down and see if it aint just as big as' he is?" "Yes," said Mrs. B.

"Yes," said Mrs. B., "it is, indeed, a pretty ,    "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.   39 little child. Is this your child?" said she to the woman. "Yes, marm," replied the beggar-woman. "But it can't be that such a pretty little sweet baby belongs to such an old creature," said Betsy, as she brought little Willie into the room. "I was just agoing to say, ma'am," said she, "that it is prettier than Willie him- self; but you know I wouldn't say so, for Willie is yours, is'nt he, ma'am?" "W ell, indeed, it is a .pretty child," replied Mrs. B., sniling at Betsy's simplicity. "Is'nt it, mamma?" exclaimed Lucy. "What is its name?" asked Mrs. B. "Well, marm, they call him Tommy, marm." "How old is it?" interrogated Betsy. "I don't just know, marm," said the old woman; "guess he's pretty much after going on three months old, marm." "Why, mamma, what makes it so pale?" asked Lucy. "Don't it have anything to eat, mamma?"  "No, replied the beggar-woman;, it haint eat anything to-day. Please marm, give me a &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7788-00000020"/> 40  LITTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND. few pennies. Please marm, if you have any old clothes, for the little baby is sick, marm.

"Come here, little girl. Whose child are you?" Littlegirl. "I have no father, ma'am."  Mrs. B. "Where is your mother, then?" Little girl. "I have no mother, ma'am." Mrs. B. "What is your name?" Little girl. "My name is Lizzy, ma'am." Mrs. B. "Where do you live?" The little girl hung her head and could not answer. The big tears stole down her cheeks, for she could no longer suppress them. Mrs. B. "Eave you no brother or sister, Lizzy?" izzy. "Yes, ma'am. This is my little brow ther." -Mrs. B. "Is this your mother, too?"   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.   41 Lizzy. "No, ma'am.

Lucy. "What made 'am die?" asked little Lucy, looking very sad. Lizzy. "If they didn't sell any poison liquor," said Lizzy, rubbing the big tears from her eyes, "then poor father wouldn't been drunlk, and killed himself. Dear mother, too, she wouldn't died neither. Yes; then father and mother both would took care of sweet little. Tommy and me, too. Wouldn't they, kind woman?" The old beggar-woman who had been listen- ing very impatiently, was now seen making her way up the steps as fast as possible, not stopping to take the pieces of bread and meat that Betsy had been preparing for her., This is the very old woman that sold the-grog to Lizzy's poor father in that dreadful grog-shop,   &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7788-00000021"/> 42 ' LITTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.  where he killed himself, you remember, with a pistol. She it was that stole the ragged coat,  all covered with blood, off from his half-dead  body, before the police took him to the hospi- tal. She spends a part of her time in begging cold victuals, old clothes, or any thing she can  get; then goes and sells them for liquor, which : she takes into that old cellar an d peddles out to the crowd around her, both old and  young, until she has made them all drunk, and has become so drunk herself that she can no  longer stand or sit up, or until she has used up  all the grog she has. Then she will go out 'and beg again as soon as she is sober enough to stagger from door to door. This is the way  she spends her life. She is a lawful rum seller. It will be remembered that she is  licensed by the authorities of a great and powerful city or state. She pays for her license ten dollars a year. She Bas a right to deal out that poison. Yes, she may, and will poison anybody she can, from the "President of the United States," to the smallest and dirtiest beggar child that paddles in the filthy   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.   43 mud at the "Five Points," provided she can get her penny. You are now ready to pour contempt and blame upon this wretched woman4 But which is most to be blamed, this poor degraded, igno- rant woman, that stands behind that old board and deals out that horrid poison by the penny's worth, or the wise la-giver? The educated, enlightened, and christianized statesman, that sits in his exalted seat and grants her the license, signs the contract and seals to her the right to poison and murder her neighbors and her neighbors' children? She is indeed guilty enough. But how much more guilty such a statesman who sits on his seat and coolly legis- lates such a law? Again, think not that this woman is alone. While she is looked upon by the world as being the lowest and most degraded of that class of beings, yet hers is not an isolated case; we have them by hundreds and thous- ands, swarming our streets like the locusts of Egypt, devouring every thing around them, from this beggarly retailer to the wealthiest &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7788-00000022"/> "  LITTL'. RAGGED TEN THOUSAND. and most genteel wholesale murderers. Her influence is limited-theirs is unbounded. She pays her ten dollars to destroy hundreds-  they pay their hundreds and ruin their thous-  ands. Mrs. B. stood in profound silence while little Lizzy rehearsed her woes. She told of her poor mother's pale cheeks and dreadful death alone in that dark cellar. She told of her father's horrid end. And she said her poor  father could not keep from drinking that bad I whiskey when they would sell it to him. "What makes 'urn let 'urn sell the bad whis- key so then, mother?" asked little Lucy, who  had been standing with her hands stretched  out, and her mouth wide open, gazing Lizzy  earnestly in the face. The big tears were run-  ning down her cheeks; her little heart was beating and throbbing; and her bosom heaved  with mingled emotions of indignation and grief. '"What makes 'urn let the wicked men sell such bad poison, mother? Say, mother, what makes 'am? Father wouldn't let 'um; would he, mother?" "What makes 'ur let 'urn,   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.   45 kind woman?" said Tlizy. Mrs. B. answered not a word; her feelings were overcome by the simple reasonings of the little girls. Turn- ing from the scene, she retired to her room with a heavy heart to meditate upon what had passed before her. The interrogations of little Lucy and the answers of the little beggar girl, lay with deep weight upon the mind of Mrs. B. The mo- mentous questions in the simple words of her little child, had been revolved again and again in her mind: "What makes 'um let 'um sell this poison?"This is a question for statesmen to answer. Would that a satisfactory answer could be given. Would that the interrogations of these "Little Ragged Ten Thousand," alone could be answered. But we hope for a better day.   &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7788-00000023"/> CHAPTER    VI.

Mrs. B. tried for some time to satisfy the   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.   47 inquiring mind of her little child, but in vain, until she arose and went to the side-board, and taking from it a bottle of wine, she said, "Well, my child, it looks something like this."

Is'nt she?"said the mother: to aunt Lucy, as she came into the room. "You see if you can't satisfy the child's mind in i some way. I have tried my best, and I can't do anything with her. I can't answer one half of her questions. She will fret herself to death if we don't satisfy her in some way."  Aunt Lucy. "' I never saw such a child.

"Well, we must satisfy her mind in some way, or she will fret about it all night, and her father will have to get up with her agaii, as he did one night after the beggars were here." Lucy. "Aunt, what makes mother keep this bad poison here? I am 'fraid it will kill  somebody. Wont it, aunt?" Aunt Lucy. "Listen, listen, my child," taking Lucy upon her lap. "Listen to me now, and I will tell you. This is what we drink. It won't hurt us if we don't take too much of it. If we take too much it will make us dizzy and crazy."  Lucy. "What made it kill the beggar girl's  father, then?" Aunt. "Because, my child, he took too much."                '  I Lncy.

"Well, you won't drink any of it, will you, aunt? Nor, you won't, will you, mother?" To these interrogations the child obtained no reply, but the servant was called, and she was sent to the nursery. There was too much truth couched in the simple words of that in- nocent child. Weeks passed away, and Lucy was often found at the window, watching for the poor beggar children. Sometimes she would, run to her mother, aunt, or her older sisters, and ask them to come to the window to see the poor beggar children, as they passed. Then she would ask a great many questions about them. Sometimes she would be found at the base- ment door watching for them to come along. Then she would run to the servants and ask them to give her something for the poor chil- dren to eat. If the servants refused her, she would cry as if her heart would break. Some- times she would run to her father, when he came in from his business, and say, "father, you won't take any of the bad poison that 5 &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7788-00000025"/> 50  LITTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND. made the little beggar children's father die. Will you, father?"Sometimes she would put a part of her own breakfast, in her apron and keep it for Lizzy. When she came along she  would give it to her. Then she would stand  and talk with her for hours, and ask' her all manner of questions about where she lived, and  where she slept. One day she took off her little shawl, and gave it to her and said, she did not need it, for she had another new one. One Sabbath afternoon, the family were all assembled around the hearth. Mr. B. was lying upon the sofa,-and Lucy stood by his  side with her little head leaning upon his K bosom. Her mother read a chapter from the : Bible. She read where the Saviour says,  "When thou makest a feast, call the poor, the  maimed, the lame, the blind."  , 41 After her mother had finished reading, Lucy : said:                  i -"Father, what does that mean that mother  read about a feast?"

Mrs. B. followed her child to the basement door, where she saw eight or ten beggar children, that Lucy had called into the yard, and invited to dine with her.  "Pooh," said Mrs. B., "I wonder what next.  Betsy, go and drive those dirty vagabonds out, and fasten the gate; then take this child to the nursery, and tell the nurse to keep her there. What a child that is.   She would have a Bible feast, indeed-she'thinks everything in the Bible is in earnest. If every- body thought as she does, we shouldn't have any of these little ragged ten thousand left long," said Mrs. B. to herself, as she turned away from the ragged crowd around the door.

Lucy, who was sitting in her little chair  close by her father's side, had been watching with grqat earnestness, every motion.  She had evidently been struggling to keep the ascend-  ancy over her feelings.  A big tear now stole  down her cheek. "What is the matter, my child?" asked her  mother.  Poor child.  She could contain her feelings no longer.  She burst into a flood of tears, and  said; "I don't want father to drink that bad poison." * Kindly presented by one whose heartfelt sympathy  with the Saviour ever leadser to long for the good of  these little ones.

This only made the child cry the louder, for she could not'contain her feelings. It seemed as if her little heart would break. "I don't want any of you to drink the bad poison. It killed the little beggar children's father and mother, and I don't want it to kill father and mother, nor sister Ann, nor bro- ther, nor aunt Lucy, nor anybody." "Take that child away, Betsy, to the nur- sery," said Mrs. B. "The poor child must be unwell," said her father, "I am afraid she is agoing to be sick."

DURING all this time Lizzy has followed the  old beggarwoman and her little brother by day  and by night, and has passed through many  horrid scenes. Sometimes sleeping on the 3 pavement; sometimes on that old grog-shop  floor; sometimes in the station-house; some-  times the old woman would get drunk, and? leave her and little Tommy for days. Then  she would find them again, and fasten the poor  little child to her body in such a way as to I make it cry almost continually, that she might : attract the attention and pity of the passing  multitude.

Oftentimes sores could be seen on his little body, caused in this way, which would remain for weeks. She carries vinegar and some horrid nostrums with her continually, which she pours into the child's stomach, to keep it pale and sickly. All this, that she may the better work upon the sympa- thies of the benevolent. Tommy had now become so large and so inured to hardships, that it was tQo much trouble for the old woman to make him cry and carry him at the same time. So she left him with his sister, after taking everything from his body that could possibly be useful to her, in case she found another victim. This poor old creature is the terror of all The Little "Ragged Ten Thousand." She goes by the name of Old Zag. She has often been taken up by the police for stealing, and put in the Tombs. More than once the court-found quantities of gold about her. At one time, the amount of seventy-five dollars in gold was found sewed up in one corner of her old filthy garment. &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7788-00000029"/> 58  LITTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND. Time has rolled rapidly away, and each day has brought its changing scenes. Several i times Tommy and his little sister have been  taken up by the police and put in the Tombs  as vagrants, or shut up in the station-house, to  spend the night, locked in cells with wicked  profane gamblers and drunken wretches, who  delight in using all their powers to debase, degrade and destroy those within their reach. Many things have transpired in connection I with our little ragged friends which, no doubt,  would be truly interesting to our young read- ers, that must pass unnoticed. But there are :I some things we cannot forbear relating. 'n"i i **I   CHAPTER IX. ONE evening, the cold winds blew, and the snow flew in a dreadful hurricane. Lizzie and Tommy had slept under the fish-market the night previous, and had been begging around from door to door all day, until they were nearly frozen. They came to an old tenant- building, where several families were living, or rather staying. They slyly found their way up several flights of stairs, hoping to find some vacant room where they might stay during the night, sheltered from the wintry storms. They finally came to a room where the door stood partly open. Tommy looked in, and not see- ing any one, he said, "let's go in, -TLiy,"' pull- ing her with one hand, and pushing the door with the other.. "Come in, Lizzy," said he, not noticing that there was any one in the room, &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7788-00000030"/> 60  LITTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND. as his sister had thrown her old ragged shawl  over his head; and shoulders, if possible, to keep  him from freezing. "Who's there?" muttered a poor drunken  woman, who sat on the hearth, half naked, with  her long and disheveled hair hanging in every  direction around her head and shoulders. She  had no stockings or shoes on her feet. Her face and limbs were bloated, and indeed, she was a frightful picture to behold.    i "Who's there?" said she. "It's us, ma'am," replied TLizy. "We didn't  know anybody lived here, ma'am." Our little friends were greatly frightened, i and started to run down stairs. "Come here-here--come here," said the i woman.  The children were afraid to run away, and  were afraid to stay.  "Come here--I want you to go and get  something for me."  This gave them courage, and they returned again to the room. "I want you to go and get me some bitters   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.   61 just down in the shop on the corner. Wait, I'll find the bottle." After looking around the room for some time, she found the old bottle stowed away in one corner under some rubbish. It was partly fall. On removing the stopple, she exclaimed, "Oh! happy enough!-I found it-I found it, and there is some of the 'good critter' in you yet. So there is," difting it to her mouth and pouring down a good swig). "Yes, there is just enough leftyet." (Indeed there was just enough for she never needed more.) So saying, she threw herself upon the old bed that stood in the corner, with the bottle in her hand, and drew the filthy covering over her head. Lizzy and her little brother who had been trying to warm themselves by the few dying embers on the hearth, being chilled'and tired, soon fell asleep. When the husband came in it was dark. On looking for his bottle he found / it had been removed from the place where he had hid it, partly filled. He, however, soon found\ it on the bed by the side of his poor drunken wife, with its contents exhausted. 6 &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7788-00000031"/> 62  LITTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND. 'His disappointment was too great. He must  have some of the " good critter," too, before he  could sleep. He left the room and locked the  door. The poor woman had been doing some  washing that afternoon, and had left it partly . finished in the wash-tub standing on an old stool in the middle of the room. While her  husband was gone to fill the bottle again, she e arose and undertook to finish her washing in  the dark, but she was too much intoxicated. She staggered and fell with her head in the ; water, from which position she was not able to  extricate herself. On her husband's return he - found her dead, with her body inclined forward e upon the wash-tub, her head beneath the water, V and her little child but a few weeks old lying  upon the floor nearly naked.    CHAPTER X.  ONE rainy day little Tommy and his sister and a number of other ragged children were sweeping the mud from the pavement some- where in the vicinity of the Park. A large stout man came along partially intoxicated and evidently in a rage about something. As he passed the street the little toiling multitude were huddled upon'one end of the walk. As he came up to them he pushed one in one di- rection, and another in another. Then seizing Lizzy by the shoulder he pushed her with all his might and said, "get -out of my way here, you little dirty varmins." Poor Lizzy fell upon the iron bar of the railroad track so violently as to fracture one of her limbs. They picked the poor thing up and carried her to the pavement where she sat for some time in   &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7788-00000032"/> "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.   64  great distress. By, and by a poor woman came  along,-and seeing Lizzy weeping, she asked what was the matter. The children related to her what had passed. "Aint your name Lizzy?" asked the woman.  "Yes, maam," replied little Tommy; " and she is-my sister." ' "Was'nt your father a carpenter?" "Yes, ma'am," answered Lizzy.  "Well, I used to know him before he died. He was just as good a man as ever lived, only : he could not keep from grog. Poor man, he X died a horrible death; I saw him when the i policeman took him to the hospital, from that! dirty-grog shop where he shot himself. It was i not long after that, when my poor husband J was killed at that same place, in a drunken : spree. Where is your poor mother, now?"  "She is dead, ma'am."         ! "Where do you stay?" "We have no place, ma'am." "Where did you sleep last night?" We staid in the lock-up, ma'am. But we  could'nt sleep any, ma'am. There was some   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.   65 drunken men and women there, and they swore so bad that we were afraid to sleep." "Where did you sleep the night before?" "We staid out, ma'am." "Did you sleep any, then?" "Tommy slept some, ma'am, when he laid in my lap." "Oh, dear," interrupted Lizzy, who had been sitting very patiently, enduring the pain until she could stand it no longer. "Oh, it pains me so. What shall I do?" said she, rubbing the scalding tears from her eyes. "Well, you must go with me, to-night," said the poor woman, raising Lizzy from the pavement. "You must go with me, and I will do the best I can for you. I had a sweet little boy the other day, continued she. Oh, he was such a comfort to me. It seems as though I could'nt live without him. But he is dead. He was killed. One day the dear little fellow was going across the street, his foot slipped' and he fell.- A drunken driver run the cars right over his head, and killed him.

He loved to talk so X much about heaven and Jesus. Oh, I know  he has gone to Jesus, now, for he said: 'Suffer  little children to come unto me, and forbid them  not.'  She took Lizzy home with her, and suc- ceeded, after much difficulty, in getting a  neighboring physician to set the broken bones $ of the poor child. She then laid her upon her  own little bed of straw and covered her with  the only blanket she had, and bid little Tommy  watch her while she could go and sell the . few rags she had in her bag, that she might get i something for them to eat for the night.  After some time she returned with a small s loaf of bread, and two or three potatoes, which  she cooked in the hot embers upon the hearth. :i After feeding poor Lizzy with some of the best  she had, she said, "Come, my boy, come ard  stand here by me ;" and as she put her hand  upon his little shoulder, she said, "Oh! you  seem so much like my dear little boy, I cannot  -  r              '   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.   67 help to call you William, (for that was the name of her little boy). She then implored the blessing of heaven upon their scanty meal. This was a new era in the life of little Tommy, as it was the first time he had ever been at a table to eat a meal of victuals. He had never heard a prayer be- fore in his life, excepting by his little sister, who often prayed with him in the dark night when nobody could see them. He had never heard the name of God used before by any one excepting by his sister, and in the horrid oaths of the blasphemer. He had never be- fore known, the!deep gushings of a mother's love, which even, now were but second-handed to him. This was indeed strange to him. He knew not how to decipher it. He had often wept before on account of injuries wrought upon his little being, and out of fear of the horrid frowns of his vile persecutor. But now the scene how changed. Kind looks, gentle smiles, and loving tones now fill the places of fierce frowns, malignant grins, and horrid oaths. &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7788-00000034"/> 68  LITTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.

Ah this is indeed almost  to him "a niilleniumn ina a moment." The ! world is now changed to him. He is changed to himself. Whereas he once could shed but bitter tears of grief, his cheeks now overflow  with rivers of joy. This little boy is not alone X in his desolation; no, we have "A  Little BRagged Ten Thousand," each of whose hearts i: may be made to leap with joy even as little  Tommy's now does.   Dear young reader,  would you be happy? Then go seek one of these little outcasts, and pour in upon him a brother's kindness, a sister's love.  Think not to gain it in the giddy whirl of  the ball-room, or in the gleeful merriment of I 4parties of pleasure, or in the degrading, fictic- i tious allurements of the museum, or the theatre.  No, these are but fleeting shadows. They pass   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.        69 with the moment. But go seek the smallest, the filthiest, and most degrading of these, and draw  around him  the chords of love.   Take off those rags, supply his wants, smile upon his little haggard face.  Breathe upon him all the tender kindness and generous affections of your own warm heart. Do it not to-day alone, but to-morrow, and continually.    Yes, do it, because you love to do    it-then  tell me if there is not joy in living. Let this then be our motto: 'C The heart-the heart, oh! let it be a true and bounteous thing, As kindly warm, as nobly free, as eagle's nestling wing; Oh! keep it not like miser's gold, shut in from all beside, But let its precious stores unfold in mercy far and wide. The heart, the heart, that's truly blest, was never all its own, No ray of glory lights the breast, that beats for self alone; The heart, the heart, oh! let it spare a sigh for others' pain; The breath that soothes a brother's care, was never spent in yain; Though it throb at gentlest touch, or mercy's faintest call, 'Twere better far should ache too much, than never ache At all.

This good woman would read the Bible and pray with Lizzy and her little brother every day., She is an industrious woman. She can be seen every morning very early, carrying a large bag strapped to her shoulders, perched over her head at least two feet. This bag is filled with rags, all of which, she has picked before the sun is fully up. She carries another in her hand, which she must fill before she can eat her breakfast. For these are all she has with which to purchase a meal for herself and her little dependants. Tommy must watch his little sick sister. Besides she will not let them beg while she lives, Poor creature, she has but one hand. Her wretched husband, in a fit of inebriation, struck her a violent blow, which fractured the bone of her arm so badly, that it had to be removed. She wears a nar- row brown-tow frock, with tight sleeves. A little narrow hood tied under her chin, is the covering for her head. She wastes not her precious moments in ar- ranging costly jewelry. She spends not her best hours at the toilet. No, she is not cum-   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.   71 bered with these things. The glistening, spark- ling tears upon her placid cheek, as she thinks of a precious Saviour, a bleeding lamb, a crown of life, are the jewels that adorn her being. This poor woman is indeed a good woman. She has been through much trouble. She has lost one of the best of husbands. When she married him, he was a young man of noble talents, of warm and generous feelings. He was the son of wealthy parents, who lavished upon him everything that money could pro- cure. But with his wealth, he fell heir to an appetite for stimulants, which grew upon him, and finally has proved his ruin. She has been for many years a member of a christian church, but when her husband had spent all in drunk- enness and debauchery, she, of course, was re- duced to poverty and disgrace. She was ashamed to enter the church where she had so long worshipped, and where now she was looked upon with sneers and contempt, for she is a drunkard's wife, they said. She is consequent- ly driven to her own secret retirement, and to her God, for her christian comfort and conso-  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7788-00000036"/> 72  LITTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND. lation. Her God is the God of the poor, and she worships him in her poverty, with sincer- ity and truth. She mourns not over a cold heart. No, her bleeding Saviour is the warmth of her heart. She grieves not at the weari- some moments passing so heavily. No, not even in her poverty. She has no selfish end to accomplish. Her Saviour is her present joy. She waits only his bidding. These little ragged children are her inheri- tance in this world. She loves them. And she rejoices to hear the gentle voice from above saying, "suffer the little ones-yes, even these despised, filthy and ragged, though they be, to come, and keep them not away." Yes, she re- members that these too were bought with the precious blood of the son of God. She needs no stimulant to warm her heart and lead her to the throne of grace. As the silken cord draws the lightning from the clouds, so she longs to be the link between that infinite heart of love, and these little outcasts. Say, christian sister, christian brother, you who have known the secrets of a God, you who have felt these   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.   73 things--would you despise the. inheritance of this woman, even in her earthly poverty, walk- ing in lowliness amid this filth? Do you say I am glad there are some that can stoop to these things, as for me, I cannot do it? Nay, would you not rather, even 'now, living as it may be, in that mansion in all its stately grandeur, pos- sess the inheritance of this woman, and enjoy what she enjoys, than all the pampering luxu- ries of a palace without it? Then say not, I can do nothing for these. Go down into the waters of humiliation. The lower you shall stoop, the higher the waves of your joy shall flow. 7 :/.   &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7788-00000037"/> CHAPTER XI. ONE evening, Mr. H., a very respectable citi- zen, was walking rapidly through' one of the by-streets, in the lower part of one of oour large cities. He had left his business and was has- tening to his tea, that he might not be belated at meeting; as that was the regular night for the weekly prayer-meeting. As he turned the corner of the street, he found himself sur- rounded by little beings with tattered garments, dirty hands and faces, dishevelled hair, bare feet, bare heads, &amp;c. It was in front of a grog-shop. These juve- niles had assembled there in a crowd, as if to recruit and prepare for their night's campaign in crime, as they are often found to do, in many parts of the city, around these schools of ini- quity at that time in the day. Newsboys, rag-   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.-   75 pickers, bone-gatherers, street-sweeps, and at their head, young gamblers, pilferers, burglars, incendiaries, thieves, pick-pockets, &amp;c. Each having their respective profession, trade, or of- fice to perform in society, as thbeir circumstan- ces, talents, and past education may have fitted them for.  Each, holding their re- spective titles according as they are estimated by their ragged votaries-some of which we  will mention: Nick Whaler, Buckshot, Car- rotts, Denny Skillett, Mike Bouncer, Chubb, Google Eye, Black Dick, Willey the Whist, Dick Taylor, Pat the, Lion. Each title repre- senting something in itself distinctly under- stood by all. They stood so thick upon the pavement, that in his haste to pass the multitude, which he considered to be nothing strange, (as he had  often seen such crowds in that part of the city,) he turned into the street.. He had, however, gone but a few steps, when a little lame. girl; with a crutch in her hand, came running to him, screaming-  "Good man, please save my little brother.  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7788-00000038"/> 76  LITTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND. Good- man, do-do save my poor little brother, They'll kill him. They'll kill him. I'm 'fraid they will." "What is the matter?" said Mr. H. "Oh, sir, they're going to make poor little Tommy drunk. Do make them stop, good man,ffor they will kill him, I'm afraid they will. Sha'nt they stop, good man?" "Let us see, let us see, what are you doing here?" said Mr. H., forcing his way through the ragged crowd. "What are you trying to do, boys?".said he, kindly. "Nothin' much," replied one. "Nothin' only'nitiatin' him," responded another. "That's right, Nick. Give it to him," yelled another. "That's just the way they did me," shouted another. "Give it to him right, Whaler," hooted another. "Do it up brown, Nick," screamed another. "Now let him go," cried a voice in the midst of the crowd. "Now let him go, I say," pour- ing forth a volume of horrid oaths at the end of every sentence. "Let him go. Why don't you let him go? If you don't let him go now!-   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.  /" I'll kill every-  one of you. Let him go." At this command, the crowd rushed back, and Mr. H. was now, for the first time, able to see within the circle. A little ragged boy was stretched upon the filthy pavement. On inquiry, he found that he was the brother of the little lame girl. He and his sister had stubbornly refused to drink any of the filthy grog that had been furnished them by the grocery-keeper. It was found that Tommy had a few cents that had been given him dur- ing the day, and one of the largest boys, they called Nick Whaler, had undertaken to 'nitiate him, as they term it. That is, when they find a new customer among them, if he has a few pennies, they will compel him to treat the whole crowd. If he refuses to drink, they catch him and pour a quantity down histhroat. This is what they call "nitiatin." The poor child was nearly strangled, and in the struggle, his ragged clothes had been almost pulled off from him, so that he was nearly naked. "Nick had poured a quantity of'whiskey down .his  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7788-00000039"/> 78  ,LITTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND. throat. Now this Nick was a famous, fellow; he was the largest and strongest of the crowd, and seemed to be chief commander. He could run the fastest; drink the most grog; utter 'the most horrid oaths; tell the biggest lie; insult the most people, and had been in the "Iock up" the greatest number of times of any one present that night. And, in fact, to the looker-on it would seem that, as far as this ragged herd was concerned, in him was vested the powers that be. Our friend, Mr. H., drew near the child, whom his sister had just raised from the pave- ment, and was about to lead him away. As he stooped down to speak to the poor little fellow, one of the crowd knocked off his hat. When he stooped to pick it up, they tripped his feet from under him, and he fell prostrate upon the pavement. "That's right," yelled Nick. "Give it to him, boys." Upon the issue of these orders, he found the ragged host gathering fast around him, with Governor Nick in the front rank.   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.  79 "You man what's got a coat on and a shilp lalah in your hand, we'll 'nitiate you next if you don't be off." "Down him-down him," shouted the go- vernor. "Down him-down him," was heard in every direction. Fierce eyes, red noses, and bloated cheeks, were hung around in plenteous 'effusions, as grog-shop keepers and bar tenders were now staring upon him, with horrid grins, from every direction. Mr. H. scrambled up from the mud, and by the help of his big cane, and sharp- toed boots, he succeeded after much difficulty, in. extricating himself from his unpleasant posi- tion without severe injury, many of his antag- onists being already too much intoxicated, and he hastened home with his nice linen and fine broadcloth well besmeared with mud, much chagrined, amid the hoots and shouts of the "Little Ragged Ten Thousand."  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7788-00000040"/> CHAPTER    XII. HE had not gone far, however, before he met one of the police, when the following conver- sation took place:- "Ah I Mr. Policeman-here you are." Ah! how do you do, Mr. E.?" ljr. H.1 "How do ,you do, sir? Pity you could'nt have been found sooner; but they do say you can never find a policeman when you want him.

Where?" Mr. H. "Just now. Right down there. Hav'nt you heard the fuss?" M. P. "Oh  was that you down yonder,   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.   81 on the corner in front of that old Rummy? -I thought there was a little more noise down there than common; but I did'nt think of it being you, though."  Mr. I. "Well, I guess it was'nt all me" (a little vexed). M. P. "Well! Well! Never mind that. I will let you pass this time." Mr. H. "Well, I think it is rather a hard case, for a man to be run over and trod on by such a set of little brats. It is a disgrace to our city." X. P. "Well, you're alive yet-are you?" Mr. H. "I guess I am;" viewing himself from head to foot, and then rolling up his besmeared wristhands. Well, this is too bad, any how. I wish you would arrest some of them, and put an end to such work." "M P.  'Oh, that is nothing. If you could see them sometimes, you would call that a trifle." , Mr. H. "I should say it was something. Why, there are at least fifty or sixty children there, of all colors, and sizes, from seven to  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7788-00000041"/> 82  LITTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND. / sixteen years of age. Some of them swear like demons; some of them are drunk now, and still they are buying grog at those groceries and rum shops. Cannot you do something? Can- not you arrest some of them?" MiL P. "Oh!' No. If we arrest one, we must arrest all. How would we look arresting a whole community of children, and locking them up. Then, every one we arrest it makes ten times worse, instead of better. Yes, every boy or girl we lock up, comes out a hun- dred-fold worse than before. While there, they must be locked up in those cells with murder- ers, robbers, thieves, and drunken, profane blacklegs, who are awaiting their trial. Adept teachers indeed, in the school of vice. And it- is plain to be seen, that it would be xuch bet- ter to leave them as they are, than to send a part of them to such schools, to be tutored by these old offenders. Besides, it ruins theni forever. For when a boy or girl has been once in the "lock up," they think everybody is look- ing down upon them with sneers and hate, This feeling makes them perfectly reckless, and   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.   83 disrobes them of all fear of God or man. Then they are prepared to destroy hundreds more- around them. Some of these children you saw in that crowd are of very respectable families, and attend Sunday Schools. Some of them have been sent to the grocery to get some tri- fling articles for the family use. Perhaps a few ounces of tea, or a pound of sugar, or some other necessary article. These necessities are occuring every day." Mr. H. "These are schools indeed; holding their perpetual sessions. - For I see no end to such influences, either in this world, or the world to come." M. P. "I was going to say that one of these children that have been shut up in the Tombs for a frew days, would destroy more good in the community in one week's time, than all the Sabbath school teachers in the city--with all their self-denial can accomplish in a whole year's fatigue and toil." Mr. H. "Oh, yes, I see it. I see it. It is just what the Bible tells us. 'That one sinner destroyeth much good." 5*  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7788-00000042"/> 84  LITTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND. /l. P. "Besides, I was about to say, they are not so much to blame; they do just as they are taught to do. If you should sit down and teach your son to play cards, could you blame him for becoming a gambler? If you send your child to the grocery each day, to deal with a profane,' Sabbath-breaking rum seller, where the sound of blasphemy and degrading sights shall become as familiar to her as her own name.  ntill all the finer feelings of her be- ing are defaced or obliterated, would you won- der at her becoming a wretched outcast? A disgrace to her parents. A blighting curse to all within her reach. "Many of these children belong to what I call our "Little Ragged Ten Thousand." Many of them have no homes. No father to protect them; no kind mother to love and smile upon them. And they have need (at least they think so) of all the cunning craft, all the bold, God-defying, man-daring impu- dence and rascality that they can- possess, in order that they may force their way through this world (to them) of robbers and, pirates.

His feelings were much affected by what he had seen among our little ragged friends. ' What will become of them?" he said, as he walked to the church. "Oh! what will become of these poor drunlken children?"Again he said, as he wiped the falling tears from his eyes, "Will no one care for these precious little souls?" The minister was not present at the meeting that evening, and of course Deacon 'J. must lead the worship, as he was considered by far the most spiritual man in the church. The exercises were commenced by singing a hymn l to the tune of "Old Hundred."  Much of the time was taken up in remarks, and great complaint was made of cold hearts,   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.  87 As the meeting passed on, and as prayer after prayer was pronounced, Mr. H. waited with great anxiety, often saying to himself, "Oh! if they would only breathe one prayer for these poor children." The superintendent of the Sabbath School was called upon. "Now," thought Mr. H., "surely he will pray for the children." He followed each sentence that was uttered, word by word, expecting the next would be "Oh! Lord! have mercy upon the souls of these uncared-for, drunken children!" but in vain. Deacon J. finally closed the meeting with a long and eloquent prayer. He prayed for the heathen in foreign lands. He prayed for the heathen in Hindostan; in China; in Burmah; in Turkey; in Abyssinia; in Iceland; in Bor- neo; in Japan; in Greenland; in Africa; in the Indies; in South America; in Oregon, and especially in California. i He prayed for the President of the United States; the Cabinet; the members of the Senate and House of Representatives, and all  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7788-00000044"/> 88;  LITTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND. the/officers of the government. For the gov- ernor of the state and members of the legis- lature. .For the mayor, aldermen, and conm non council of the city, and all those in authority. For all kings and queens, and all rulers of the earth. For ministers and doctors, and deacons, and all men of influence. He prayed for the big new stone church up-town, that was nearly finished by the kind assistance of an All-Wise Director. He prayedhat Zion might be led forth into it with victdry. That there she might dwell in peace, retired from her foes, the little rag- ged tumultuous crowd without. In fact it seemed to him that the deacon prayed for everything in the heavens above and the earth beneat'h, and the waters under the earth, ex- cepting for "The Little Ragged Ten Thou- sand." After meeting, Mr. H. retired to his room deeply weighed down with the condition of these children. He could not sleep. Oh, who will care for these little lost ones, would often force itself upon his mind.   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND. -89 In the morning, Mr. H. called upon Deacon J., to see if something could not be done to rescue these drunken children. The deacon replied, "I have been a great temperance man for many years; I helped to establish the first temperance society in the country; I have delivered many temperance speeches. But of late years I have given these things up into the hands of the world, and I attend to more spiritual matters. "Oh, deacon," said Mr. H., (the tears gush- ing from his eyes,) ' what more spiritual act did Jesus Christ ever perform than to bleed upon the shameful cross, to save our lost and degraded souls from an eternity of black de- spair. What more spsiritual act could you per- form, than to rescue one of the filthiest of these outcast children from a drunkard's grave, and a drunkard's hell, and by the help of God, set him as a little sparkling star, in the crown of Jesus forever." "Furthermore," continued the deacon, "I doubt whether it would be policy to do any- thing now in this matter, as the public mind is ' slD  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7788-00000045"/> 90.

But, Mr. H., I give you God speed, as your cause is a good one, I confess." - "But then, deacon, won't you do something to aid us in this good cause in some way?" "No, no," said the deacon, "my mind is made up. "But I would advise you to call upon our clergyman, Rev. Dr. -- . He will undoubt- edly feel a deep sympathy for the object, and do much to assist you-I do not mean pecu- niarily, for you know he receives only four thousand dollars salary, and there are at least three in his family. He lives just across the way in that large brown house." Mr. H-then called upon the Rev. Dr. who replied he could do nothing for such a cause. Besides: that, he had no time to talk about such things. "Well, sir, do you not think we could get' the basement of your church to hold a meeting, '!.       ,      .   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.   91 that we may devise some plan to save some of these children?" Oh, no," said the Rev. Dr. --; "I could not give my consent to that. Some-of our wealthiest men are rum-sellers. You know I could not offend them." "Well, sir, you will give out our notice in your pulpit, will you not?"  "No," said the Rev. Dr. -- ; "that wouldn't do." "Well then, sir, you will let me give out the notice to the Sabbath-school, won't you? as we e wish to get as many of the children enlisted in the subject as possible." "Oh, no, I could not. Mr. H., you see I am  in a peculiar predicament, for you know I could not get along without their money." "I should think you were in a peculiar pre- dicament, for a minister of the Gospel of the Son of God," replied Mr. H. "Well, Mr. H., I wish you God speed. Your cause is a good one, and you will receive your reward.

"Oh, Most Rev. Sir, when will the time come, that you will preach one of your good sermons for the benefit of these poor heathen children, lying in thousands at our very doors, under our feet by day and by night? Oh, sir, my time is precious, too, but it seems to me that these souls are infinitely more precious still than time. Are souls in foreign lands more precious than these? Did God pay more for their redemption than for these?" "Well, Mr. H., I would advise you to call upon Mr. B. He has lately been elected Alder-. man of this ward. He, without doubt, feels a deep interest in these things. So, may God bless you in your noble undertaking."  Mr. H. then called upon the Alderman, and related to him what had passed, the day pre- vious. He told of the drunkenboys and girls that he had found in the streets. He spoke of little Lizzy, and Tommy, and all the little beg- gar children; and he said:   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAND.   93 "Mr. B., can't you do something to save these children and youth from intemperance and' ruin?"

I fear they will all be ruined if we don't do something." "Why, father," said little Lucy, who had been standing by his side, listening very atten- tively to all that had been said, "why, father, what makes 'um drunk'? Does the bad poison make 'urn drunk, father?" "Yes, my child," replied her father. " ell, father, what makes you let 'un have the bad poison? Does the beggar children "drink the bad poison, father?"

Mr. P I is considered to be worlth nearly three millions of dollars. He has no family, excepting a niece, who has charge of his house. He has been making preparations for 'an evening's party, to take place on the night following, and has spared no pains to adorn his house for the occasion. A bill was lying -on his table to the amount of three thousand dollars, that had already been expended for the purpose of ornatnenting his parlors, &amp;c. The servant enters. "Mr. P., sir, the man is waiting for the check on the bill that lies upon your desk, sir." "Tell him to come in and be seated in the hall." Mr. P. draws the check. "Here, Andrew, hand this tothe man. Stop, you may call him in." The man enters. Mr. P. "Is this bill right?" Milan. "Y1es, sir. I made it out myself. It is right." Mr. P.

She has been educated at one of our most popular Seminaries. Every advantage that wealth could confer, has been lavished upon her. She has all the accomplishments and airs of a modern popular female education. She can talk French, and play upon the piano. She is truly expert at a game of whist or cards. The novel, the ball- room, the Museum, and the Theatre, are her resort. Her companions are the gay and the frivolous. Step by step, her young, kind, warm and generous heart, has grown cold, ^ proud, and selfish. Often, during'the course of her education, and especially during her &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7788-00000052"/> ,stay t, the seminary, she has wept, when she , has thought of the happy and innocent, mo- , ments of childhood. When she stood at the gate and talked with the poor little lame beg- gar girl. Often has her mind recurred to the time: when she took her shawl from her shoul- ders and gave it to sweet little Tizzy. Often has she been known to exclaim, "Oh, that I were that innocent, tender-hearted girl that I was when I talked with the beggar children, at my father's gate." Often has she dreamt of seeing the ragged children at her door. ,At one time she wrote her mother a very affecting letter; anextract of which, we will give. : Dear mother, I could not sleep last night. I thought the little beggar children were at ' my door. Among the rest, was that sweet lit- fle lame Lizzy, that I loved so much. Oh, mother, how happy I was when I talked with her. She was such a sweet little girl. She  used to talk so much about kind Jesus, as she called him. Then she would' tell about her diig mother. Oh, dear mother, I couldn't : :sp, I dreamt so much about the beggar   "TTLE RAGGED TEN THOUSAN-D.- 105' children. Oh, mother, I fear my heart is grow- ing proud. Mother, can't you find little Lizzy and give her some of my clothes?" To which her mother replied, in her next letter, that "she thought/she was now getting old enough to think of something else besides the beggar children. This would do for little girls, but a young lady should be more dig- nified." Which was the last she dared to write upon that subject. The influences that have surrounded her, have drawn her, step by step, to love t e world and all its follies and flatteries. Yeti her more serious moments, she often wee over her proud and selfish heart. She as been led by the gaieties of youth, and" luring smiles of the proud and frivolous. She is not happy. During her stay at the seminary she had many serious moments. At one time there was a revival in the Institution, when a num- ber of the students came forward-and publicly renounced their sins, and professed their at- tachment to the Saviour. i X , .    ,  ,  -  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7788-00000053"/> ": -'S e&amp;,was j among the number-she lived for a number 'of- months a devoted Christian. ;':But iwhen vacation came on, and she re- turned to her father's' house, she was sur- rounded by gay companion, and, little by lit- ;tie, she, was led to. yield to the influences around her, until she consented to enter the, 'ball-room by the over-persuasions of a gay young companion.

She, after her recovery, sought for many monthsito find our little friends Lizzy and Tommy, but in vain.  One morning, however, very early as she passed through a bye-street, she saw some one sitting upon the steps of an old shop, weeping-it was Lizzy. When she saw the woman she arose, and threw her arms around her neck, and sobbed and wept as though her heart would break. Since Tommy's death Lizzy has been very lonely. A She has become a regular rag-picker. She has kept the old Bible that 'her kind mother gave her on her death-bed. It. has been her only companion. - She has not forgot-  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7788-00000054"/> ten the injunciions of her mother. Many fiere -temptations have surrounded her. Many dark moments of trial has she passed through. Many heart-rending scenes of wickedness has she been compelled to look upon. She has been robbed of father, mother, and brother. She has been robbed of home and ,' all its endearments-of food, of raiment, and all the pleasures and comforts of this life. She is now near her end. She. has been ly- ing for a number of months upon that hard couch of straw, wasting away by consumption. Most of the time she is alone, as the poor woman must pick rags every moment she can. Still she is not alone, for Jesus is her present ! help. She is happy. She longs to meet Jesus in a world of glory. The hour is set, and the preparations for Lucy's wedding are fast being completed. The large parlors are ornamented with splendor. All is glittering show. The morning has ar- rived. This afternoon, Lucy is to be married. Harkl a lady is at-the door.

YEARS have now rolled rapidly away and --little Lucy's childish fears were not so much misplaced, for not many months since, the remains of that dear brother Alfred were brought in at the midnight hour, and the fam- ily were aroused by the announcement that Alfred was dead.

The words of his little daughter now rushed vividly to his mind. "Father, won't the bad Doison kill brother Alfred, too." His feelings of anguish now almost overwhelm him. In. stead of one cent- to decide the characters of thousands of young and tender minds; in- stead of one vote weighing the destiny of hun- dreds of thousands of defenceless ones, he now cries, "Oh, had I millions of gold, would it but redeem my lost son; would it bring back my boy, it were nought to me beside."

Little children, too, plead and besought them, to save their fathers and mothers, and cover their own little innocent and defenceless heads, from the scald. ing blasts of such a storm. All this could have been done by a single vote. But no, their pe- titions were disregarded; their, cries were un- heeded; their prayers were unnoticed; with one fell swoop all were thrown under the table, and the rum bottle called for, to drown thle thoughts of a dying city, a bleeding state, and a mourning nation.
