After this visit, much of the attraction of the affair, as a sight for the mob,&#xD;
diminished, for, although there were certainly many notable personages con-&#xD;
tinually coming and going, it was royality that made up the principal interest&#xD;
to the populace. The confusion, however, increased, and by about half-past&#xD;
twelve o'clock Manchester Square was altnost impassable to foot-passengers.&#xD;
A strong body of constables had been sent for, and tried in vain to make some&#xD;
head against the mob; but they only sufficed to increase its numbers, so far&#xD;
as they individually went, without, in the smallest degree, diminishing its&#xD;
uproariousness.:&#xD;
The carriages proceeded pretty well, for the horses trod upon the toes of&#xD;
the people, and the coachmen and footmen were not very particular as to how&#xD;
they forced a passage through the dense, living throng.&#xD;
Hats, walking-canes, and umbrellas were thrown about as if they had been&#xD;
the chance missiles of some battle-field. The few miserable oil lamps in the&#xD;
square were smashed ; and had it not been for the blaze of light from the&#xD;
windows of the house, through which the glittering chandeliers, with their&#xD;
innumerable wax lights, could be seen, and the wild illumination round the&#xD;
door made by the linkmen, the darkness would have been the inducement no&#xD;
doubt, to even a greater amount of riot than did actually take place.&#xD;
Several of the guests had made unsuccessful efforts to leave the house, but&#xD;
could not get their carriages up to the door, and as for going on foot to seek&#xD;
them, which they would not have scrupled to do upon ordinary occasions, that&#xD;
was now out of the question.&#xD;
Among the guests so situated, and who was thus compelled to linger in the&#xD;
hall, was a Sir John Morton and his family. The family consisted of Lady&#xD;
Morton his wife, his son, Abel Morton, a youth of fourteen years of age, and&#xD;
his daughter, Loo Morton, who was upon that day exactly nine years old.&#xD;
The residence of this family was in an old mansion on the northern slope of&#xD;
the plateau comprising Hampstead Heath, and an old-fashioned travelling&#xD;
chariot waited in the square to take them home, the coachman and the couple&#xD;
of well-powdered footmen connected with which had made half-a-dozen vain&#xD;
efforts to reach the door, being invited thereto by the shouts of the linkmen&#xD;
for Sir John Morton's carriage !"&#xD;
" Ah, Sir John Morton," said the Prince of Wales as he crossed the hall,&#xD;
"they told me you were gone."&#xD;
"1 should have been, your highness ; but it is not a very easy thing to get&#xD;
away."&#xD;
"There's a revolution in the square," said a gentlemanly man by the side&#xD;
of the prince.                                            '&#xD;
"So there seems to be, Mansfield," laughed the prince. "I wonder if they&#xD;
will let me go?"&#xD;
"The prince's carriage !-the prince's carriage !"&#xD;
The row and the crush that ensued baffles all description, and the Prince&#xD;
of Wales was away in another moment.&#xD;
"Let me go, father," said Abel Morton, "and look for the carriage. It must&#xD;
be somewhere close at hand. Our fellows are so stupid."&#xD;
"No-no, boy ; stay where you are. There is a good deal of rough work&#xD;
going on in the mob; and they will soon see, by your dress, that you are not&#xD;
one of them. Don't stir, Abel, from the hall. You don't know what mis-&#xD;
chief is in the minds of the people just now, cloaked by an appearance of&#xD;
jocularity."&#xD;
An universal groan came from the mob at this moment, as if to give a prac-&#xD;
tical example of the opinion of Sir John Morton. Who or what it was they&#xD;
groaned at nobody in the hall could tell; but-no doubt it was at some obnox-&#xD;
ious political personage who had made his appearance in the square.&#xD;
"Oh, I'd rather go, father; and get up the carriage," said Abel. "Here's&#xD;
Loo, shivering like 1 don't know what; and she is sure to take cold. Do let&#xD;
inc go ?"&#xD;
"If you think you can, Abel, without getting into any danger," said Sir&#xD;
&#xD;
ii&#xD;
&#xD;
a&#xD;
x&#xD;
Y&#xD;
p&#xD;
fi&#xD;
&#xD;
John Morton, who was n'vously sensitive when any apprehension concern-&#xD;
ing the health of his darling child, Loo, was hinted to him. "If you think&#xD;
that with discretion, Abel, you can find the carriage do so."&#xD;
"Yes, father-yes. I can easily do it."&#xD;
Lady Morton was about to say something against the certainly rather peril-&#xD;
ous enterprise; but Abel, fancying that such would be the case, availed himself&#xD;
so rapidly of the tardy permission of his father, that his mother had not time&#xD;
to speak a word in opposition.&#xD;
"Pa, you should not let dear Abel go into such a bad crowd," said Loo.&#xD;
"Oh. why-why did we come hereD'&#xD;
''Hush, my dear. There is no danger to us. Do not be alarmed."&#xD;
"Oh, Abel, Abel," said Loo, "why don't you come back 7"&#xD;
"My dear," said Lady Morton, with as much asperity as she could put on,&#xD;
for she was a good soul. "My dear, Abel should not have been permitted to&#xD;
go."&#xD;
Perhaps Sir John Morton was getting round to the same opinion ; but 1-&#xD;
fore he could say a word, either in defence or lamentation of what he had done,&#xD;
Abel made his appearance in the hall again, with his honest, healthy face&#xD;
flushed to a crimson glow with the exertion which he had made to battle his&#xD;
way through, the mob.&#xD;
"It's all right," he said. "The carriage is at the corner of a street a little&#xD;
way off; but Jarvis can't get up to the door, so I told him welwould come&#xD;
to him, you see, father, and there won't be any difficulty if you carry Loo."&#xD;
"Come along, then," said Sir John, as he took the little girl in his arms.&#xD;
"Come along. If we do not go at once, Heaven only knows how long wemay&#xD;
be detained in this place. Come--come !"&#xD;
A roar and a shriek from the crowd in the square at this moment, made&#xD;
them all recoil from the steps of the house, and Sir John called out in a voice&#xD;
of anxiety-&#xD;
"What's that? what's that ?"&#xD;
Loud cries of "Murder !" now came upon the night air, mingled with shrieks&#xD;
and oaths. It was evident that the mob had got into collision with some&#xD;
obnoxious personage, and that the riot was taking a much more mischievous&#xD;
shape than it had yet done. The principal focus of the tumult, though, was&#xD;
evidently upon the other side of the square, and, therefore, a better opportu-&#xD;
nity for Sir John Morton and his family to leave the house could not be desi-&#xD;
red. The mob swayed to and fro for a few moments, and then, in a full tide,&#xD;
made way to the special scene of the tumult, so that the space before~ the&#xD;
ambassador's door was singularly'clear in comparison to what it had been.&#xD;
" Ah, there comes Jarvis with the carriage," cried Abel, as the vehicle made&#xD;
its way up to the door of the ambassador's house."&#xD;
Sir John Morton, with all possible expedition, placed his family in the car-&#xD;
riage, and springing in himself, he felt satisfied that the perils and anxieties&#xD;
of that night were over. But alas ! they had scarce began.&#xD;
"I don't know," he said, "what on earth induced me to accept the invitation&#xD;
to the ambassador's to-night ; but, somehow, you see, it was made a request&#xD;
by General Hawksworth ; and he said that by bringing one's family it would&#xD;
show a confidence in the existing state of affairs, which would have a good&#xD;
effect at present."&#xD;
"But I have no confidence in anything," said Lady Morton ; "and rather&#xD;
than be terrified as I have been to-night, I would stay at home all the year&#xD;
round."&#xD;
"Yes, mamma," said Loo, "and I would stay with you."&#xD;
"I know you would, my child; you are my dear, darling Loo, and as affec-&#xD;
tionate and kind as-as---"&#xD;
"Well-well,"'said Sir John, "don't cast about for a comparison. We will&#xD;
rather be content to consider Loo quite peerless, only I am very much afraid&#xD;
we shall spoil her among us. This is her ninth birthday, and may we live, all&#xD;
of us to see the return of very many birthdays for her, and may they each be&#xD;

happier than its predecessor. Come to me, Loo, my darling. Now don't you&#xD;
be jealous, Abel, for you know we are beginning to look upon you as a man;&#xD;
and if this were my last request to you, I would say, Abel, always be the friend&#xD;
and protector of your sister Loo."&#xD;
"I will, pa," said Abel, in a tone of voice that showed the deep sincerity of&#xD;
his answer. "I will, indeed. -1 am quite ready now to fight all the world ;&#xD;
and when I go into the army, pa, you know that I shall have a sword by my&#xD;
side that will be ready to leap out of its scabbard the moment I only whisper&#xD;
to it that Loo requires its aid."&#xD;
"Bravely spoken, Abel."&#xD;
The carriage stopped with a sudden jerk, and a strange, but still very clear&#xD;
voice cried out-&#xD;
"Is this Sir John Morton's carriage ?"&#xD;
CHAPTER        II.&#xD;
ONE hour before the carriage even so much as forced its way up to the door&#xD;
of the ambassador's house, a lumbering, wheezing, odd-looking hackney-coach,&#xD;
drawn by a couple of horses that looked coal-black in the intense darkness of&#xD;
the road, which was not even pretended to be lighted, halted in the deep&#xD;
shadow of a group of willow trees, that waved their long branches almost to&#xD;
the other side of the way.&#xD;
The man who was driving rubbed his hands together as though he were&#xD;
chilled by the night air, and he laughed a strange laugh, which had-in it not&#xD;
one particle of mirth.&#xD;
"Silence !" said a rough voice from the interior of the vehicle. "Silence,&#xD;
Jobus !"&#xD;
"Oh, dear, yes sir. Silence it is, and silent I am," said the man. "I-that&#xD;
is--0.! thank you humbly, sir.".&#xD;
"Frogs !" cried the man who was in the coach.&#xD;
At this, a strange bundle, that looked as if it had been strapped to the back&#xD;
of the vehicle, unrolled itself, and another man appeared.&#xD;
"Frogs !"&#xD;
"Well, what now ?" said the man from behind the coach.&#xD;
"Where's the box ?"&#xD;
"On the roof. Didn't you say it was to go on the roof?"&#xD;
"I did. Let me not have any of your insolence, Frogs. Understand me,&#xD;
now, both of you," said the tall man. "Attend to what I. say to you."&#xD;
"Humbly, yes," said Jobus,&#xD;
"Well, I hear," said Frogs.&#xD;
" Now you understand, Jobus, that you keep upon the coach-box, and the&#xD;
moment you hear me whistle, you whip the cattle towards town, and go at&#xD;
the best pace you can. If you are pursued you will take the first opportunity&#xD;
of leaving the coach and making your escape. If you are not pursued you will&#xD;
go quietly to the stables."&#xD;
"Yes, sir-yes, Colonel Elk, I-"&#xD;
" Silence ! How dare you mention my name, even to the night air, you&#xD;
wretch?  How dare you do it ?"&#xD;
" 0-I-that is, I humbly forgot ! 0, sir, I beg your pardon, indeed I do !&#xD;
-If.you please, sir, I forgot !"&#xD;
". Hush ! Frogs, where is the box ?"&#xD;
"Here, to be sure. Have you got any ears?  I thought I heard some one&#xD;
coining. It's a man on horseback, [ take it."&#xD;
" Stand close then, and let him pass. What a pace !"&#xD;
A mounted man swept by them at a gallop that was prodgious, and he was&#xD;
gone like a whirlwind before a glimpse could be got of him, so as to omol~ at&#xD;
any opinion as to who or what he wa"  Colonel Elk and his men  id ut&#xD;
speak nor move for som ae few minutes after the man ou horseback had pased&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.                        15&#xD;
them like a mad apparition. It was the colonel, however, who at length broke&#xD;
the silence ; and in a low, demoniac voice, he said-&#xD;
" Look to your pistols, but do not use them until I order you. Open the&#xD;
gate that leads to the garden, Frogs, and place the box inside. Quick !-quick,!&#xD;
I do not know that there is any time to lose now."&#xD;
The rumble of approaching carriage wheels, and the step of the horses' hoofs&#xD;
upon the unfrequented road, increased in reality each moment.&#xD;
"They come," said Colonel Elk. "They come," and he hastily put on a&#xD;
green mask, enveloping his entire face.&#xD;
In a few minutes the reflection of the lamps of Sir John Morton's carriage&#xD;
flashed upon the hedge as it whirled rapidly past, thus giving that strange,&#xD;
metallic color to the vegetation which artificial light ever imparts to it. Col-&#xD;
onel Elk stood just upon the verge of the shadow cast by the old willows;&#xD;
and when the carriage got within about a dozen yards of the spot, he, with&#xD;
one bound, got to the middle of the road, and seizing the horse that was upon&#xD;
the near side by the rein, he cried out, as the animal was forced back upon itS&#xD;
haunches by the suddenness of the attack-&#xD;
"Is this Sir John Morton's carriage ?"&#xD;
The vice of Sir John Morton from the inside of the vehicle calling loudly to&#xD;
know what was the matter, was the next sound that was heard. The coach-&#xD;
man was courageous enough in his way, and he began to lash with his long&#xD;
whip at the man who had so audaciously stopped the horses. The two foot-&#xD;
men likewise got down from behind, and were rather confused to know what&#xD;
to do, when Colonel Elk, who had received a severe cut or two from the coach-&#xD;
man's whip, drew a pistol from the breast of his apparel, and with an execra-&#xD;
tion, shot him dead.&#xD;
All this was the work of a very few moments, during which Sir John Mor-&#xD;
ton had made the most unavailing efforts to get out of the carriage. Lady&#xD;
Morton screamed and fainted. Abel seconded his father in his exertions to&#xD;
open the carriage door, and little Loo, with her hands clasped, and her pretty&#xD;
face blanched as though death had robbed it'of its roses, sat still as a statue.&#xD;
"What is ml this ?" cried.Sir John, furiously. "Open the door, somebody.&#xD;
Thomas-Jones-where are you both?     Open the door at once."&#xD;
"Try the other one, father," said Abel.&#xD;
Before Sir John could scramble over the fainting Lady Morton, who had&#xD;
slipped from her seat to the bottom of the carriage, and offered a considerable&#xD;
obstacle to reaching the other door, it was swung open, and, holding one of&#xD;
the carriage lanmps just a little above the level of his face, so that the light fell&#xD;
full upon the strange and hideous green mask, there stood Colonel Elk. .&#xD;
"'Good God !" said Sir John Morton.&#xD;
Abel shrunk back and impeded his father. Little Loo uttered a shriek, as&#xD;
the man with the green face suddenly thrust his disengaged arm into the car-&#xD;
riage, and seizing her by the long ringlets that hung in such luxuriance down&#xD;
her back, he had her out in a moment.&#xD;
"Hold !" shouted Sir John. " Villain ! devil!"&#xD;
Smash went the carriage-lamp right in his face, and he fell backwards over&#xD;
the senseless form of Lady Morton. The light was extinguished, and then a&#xD;
deep, hollow voice, cried-&#xD;
"Ha, ha, ha !"&#xD;
Half stunned and bewildered as he was, however, Sir John Morton rose&#xD;
again, and dashed himself out of the carriage into the roadway, shouting-&#xD;
"My child ! My darling ! help! murder ! Returnher, and take all I have !&#xD;
Name your price, villains, but restore me my child. Help-help !"&#xD;
A bewildering scream rose upon the night air, and Jobus then lashed the&#xD;
horses in the old hackney-coach into a gallop.&#xD;
"Father-father !" cried a voice.&#xD;
"Follow us if you dare ! Ha! hal1" shouted the strange sepulchral tones&#xD;
that had before brought terror to the ears of Sir John ; and then he felt con-&#xD;
'       vinced that it was in the coach that rolled so rapidly away that his child was&#xD;
borne from him.&#xD;

my best loved child ! My datling! Help-help! Abel, follow me. It is&#xD;
for your dear sister's sake. On-on-on !"      -&#xD;
Both father and son set off in a fruitless and mad race after the hackney-&#xD;
coach. The two footmen gathered themselves up, and, as fast as their legs&#xD;
would carry them, darted off in the other direction. The dead body of the&#xD;
coachman lay upon its face in the road, and Lady Morton, still in a complete&#xD;
state of insensibility, was in the carriage.&#xD;
"Frogs," said Colonel Elk.&#xD;
"Here you are."&#xD;
"Take her-you know what to do."&#xD;
"The box ?"&#xD;
"Yes. Quick-quick. She is half dead with fright; but she may recover&#xD;
yet. Quick, I say. Leave the gate open-I will soon come to you."&#xD;
Frogs, with Loo in his arms, disappeared into the deserted garden with&#xD;
speed. Colonel Elk carefully took off his green mask, and put it in his pocket.&#xD;
" Jobus does his work well," said he.&#xD;
The night wind came past him in howling gusts. The clouds had, as he&#xD;
hoped they would, thickened, and a few heavy drops of rain were falling. No&#xD;
sound came from the only occupant of the carriage ; but a slight confused noise,&#xD;
in the other direction to that which Sir John Morton and his son had taken,&#xD;
came upon the ears of Colonel Elk.&#xD;
" Ah !" he said, "what is that ?"&#xD;
To step lightly into the middle of the road was the work of a moment. He&#xD;
took a long look in the direction of the confused sounds, and presently, far off,&#xD;
he saw the flash of lights, and he heard the tramp of footsteps coming hur-&#xD;
riedly on. The two footmen had met with aid, and gathering courage by&#xD;
numbers, now were coming back to render that assistance which is generally&#xD;
too late.&#xD;
A shrill wailing cry from the garden at this moment reached the ears of&#xD;
Colonel Elk.'&#xD;
"Frogs, what's that ?"&#xD;
"The girl ! Confound her !"&#xD;
"What of her ?"&#xD;
"She recovers-she will scream. She won't go into the box. What shall&#xD;
I do ?"&#xD;
"Smash her !"&#xD;
Crash! One shrill scream burst upon the night air - Crash ! All is&#xD;
still.&#xD;
CHAPTER        III.&#xD;
THE reader will be so good as to imagine that the world and all that it in-&#xD;
herits are six years older than they were at the conclusion of our last chapter.&#xD;
From a lively, peach-cheeked boy Abel Morton has shot up into a young man.&#xD;
The kindly blue eyes, full of frankness and intelligence, are still there, but the&#xD;
color has faded from the cheeks.&#xD;
Lady Morton, from that night, had been a confirmed invalid, and she looked&#xD;
so pale-oh,'so pale-and she spoke so low, and sighed so deeply, that it was&#xD;
evident to the most casual observer her heart had all but broken.&#xD;
Sir John Morton, for a time, had borne his sorrows like a man; but those&#xD;
six years of grief had sapped the better part of his health and strength. They&#xD;
had changed his dark hair to an iron grey-they had planted furrows in his&#xD;
cheeks, and they had robbed him of all the strength of manhood.&#xD;
From the moment that the man with the green face had clutched hold of&#xD;
Loo by her long ringlets, and taken her from the carriage, nothing whatever&#xD;
had been heard or seen of her.&#xD;
This was the grief that had eaten into the soul of the strong man, and made&#xD;
him what he now was-the querulous invalid-furiously passionate about&#xD;
&#xD;
trifles--.maddened by his own thoughts-a walking curse to himself, and at&#xD;
times as bad to all about him.&#xD;
There was another inmate of the baronet's house, though, now, and that was&#xD;
a young girl of as nearly as might be the same age as Loo Morton. Her name&#xD;
was Emma Chester, and she was the orphan niece of Sir John Morton. His&#xD;
sister had married a Lieutenant Chester, who, in one of the half wild campaigns&#xD;
in India, had fallen within four months of his marriage. Emma was the pos-&#xD;
thumous child of their union, and her mother died soon after her birth, so that&#xD;
for a time, in India, she was in the care of strangers. They were kind and&#xD;
considerate strangers, though ; and it was not until the little orphan was&#xD;
some twelve years old that Sir John-Morton, at the solicitation of his lady,&#xD;
had her home to England.&#xD;
Now, it is rather a hazardous thing to bring up an impetuous boy of six-&#xD;
teen to the age of twenty under the same roof with a lovely girl of twelve,-&#xD;
who imperceptibly becomes the young lady of sixteen in four years, that&#xD;
glide by to the young and happy carelessly enough.&#xD;
Their relationship just sufficed to place Abel quite at his ease with Emma,&#xD;
and his mother told him that he was to look upon her as his sister in place&#xD;
of the lost one; but he loved her better than ever sisters are loved ; and we&#xD;
shallxnot be far wrong when we say that Emma Chester, from the time that&#xD;
she began first toask her heart any questions at all, found that the image of&#xD;
her handsome cousin, Abel, was its occupant.&#xD;
The course of true love runs not smooth; and when the time came, which&#xD;
it did, for Abel to pass a term or two at college, he went with a heavy heart&#xD;
from his dear cousin, Emma; but that separation passed away, and then it&#xD;
became necessary for him to finish some studies in London dhich Sir John&#xD;
wished him very much, to excel in, so by his twentieth birth-day, Abel had&#xD;
been in London for six months, from Christmas to midsummer. His absence&#xD;
had cast a gloom over his fireside at home ; but as it was only to be for one&#xD;
year, even Emma taught herself the secret duplicity of affecting to smile when&#xD;
her heart was in reality sad.&#xD;
It was during these six months that the first change to a state of quiet se-&#xD;
renity seemed to come over Sir John Morton. It was whispered about the&#xD;
household that it was after a dream, in which he had seen his dear child Loo,&#xD;
who had looked smilingly at him, and told him she was happy, and that they&#xD;
would meet again, that he shook off the heavy load of grief, and began to look&#xD;
again at the world with more friendly eyes ; but be that as it may, he cer-&#xD;
tainly di recover to some degree.&#xD;
Now aving explained this much, we will look in upon the family. at their&#xD;
breakfast on a bright midsummer's day. The room they sat in was a charming&#xD;
one. Lady Morton half reclined upon a couch, drawn close to the breakfast-&#xD;
table and even she seemed to feel more than usually the genial influence of such&#xD;
a day as our fickle and wayward climate seldom has the graciousness to pre-&#xD;
sent us with,&#xD;
Sir John himself faced the window, and Emma Chester sat next to him,&#xD;
and was looking in his face as he lifted the letters slowly one by one that .&#xD;
were laid upon the breakfast-table, and which had just arrived by the post&#xD;
from London.&#xD;
"Well, uncle ?" said Emma-" well ?"&#xD;
"Well, niece ?" said=Sir John, as he smiled in the sad way that he did&#xD;
smile now ; but it was something to see him smile at all.&#xD;
"Oh, uncle, you know that it is-is Abel's letter that I don't want to&#xD;
see."&#xD;
"Very well ; then we will open it."&#xD;
"Now, uncle."&#xD;
"Has dear Abel written" said Lady Morton.&#xD;
"Yes," said Sir John ;  nd despite Emma's dislike to hear what he says,&#xD;
I will open his letter the veryfirst. Ah ! how well I should know his hand&#xD;
writing amid a multitude of letters 1"&#xD;

"Oh, yes," said Emma, "and so should I."&#xD;
"We all love him," said Lady Morton, "and that is why even his writing&#xD;
is fixed upon our memories so strongly that we can never, by any possibility,&#xD;
mistake it."&#xD;
"Yes, dear aunt, we all love him," said Emma; "that is-I mean that-&#xD;
that-"&#xD;
"You don't love him," added Sir John Morton.&#xD;
Emma got more confused than ever ; but, to her great relief, Sir John Mor-&#xD;
ton broke the seal of Abel's letter, and read as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
" Dear everybody at the old house at home.&#xD;
"It seems like obliterating time and space, and being at home again in the&#xD;
dear family circle, to write these lines, with the certainty that they will meet&#xD;
the eyes of those who will judge them kindly ; and, although, as I say, my&#xD;
head aches and my hand shakes, it is a melancholy pleasure to me to sit up&#xD;
and write to you all.&#xD;
"You must know, father, that there is a very intricate point of law involved&#xD;
in the subject of leaseholds of customary tenure, and I made a kind of prom-&#xD;
ise to one of the Masters in Chancery that I would study it for him, aid that&#xD;
is what has kept me up so late of a tight; and I have had, too, to purchase&#xD;
some very expensive books upon the subject, so that I am afraid, ridiculous&#xD;
as it may appear, that I am a little short of cash.&#xD;
"I live in a very quiet way, and if it were not that the din of the great city&#xD;
about me puts me in mind that I am in London, where, I fear, that there is a&#xD;
great deal of heartlessness and deception going on, I could almost fancy my-&#xD;
self a kind of Robinson Crusoe; and that my kind and estimable simple-&#xD;
hearted attendant, John Rowley, was my man Friday. Ah, we are neither&#xD;
of us adapted for a great city, I fear, where there is, according to report, such&#xD;
vice and irregularity of life. When I have the pleasure-and what a pleasure&#xD;
it will be !-of seeing you all, bless you, at the old place, I will explain to you&#xD;
the rather intricate point of law regarding leaseholds that I have been study-&#xD;
ing ; and, in the meantime, believe me to be, with the kindest and best love&#xD;
to all,                              "Your own&#xD;
ABEL MoRToN.&#xD;
"P. S. Do not forget, ridiculous as it may seem, that, in my ardor in the&#xD;
pursuit of my studies, I have really left myself with, I believe, but one soli-&#xD;
tary guinea at one end of my purse, and a few shillings at the other."&#xD;
Sir John placed the letter upon the breakfast-table and looked a little&#xD;
queer.&#xD;
"Law-books must be very expensive," he said.&#xD;
"You may depend they are, uncle," said Emma ; "but they are of value,&#xD;
you know, when once they are bought."&#xD;
"To be sure that is true. Well-well, we must not grudge poor Abel the&#xD;
means of becoming a great man; so, write a letter between you, and I will&#xD;
send him a cheque for another fifty pounds. Tell him to be careful of his&#xD;
health, and that, perhaps, next week I may give him a call in his rooms at&#xD;
the Albany-not that I want to hear anything about the intricate subject, of&#xD;
leaseholds."&#xD;
Emma rose and kissed her uncle, to whom she was much attached, and&#xD;
then drawing a little table towards her, she sat about writing to her cousin,&#xD;
Abel ; while Lady Morton looked at the beautiful girl, and wondered in her&#xD;
own mind whether it would ever be a match between her and Abel, which&#xD;
was one of the few-things in this world that the good lady had thoroughly&#xD;
and entirely set her heart upon.&#xD;

CHAPTER        IV.&#xD;
Wn leave the fresh and balmy breezes of the dear delightful country, to&#xD;
step into the huge city. Come with us, reader, to the Albany-then quite a&#xD;
newly-built place, and considered one of the most elegant abodes for the&#xD;
wealthy young bucks of the town.&#xD;
Imagine, then, an elegant suite of rooms in the Albany, the rent of which&#xD;
was, nominally, a hundred and fifty pounds per annum, but really three hun-&#xD;
dred pounds, by a little management connected with a premium, which was&#xD;
paid by quarterly instalments, but about which Abel did not think proper to&#xD;
trouble the home authorities at all.&#xD;
Well, the rooms were superb. The walls were draped with rare hangings.&#xD;
The furniture consisted of that bijouterie confusion that is so much affected&#xD;
by men of taste; and, in fact, an elegant and glittering litter was about the&#xD;
chamber that was quite charming to behold.&#xD;
The windows of the principal'apartment are thrown open. It is twelve&#xD;
o'clock in the day, and Abel Morton has just got up, and strolled into the&#xD;
brilliant room in a dressing-gown of quilted satin, lined with the most exqui-&#xD;
sitely delicate rose-colored silk.&#xD;
Upon a round table is spread a breakfast that it would puzzle any one to&#xD;
know where to begin upon, it was so very choice, and consisted of so many&#xD;
dIifferent things, and was heaped up and fenced round with so much silver plate.&#xD;
At the farther end of the apartment was the pattern servant, Rowley, in a&#xD;
white linen jacket and white kid gloves, carefully polishing a wine-glass, and&#xD;
ever and anon holding it up to the light, to see if its brilliancy were marred&#xD;
by any speck or fibre.&#xD;
"-Coffee or chocolate, this morning, sir ?" said Rowley, in that soft, silky,&#xD;
deferential whisper that such persons know so well how to put on.&#xD;
"Go to the devil !" said Abel.&#xD;
"Yes sir."&#xD;
Rowley went on polishing his glass, and Abel yawned twice, uttered an exe-&#xD;
cration, and then started, as a dab came at the knocker of the door of the&#xD;
chamber. Rowley paused in wiping the glass, and listened.&#xD;
"Who the deuce is that ?" said Abel.&#xD;
'A dun, nir."&#xD;
"A what?"&#xD;
"Some low fellow, sir, wants to be paid."&#xD;
"Confound his insolence !"&#xD;
"A men, sir !"&#xD;
"Upon my word, this is too bad !" he said. "The rascal ! No sooner&#xD;
does a man get out of his bed than here comes some pounds, shillings and&#xD;
pence mechanical rascal, whose whole cry is money-money-money! Oh,&#xD;
Rowley, what a grasping world this is !"&#xD;
Quite right, sir."&#xD;
Dab! dab!&#xD;
Abel Morton jumped up from his chair, and gathering the costly dressing-&#xD;
gown around him, he said--&#xD;
" Tell him I'm out of town--tell him I'm dead--in the family vault ! any-&#xD;
thing, so that you get rid, of him, and make me a cup of chocolate directly. I&#xD;
should like to shoot somebody."&#xD;
Abel Morton retreated to the inner room, and Rowley went to the outer&#xD;
door of the chamber, and opened it so sharply, that a man who was trying to&#xD;
look through the keyhole fell in upon all fours in a moment.&#xD;
" IIolloa !" said Rowley. "Serve you right."&#xD;
" O, but come, I say, Rowley, is the governor at home? Come, now you&#xD;
kno w I always behaved like a trunip to you, and gave you your five shillings&#xD;
in the pound out of the plunder. I want my money-forty-nine pounds eight&#xD;
shillings and twopence halfpenny, for gloves and peifumery. Come, now. just&#xD;
.,peak to him about it."&#xD;

"He isn't here."&#xD;
"Where is he, then ?"&#xD;
"Gone to the old man to get some supplies. I needn't tell you that the&#xD;
old man4s so rich he don't know what tb do with his money. Well, our&#xD;
governor has gone down to him to get a few thousands or so, and then it will&#xD;
be all square.",&#xD;
"Will it now, really, though ?"&#xD;
"To be sure it will. Look at me. Do I look like the sort of fellar that&#xD;
would stick to anybody who hadn't the ready to come down with in the long&#xD;
run Z"&#xD;
"Why, no, Rowley."&#xD;
"Then be off with you. Come next week."&#xD;
Bang went the door, and Rowley went back to his master's room.&#xD;
"Gone ?" asked Abel, from the inner apartment.&#xD;
"Yes, sir-off and away."&#xD;
"Being gone, then Abel's himself again," said the scapegrace, as he once&#xD;
more flung himself in the easy chair. "Chocolate, Rowley, and be quick, on&#xD;
your life. Don't answer anybody else. iat did you tell the fellow, by-the-&#xD;
by who was it ?"&#xD;
"Glover and perfumer, sir. Forty-nine pounds odd, sir. Kid gloves-riding&#xD;
trousers, and perfumes for you know who. sir."&#xD;
" Oh-ah--well-I understand you."&#xD;
" Dando, sir."&#xD;
'Silence, you villain ! How dare you call the charming-the exquisite-&#xD;
the divine Mademoiselle Dandoloski, of the King's Theatre, Dando ? Ah ! she&#xD;
is beautiful, so beautiful ! Such cheeks !&#xD;
"0. or !"&#xD;
"What do you mean&#xD;
"Nothing, sir, only if you begin to sigh, sir, it is time for me to groan, that's&#xD;
all. But sir, if I may be so bold as to give a little advice, and if you would&#xD;
not be offended, and will promise not to throw the coffee-pot nor the sugar-&#xD;
glass at my head, sir-&#xD;
" What the deuce do you want to say?  Say it at once or I will throw the&#xD;
whole tray full at your head !".&#xD;
"Well, then, sir, something must be done."&#xD;
"About what ?"&#xD;
"The little encumbrances, you know, sir. All the day long it's nothing&#xD;
else but knock, knock, knock, at the door; and what with boot makers, and&#xD;
tailors, and haberdashers, and horse-keepers, and--"&#xD;
"Alas !"&#xD;
"Yes, sir, that's true enough. It's most of it owing to a lass."&#xD;
" Silence ! Don't mock me. I dread to expose the real state of affairs to.&#xD;
my father. They suppose that I am studying the law, and injuring my health&#xD;
by the closeness of my attention to it. What will they all think of me when&#xD;
they find out the truth? My father, my mother, and Emma Chester, my&#xD;
cousin, and even the old servants-what will they not say of me&#xD;
"Ha! ha !"&#xD;
"You villain, how dare you laugh ?",&#xD;
"It wasn't at you, sir-indeed, it wasn't. Excuse me, sir, but the fact is,&#xD;
this is your first little out of the way affair, sir. You ain't accustomed to get&#xD;
over the traces, you see, sir, and so you are rather afraid of the consequences;&#xD;
but, of course after the first little fuming and humming about it, the old man&#xD;
will pay all the debts, and you will be able to go on again as comfortably as&#xD;
possible."      o-.&#xD;
"I have written to him."&#xD;
"For tin ?"&#xD;
"Yes. For fifty. If he should send that amount, it will ward off the evil&#xD;
day for a little.&#xD;
Bang !-bang! came at the outer door of the chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Vanish, sir," said Rowley. "Be off?"&#xD;
- "Ofl?  Where to ?"&#xD;
"Into the next room, sir. Only keep out of the way, that's all. I'll drive&#xD;
them off this time, somehow."&#xD;
"Get rid of them if you lie for an hour," said Abel, as he dashed into an&#xD;
adjoining room, with serious thoughts of getting under the bed, or up the&#xD;
hitnney.&#xD;
When Rowley opened the outer door, he was prepared with a small slip of&#xD;
paper, and a couple of wafers, which he was deliberately wetting; and then,&#xD;
heedless of the commotion and the babel of voices that dinned his ears, he&#xD;
stuck the paper on the outside of the door. Upon it was written-&#xD;
"Return to-morrow."&#xD;
The creditors looked-at each other, and then one said-&#xD;
"Will he pay then ?"&#xD;
"Honor-honor !" said Rowley, as with a sudden movement he slapped the&#xD;
atrcet door against the nose of the foremost of the duns.&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
ROWLEY having ggt rid of the duns returned to his master and hinted to&#xD;
him the propriety of taking a wife and paying his debts with her dowry.&#xD;
This awkward and worldly-wise suggestion of Rowley's suddenly drove&#xD;
ba k Abel's thoughts to the only being in all the world whom he would have&#xD;
teek, glad to have called his own.&#xD;
Emma Chester then, for the time being, became in the ascendant, that fair&#xD;
cousin who was the light of the house which had been despoiled of the young&#xD;
child who was still so deeply regretted.&#xD;
"Leave me, Rowley."&#xD;
"Yes, sir, of course, sir; but I hope you will think over the affair I have&#xD;
mentioned."&#xD;
Go at once-go. The suggestion displeases me. Never mention it again."&#xD;
Rat, tat, tat ! came a knock at the door, and Abel started.&#xD;
"That ain't a dun, sir."&#xD;
"Open the door then."&#xD;
Rowley flung open the outer door, and ushered in Lord Rokeley and Cap-&#xD;
tain Lorrinet, of the guards.&#xD;
"Ah, Morton, how are you, old fellow ?"&#xD;
"How do ?" said Lord Rokeley, in a drawling tone. "'Pon soul ! how do ?"&#xD;
"Oh, blooming enough, thank you," replied Morton. "Glad to see you&#xD;
both. But are you up to anything? What's to be the game to-day ?"&#xD;
Well, we are not particular. We are open to any offer you may have to&#xD;
make us, Abel."&#xD;
"'Pon soul, yes."&#xD;
"I am for all and everything you can propose. Take seats."&#xD;
.Dab ! dab ! came at the door.&#xD;
Rowley made his appearance with a letter for his master.&#xD;
" By your gracious leaves," said Morton, as he opened the epistle and a&#xD;
.heque for fifty fluttered out.&#xD;
"Humph !" he cried. "Here's enough to amuse ourselves with. Let's be&#xD;
ff. Rowley, get my things ready. Upon my word, I was getting rather&#xD;
queer in the way of resources, but now all's right, and we will have a jolly day&#xD;
Of it !"&#xD;
"Let's have three hunters," said Captain Lorrinet, "and race to Richmond&#xD;
t'or a dinner, then. We can get back in good time for the opera."&#xD;
"'Pon soul ! agreed."&#xD;
"Agreed!' cried Abel Morton ; "that will be the very thing., Wait for me&#xD;
a few minutes-I will be with you soon."&#xD;

HEADS AND HEARTS; OR,&#xD;
"Sir, sir," said Rowley to Abel, as he helped him on with his coat. "Sir,&#xD;
if y on please-"&#xD;
"What now?"&#xD;
"Why sir, shall I get you change for that cheque, sir'? Perhaps you would&#xD;
like to eave a few pounds with me, you know, sir."&#xD;
Be off with you. I will bring you home some money. You are decidedly&#xD;
the most grasping, awful fellow after money, Rowley, that I ever met with.&#xD;
Bold your noise, or I will not bring home a single guinea."&#xD;
"0, but sir-if you please Mr. Morton. Really, now--"&#xD;
"All's right - I'm ready, Rokeley and Lorrinet. Let's be off. It will&#xD;
be a delicious day. Couldn't we get round to Roehampton and give Dando-&#xD;
loski a call ?"&#xD;
"Not a doubt of it, 'pon soul ."&#xD;
"Come on. then-come on ! My gloves, Rowley-Ha! ha! I am so glad&#xD;
you have both come--so very glad ; and Rowley, if any one comes you can&#xD;
say I have gone to the North Pole with a gentleman in his yacht, you know."&#xD;
Yes, sir."&#xD;
Rowley saw that it was quite useless at that juncture to trouble his master&#xD;
for any more money, so, with a sigh, he opened the outer door, and held it for&#xD;
the departure of the two thoughtless, if not very vicious, young men. They&#xD;
were upon the very threshold, and Abel Morton was pulling on his gloves,&#xD;
when a shrill shriek burst upon their ears, and a slight shadowy figure (lashed&#xD;
past them, and into the chambers, before any of them could move a finger&#xD;
to stop it. By the lash of the drapery of the figure it was evidently a female,&#xD;
and the cry that it uttered was likewise too feminine to be mistaken.&#xD;
"What is this ?" said Abel. " Did any one pass ?"&#xD;
"To be sure," said Lorriuet. "A female."&#xD;
"Somebody uncommonly mad, sir," said Rowley.&#xD;
"Mad !" said Lord Rokeley. "how fatiguing to be mad. Come on, do."&#xD;
"Nay, excuse me," added Abel. "I cannot leave my rooms without ascer-&#xD;
tainiug who it is that has made free with them: I will have her out."&#xD;
Abel Morton looked rather serious as he advanced into the magnificent room&#xD;
in which he had been so recently breakfasting. The occurrence was one of&#xD;
so very strange and unusual a character, that it was difficult to say what species&#xD;
of risk he might be running by taking the lead in the attempt to solve the&#xD;
mystery ; and yet, as it was his ownn place he could not very well do other~&#xD;
wise. Abel was soon convinced that whatever interest and mystery there was&#xD;
connected with the affair, there was no danger.&#xD;
Kneeling on the floor, with her face hidden upon one of the pillows of the&#xD;
couch, at the further end of the room from the door, was the female who had&#xD;
made so sudden and alarming an entry into the chambers.&#xD;
The three young men looked at the kneeling figure, and then at each other&#xD;
with interrogative glances; but for some few moments neither of them spoke.&#xD;
It was Abel Morton, then, who broke the silence'&#xD;
'What has induced you," he said, "to conic here. Are you in any danger ?"&#xD;
The mysterious unknown uttered'a sharp, plaintive cry, and rising from her&#xD;
recumbent position, she astonished the young men by presenting to them the&#xD;
face and figure of a young girl of sonic fifteen or sixteen years of age, and of&#xD;
such surpassing sweetness and beauty that they were struck with wonder.&#xD;
CHAPTER        VI.&#xD;
TH young girl let her eyes sink before the gaze of the three young men&#xD;
and then Abel, advancing, said to her--&#xD;
"If you were flying from any danger, you are quite safe here. Be seated&#xD;
and assure yourself that no one will be permitted to harm you in this place&#xD;
Only let us know what it is that alarmed you."-&#xD;
" Sir, I thank you. I am very, very sorry."&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHER' THE COLONEL.&#xD;
&#xD;
23&#xD;
&#xD;
"For what?   Surely not for seeking protection from some insult ?"&#xD;
"Oh, no-no ! But I will go now, sir. Let me go now. I can find the&#xD;
way easily by myself."&#xD;
At this moment a voice from the other room cried out-&#xD;
"Dora--lora ! My dear Dora, are you here? Oh, speak to me."&#xD;
"Oh, that is my uncle--my good uncle, I mean, and not the Colonel," cried&#xD;
the young girl; but before she could leave the apartment to meet him, an&#xD;
elderly gentleman, with a very bald head, and attired in a scrupulously sober&#xD;
suit of black, rushed past the three young men, and clasped the girl in his arms.&#xD;
"Who of you all can tell," he said, "how this child came here ?"&#xD;
Ican tell you, sir, how she came here," said Morton, "but why she came&#xD;
here is a mystery to us all."&#xD;
"Sir, I very much fear this is a great intrusion, indeed. My name, sir, is&#xD;
Elk, and this is my niece. Tell me, my dear Dora, how it was that you were&#xD;
compelled to come here? I was myself passing the place, and I saw a car-&#xD;
riage, the livery of which I knew too well, close at hand, and some people&#xD;
who were about said that a young lady had made her way into these chambers."&#xD;
"Yes, uncle-oh, yes ! You had hardly left home half an hour this morn-&#xD;
ing when he came."&#xD;
"My brother, the colonel?"&#xD;
"Yes, uncle. He came, and in spite of my tears and entreaties, he forced&#xD;
me into his carriage and drove off with me. By mere chance, the carriage-&#xD;
door swung open as'we had to stop, in consequence of a horse having fallen&#xD;
close to this place, and I seized the opportunity of springing out, and taking&#xD;
refuge through the first open door that presented itself to me ; and thus it was&#xD;
that I came here, and intruded myself upon this gentleman's roor is, for which&#xD;
I tender him many apologies."&#xD;
"And mine likewise," said Mr. Elk, addressing Lord Rokeley.&#xD;
"'Pon soul, they ar'n't my rooms."&#xD;
"Nor mine," said Captain Lorrinet.&#xD;
"They are mine, sir," said Abel Morton; "but there is not the slightest&#xD;
occasion to apologise, I assure you."&#xD;
"Sir, you are too good. Gentlemen, I lead a quiet, and, I hope, a religions&#xD;
and gentlemanly life, myself; but I am, unfortunately cursed with a twin bro-&#xD;
ther, who has been a Colonel of cavalry in the Austrian service-would that&#xD;
he had remained there !-but a year or two ago, or perhaps more,-he came&#xD;
home here with a considerable fortune, and since then he has been my tor-&#xD;
ment."&#xD;
"A sad case, sir," said Abel.&#xD;
-4"0, very--very. You see, sir, that my niece, Dora Elk, is a very beautiful&#xD;
girl; and this brother of mine wishes, I blush to tell it, that she should visit&#xD;
with him the house of a man who, although he is a nobleman, is a disgrace to&#xD;
his order. Gentlemen, I need say no more. Pray accept my apologies and&#xD;
my thanks."&#xD;
"There is no occasion, sir, for either," said Abel. " My servant will get you&#xD;
a coach."&#xD;
"No--no, I thank you, but I could not think of giving still more trouble.&#xD;
I thank you, sir, from my heart. Good morning, gentlemen. Come, Dora,&#xD;
my child-come."&#xD;
The young girl bowed to Abel, and looked her thanks with an eloquence&#xD;
surpassing that of language, and then she left the chambers, leaning upon the&#xD;
arm of her uncle.&#xD;
"Upon my life, an angel !" said Lord Rokeley.&#xD;
"She is lovely," said Abel.&#xD;
Morton laughed, but Captain Lorrinet looked uncommonly grave.&#xD;
"I cannot help fancying that I have met that uncle in society, and yet I&#xD;
could not say,where for the life of me. But, come : are we to give up our day's&#xD;
enjoyment because there is an Elk in the world who has a pretty niece'? Let&#xD;
us be off at once."&#xD;

"I am ready," cried Morton ; but the tone in which he spoke was rather a&#xD;
strange and abstracted one.&#xD;
"And I," yawned Lord Rokeley. "Dear me, I'm afraid we shall find the&#xD;
day and tandems and the dinner very fatiguing. Come along."&#xD;
As soon as Rowley had the chambers to himself, and by a rapid glance&#xD;
around them felt quite certain that his master had forgotten nothing in the&#xD;
shape of gloves, walking-cane, handkerchief or watch, he walked to the break-&#xD;
fast-table. and inspected its contents.&#xD;
"0, he hasn't touched the fowl, so I shall indulge myself with half of it&#xD;
and as my stomach is a little out of sorts this morning. I think a glass of claret&#xD;
will be better than chocolate or.coffee."&#xD;
With this Mr. Rowley slipped on his master's recherche dressing-gown, and&#xD;
sunk into the unoccupied seat by the table with all the ease and impudene&#xD;
for which such personages are famous.&#xD;
"Well," said Rowley, as he poured himself out a tumbler of claret, "here's&#xD;
luck."&#xD;
In this highly facetious manner Rowley drank to himself, and then, with all&#xD;
the coolness in the world, he opened a letter the seal of which Abel Morton&#xD;
had done very little more than break, and read as follows-&#xD;
"MY DEAR - ABEL,-At the desire of your father, I write to you to enclose&#xD;
the cheque for fifty pounds which you will receive with this. We were all&#xD;
well, Abel, but we are now sick at heart to think that you will so much&#xD;
endanger your health-that health which you know is so very precious to us&#xD;
all, by over-study and by too arduous an attention'to your law-books.'&#xD;
" 0, my eye !'.' said Rowley, "here's a go 1"&#xD;
"'And, dear Abel, why do you shun society and shut yourself up with your&#xD;
books in the way you doI Why do you not seek for some friends of your&#xD;
own age, and in harmless mirth, now and then see a little pleasure ?'&#xD;
"Well, I never! This letter will be the death of me. It will give me a&#xD;
stitch in the side with laughing."&#xD;
"' Think of all this, dear Abel, and when you come to us again, let us see&#xD;
that the pallor of the student has given place to the more healthful color of-'"&#xD;
The door of the room was hastily opened, and Abel Morton stood upon the&#xD;
threshold.&#xD;
Rowley slipped off the chair, and dashed under the table, dressing-gown, and&#xD;
letter, and claret, all in his grasp.&#xD;
CHAPTER        VII.&#xD;
TnoMAs-Thomas, my good fellow ! Stop, if you please, Thomas, at the&#xD;
Albany, and Thomas, you will be so good as to drive to the entrance in Bur-&#xD;
lington'Street."&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
Such was the conversation that took place between a handsome, serious, bald&#xD;
man in a barouche and his coachman, as the vehicle turned into Bond Street&#xD;
from the Oxford Road, as Oxford Street was then named.&#xD;
The carriage stopped at the entrance to the Albany, and after gracefully&#xD;
swinging in the slightest possible manner upon its well-hung springs to and&#xD;
fro, it came to a full stop.&#xD;
Now, Thomas, if I am detained beyond a quarter-of-an-hour, you will&#xD;
gently walk the horses round Burlington Gardens, you understand ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sr.&#xD;
"Mr. Morton's chambers," said Mr. Elk, "if you please, beadle."&#xD;
"Yes, sir. This way if you please, sir. This is the doorway. On the first&#xD;
floor, if you please, sir.""&#xD;
"Thank you--thank you."&#xD;
Mr. Elk ascended the staircase, and tapped at the door of Morton's room.&#xD;

MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Is Mr. Morton within ?"&#xD;
"No, sir, he isn't up."&#xD;
"A very good answer, my friend. Very good, indeed. But it is now twelve&#xD;
o'clock. and probably your master will be up soon ?"&#xD;
Mr. Elk's fingers dived into his waistcoat pocket, and fished up a half-&#xD;
guinea. It was a very bright, dazzling-looking one, and Rowley instantly held&#xD;
out his hand. The half-guinea instantly dropped into it, as Mr. Elk said-&#xD;
-I am the gentleman who came with the young lady here yesterday evens&#xD;
ing, and my object is, upon her part as well as upon my own, to thank Mr.&#xD;
Morton for his kindness. I dare say I can see him ?"&#xD;
Rowley knew perfectly well that if he went beforehand to his master, and&#xD;
,said-" Here, sir, is Mr. Elk come to thank you," the reply would be in all&#xD;
probability, particularly in the then state of Abel's mind, a polite intimatioii&#xD;
that he and Mr. Elk might go to the devil, nd there remain as long as they&#xD;
pleased; so he threw open the door of the  eakfast-room, andin a loud tone&#xD;
announced-,&#xD;
"Mr. Elk !"&#xD;
Thus taken by surprise, Abel was too much of a gentleman to insult a gen-&#xD;
tleman,; and as Mr. Elk bowed upon the threshold of the room, Abel rose, and&#xD;
bowed likewise, muttering something about the pleasure of seeing him.&#xD;
-My dear sir, said Mr. Elk, "I have come to thank you. My good child,&#xD;
Dora, would not let me rest until I had come to thank you before she started&#xD;
Jbr Worthing this morning, and I need not say that my heart joins with hers&#xD;
in the feelings of gratitude we must-ever feel towards you."&#xD;

"0, sir, it was nothing at all. The young lady took refugein the room, and&#xD;
of course I should have protected her if she had been followed by any one ;&#xD;
but as she was not, I had nothing to do but to feel quite delighted at your&#xD;
opportune appearance."&#xD;
Mr. Elk patted his eyes with his handkerchief as he replied-&#xD;
" Ah, you who, no doubt, are a prudent, exemplary young man, little know&#xD;
the deep anxiety of my mind."&#xD;
"Anxiety, sir ?,&#xD;
"Yes. I ap rich-that is to say, I am comfortable, although my income&#xD;
does not exceed my expenditure ; but when I talk of anxiety I-I-"&#xD;
" Pray compose yourself, sir."&#xD;
"I think of-of---"&#xD;
"Of what'?"&#xD;
"I wish it were a what only. That would be a circumstance that might&#xD;
be altered ; but it is of my brother, the colonel, I think-"&#xD;
"Ah, you mentioned him."&#xD;
"Yes, Colonel Elk. Oh, Mr. Morton, you do not know what it is to be&#xD;
connected with a brother a colonel such as mine. If I could only think him&#xD;
mad, it would be nothing in comparison with what he makes me suffer; and&#xD;
yet strange to say, he is not, after all, a bad man."&#xD;
"You speak in riddles, sir."&#xD;
"I know it-I feel it. But the fact is, Mr. Abel Morton, the colonel is so&#xD;
desperately gay and adventurous that he is always getting into scrapes, and&#xD;
always getting out of them. Then he is rich-as rich as Croesus, although he&#xD;
won't own it, not he."&#xD;
"Indeed !"&#xD;
Here a rat tat tat !-rat tat tat ! came at the outer door. Rowley popped&#xD;
his head into the breakfast-room, and looked at his master.&#xD;
"Don't like it, sir. Not the right thing."&#xD;
"What do you mean&#xD;
"That knock at the door, sir. A pretty fair intimation, but not the right&#xD;
thing. Shall I keep it close, sir, or shall I open it 7"&#xD;
Abel's face flushed a little that his visitor should be let into so many of the&#xD;
secrets of his menage, and he cried out-&#xD;
"Open the door, Samuel, at once! How dare you come bothering me about&#xD;
your suspicions and your nonsense? Open the door, sir, I say !"&#xD;
"Very good, sir."&#xD;
Abel turned pale as he heard the sound of voices in an angry tone in the&#xD;
outer room, and then the door was flung open, and an individual appeared&#xD;
attired in an outrageous fashion. He wore a crimson silk waistcoat, and over&#xD;
that a dirty yellow plush one. A supply of faded jewelry was about him suf-&#xD;
ficient to stock a country shop in that line. His cravat was truly elaborate,&#xD;
and a pin in it stuck up in front of his chin, with a knob at the end of it as&#xD;
large as a cherry.&#xD;
"What is the meaning of this intrusion ?" said Abel, starting to his feet.&#xD;
"Who are you, sir?"&#xD;
"Beg pardon, sir, I'm sure," said the man. "Hope I don't intrude, as the&#xD;
chap in the play says. Ha !-ha! you take?  Ha !-ha !"&#xD;
"Rowley, kick this fellow down stairs."&#xD;
"0, dear,'no-not at all," said the man advancing to the table. "None of&#xD;
that ifiyou please, sir. I always transacts business as a gent with them as is&#xD;
gents. Perhaps you'd rather see me alone, sfr ?"&#xD;
"See you alone.? See you hanged, you mean."&#xD;
"0, very good sir. In course it's all the same to me ; only I thought, per-&#xD;
haps, you would rather the elderly gent wasn't made fly to the little affair."&#xD;
" Dear me !" said Mr. Elk. "i'll go at once, Mr. Morton, if you please."&#xD;
"No-no! You beast, say at once what you want here, and have done&#xD;
with it."&#xD;
"Very well, sir. I'm civil with them as is civil with me. I've done no&#xD;

business but amdng real gents for a long time. Tip-top swells is my caper;&#xD;
and I thought I should find a gent in a place like this as would treat me like&#xD;
a gent. You are my prisoner, Mr. Abel Morton. Here's the warrant. At&#xD;
the suit of John Soaker, wine merchant, and the amount, one hundred and&#xD;
eighty-two pounds four shillings and sixpence, expenses, in course, makes more.&#xD;
Capital accommodation in a good, airy situation, No. , Chancery Lane."&#xD;
"Arrested !" gasped Abel, as he sarik into a seat.&#xD;
A silence of some minutes duration ensued in the magpificent apartment of&#xD;
Abel Morton. Abel sat looking pale and wan at the superb breakfast things&#xD;
upon the table, and Mr. Elk, through his gold double eyeglass, surveyed the&#xD;
bailiff.&#xD;
"Now, sir," said the bailiff. "Time is precious, you know, sir. Chancery&#xD;
Lane or quod, if you please, sir. Make up your mind."&#xD;
"Really," said Mr. Elk, "this is very distressing.. My dear Mr. Morton, the&#xD;
best wayin all these little affairs is to pay at once."&#xD;
"Pay, sir, do you say? I have not a guinea."&#xD;
Mr. Elk drew Abel Morton aside, and whispered to him-- -&#xD;
" My dear young friend do not allow yourself to be taken to prison. There&#xD;
is contamination in the very atmosphere of such a place to one who, like you,&#xD;
has a pure, fresh spirit. Do not, I implore you. Yqu have some money in&#xD;
your purse now. and you shall have more. Take the counsel of an older nn&#xD;
than ourself. end go to Chancery Lane to the lock-up house of this man  '&#xD;
"But I have no hope."&#xD;
"Your father----'&#xD;
"No, no, I cannot--I dare not write to him. Alr  y ha  I deceivedhim&#xD;
and all of those at home. It is horrible to think o Do not, if you value my&#xD;
sanity, talk to me of my flier, sir."&#xD;
"Well-well, we will not. Oh, that I had th wealth of my brother the&#xD;
colonel ! He is rich, my dear Mr. Morton, and if you would only condescend&#xD;
to borrow of him.--He is a bad, cold-hearted man, I tell you; but he does lend&#xD;
money now and then to my certain knowledge. Will you see him ?"&#xD;
"I will. If he can and will extricate'me from this tangle upon any decent&#xD;
terms, I shall be obliged to both you and him. How can I see him ?"&#xD;
"Why, the fact is, I was going to call upon him this morning to-forbid him&#xD;
my house for the future, on account of his atrocious conduct to our niece, Dora;&#xD;
but I will defer my own quarrel with him until he has seen you and settled&#xD;
your  fair. I will bring him to you myself, if you will now go with this man&#xD;
to his house in Chancery Lane."&#xD;
"Be it so. Mr. Elk you are a friend raised up by Providence for me in my&#xD;
hour of need."&#xD;
Abel and Mr. Elk shook hands with each other, and the old gent, as Mr.&#xD;
Lyon called him, went with a bland look from the chambers.&#xD;
Morton put on his coat and cravat, and was ready forthe streets. Rowley&#xD;
was despatched for a cab into which Mr. Lyon and Abel got. Rowley shut&#xD;
the outer door of the chambers, and flung himself at full length on a crimson-&#xD;
satin sofa.&#xD;
While Rowley was soliloquising in the deserted chamber, the cab was rum-&#xD;
bling and rattling towards Chancery Lane, and duly drew up at the lock-np&#xD;
house belonging to Mr. Lyon. officer to the sheriff of Middlesex.&#xD;
"Now, Mister," said Lyon," you may be as comfortable as a kepeordin a&#xD;
pallas here, if you like. All you have got to do is to pay. There's a coffee-&#xD;
room for gents as don't like to go to the expense of a private room all to them-&#xD;
selves; and then there's a nice room on the second floor that you can have for&#xD;
a trifle, all to yourself, with a turn-up bedstead, that all the world thinks isa&#xD;
sideboard."&#xD;
"That will do," said Abel.&#xD;
"It's a guinea a day."&#xD;
"Very well; that will do I tell you."&#xD;
"A private room for the gent," cried Mr. Lyon; whereupon Miss Lyon put&#xD;

in an appearance, exhibiting herself as a young lady of about thirty, who did&#xD;
not appear to have washed her face for the last week or so; but then she wore&#xD;
very large gold hearings, and had a stained old blue satin dress on, that was a&#xD;
long way down her shoulders.&#xD;
Abel felt sickened at the sight of this young hag, as she tripped up the dingy&#xD;
staircase to show him to his room.&#xD;
Abel now thought of his father, so indulgent and so kind, and so worn down&#xD;
with grief for the loss of his dear child. He remembered that father's words&#xD;
when he, Abel, set off to London. "Now my dear boy, Abel, as you will be&#xD;
in the great city, I know that while others are leading lives of riot and dissi-&#xD;
pation, you will ever keep alive the inquiry for our lost darling Loo.  And&#xD;
then the old man had wept ; but they were not even such bitter tears as he,&#xD;
Abel, was weeping just then in that horrid lock-up house.&#xD;
But there was yet another remembrance to come to Abel; and with the&#xD;
name of Emma Chester on his lips, he sobbed as though his heart would break.&#xD;
"Colonel Elk !" cried a voice, and the room door was flung wide open by&#xD;
the obsequious Mr. Lyon himself.&#xD;
CHAPTER        VIII.&#xD;
WE left Abel Morton in the lock-up house of Mr. Lyon in Chancery Lane,&#xD;
and in anything but a pleasant frame of mind. It will be remembered that&#xD;
the better reflections that had came across him, and which were ,most cer-&#xD;
tainly for the good of his soul, were interrupted by the arrival of Colonel&#xD;
Elk.&#xD;
Colonel Elk was dressed in the first style of fashion; and the jewelry that&#xD;
was about him, although it could not be called too snowy, or, indeed, be said&#xD;
to be in bad taste, was rather strikingly massive.&#xD;
"I have the pleasure," said the colonel, when the door was closed, of seeing&#xD;
Mr. Abel Morton, I believe ?"&#xD;
"That is my name, sir  Pray be seated."&#xD;
"Thank you. A good hunting day this ; a south wind and a cloudy sky.&#xD;
I wish I were on the downs. This is a d---d hole for a gentleman to be&#xD;
cooped up in."&#xD;
"It is, indeed, colonel."&#xD;
"Well my sanctified brother spoke to me about you, and I look upon you&#xD;
in the light of the peace-offering."&#xD;
"The what, sir ?"                                 -&#xD;
"The peace-offering between us. The fact is, that my brother and I don't&#xD;
often agree, and we should have had a confounded tiff this morning, if it&#xD;
hadn't been that he wanted..me to help you out of this scrape."&#xD;
"Oh, I understand."&#xD;
"Exactly. You see, the Earl of Cashen has taken a fancy to our little niece,&#xD;
Dora, and I think I can make him marry her ; but my brother, Josiah, is as&#xD;
timid as a hare, and won't let me risk the affair, in any way. Confound it !&#xD;
D-n all cowardice. But, what is all this to you? Of course, you are think-&#xD;
ing of your own affairs, not mine, or my niece's. You must dine with me at&#xD;
my lodgings to-day. Can you do so&#xD;
"Can I ?"  Abel laughed. "You forget, colonel, where I am."     .s&#xD;
"No I don't. I merely ask if you are free from any engagement, that is&#xD;
all."&#xD;
"Quite so. There was some talk about going somewhere with Lord Roke-&#xD;
ley ; but nothing was fixed."&#xD;
"Very good. Is there a bell here'?  Oh, yes : there it is. Don't ,trouble&#xD;
yourself, Morton: I'll ring it."&#xD;
In a few moments Mr. Lyon made his appearance, with an abundance of&#xD;
bows and grimaces.&#xD;
"Why Lyon," said Colonel Elk, "you ought to be ashamed of yourself.&#xD;
&#xD;
This is an infrnal shabby transaction, to bring a gentlemair here for such a&#xD;
trifle. What covers all oweing in this affair ?"&#xD;
"A couple of hundred, colonel, kivers all the expenses; and the little trifle&#xD;
of charge, I'm sure, with- a gent as is a gent.--"&#xD;
"Hold your row. There is a cheque for the amount. And now, Morton,&#xD;
let us be off out of this dog-hole as quickly as we can. You will have to get&#xD;
a bath as soon as possible, and give yb0i4 clothes to your man. My cab is at&#xD;
the door, I suppose ?"&#xD;
"Yes, colonel, it's all right. The blessed 'oss has been a-looking in at the&#xD;
parlor winder, and a-standing on his hind legs, for ever so long, colonel, and&#xD;
the boy a-hanging by his head."&#xD;
"But really, Colonel Elk," said Abel, "I cannot permit you, without any&#xD;
arrangement with me, to thus pay my debts."&#xD;
"Oh, nonsense  . We will settle all that before we part. Come on Mor-&#xD;
ton. It's not worth thinking about. You will be in feather again some day&#xD;
soon, you know, and then you can put me in mind of it."&#xD;
Abel was quite overpowered with the generosity of the colonel, and. made up&#xD;
his mind that he would make some suitable return for it. The cab, with the&#xD;
amazingly ,tall horse that had been looking in at the parlor windows, was&#xD;
there, and a diminutive tiger, on tip-toes, held, or was supposed to hold, the&#xD;
animal's head, with a toss of which he could have sent the foresaid tiger right&#xD;
over his back.&#xD;
The colonel made Abel get in first, and then darting after him, it seemed to&#xD;
be a kind of struggle between him and-the tiger whether or not he should suc-&#xD;
ceed in driving off before that diminutive personage could get up behind. The&#xD;
tiger, however, by making a wild rush, and hanging on for a moment or two,&#xD;
eventually succeeded in getting on his perch, and the colonel dashed}down&#xD;
Chancery Lane with the near wheel in the kennel, and utterly heedless of col-&#xD;
lision.&#xD;
To emerge from the narrow thoroughfare into Fleet Street--to dash through&#xD;
Temple Bar, and go down the Strand at a good ten miles an hour, seemed the&#xD;
easiest thing in the world to Colonel Elk.&#xD;
"You manage to drive fast in the crowded thoroughfares," said Abel.&#xD;
"Why, yes, I hear a good deal about the difficulty of getting along; but I&#xD;
don't fihd it out. My horse has courage, and so have I, and we get on our&#xD;
own side of the road, and we don't stop at trifles. The snobbery get out of&#xD;
the way usually."&#xD;
"So it seems. But do you never meet with an accident at thispace through&#xD;
the streets of London ?"&#xD;
"Why nothing to speak of. A few old women run over at times."&#xD;
"Indeed i"&#xD;
"uYes ; but it's the force that saves them. Your wheels fly over them safely&#xD;
as possible, and they get up again after a squall. To be sure, once a brewer's&#xD;
dray got rather the best of me."&#xD;
"I should think it would. But how was it, colonel."&#xD;
"At the corner of Bruton Street was a dray, you see. Of course I was not&#xD;
bound to see round a corner, so round I slapped in my usual style, and the&#xD;
- off-wheel took the dray, and sent us all right over the road and down an&#xD;
area."&#xD;
"A fearful fall !"&#xD;
"Not at all. We had a little kicking and scrambling, and then we al got&#xD;
into the front kitchen you see, and astonished the natives a little. My boy-.&#xD;
the same who is behind us now, I suppose-was 'found head-foremost in a&#xD;
coal-scuttle ; but I walked the horse up the kitchen stairs, and brought hin&#xD;
out at the front door quite comfortable."&#xD;
"And the cab likewise?"&#xD;
"Why no. That was rather a smash."&#xD;
"So I should think."&#xD;
"Here we are, though, at last.'&#xD;

MY BROTHER THE COLONEL.&#xD;
&#xD;
HEADS AND HEARTS; O,0&#xD;
&#xD;
The street in which the colonel drew up was one of those numerous ones&#xD;
that lead from Great Cumberland Street towards the Edgeware Road. The&#xD;
house was one of a large size, and the rooms of Colonel Elk were upon the&#xD;
first-floor, consisting of four handsome apartments. The appointments of&#xD;
those rooms were of the first style of fashion.&#xD;
"Now, my dear fellow," said-Elk, as he looked at his watch, "it wants an-&#xD;
hour to dinner time, so what will you do ?'&#xD;
"Anything, you like, colonel?'&#xD;
"Stop a bit. Let me order the table for two."&#xD;
The colonel rang a hand-bell, and almost before the sound had ceased an at-&#xD;
tendant made his appearance.&#xD;
"Covers for two to-day."&#xD;
The attendant bowed, and made his retreat without a word.&#xD;
"Now, Morton," said Elk, "they say you are rather spooney on the Dan-&#xD;
doloski."&#xD;
Morton blushed as he stammered out-.&#xD;
"I certainly very much admire the Signora Dandoloski, of Her Majesty's&#xD;
Theatre."&#xD;
"Not a doubt of it ; and, I can tell you, she admires you, for no less than&#xD;
three men have failed on your account with her."&#xD;
"Indeed !"&#xD;
"Yes: she might have capital offers; but she has taken a fancy to you, and&#xD;
so there's an end of it. Her Castilian blood will have its own way you know,&#xD;
so you have only to go and conquer, my boy."&#xD;
"Alas-alas -"&#xD;
"Why do you cry 'Alas?'"&#xD;
" Because, to tell the truth, colonel, I have kept from going near the Dan-&#xD;
doloski for some time past, simply because I could not go as I ought to go."&#xD;
"Why, what the deuce do you mean&#xD;
"Money !-money !".&#xD;
"0, that is it, is it?  Ha ! ha ! Mon cher Morton, that is a common com-&#xD;
plaint. By-the-by, what are your expectations, Morton?  Is the old one&#xD;
rich ?"&#xD;
"Yes, tolerably so. He made a fortune in India."&#xD;
" Oh-ah !"&#xD;
"About thirty or forty thousand pounds or so ; but he has funded the whole&#xD;
of it, and nothing will. move him. He is liberal, you know, to a fault ; but&#xD;
his idea of liberality would never come half-way to what I want in the metrop-&#xD;
olis, as you can easily imagine."&#xD;
"To be sure I can. Half-way?  Why, they would not come a quarter the&#xD;
way. Well-well, we'll think of some way of bolstering you up, Morton. It&#xD;
won't do to go down-hill at your time of life without a few feathers to fly with,&#xD;
will it now ?"'&#xD;
"Certainly not," said Abel, who began to think the colonel the most frank,&#xD;
free, and engaging man he had ever met with. In such like chat as this they&#xD;
passed the time until dinner was announced; and then the colonel, as he rose&#xD;
with Abel, to obey the summons, said-&#xD;
"Come what may of it, my dear Morton, you must not go to the wall for&#xD;
the sake of a few hundreds. Youth is a season that don't continue, and the&#xD;
pleasures of early life cannot be waited for. You must seize them as they pass,&#xD;
or they are gone."&#xD;
"Not a doubt of that," said Abel, "and I mean to seize them as they pass."&#xD;
"Bravo !-bravo! And now to dinner. We will talk more of this after-&#xD;
wards."&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAP TER       IX.&#xD;
WELL, Morton," said the Colonel, when the cloth was removed, "you wifl&#xD;
recollect that you never can have anything with me but bachelor's fare."&#xD;
"Give me leave to assure you, ColonelElk," said Abel as be stretched out&#xD;
his right hand over the table, "that I have enjoyed myself amazingly, and that&#xD;
your great and disinterested kindness- "&#xD;
a Don't name it, my dear boy," said the colonel, as he grasped Abel's honest,&#xD;
proffered hand-it was like the hand of an angel of light in comparison with&#xD;
that of the man who held it in his cold grip-" don't name it, mydear boy. I&#xD;
only hope we shall be good friends."&#xD;
"We are-we are."&#xD;
" Well, I was afraid that my brother, Josiah, had prejudiced you against&#xD;
me, that was all. He and I are very different men. The fact is, that he is&#xD;
cold and suspicious, and I am warm-hearted, and commit a thousand errors&#xD;
without thinking of them. But come, we will dip into a bottle of claret, and&#xD;
say no more of such matters. We have to visit the Dandoloski to-night, yop&#xD;
know."&#xD;
" Why, a-a-yes."&#xD;
"What is it, man?  0, forgive me: I quite forgot about your pecuniaries.&#xD;
Dear me, how ,thoughtless of me. You are not in full feather just now, Abel,&#xD;
I think you said?  How much will -do for the present?  You will want to&#xD;
give a trifle to the Dandoloski, in the shape of some ornament or another, sot&#xD;
will draw you a cheque for one hundred pounds at once, and you can cash it as&#xD;
we go along."&#xD;
"0, colonel, this goodness, this excessive kindness---"&#xD;
" Hush ! Here's my fellow with the wine. Not- another word about it,&#xD;
except that it will be just as well not to say anything to riy brother, Josiah,&#xD;
about the affair."&#xD;
The wine was excellent, and Abel took care to do justice to it; and then,'&#xD;
when Colonel Elk proposed a quiet game at Rouge et Noir just to pass away&#xD;
an idle hour, before they went to visit the Dandoloski, Abel cheerfully con-&#xD;
sented.&#xD;
The.excitement of gambling was a new one to Abel. That game with Col-&#xD;
onel Elk was the first one that he had played for anything like a large stake,&#xD;
and he rather started to see thirty pounds upon the turn up of a card, n&#xD;
jeopardy ; but the colonel looked so cool and composed, and sipped his wine&#xD;
so cheerfully when he lost, that Abel drew a long breath, and thought that&#xD;
Rouge et Noir was, after all, a charming mode of passing an hour.&#xD;
Abel rose from the table a winner of about one hundred and fifty pounds,&#xD;
and his face was flushed with the excitement of the game, and the blood was&#xD;
bounding through his veins at a most unwonted rate.&#xD;
" I-I will buy a pair of bracelets for the Dandoloski, colonel, as we go along,&#xD;
if you have no objection."&#xD;
"None in the least, my boy. It is a very nice present to make her. You&#xD;
see, she is in the new opera to-night, and is not wanted till half-past nine&#xD;
o'clock, so we are sure to find her at home, waiting for you."&#xD;
-" For me?"&#xD;
"Ay; or for some one else who will drive her to town and keep up her spirits&#xD;
on the way. I suppose you keep a cab ?"&#xD;
"No, no. I have had one from Slash, on hire."&#xD;
"Don't do it again, then. Buy one and drive it yourself, my boy. But the&#xD;
Dandoloski is not particular. My cab will hold three, and I will make room&#xD;
for her in it as we come back-that is to say, if she will ride with me at U,&#xD;
which I rather doubt; but if she won't, I can lend you the cab, and sek for&#xD;
myself some hack conveyance, you know."&#xD;
In a few moments Abel and the colonel were in the cab, and dashing along&#xD;
at a rate that was rather alarming. The vehicle drew up at a fashionWe&#xD;

jeweller's, where Abel paid forty guineas for a pair of gold bracelets, the real&#xD;
value of which was about twenty.&#xD;
"Now for the Dandoloski." said the colonel, and the horse began to step out&#xD;
in a style that was truly beautiful, as well as a little alarming. The wheels&#xD;
of the cab flew round at a rate that almost obliterated all noise ; and after a&#xD;
few minutes there was something exceedingly exhilarating in the rapidity of&#xD;
the motion.&#xD;
The well-lighted shops appeared to fly past like ignes fatui. Hyde Park&#xD;
corner was passed like something 'seen for a moment in a dream, and the dim&#xD;
and more dark suburb=of Bayswater was reached in a space of time that seemed&#xD;
all but impossible.&#xD;
There was a narrow, but beautifully shady lane, and at the corner of it a&#xD;
pretty Italian villa. Tall trees waved to and fro in the night air, and the place&#xD;
had a look of fresh an verdant beauty. That was the abode of the Daido-&#xD;
loski, as she was term4d by her admirers.&#xD;
The Dandoloski wa one of the stars of the operatic firmament, whicl come&#xD;
out with a vast amou t of eclat, but which quietly go in again in a very short&#xD;
space of time indeed.&#xD;
The moral character of the Dandoloski will, we trust, appear sufficiently dis-&#xD;
tinct in the course of our narrative.&#xD;
For her appearance, we may say, that she was a little above the ordinary&#xD;
height of women: that her complexion and her hair were dark : that she had&#xD;
large, black, sparkling eyes, and a high color, and a brilliant set of teeth ; a&#xD;
good laugh, but a voice that had too much of the lower tones in it to make it&#xD;
agreeable in a woman.&#xD;
She was just the woman to attract a young and inexperienced personage&#xD;
like Abel Morton, and drive him almost frantic with admiration.&#xD;
"Now, my dear fellow, you must be announced," said the colonel, as they&#xD;
alighted from the cab ; "for if she thinks I am here, ten to one but she will say,&#xD;
'Not at home,' or something of that sort."&#xD;
'Upon this understanding then, or this dread, Abel gave only his own name,&#xD;
and was at once shown into a pretty reception-room, that, in its style and&#xD;
decoration, transcended anything that he had ever seen or imagined.&#xD;
" Beautiful !" cried"Morton. "This is quite a paradise."&#xD;
"Do you think so?  Well, I own it is pretty, but I should soon tire of it.&#xD;
Give me a rock-a mountain-and a cave-a howling wind and a rushing sea,&#xD;
in preference to all this trickery of high-wrought civilization."&#xD;
The door of the room opened, and the Dandoloski appeared. She was en&#xD;
deshabille-thatris to say, she was elaborately-not dressed. The moment&#xD;
she saw Abel, she made a melo-dramatic rush forward, and alighted upon his&#xD;
arm, as she cried-&#xD;
"0, you bad beautiful! How was you to be ?"&#xD;
"Well and happy now," replied Abel, "and you ?"&#xD;
"Much more dead than noting ! 0, you bad beautiful, you not come when&#xD;
yesterday come to-morrow."«&#xD;
"I could not."&#xD;
"Rather difficult it would be," said the colonel.&#xD;
The Dandoloski gave a slight scream, and looked towards the window, where&#xD;
the colonel had half hidden himself.&#xD;
" Ah, it is one monster."&#xD;
"At your service," said the colonel, laughing.&#xD;
"Oh, y'ou was one brute wild beast, you know. How was you to impudence&#xD;
to go here, Colonel Elk ?"&#xD;
"How had I the impudence to come here, you mean?  I will tell you, fair&#xD;
Dandoloski. I came with my friend Morton."&#xD;
"No !" exclaimed the Dandoloski, stamping with vehemence; "you are one&#xD;
bad man and ugly, and not one friend of the Abel."&#xD;
The Dandoloski's eyes flashed, and she bit her  er lip, while the colonel&#xD;
flung himself upon one of the cerulean couches aid roared again with laughter.&#xD;
&#xD;
32&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.                        33&#xD;
Ho then took his watch from his waistcoat pocket, and held it to her eyes,&#xD;
adding-&#xD;
"There is such a place as the Italian Opera House, in the Haymarket, my&#xD;
dear Dandoloski.&#xD;
"This is much truth from one wild beast," said Dandoloski. "I.must-go.&#xD;
Make excuses to me while I go to the toilette, mon cher; I come to you soon&#xD;
a little while gone-half-an-hour ago."&#xD;
With this she sailed out of the rcon, bestowing upon Abel, as she disap-&#xD;
peared, a look that put him in raptures.&#xD;
"0, she is all that is charming-all that is feeling and delightful!" cried Abel.&#xD;
"I never saw such a form-such a face-such gems of eyes-such a smile ;&#xD;
and even the little mistakes she makes in the pronunciation of our barbarous&#xD;
language are to me so piquant and delightful, that I could listen to her all day&#xD;
and never tire of them. I love her, indeed--.I love her! Dear, charming Dan-&#xD;
doloski i"&#xD;
The colonel flung up his heels, and roared again with laughter.&#xD;
" Ah, Abel-Abel !" he said, when he had a little recovered," how very-&#xD;
very-no-I won't say that---"&#xD;
'"What were you going to say, colonel ?"&#xD;
"Never mind ; you are young and inexperienced. that is all'; but take the&#xD;
advice now of an old stager, and don't let this woman ruin you. Don't let&#xD;
her get anything from you but money. Enter into no pecuniary obligation&#xD;
for her. Gives her cash, or things that represent cash, such as bracelets, if&#xD;
you like; but there stop, my boy, Abel, and you will know what you are&#xD;
about.&#xD;
"Colonel, I thank you. I cannot but feel that this is good advice, and it is&#xD;
kind of you, a man of the world, to give it to me."&#xD;
"If I were not, I could not give it at all to you. Abel. I wish to forewarn&#xD;
you; but, bah ! here she comes again, fully equipped for London."&#xD;
CHAP-TER       X.&#xD;
"Now, my dear Emma, wrap yourself up well, do," said Lady Morton, as&#xD;
she stood in the hall of Morton house, shaking hands with Emma Chester,&#xD;
who was ready equipped to accompany her uncle, Sir John, to town, to get&#xD;
poor Abel, as they called him, to throw aside his law-books, and come to-them&#xD;
for a month.&#xD;
"Mind, my dear, that you don't take cold. Put something round your neck&#xD;
when the carriage turns a corner; and make Abel wrap himself up well-about&#xD;
the throat."&#xD;
"Yes, aunt, yes," said Emma. ." Good by."&#xD;
Emma was glad to escape from her aunt, and calling to her uncle that she&#xD;
was quite ready, she ran across the lawn, and sprang into the carriage like a&#xD;
young fawn.&#xD;
"My dear," said Sir John to Emma, "this will be quite a surprise for Abel&#xD;
to see us at his chambers."&#xD;
"0, yes, uncle, and he will' be so pleased."&#xD;
"Yes, poor boy, he will. Alas !. he is my only child now; and I often think&#xD;
that after all, he might as well live with us the life of an independent gentle-&#xD;
man at his ease instead of being in London, with its tainted air, and stultifying&#xD;
himself with a study that, however it may make a man wiser, certainly never&#xD;
made men better.&#xD;
"0 ,. uncle, I have often thought---"&#xD;
"What, Emma ?"&#xD;
"Just what you say now, uncle ; but you and aunt seemed to think that&#xD;
it was more proper for Abel to go to the law; so it was not for me to utter my&#xD;
opinion.&#xD;

"Well, well, when we get Abel down among us at the old place for a month"&#xD;
we will talk over future prospects, and see what can be done. There is one&#xD;
thing, though, that I do feel strongly upon, and that is, that there is no&#xD;
occasion for Abel to injure his health by his severe and continued study of the&#xD;
law."&#xD;
It was in this and such like discourse as this, that the fond and indulgent&#xD;
father, and the gentle and loving Emma Chester, wiled away the time that the&#xD;
horses in the old family coach took to carry them to the Albany.&#xD;
To have chambers in the Albany was like a perpetual latch-key. The pri-&#xD;
vilege of turning night into day, if at all agreeable so to do, and, in fact, to&#xD;
indulge in the freest and most unrestricted manner in all the gaities and all the&#xD;
follies of London.&#xD;
All this was unknown to Sir John Morton, for when lie had casually men-&#xD;
tioned to some better informed visitor than himself that his son was studying&#xD;
the law, and had chambers in the Albany, they felt a little surprised; yet no&#xD;
one lked to say, "Why, then, he will learn very little law."&#xD;
In the most complete and unenviable ignorance, then, did Sir John Morton&#xD;
alight from his carriage at the entrance to the.Albany, and with Emma Ches-&#xD;
ter upon his arm, began to look for the chambers of his son.&#xD;
As for Emma, she had almost as much idea of the sort of place she was going&#xD;
to as she had of Pekin.&#xD;
" Dear me," said Sir John, "where can it be ?  0, here-no, no."&#xD;
Now, the beadle of the Albany was on the alert, and seeing an elderly gen-&#xD;
tleman and a young lady looking about them in rather a bewildered kind of&#xD;
way, he stepped up and proffered his services, and soon conducted them to the&#xD;
door of Abel's chambers, for which he received one shilling from Sir John and&#xD;
a grateful, kind look from' Ema Chester, who was one of nature's ladies, and&#xD;
therefore courteous to everybody-&#xD;
"Now, indeed," said Sir John with a gratified look upon his face, "we shall&#xD;
surprise Abel, I rather think."&#xD;
Sir John knocked at the outer door, which Rowley now always-kept closed,&#xD;
as he considered it a kind of war with the duns, who made frequent incursions&#xD;
to the Albany with the hope of finding Abel at home.&#xD;
Both Sir John and Emma hardly breathed after they had knocked, so&#xD;
anxiouss were they ; and, indeed, they would not have been at all surprised if&#xD;
Abel had himself opened the door, with a book in his hand, and with a pen in&#xD;
his mouth. But moment after moment passed glibly by, and no one answered&#xD;
the summons.&#xD;
Sir John knocked again, louder than before, and then a voice, in some very&#xD;
mysterious manner, quite close to them, and apparently in. the very passage&#xD;
cried-&#xD;
" Hilloa!i what is it ?"&#xD;
Emma started, and Sir John looked around in amazement ; and just above&#xD;
the door in the panel of the wall, he saw that a little square hole was cut,&#xD;
and that through it a human eye was looking down upon him and upon&#xD;
Emma.&#xD;
"Why, what on earth is the meaning of this ?" he said. "Is not this Mr.&#xD;
Morton's ?"&#xD;
"Please, sir, what do you want ?" said Rowley, in a soft tone, for he saw&#xD;
that Sir John Morton, although he had not the most distant idea of who he&#xD;
was, was a gentleman.&#xD;
"Are these Mr. Morton's chambers ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"Is he within ?"&#xD;
"0, or ! no, sir. Hasn't come home yet."&#xD;
"Yet?   What do you mean by yet ?"&#xD;
"Just that, sir, and nothing else. He hasn't dome home since yesterday,&#xD;
that's all, sir ; but I expect him to breakfast."&#xD;
"My good fellow," said Sir John Morton, "if these are Mr. Morton's chain&#xD;

hers, and that gentleman is out, I wish to wait for him; so, if you will open the&#xD;
door, and allow me and this young lady to do so, I shall feel much o hged&#xD;
and will place a guinea at your disposal."&#xD;
"Certainly sir ; in a moment--in a moment, sir. Perhaps you are the gent&#xD;
who got him out of Lyons's? He did send me a bit of a note last night, with&#xD;
a twenty pound note in it, and said a friend had got him out of the mousetrap&#xD;
in the lane. Come in, sir; I dare say he won't be long now. Walk in, miss,&#xD;
if you please."&#xD;
Stunned and bewildered by what he had already heard, Sir John Mor-&#xD;
ton and Emma Chester, who, by-the-by, trembled so excessively that she was&#xD;
compelled to hold by her uncle's arm with almost a painful pressure, entered&#xD;
the chamber after Rowley.&#xD;
That serving-man, who certainly upon that morning had not all his usual&#xD;
wits about him, led the:way to the splendid sitting-room, and handing Emma&#xD;
a chair, and another to Sir John, he said-&#xD;
"He won't be long, sir. I am glad you took him out of jail, for after all,&#xD;
he ain't of the worst sort; and the old governor is as close as wax, and won't&#xD;
come down no how with the rowdy."&#xD;
Sir John Morton held by the back of the chair which Rowley had handed&#xD;
to him, and lot °ed around him in anguish, while poor Emma, who had the fulL&#xD;
dread of son impending calamity upon her heart, was but too glad to sink.&#xD;
into a seat, and to hope that she should be able to preserve her strength in the&#xD;
time that was td come.&#xD;
"And these," said Sir John, "are Mr. Morton's chambers."&#xD;
"cOh, yes. , They are ours; we don't exactly like to be surrounded with&#xD;
rubbish ; and as we see good company, why, we like to have a decent= place&#xD;
to show them into. But, lord bless;you, sir, this is nothing to what we shal&#xD;
do, I hope. Abel has got hold of some tin again, somehow."&#xD;
Surely, Rowley must have had something strong and bewildering rather&#xD;
early upon that morning, or he would never have bee so frightfully indite&#xD;
creet to a stranger ; and yet he did not exactly look upon Sir John as a stran-&#xD;
ger, for he still clung to the idea'that he was the person who had relieved his&#xD;
master from the clutches of Mr. Lyons.&#xD;
Enmia was in an agony at the scene that was going on. She knew weU,&#xD;
by the calm voice of Sir John, that something like a storm was raging in the&#xD;
depths of his heart, and she would have given anything tr the assurance that&#xD;
the whole affair was a mistake. But it was too real. Do what she might in&#xD;
the way of building'up in her own imagination some ingenious theory regard-&#xD;
ing the matter, the truth was too apparent-that dreadful truth, that Abel&#xD;
Morton was deceiving those who loved him best, and leading a life of reckless&#xD;
extravagance and dissipation in London.&#xD;
"Are you the friend of Mr. Morton ?" she said to Rowley.&#xD;
"Silence, my dear," said Sir John, before Rowley could reply. "You will&#xD;
allow me the pleasure of speaking to this gentleman. Then," added Sir John,&#xD;
with a smile--"you are well acquainted with Mr. Morton's mode of life ?"&#xD;
"So are you," said Rowley; "So are you. I suppose you have put him all&#xD;
right for the present, sir, in the way of tin ?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes-yes!"&#xD;
"Well, then, on we go again. The fact is, they do say'the old bloak at&#xD;
Hampstead is rather warm."&#xD;
"The old who did you say?"&#xD;
"Oh, that's only my funny way of mentioning Abel's old governor, that's&#xD;
all. I dare say he is a very respectable old gent ; and, you see, sir, if we can&#xD;
only keep Abel upon his pins till the old man toddles off the hooks, why, then&#xD;
there will be plenty of money, and no mistake, and no time lost, neither.?&#xD;
"Exactly. But still Mr. Morton must give some attention to the law, you&#xD;
know."&#xD;
"Attention to the law?  Oh, dear, no. Although it wold be but retui-&#xD;
ing the compliment, for the law'is beginning to pay him some attention, I can&#xD;
tell you."&#xD;

&#xD;
37&#xD;
&#xD;
Bang-bang ! came two knocks at the door at this moment, and Rowley,&#xD;
placing his fingers by the side of his nose, said, with an air of great drollery,&#xD;
to Sir John Morton and Emma-&#xD;
"Now, I know what that means, as well as if I were outside."&#xD;
" Yordo '?1&#xD;
"To be sure. Lord bless you, sir, there's no deceiving me. That's a dun,&#xD;
and he's out of temper, too. I shouldn't be a bit surprised if it were that tai-&#xD;
lor in the Haymarket, that made the indescribables for Dandoloski to ride&#xD;
with. If you'll believe it, sir, they were white kid-yes, sir, white kid, as true&#xD;
as you area sinner. But I'll go and settle this fellow-Ah ! there he goes&#xD;
again ; two more dabs. He is getting desperate now."&#xD;
" Hilloa !" cried Rowley through his peep-hole in the wainscot above the&#xD;
outer door. " Hilloa ! What's the row now-eh?  Who are you ?"&#xD;
"I want my account!-I want my money ! I will have my money !"&#xD;
"Oh, well, if you will have it, that's another thing. How much is it ?"&#xD;
"Oh, you know as well as I do ! Eighty-four pound, seventeen shillings&#xD;
and four pence, for clothes. You know well enough. Come, now, can't I&#xD;
have something on account ?"&#xD;
"Next Thursday, my good fellow, but not a minute before. Next Thurs-&#xD;
day we shall roll in tin; and I tell you what it is, I advise you to say as little&#xD;
as possible, and to be as civil as possible, or else you will be paid in full."&#xD;
"Paid in full?"&#xD;
"Yes. How do you like that ?"&#xD;
" Oh ! but, Mr. Rowley, you know I don't want to be paid in full. All I&#xD;
want is. what's reasonable, you know. That is to say, about fifty pounds on&#xD;
account, and another order. That's the proper way to do business, you know,&#xD;
with gents."&#xD;
" I know it is. Be off !"&#xD;
Rowley descended from the chair that enabled him to reach the attitude of&#xD;
the peep-hole in the wainscot, and came into the splendid drawing-room again,&#xD;
rubbing his hands together.&#xD;
"Got rid of him, sir," he said. "Threatened the fellow we would pay him.&#xD;
That settled him rather, I take it. Enough to give him a stitch in the side."r&#xD;
" But is not that," said Sir John, "just what he wants ?"&#xD;
L     ess you, sir, no. Quite the t'other way. You mast know, sir, that&#xD;
all th ofelows only want something on account, and another order."&#xD;
"Then, Mr. Morton is in debt ?"&#xD;
"In debt? Oh, Lor ! just a few."&#xD;
"But how does'he pass his time'? Surely ha cannot be always out in this&#xD;
sort of way'? What does he amuse himself with ?"     -&#xD;
"Amuse himself with ?  Lots qf things. Why there's champagne sdppers&#xD;
-there's the theatres-the saloons-there's boating on the river-there's&#xD;
matches at billiards-there's hurdle-races-there's trotting matches-pigeon&#xD;
shooting-sprees after dark at the West-en-there's dinners at Richmond,&#xD;
and elsewhere-there's the ladies-there's---"&#xD;
"That will do," said Sir John. "That will do. But has he any friends or&#xD;
associates who call upon him here ?"&#xD;
" Why, yes, there's a few of the fastest fellows about town, I rather think,&#xD;
and they all come hero to knock up a bit of fun for the evening, you see, while&#xD;
Abel is shaking his head a little after the last night's frolic. Do you know, I&#xD;
don't think he can have made his head well."&#xD;
"Made his head ?"&#xD;
" Yes ; you know what I mean. A little touches him, and then he is on&#xD;
the groan with a headache in the morning, and pitches into the soda-water.&#xD;
As for me, I can stand anything but champagne, and that, somehow, does get&#xD;
into my eye.-I have had a glass or two this morning."&#xD;
"'So I thought," muttered Sir John in an under tone.&#xD;
But, after all," said Rowley, with a loud laugh, "nothing is so funny as&#xD;
when he gets a letter from the old 'uns at home."&#xD;
"Funny ?" said Emma.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, to be sure. It would kill you with laughing. Why, there was one&#xD;
only a day or so ago from a girl he says is his cousin, and how I did laugh&#xD;
over that letter, to be sure. If you'd believe me, sir, it was positively green as&#xD;
grass; it was quite as verdant as a meadow in May. 'Oh! oh ! It spoke about&#xD;
his injuring his health by studying too much. Oh dear-oh dear ! I thought&#xD;
I should have died when I read it.&#xD;
"This is horrible," said Emma, and she burst into tears.&#xD;
"Why, what's the matter, miss ?" said Rowley. "Ain't you well. Per&#xD;
hips I have said what I oughtn't-"&#xD;
"By no means," said Sir John. "You have said just what you ought, I&#xD;
have received more information from you in this one half hour, than I dare-&#xD;
say, I could have procured if I would have given a thousand pounds for it."&#xD;
Rowley pressed his hands on his eyes for a moment, and then he said.&#xD;
"What have I been saying, sir ?"&#xD;
"Nothing very particular to you. Can you oblige this young lady with a&#xD;
glass of water'?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir, of course-or champagne. No, hang it ! Bother the champagne.&#xD;
I have had too much of that myself, I think. Plague take it, yes. Water-&#xD;
a glass of water? Yes, sir. In a moment. I begin to think I have made a&#xD;
precious fool of myself."&#xD;
"Uncle-dear, uncle ! Come--come home ! To our old home&#xD;
"No, Emma. I wait for Abel."&#xD;
"He may not'°come back--"&#xD;
"I will wait, if it were a month ere he set his foot in this room. I am his&#xD;
accusing spirit, girl, and I wait here for him. Say no more to me upon that&#xD;
point. I wait here for my son, Abel. Hush ! this rascal of a servant of his&#xD;
comes with the water. You can go home, Emma, if .you please; I amano&#xD;
domestic tyrant to force you to remain here against your will," then turning to&#xD;
Rowley he said-&#xD;
"And so you think that Mr. Morton will soon be here ?"&#xD;
"Well, sir, I-I-that is, I really don't know; but he usually does come&#xD;
home about this time, for after being out all night he likes to come here and&#xD;
take his shower bath, and cup of chocolate, and to change his things, and turn&#xD;
over in his mind what he will do next, you see, sir."&#xD;
"Very proper, indeed, very proper."&#xD;
" Ah !" said Rowley, starting. "Don't you hear that ?"&#xD;
A peal of laughter outside the door of the chamber. sounded now upon Sir&#xD;
John's ears.&#xD;
" That's Abel,". said Rowley. "That's he. He seems all right enough.&#xD;
Shall I tell him, sir, that Mr.-a-a-"&#xD;
"Not for worlds. I will give you another guinea to say nothing. Let him&#xD;
come into this room and find me here."&#xD;
"Very good, sir."&#xD;
"Ha, ha, ha I" laughed Abel, as Rowley opened the outer door for him&#xD;
Good morning, Rokeley. Good morning, Lorrinet, my boy. Good-by Col-&#xD;
onel. Remember eight o'clock this evening. By-by ! Ha, ha, ha ! Glori-&#xD;
ous fun ! Rouge et noir for ever, and d-n the consequences ! Keep things&#xD;
going somehow. Curse the law ! Good morning, all of you. Hip, hip, hurra!&#xD;
That's the way to do it. Ha, ha !"&#xD;
CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
AT the sound of Abel's voice uttering such expressions, and laughing with&#xD;
such tipsy merriment, Emma had risen, and flung herself into the arms of her&#xD;
uncle, crying s she did so-&#xD;
" Uncle--uncle, have mercy !"&#xD;
Sir John Morton rose up from the chair upon which he had been sitting, afd&#xD;
confronted the half open door of th6apartment.. Emma as he so rose, slid&#xD;

&#xD;
down to his feet, and upon her knees she held hitn fast, lest there should be&#xD;
any collision between him and Abel upon the impulse of the moment.&#xD;
"Rowley, you infernal thief!" cried Abel, as he half glanced around him at&#xD;
that fidgetty and terrified defendant, for Rowley was now in a fright, at he&#xD;
knew not exactly what. " Rowley, you thief, get me breakfast, and some&#xD;
soda water'first, though-soda water and brandy, and earn the money better&#xD;
you vagabond. Did you get the twenty pounds I sent you. you infernal cor-&#xD;
morant?   Give-give ! That's your cry, you leech. You-you---"&#xD;
Abel's eye fell upon the perfectly white face of Sir John, and staggering back&#xD;
till he grasped the back of a chair for support, he gasped out, in half-choking&#xD;
accents-" God ! My father !"&#xD;
"The governor, by jingo !" said. Rowley. "I have done it, rather, now !"&#xD;
"His spirit ! He is dead ! Oh, God! he is dead !" cried Abel, "and his&#xD;
sainted spirit comes to chide me here ! Father-father-father !"&#xD;
The father made a movement to approach his son, but Emma sprang to her&#xD;
feet, crying,&#xD;
"No, no. All will be explained, it is not true. Abel, say that it is not true&#xD;
-not all true. Abel-Abel-"&#xD;
"Emma?"&#xD;
"Yes, I am Emma-Emma Chester."&#xD;
"The cousin !" said Rowley. "0, or-oh, or !"&#xD;
"Lost !" murmured Abel, "all lost now !"&#xD;
''No, no," shouted Emma, "you are not lost, Abel. 0, no !"&#xD;
She tugged at his arm, and shook him to and fro, but he heeded her not.&#xD;
"Let him be quiet," said Sir )hn. "Abel, answer me."&#xD;
"I-will-father."&#xD;
"Are you-(the old man's voice faltered)-are you a gambler-a debauchee&#xD;
-a bully-a midnight brawler ?"&#xD;
Slowly Abel raised his eyes to the face of his father; and for a few moments&#xD;
they gazed at each other. Then, after drawing a-long breath, Abel said, in a&#xD;
low voice, that appeared as though wrung from him by despair--&#xD;
"Go on, sir."&#xD;
"Are you a villain ?"&#xD;
"No !"&#xD;
" No !" shrieked Emma. "There, uncle, I told you so. He is not a villain.&#xD;
Abel, say no again ; say it with an open, honest look, and with one of the old&#xD;
smiles. Abel-Abel say so again. You are not what they would, perhaps,&#xD;
fain make of you. You may have erred, as some poor spirit may for a time&#xD;
mistake its path ; but you will come back again-back again?"&#xD;
Abel's heart beat with a strong emotion.&#xD;
"Father," he said, "you. have found me out. I wandered in the pleasures&#xD;
and the follies of the town, which pleasures are but follies, but which follies,&#xD;
alas ! I have found not to be all pleasures. I dreaded to let you, of all living&#xD;
beings, know that I was what Iam. I have deceived you. You see me before&#xD;
you harassed by debt, tortured by remorse; my time and health wasted-all&#xD;
unworthily. Father, I have but one solitary request to make of you. It is,&#xD;
that you will now leave this place, and that it will please you, from the moment&#xD;
that you do so, to forget that you have a son.",&#xD;
A deep groan burst from the lips of Sir John Morton, and h'e tried to speak,&#xD;
but could not.&#xD;
"Sir," said Abel, and he spoke almost in a whisper. He was perfectly beaten&#xD;
down, was poor Abel, to see how much his father suffered. "Sir, it will be&#xD;
much better-very much better."&#xD;
"No, no," cried Emma, "this must not be. Uncle-uncle ! reflect only for a&#xD;
moment. This is Abel-Abel, your dear son."&#xD;
"Hush !" said Sir John. "Hush, girl! Sterner hearts than yours must&#xD;
act in this business. Abel, you wrote-o me for money: you were sick from&#xD;
over study-you wanted to purchase books?  You wrote as much, Abel, did&#xD;
you not ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
.l&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.&#xD;
"I did, sir."&#xD;
"And-and you did not purchase the books? you were not sick from study?  u&#xD;
It was all false-all false was it ?"&#xD;
"All-all."&#xD;
"And that letter begun with words of love to all at home-it ended with&#xD;
other words of love and reverence, and these bright and fine expressions enclo-&#xD;
sed a hideous lie !"&#xD;
Abel shuddered.&#xD;
"Emma?" &#xD;
"I am here, uncle."&#xD;
" Come, my child-cone. We are not wanted here. One don't know&#xD;
what one's heart is capable of until it is tried. Like the true steel, 'twill bend&#xD;
even to the cracking, and yet break not. Come-come, Emma, come."&#xD;
"No, no, uncle. There is Abel-look at him; are you human? Heis your&#xD;
son-your boy-your only one ! Can you look unmoved ?  Dare you leave&#xD;
him to his own thoughts, and the .deep temptations that beset him?  Does&#xD;
Heaven leave its children thus? Speak to me, uncle-speak, and do not look&#xD;
so cold. Uncle-uncle !"&#xD;
"Go on, girl. These are but fresh daggers ; use them freely."&#xD;
"No, no. , I would pluck daggers from your heart, uncle, not plant them&#xD;
there. You are not all yourself at this dread moment."&#xD;
"Come, my girl, come. The carriage waits-the carriage waits. We are&#xD;
wanted at home.' Come, girl."&#xD;
"One minute more, uncle, only one minute more. At hame, at the dear old&#xD;
house, you know, where the soft summer sun looks down upon us amid a world&#xD;
of flowers-at that dear house there is a mother---"&#xD;
Sir John started.&#xD;
"Yes, there is a mother. She has but a faint hold of life. It is but by one&#xD;
silken cord she is held to the great world. Would you snap it at once by&#xD;
telling her that you have cast 1im from you? That you had left him with&#xD;
his imagination, a wreck in the wild Waste of the great world, the prey of&#xD;
every danger? No, no-,-you cannot look into Abel's mother's face andsay&#xD;
that you have done so."&#xD;
"Peace, girl-oh, peace !"&#xD;
"You cannot, your heart relents. You are his father, and let him be ten&#xD;
times what he is, you must not-you shall not--you will not-I tell you, uncle&#xD;
you dare not desert him."&#xD;
Sir John staggered to the door, and there he paused for a moment, and they&#xD;
thought that he would fall ; but he merely turned, and opening his arms, he&#xD;
cried, through a gush of tears-&#xD;
"Abel-my boy-my own boy-my joy-my son !"&#xD;
Abel fainted in his father's arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER       XII.&#xD;
THE silence that ensued between the father and the son was of too sacred a&#xD;
character even for Emma to break. She quite unconsciously seated herself in&#xD;
the great chair that Abel was wont to call specially his own, and'which, with&#xD;
its profuse gilding and silken ornaments and tassels, was quite a thing of state ;&#xD;
and there, pale and nervous, and so beautiful and angelic-looking, that it was&#xD;
quite a sight to see her, she waited for the ebullition of feeling upon the part&#xD;
of Sir John Morton to pass away.&#xD;
It was the father who spoke first after that=pause; and looking into the face&#xD;
of his son, his only son, the one strong tie that bound him to the world, he&#xD;
-         said--&#xD;
"Abel, do we indeed know each other again 1"&#xD;
"Father !" was all that Abel said in reply, but it was quite sufficient. A&#xD;
smile lighted up the features of the sorrow-Ctricken man. It'was such a smile&#xD;

MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.          41&#xD;
&#xD;
as Emma had not seen yet, since she had known him, upon his face. His very&#xD;
soul rejoiced in the fancied reclamation of his boy.&#xD;
" Father," he said, ".the past is-is---"&#xD;
"Is the past, my boy," said Sir John, "so we will say no more about it,&#xD;
except'so far as we shall be obliged to settle some of its results. Come, come&#xD;
-look up, Abel. I will believe that it was Heaven who sent us here to-day ;&#xD;
and ought I not to rejoice when I find that you are still my own, notwith-&#xD;
standing the syrens of false and fleeting pleasure tried to steal you from me&#xD;
"Yes, father, I feel now, indeed my heart tells me---"&#xD;
Abel could not go on, and Sir John glanced at Emma, who gently rose, and&#xD;
gliding towards him, took Abel by the hand.&#xD;
He started, and looked in the face of the ingenuous fair girl who was by his&#xD;
side. What words could paint to the mind's eye the charm of the tender smile&#xD;
that sat upon her lips?&#xD;
"Emma !" said Abel. "0, Emma, you-you despise me now   -"&#xD;
"My Abel, no-oh, no, dear Abel, we will all now be happier than we were&#xD;
before. Abel-Abel, do not weep. We shall, indeed."&#xD;
"0, Heaven !" cried Abel, "that I could for one moment forget how much&#xD;
I loved you, and that upon your love rested the ark of all my hopes ! Dear&#xD;
Emma, can you indeed look upon me with the eyes of forgiveness ?"&#xD;
Sir John looked just a little surprised. He had not suspected that Abel and&#xD;
Emma had quite such an appreciation of each other's worth as he now saw&#xD;
they had; but the suspicion was not displeasing to him. He had an opinion.&#xD;
and it is one that any sensible parent, we think, will have likewise, upon reflec-&#xD;
tion, that there is nothing in all the world such a safeguard to the young and&#xD;
inexperienced-as.a virtuous and early attachment.&#xD;
Emma suffered Abel to fold her in his arms,.and to kiss her cheek, as he&#xD;
whispered to her-&#xD;
"After this moment, if I fall again, I am unworthy even to be pitied."&#xD;
"You will not fall again, Abel," she whispered, tenderly.&#xD;
"Nice," said Rowley, from his post of observation. "Upon my soul, that is&#xD;
a fine girl. But what the deuce is all this to end in ?"&#xD;
"Abel," said Sir John.&#xD;
How Abel started, and what a little scream Emma uttered ! The fact was,&#xD;
that they had quite forgotton Sir John-shall we go a little further, and say&#xD;
that at that moment they had forgotten all the world but themselves? To be&#xD;
sure they had. Are there not such moments in the lives of all?&#xD;
"0, uncle," said Emma, "I-that is,,.dear uncle---"&#xD;
," Exactly," said Sir John. "Do not tremble so, Emma. If I have unex-&#xD;
pectedly to-day, in addition to awakening my son from a few heedless follies&#xD;
of youth, found out that he loves you, surely these are two good discoveries&#xD;
instead of one."&#xD;
"Indeed, father, I do love her with all my heart," said.Abel.&#xD;
"And, indeed son," said Sir John, "I approve of your choice with all my&#xD;
heart."&#xD;
Now, nothing would serve Emma but a good cry in the arms of her uncle,&#xD;
and Rowley got still more puzzled.&#xD;
"It must be gammon," he said, "broad-wheeled gammon. I should say Abel&#xD;
will come down on the old man for some tin, and then get rid of him and the&#xD;
girl as quick as he-can ; that's the way to do it."&#xD;
"Now, Abel," said Sir John, " sit down."&#xD;
Abel sat down as quietly and submissively as possible, so that Emma quite&#xD;
leaped again in the joy of her young heart to see him.&#xD;
"Probably," added Sir John, "you have got into some pecuniary entangle-&#xD;
ments, Abel, and the only way is to pay them all off at once, so that you may&#xD;
feel your mind quite at ease about them, and then we will forget that part of&#xD;
the subject entirely."&#xD;
"Yes, father."',&#xD;
"I do not wish you to give up your studies, Abel," said Sir John "but I&#xD;
should like you to remove from this place."&#xD;
&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
Abel slightly groaned at the-word "studies."&#xD;
"And now, my boy, asI have my cheque-book with me, I will draw at chee&#xD;
for the amount of the little debts."&#xD;
"Well," said Rowley, "that is what I call out-and-out brick-like. What as&#xD;
uncommon excellent old governor, to be sure."&#xD;
"Cot~re, Abel, what will be the amount nearly?  Give me a guess now.&#xD;
Overdo it, though, rather than under do it, as that will make no matter; Will&#xD;
a hundred pounds cover these little plaguing debts, Abel?"&#xD;
Rowley groaned, and so did Abel, as he said, faintly-&#xD;
-   "I'm afraid not, sir, I'm very much afraid not."&#xD;
"You are sure not, you mean, Abel. Well, well, it don't  tte or whit,&#xD;
only say what will."&#xD;
"Father," said Abel, with a look of desperation, "do not attempt to pay my&#xD;
debts. Leave me and them to struggle together as bestImgy:, Timploreyou&#xD;
to do so."&#xD;
Baug-.bang! came at the outer door, and they all started.&#xD;
"Nobody," said Rowley, popping his head into the room. -4o on. It's&#xD;
nobody."&#xD;
"Nobody ?" said Sir John. "How can you say it is nobody, sir, when Ihear&#xD;
a knock that is enough to break any reasonable door off its hinges ?"&#xD;
Bang-bang-bang! came three decisive knocks again.&#xD;
"I mean, sir," said Rowley, "that-that-when I say nobody, you know,&#xD;
sir, I mean to say that it's one of the enemy."&#xD;

"There is no occasion for this sort of thing any further," said Sir John Mor-&#xD;
ton. "Admit this person, be he whom he may."&#xD;
"Mr. Stilt, the tailor from St. James's Street," announced Rowley, as he&#xD;
pushed into the room rather an alarmed-looking individual, dressed in the&#xD;
height of the prevailing fashion, or rather, in caricature of it. Rowley then&#xD;
followed him, and kept in a very mysterious manner dodging behind him.&#xD;
Rowley's real motive was, to give the tailor a hint to stop, if he should begin&#xD;
t) say too much.&#xD;
"Well, sir," said Sir John, looking Mr. Stilt mildly in the face. '"What is&#xD;
your business here ?"&#xD;
"My little account. Your servant, Mr. Abel Morton. I have called, sir, a&#xD;
matter of fifty times, sir, I assure you."&#xD;
"Stop, sir," said Sir John. "We don't want to know how often you have&#xD;
called. We'wan't to pay you."&#xD;
"Pay me !" gasped the tailor, starting back, and treading violently upon&#xD;
Rowley's toes, for which he got a hearty kick in return. "Pay me !"&#xD;
"Yes, sir, pay you. Is that so extraordinary ?"&#xD;
"Why, sir-I-that is, if Mr. Morton would oblige me with something on&#xD;
account, you see sir, that'is all we want; so that we see some of his money,&#xD;
sir. Of course it gives me great pleasure to see his name on the books."&#xD;
"But not one half the pleasure that it will give me to take it off them, Mr.&#xD;
Stilt; so I intend to pay you in full. Abel, what do you owe this man&#xD;
"I don't know, father."&#xD;
At the word, "father," Mr. Stilt pulled a long face, and looked really dis-.&#xD;
tressed.&#xD;
"Sir I will call again, I will do myself the honor to call again. The fact&#xD;
is, sir, the-the spring patterns, you see, gentlemen, induced me to call. I will&#xD;
do myself the great honor, now, of retiring, if you please, gentlemen. Another&#xD;
time wal do for the a-a little account, gentlemen. Good morning, if you&#xD;
please, good morning."&#xD;
"Stop, sir !" cried Sir John. "Oblige me with your bill."&#xD;
"Not at all !" cried Mr. Stilt. "O dear me sir, you don't say that?  My&#xD;
little account doesn't matter in the least, sir, but if you would be so kind as to&#xD;
oblige me with fifty or a hundred pounds on account- "&#xD;
"Fifty or a hundred pounds on account !" cried Sir John, as he sprang to&#xD;
his feet.&#xD;
"Yes-a-yes, sir, if you please, on account."&#xD;
"Sir," cried Sir John, "what does my son owe you ?"&#xD;
"Why, sir, at a rough guess---"&#xD;
"Well, sir, at a rough guess ?"&#xD;
"About three hundred pounds."&#xD;
Sir John sat down with a groan, and the costly dressing-gown in which&#xD;
Abel generally sat at home, slid from the back of the chair, where it had been&#xD;
reposing, on to the head of Sir John Morton. He dragged it off him rapidly,&#xD;
and looked at the satin and silk of which it was composed.  d&#xD;
"Did you make this, sir ?" he said to the tailor.   '&#xD;
"Yes, sir, if you please. Make you-one sir, exactly to the pattern."&#xD;
"And the price ?"&#xD;
"Why, sir, we book it at twenty-two pounds."&#xD;
"0, and very moderate, too-very moderate, indeed. O, Abel, Abel !" .&#xD;
Rat, tat, tat ! Bang bang ! came at the door.&#xD;
"Now we are what I call rather in for it, and no mistake," said Rowley.&#xD;
"Here's a go."&#xD;

CHAPTER        XIII.&#xD;
Tus violent knocking'at the door was quite a seasonable relief to Abel, for&#xD;
he was ready to welcome any circumstance that would put an end to the dread-&#xD;
ful interview that was taking place between the tailor and his father.&#xD;
"Shall I let 'em in, sir ?" said Rowley.&#xD;
"0, yes," cried Sir John Morton,'in a high, cracked voice. "0 let them in.&#xD;
As for you, Mr.'Stilt, you will be called upon by a professional gentleman, who&#xD;
will look over your account."&#xD;
"]3ah ! sir, I am a respectable tradesman, sir, and when, sir, anybody talks,&#xD;
sir, of a professional man to me, sir, my blood rises, sir, and I feel, sir, that my&#xD;
pattern book-I mean my feelings, sir, are not to be worried out in such a way,&#xD;
sir. Good day, sir."&#xD;
Mr. Stilt made quite a rush to leave the chambers, and violently encoun-&#xD;
tered a person who was entering, so that they both rolled on to the floor&#xD;
together.&#xD;
"Bravo !" said Rowley. "Two to one on the tailor ! Go it ! That's the&#xD;
way to do it ! Hit him again ! Six to four on the tailor ! Any takers? Go&#xD;
it, Stit"&#xD;
After a scuffle of some few minutes' duration, Mr. Stilt gathered himself up,&#xD;
and darted out of the place, leaving rather a prim-looking man, in a white cravat,&#xD;
rather the worse for his tumble and scramble on the floor.&#xD;
"Walk in, sir, walk in," said Rowley. "Walk in, sir. All's right.. Allow&#xD;
me to introduce you to the governor. Mr. Popham, the jeweller, sir, if you&#xD;
please."&#xD;
The jeweller looked a little astonished, as, upon walking in, he found him-&#xD;
self confronted by such a party in Abel's room.&#xD;
.' Come in, sir," said Sir John Morton. "Come in. I'm glad to see you.&#xD;
Does Mr. Abel Morton owe you anything, sir ?"&#xD;
"Well, sir, he does, certainly."&#xD;
"Very well. What my son owes you will be paid; a gentleman will call&#xD;
upon you, and pay you, on account of my son, who will be able to furnish him&#xD;
with your address. Good day, sir."&#xD;
"That's the way to get rid of 'em," said Rowley. "Don't I wish they'd go&#xD;
when I  tell 'em as quietly as that ! But catch 'em at it, that's all !"&#xD;
Sir John now turned to Abel. and spoke in a low tone to him.&#xD;
"Abel," he said, "I think that I had better not remain here just at present.&#xD;
I will go to my hotel in Clarges Street, where I have been in the habit of stay-&#xD;
ing when in London,, and you can come to me this evening at seven o'clock. I&#xD;
will send a message home with an excuse to your mother ; for she expected&#xD;
we would all be back in a few hours. I feel, though, that I cannot take you&#xD;
with me home until these affairs are settled."&#xD;
Abel merely bowed.&#xD;
"You will attend me this evening at seven ?"&#xD;
Abel rose, and held out his hand, which his father shook for a moment.&#xD;
Then Emma burst into tears, as she cried-&#xD;
"Abel-Abel, you will indeed be different from what you have been ! You&#xD;
will forsake the false pleasures that have wound themselves around you in the&#xD;
town-you will indeed, Abel; and for the time to come you will be all that&#xD;
your dear father can wish you. Speak to him again Sir John-oh! speak to&#xD;
him, uncle. You see how depressed he is. I pray you speak to him. The&#xD;
venial crimes of his youth will be to him lessons through life. It is true that&#xD;
he is very young, indeed ; but if you desert him, he is lost to all the world.&#xD;
Tell him again, uncle, that you forgive him !"&#xD;
"I do," said Sir John.&#xD;
"With all your heart, uncle ?"&#xD;
"Yes, girl-with all my heart. Let Abel's follies pause at this point, and&#xD;
be the present complications or amounts of them what they may, I freely and&#xD;
from my heart forgive him."&#xD;

"You hear, Abel-you hear that ?"&#xD;
"I do," said Abel, "and I feel that I am unworthy. Father, I will make&#xD;
no promises for the time to come ; I feel that it would be but tampering with '&#xD;
your feelings for me to.do so. It is only when some portion of that time shall&#xD;
pass away, that you shall know me as your son again."&#xD;
"Thank heaven," said Sir John. "Abel, look at that young girl."&#xD;
Abel did, indeed, look at her.&#xD;
"It appears that you have won her affections. She is very young, and very&#xD;
innocent, and very guileless, indeed. Abel, I say that you have won her heart,&#xD;
as it appears. That fact was unknown to me this morning. Abel, it is hard&#xD;
to deceive me and your mother-it is hard, I say to do that ; but if you deceive&#xD;
her---"&#xD;
0 no -no father, I will not !"&#xD;
"You hear that he will not, uncle. I will be to you the pledge for his&#xD;
fidelity-I will answer for him; and feeling and knowing that such is the case,&#xD;
Abel, if a thought of wrong should cross his mind, will banish it."&#xD;
"Yes," said Abel, 4"yes, Emma; only that I feel how unworthy that I am&#xD;
of you. Father, are you satisfied?  Do you think I would be the villain to&#xD;
deceive this fond and trusting heart?  0 no-no ! I may be.thoughtless, and&#xD;
upon the first introduction to the world I have done much that is wrong, and&#xD;
gone astray from the path of goodness; but an angel has beckoned me back to&#xD;
it again, and I obey her."&#xD;
"Enough, Abel. I am satisfied now."&#xD;
Abel tottered back into the chambers, and his father and Emma left them.&#xD;
For 'ome few moments Abel sate in the gilded chair and covered his eyes&#xD;
with his hands. Rowley looked earnestly at him. Then he spoke, and Row-&#xD;
ley shrunk back, for there was something very earnest in the tones of his&#xD;
master ; and as he proceeded still speaking, Rowley got quite back, and took&#xD;
an amber look at him through one of the colored panes of glass in the upper&#xD;
part of the door.&#xD;
"Yes," soliloquised Abel, "I shall be very happy indeed. I shall only think&#xD;
of the mock pleasure that I have seen in London, and with my gay compan-&#xD;
ions, as I would think of the riot of a dream. There shall be nothing congru-&#xD;
ous in my mind to them. Will not sigh for the theatres, the saloons, the&#xD;
balls, the routes, the gay suppers, and the wild saturnalia of the spirits and&#xD;
the passions that followed the sparkling wine cup, and the still more sparkling&#xD;
wit that it evoked. The bright eyes of beauty, whose virtue sits so easily upon&#xD;
them that like a loose garment, it can be shuffled off at pleasure. No-no! I&#xD;
must think no more of such things."&#xD;
Abel rose, and paced the room.&#xD;
"No more must I sigh for the sunset to come, that it may usher in the life&#xD;
that only begins when the bright day has passed away. Let me think. Yes,&#xD;
I can easily get rid of my engagements. I have to be with my father at seven&#xD;
this evening, yes, at seven-0, so punctually at seven, at his old London Hotel&#xD;
in Clarges Street."&#xD;
"He musn't go," said Rowley.&#xD;
"Then I have an appointment with Colonel Elk at ten-ay, at ten-and&#xD;
with the Dandoloski, to whom I have promised a pony phaeton. By all that's&#xD;
terrible, I was near forgetting that. What on earth shall I do?  And the&#xD;
colonel was to put me up to some mode of possessing the means to purchase&#xD;
it. Then there's Lorrinet, who has got up a kind of bachelors' fete for to-&#xD;
morrow on purpose for me, and we are to have a boat-race at Twickenham.&#xD;
And then there is Lord Rokeley-why, I did promise to take a drive with him&#xD;
to Brentford to-day, and to lunch there; at a cottage oinee in which he has&#xD;
lodged, he says, is a young Greek girl, who is the most bewitching and beau-&#xD;
tiful creature that ever lived. What shall I do'7 Alas !-alas! unhappy man,&#xD;
what can I do ?".                       -&#xD;
He flung himself upon the chair again.&#xD;
"Lord Rokeley," announced Rowley ; and then, in another moment, he&#xD;
shouted out, "Captain Lorrinet."&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHERS THE COLONEL.                       45&#xD;
" Hurra !" cried Lorrinet. "Here you are, Abel. A glorious day ! How&#xD;
are you, old boy? Ah! you gave us all the slip nicely last night. They say&#xD;
you went off with the Dandoloski.""&#xD;
"My drag is at the door," said Lord Rokeley. "What a trouble it is to live,&#xD;
don't you think so, Abel?'"&#xD;
"Glorious fun, I call it," cried Lorrinet. "Why, Abel, we think of all put-&#xD;
ting on thick coats, and blacking our faces, and going to Tom lHuncombe&amp;amp;&#xD;
little lodge at Putney, and pretending to take possession of it, and the little&#xD;
piece of goods he calls Nancy, that he keeps there in the name of the law"&#xD;
"Capital !" said Abel.&#xD;
" Oh, very," said Rokeley ; "but a world of trouble."  -&#xD;
*  *      *      *      *      *      *-     *&#xD;
It is evening. The great city is full of that strange and incessant hum of&#xD;
hurried existence, which in London gives such a significance to those hours&#xD;
which, in a less artificial state of existence, invite to repose. A fiery glow is&#xD;
in the night sky from the innumerable lights of London; -and the riot-the&#xD;
dissipation-and much of the absolute vice of the great human hive is about&#xD;
to begin.&#xD;
Now from several houses, where the debauch and the watchfulness of the&#xD;
preceding night have been slept off, emerge the house-breaker and the street-&#xD;
robber. The flaunting lady of what is called easy virtue, which means no&#xD;
virtue at all, bedizeps herself in her tawdry finery. The bully-the pick-&#xD;
pocket-the gentleman and the roue, find that their hour has come, for the&#xD;
beautiful sunshine has passed away, and the light of heaven no longer looks&#xD;
down upon their guity eyes.&#xD;
.rAnd amid all the riot-and the life-and the bustle without, Abel ljQrton&#xD;
is alone in his chambers at the Albany.&#xD;
Twice had Rowley asked his master if he would have a light, and had as&#xD;
often been replied to by a sharp negative ; so he had retired to the outer room,&#xD;
leaving the young soul that was wavering betwixt vice and virtue to itself.&#xD;
Bang ! came a knock at the outer door. The world had not forgot that&#xD;
there was such a being in it as Abel Morton.&#xD;
Rowley was delighted at the opportune arrival, for he had heard enough of&#xD;
his master's soliloquy to know that there was a struggle going on in his breast,&#xD;
that might. possibly end in a manner very adverse to his, Rowley's, present&#xD;
interest, and he was right glad of a good excuse for breaking in upon such&#xD;
meditations.&#xD;
The single knock had assured Rowley that no one was at the door to whom&#xD;
he must display much ceremony, and, accordingly, as he flung it open, wit-&#xD;
out going through the process of looking through the little hole in the panel&#xD;
above it, he cried-&#xD;
"Now for it !-Who are are you ?"&#xD;
Rowley was rather astonished to see no one.&#xD;
".Hilloa ! A run-away knock. Well, that ain't very often here. Confound&#xD;
it! who can it be? Nobody, by Jove !"&#xD;
"Mr. Morton home ?" squeaked a voice.&#xD;
Rowley was so taken aback by the suddenness of this question, that he&#xD;
quite staggered into the chambers, a pace or two, and then he happened to&#xD;
look towards the floor, and he saw, dinily, a specimen of humanity from whom&#xD;
the voice had came, and who he had completely overlooked, in the extrena&#xD;
sense of the term.&#xD;
"Hilloa I" said Rowley, "who the deuce are you?"&#xD;
"The Dandoloski's tiger."&#xD;
Rowley looked at the object as well as the dubious and uncertain light&#xD;
would permit him, and then he said-&#xD;
"Oh, my eye!"&#xD;
"Well, fellow," said the tiger, "what do you mean by staring in that way&#xD;
at a gent, eh?  Is the governor at home? that's what we want to know."&#xD;
"Come in," said Rowley. " Lor bless you! come in, and let's have a good&#xD;

MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.                      47&#xD;
"That's right ! Had a little spree in Regent Street about half-an-hour ago,&#xD;
or I should have been with you sooner, old fellow. The Marqais of Lander-&#xD;
ford was coming along at a'pelt in his cab, and I in mine. You know I don't&#xD;
go slow : but the Marquis thought to pass me, which, of course, I wouldn't&#xD;
have ; so I let him get about half-a-dozen yards in advance, and then laid the&#xD;
whip on my mare's neck, which always mnkes her a maniac for half-an-hour,&#xD;
and off she went. I did the thing rather cleanly, for I caught the marquis's&#xD;
off-wheel, and sent him and his cab through a shawl-man's window. I didn't&#xD;
wait to see what damage he had done. Heard a loud crash, that was all, and&#xD;
came on here as if the devil himself were behind me. But, Abel, you don't&#xD;
seem the thing."&#xD;
"I am though. Colonel Elk, I have made a determination."&#xD;
"What is it, my boy?"&#xD;
"To-to leave a town life-to go to the country, and remain with my&#xD;
father, and to bid a long and last adieu to the follies and extravagances into&#xD;
which I am plunging. This is the resolve I have made, Colonel Elk."&#xD;
"My dear fellow, I see that something has happened to put you very much&#xD;
out of the way, and I am sorry for it.. I like a young man to be diffident of&#xD;
his own powers, and if you feel that you cannot enjoy the pleasures of life with-&#xD;
out going too far, why, do not attempt to taste them, There are men who&#xD;
dare not touch good wine, for fear they should not know when to leave off&#xD;
short of hopeless drunkenness. If you know yourself so well as to be sure that&#xD;
you cannot be merry and wise, why, go to the country at once, and hang your-&#xD;
self in a pig-sty."&#xD;
"You distract me&#xD;
"Then I will take my leave. I did fancy, Abel Morton, that I saw in you&#xD;
one who would be a credit to the bold and brave spirits of London-one who.&#xD;
would, with his wit, his eloquence, his daring, and his handsome appearance,&#xD;
get the love of all the women, and the envy of all the men; but if it is not to&#xD;
be so, why, there's an end. If you must lay-by in youth instead of age-and&#xD;
age will come soon enough, Abel-do so. I will leave you."&#xD;
"No, no ! do not leave me !-I shall go'-mad if you do !"&#xD;
"Excuse me, Abel, but I think you are a little that way as it is. But, come,&#xD;
can you give me sufficient privilege as a friend to allow me to inquire what&#xD;
happened to effect this change in you ?"&#xD;
"Yes: my father has been here, and my cousin Emma. They know all&#xD;
now-they are perfectly aware that I am not studying the law--they know&#xD;
that I even have been leading a life of extravagance and riot in London-&#xD;
they know that lam deeply in debt, and Iam wretched with the thought that&#xD;
they do know it."&#xD;
"Why, my dear fellow, there could not, in all the chapter of accidents, have&#xD;
happened anything one half so lucky. Fortune smiles on you, Abel."&#xD;
"Lucky ?-smiles'? What do you mean, colonel ?"&#xD;
"Why, that you are relieved now and forever, from the only one drawback&#xD;
to your love of gratification, and that was, that you were playing a double&#xD;
game with your friends; but now that that is over you are a happy man,&#xD;
Abel, and you have nothing to dread now."&#xD;
"Have I not? I have to meet my father this evening at his hotel, and to&#xD;
give a list of my debts, an account of my mode of life, and a confession of all&#xD;
my extravagances and vices, and to hearhis condemnation of them, and then&#xD;
to go with him to the country."&#xD;
"Oh, Oh! Oh dear-Oh dear ! Don't kill me, Abel, with laughing. Nowdon't,&#xD;
there's a good fellow. This is too rich-it is indeed !"&#xD;
"Colonel Elk ?"&#xD;
"Oh, I perceive Iam going too far. I am getting beyond the bounds of our&#xD;
friendship, Mr. Morton. Well, be it o. Farewell; I am mistaken in you. I&#xD;
did expect that as a gentleman, you w uld have given me my revenge at Rouge&#xD;
et Noir."&#xD;
"I will do that."&#xD;

" No, no. It don't matter. There are a thousand things, too, that I wanted&#xD;
to speak to 'you about, for, hang it, I thought you one of us, I did, indeed.&#xD;
What a disappointment this will be to Lorrinet and Rokeley, and all the other&#xD;
fellows. Why, we were going to get up a kind of club, and make you the pre-&#xD;
sident. And poor Dandoloski, too ! Poor devil, she has refused such an offer&#xD;
from the Austrian Ambassador for your sake."&#xD;
" For ne?"&#xD;
"'To be sure-to be sure. But good evening, Abel. I respect you yet, my&#xD;
'boy ; and when you sicken of the country, which you will in a week, come to&#xD;
me and I won't laugh. I thought you would have accompanied me to my&#xD;
place, and over a bottle of Lafite, we could have had a little Rouge et Noir, or&#xD;
Piquet if you like it better; but it is not to be. Farewell."&#xD;
'.Stay, colonel. Oh, stay."&#xD;
" As-you please, my good Abel."&#xD;
" Colonel, you have staggered me. If I thought that after a time my father&#xD;
would not think anything of my determination to stay in London--"&#xD;
"Abel, your father will admire you for being, no doubt, what he was at your&#xD;
age, when he comes to think about a young man of spirit and genius, who had&#xD;
the wisdom to sow 'his wild oats, and then to quietly retire to private life, when&#xD;
'he no longer cared for a more public career."&#xD;
"But my debts?"&#xD;
" Pshaw ! stuff!"&#xD;
"I-promised to be at the hotel by seven o'clock."&#xD;
"And it is now half-past. Ha ! ha ! Abel, it is too late, and the old man is&#xD;
over his pint of port, saying, with a shake of his head, 'Ah, I was just like him&#xD;
at his age, the young dog. The lad has a spirit.'"&#xD;
"Do you think so?"&#xD;
"I know it. My cab is at the gate of the Albany. On with your hat, man,&#xD;
and come. I will tell you as we go along, how the Austrian Ambassador's&#xD;
affair went off with the Dandoloski, and exactly what she said to him. Come&#xD;
on, Abel, my boy. Why, you look twenty per cent. better than you did.&#xD;
Twenty,-did-I say?  I meant.a hundred."     "&#xD;
In this kind of discourse the colonel got Abel into his cab, and away it went&#xD;
at such a startling puce to-the colonel's lodging that it was enough ,to  t any&#xD;
one's brains in a whirl to look at the cab at all, as it flew past. .rPhe wherr&#xD;
they arrived, some of the finest wines, some of the most brilliant lights, and a&#xD;
pack of cards, awaited them.&#xD;
Oh,'was there no good angel at that moment to whisper, "beware !" in Abel's&#xD;
ear?                                             . -&#xD;
The flashing wine soon ascended to the head of poor Abel, and lent to his&#xD;
eyes a lustre that was not their own. The color came back to his cheeks in a&#xD;
full flush. He laughed and joked with the colonel about the Dandoloski and&#xD;
the bitter chagrin atd disappointment of the Austrian Ambassador, who, with&#xD;
all his princely title, and his almost fabulous wealth, could not tempt that one&#xD;
frail, bad woman to sin; and by ten o'clock Abel lost eight hundred pounds&#xD;
to Colonel Elk at that most engaging of all games to the young and inexperi-&#xD;
enced, blind-hookey. Abel sprang to his feet with an execration upon the cards,&#xD;
as he dashed them to the floor.&#xD;
A little French clock upon the side-board played a tune and struck ten.&#xD;
"I should have been with my father at seven," gasped Abel ; "I could then&#xD;
have told him that I owed two thousand pounds ; but now-now God help&#xD;
me, I must add half as much again to the amount, if he will. indeed, ever look'&#xD;
upon my face again."&#xD;
"Abel," said the colonel, "you gave me an I. O. U. for the amount of my&#xD;
winnings; there it is."&#xD;
The colonel screwed up a'bit of paper, and deliberately lit it, and threw it.&#xD;
into the fireplace.&#xD;
"Don't say, Abel, my boy, that anything between you and me need ever be&#xD;
repeated to a third party. The debt is cancelled."&#xD;
&#xD;

"Colonel, you are too generous-you are too kind to me. In my impatience&#xD;
I fear I say things that I ought not to say; but youyill pardon me, and make&#xD;
allowances for me, I feel assured that you will, colon .&#xD;
"My dear fellow," said the colonel, "you never can offend me till I am sure&#xD;
you want to do it, and then it will be easy enough. Come, let us go to Long's&#xD;
for Lorrinet and Rokeley. We will make a night of it, Abel, and of one tbigr&#xD;
rest assured, that my purse is always open to you. Draw at once ; what does&#xD;
it matter?  I have enough and to spare, though I will own to you that at times&#xD;
I am pushed, owing to a congregation of unexpected demands; but that is not&#xD;
now. What money will you have, Abel?"&#xD;
"None-none ! I cannot."&#xD;
" Pho ! Stuff! There,,you will find a couple of hundred in notes in that&#xD;
case, put it in your pocket, and let's be off. To-morrow morning we will see&#xD;
after this poney concern for the Dandoloski."&#xD;
The tears started to the eyes of Abel.&#xD;
"This noble generosity," he said, "This unheard of friendship is-is too ,&#xD;
much."     h.&#xD;
"There-there, not another word. Come on. We must leave the cab, it&#xD;
will only be a bother to us. We can drop mat the Opera, and see Dandoloski&#xD;
in her Aria; and then we will go up the town, and pick up what fun we can.&#xD;
Ha-ha ! Abel, this is better than feeding pigs, and being called out of your&#xD;
bed at night to attend to a sick cow. Ha ! ha ! It is life ! Life my boy !"&#xD;
"It is," said Abel. "Ha!l"&#xD;

"A quarter to seven;  y dear," said Sir John Morton to Emily, as they sat&#xD;
together in a quiet, priv  room at these hotel. "A quarter to seven, and we&#xD;
shall soon have Abel her  ih us."&#xD;
"Yes, dear uncle." -&#xD;
"Come-come, Emma, nomore crying."&#xD;
"But I do not cry for grief, uce,.I am very happy-very happy, indeed.&#xD;
Does it not seem, dear sir, as i  beLhgd been lost and found again; or as if&#xD;
he had gone through some great dagr scatheless, and that we had waited&#xD;
tremblingly to hear the result, and now still tremblfor joy that it is a happy&#xD;
one."            -           '    f..&#xD;
"It is so, my good, kind Emma, and-I am all the ihaier that out of the&#xD;
rescue of poor Abel from his venial errors inen4gkasvolved the fact that&#xD;
he' loves you. May you both be happy. But cgm, my dear girl, I see that&#xD;
this kind of discourse is too much for you. Youu nst take a glass of wine,&#xD;
and we will have some ready to offer Abel as soon.as f irhts in, for I know&#xD;
he will feel agitated.&#xD;
Wine was then placed on the table. The lights were then trimmed, and&#xD;
Sir John laid his ancient gold repeater upon the table, that he might know the&#xD;
moment to expect his dear son, Abel, to come to hih, The old man's hand&#xD;
trembled, and there was a restlessness about him that rather alarmed Emma&#xD;
to see.&#xD;
Seven o'clock came-half-past seven-eight o'clock, and no Abel.&#xD;
Sir John Morton only spoke in a whisper, and it was by the greatest efforts&#xD;
that Emma controlled her tears.&#xD;
Nine o'clock came, and still -Abel.&#xD;
"My child-my Emma" saidfi      ohn, we wll go home."&#xD;
Re tried to move from his chair, hut the effo t-was too muchfor bim. For&#xD;
a moment the room swam round-with him, and then Sir John Morton fainted&#xD;
mna's cries soon brought the attendants; but Abel did not come !&#xD;

MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.                       51&#xD;
he found the extent of the mischief he had done, and he thought he might posa&#xD;
sibly atone for it in some way, to offended Heaven, by adopting you. He took&#xD;
you from the dead body of your mother, and adopted you as his own child-&#xD;
indeed, he passed you off as such, after a time, in this country, when the deed&#xD;
of blood by which he became possessed of you was forgotten."&#xD;
"Oh, uncle, where did all this happen?"&#xD;
"At Calcutta, in the East Indies."&#xD;
"I shall never know peace again. My poor father and mother, too! Oh,&#xD;
God-Oh, God ! why do I know this ?"&#xD;
"There, now," said Mr. Elk. "There now. You were never at peace with&#xD;
me till I told you all this ; and you see the thanks I get for it-see my reward !&#xD;
Oh, Dora ! is this kind of you to reproach me for telling you that which you&#xD;
were always asking to know'?- But hear no more. If you fancy that you are&#xD;
injured by the communication, I will say no more."&#xD;
"Oh, yes, tell me all now. I should know all or nothing."&#xD;
Well, be it so. The news of your father and your mother's tragical end&#xD;
reached me and my brother, the colonel, here in England ; but it was a con-&#xD;
siderable time before, under the assumed name that had been given to you,&#xD;
we found out where you were, although we knew you had been brought to&#xD;
this country by your father's murderer. The idea was, to us, gall and worm-&#xD;
wood that you should exist under his roof. I could not rest, Dora, till I had&#xD;
found yoii, and taken you from the hands- which were red with the blood of&#xD;
your parents."&#xD;
'"You were right, uncle-oh, yes, you were right ! From my soul, uncle, I&#xD;
thank you for that !"&#xD;
"I sincerely hope, too, that you will do justice to the intentions of my bro-&#xD;
ther, the colonel. It was he who rescued you from the hands of your father's&#xD;
assassin, for I was unequal to the task of doingso  To him you owe your&#xD;
thanks for that service; and I assure you, that ho vr you may suspect or&#xD;
fancy that he is not acting towards you as he ought, you are mistaken, for he&#xD;
would defend you from any real insult. 'And now, Dora I hope that you will&#xD;
not object to go to his house, and remain there while I transact .soine little&#xD;
business out of town for about two days or so."&#xD;
"As ynu please, uncle. I ought not to object. I may have, tiistaken my&#xD;
uncle, the colonel; but-but the last time I was at his house, there was an&#xD;
odious man--"&#xD;
" Well-well, I have spoken to him about the Earl of Carlin, and I don't&#xD;
think he will annoy you again; Dora. 'At all events, be assured 'of'one thing,&#xD;
that my brother, the colonel, will really protect you, for he is jealous of your&#xD;
honor ; and if you see cause to think otherwise, you have much more cause&#xD;
to fancy yourself mistaken from your ignorance of the world, than to doubt&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"I will try to believe so, sir."&#xD;
"Well, that is all right. Now we will be off at once. I will take you to&#xD;
my brother's house, or rather, to his apartments. You are well known to be&#xD;
his niece, so that there can be no scandal; and the old woman who is in the&#xD;
place can attend upon you, as she has done before. Dry your eyes, my dear&#xD;
Dora, and let us go at once."&#xD;
"But, uncle, this is your house, and these are your servants. Can I not&#xD;
remain here in peaceful ease and quietude till yoqrcome back to me'?"&#xD;
"No, Dora. I have certain information that the man I took you from is&#xD;
maddened at the idea of your escape, and would commit any desper to act to.&#xD;
recapture you, and take you out of the country, He has got a w'l&amp;amp;y i'n:&#xD;
his head that by keeping'you he will atone for his crimes; and there   ldo&#xD;
not feel that you are safe here alone. ~And let me beg of y jy. ue     x;&#xD;
your liberty, and as you wish never to feel that you are again 4ie lf  ..c&#xD;
your father's murderer, never to mention the name that yourha yt ldi'&#xD;
recollect to be the one you were once known by.&#xD;

MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.                 -     0&#xD;
"The colonel ?"&#xD;
"Ay. Mind me, Morton, I do not say that I know anything specifically&#xD;
against him; but I watched him when his eyes were upon you once or twice,&#xD;
when you did not notice him; aid 'if there were a devil in human shape,&#xD;
it is surely he. Do you hear me, Morton ?"&#xD;
"I do-I do, Lorrinet !"&#xD;
Morton rose to a sitting posture, and e1d out both his hands, saying-" Oh,&#xD;
Lorrinet, I have been so mad-so criminal mad ! You do not know all."&#xD;
"I rather suspect I do. You made a pretty clear breast of it as we came&#xD;
along, Morton.&#xD;
"What did I tell you? said Abel, faintly.&#xD;
"Just that you were in debt some two or three thousands, and that your&#xD;
father would have paid it, and taken you to a happy home, but you neglected&#xD;
an appointment with him, to enable him to do so, and that you were sure&#xD;
that you had broken the heart of the sweetest girl in all the world, your&#xD;
cousin Emma. That is the whole of it, chapter and verse. It was no romance,&#xD;
was it, Morton ?"&#xD;
' Alas ! no."&#xD;
"Then take my advice, Abel. It is not too late. Who the deuce is it who&#xD;
says that while there is a future at all, it is never too late to woo the angel&#xD;
Virtue for the time that will last? Go to the old man at once. Tell him&#xD;
all. Go to your cousin Emma, and at her feet beg for that forgiveness which&#xD;
will be more precious to you than all recollections in the time that is to come.&#xD;
Go at once, Abel Morton, and bid London a long adieu."&#xD;
"I will go at once. Oh, yes, Lorrinet, I will go at once. You have saved&#xD;
me. But for your calling now, I cannot say that the day would have passed&#xD;
over my head without some dreadful act that would have spread the funeral&#xD;
pall of a never-ending grief over the hearts of those who still love me, despite&#xD;
all my errors. My dear friend, I was to have met my father at seven o'clock&#xD;
last night, at his hotel in Clarges Street ; but you know how my time was&#xD;
occupied-you know how differently&#xD;
"Oh, Abel-Abel! Well, no more of that. I have said enough fox"friend-&#xD;
ship. And now let me have the satisfaction of seeing you off."&#xD;
"You shall. I-think, though, that-I owe you some money.. Did you&#xD;
not win some hundreds of me at &amp;amp;carts ?"&#xD;
"Oh dear, no. Quite a mistake. We all played together till we threw the&#xD;
cards into the fire, and that is all I know about that part of the transaction;&#xD;
so we will say no more about it. Here, Rowley, your master's coat ad hat&#xD;
-quick, Rowley. I will go a part of the way with you, for it is on my route.&#xD;
And nQW again I beg of you beware of the colonel. I tried to make some&#xD;
inquiries about him, but no one knows him. The Austrian Aervice is the one&#xD;
from which he dates his rank. I need not tell you that 'that of itself is a sus-&#xD;
picious circumstance, as it is difficult of confirmation. But come now, you&#xD;
look a little more like yourself again."&#xD;
"I feel better. Rowley, if any one comes for me, say I am gone out of&#xD;
town for a day or two."&#xD;
" Yes, sir."&#xD;
"And-and-if Colonel Elk should come, you can say that-that---"&#xD;
"INo," interposed Lorrinet. "Don't leave any 'message, Morton. Cone&#xD;
along and see at once to the more important part of your affairs-your recon-&#xD;
ciliation at home, and then the colonel can easily be disposed of."&#xD;
"I will-I will. God bless you, Lorrinet-God bless you !"&#xD;
" Hush-Hu h! That servant of yours is listening to catch our words.&#xD;
Come at once. I will see you to Clarges Street."&#xD;
With a feeling of desperation-something of that sort of resolution with&#xD;
which you enter a dentist's studio-Abel crossed the threshold of the hotel.&#xD;
Of the waiter he met he inquired of Sir John Morton.&#xD;
"Gone, sir."&#xD;
" Gone ?  Gone ?"&#xD;
&#xD;

HEADS AND HEARTS; OR,&#xD;
"Yes, sir. Left late last night, sir."&#xD;
"And the young lady ?"&#xD;
"Coming !"&#xD;
Some bell had rung, and the waiter disappeared with the sharp, ambling&#xD;
trot peculiar to his calling. Abel was rather staggered at this most unex-&#xD;
pected piece of intelligence. That his father and Emma should leave without&#xD;
further communication with him did not appear credible ; and yet, why not'?&#xD;
They were the persons who had to complain, not he, Abel.  '&#xD;
A very few paces down the passage, close to the open door of the hotel,&#xD;
there was a quiet kind of bar, at which the waiters procured what they&#xD;
required for the customers, and at that bar a young lady, with a profusion of&#xD;
very black ringlets, presided. As Abel stood meditating in the hall, the black&#xD;
ringletted young lady coughed slightly, and then said-&#xD;
"Did you wish to see any one, sir ?"&#xD;
"Yes," said Abel, with a faint hope that the waiter was wrong. "Yes, I&#xD;
came to see Sir John Morton."&#xD;
"Oh, he is gone, sir. He has left a letter, though, for a Mr. Abel Mor-&#xD;
ton."&#xD;
"That is my name. Here is my card."&#xD;
"Oh, very well, sir. There is the letter."&#xD;
The letter was upon a whole, sheet of paper, and just contained these&#xD;
words:-&#xD;
&#xD;
"Abel, farewell !&#xD;
&#xD;
"JOHN MORToN."&#xD;
&#xD;
The paper fluttered from the hands of poor Abel, and he staggered back,&#xD;
into the street, until he was stopped by some one who called out-&#xD;
"Now, sir, where is you a-coming to ?"&#xD;
That coarse address recovered him a little, and he walked on like a man in&#xD;
a dream for some little way, and then he heard the rattle of wheels, and a&#xD;
voice cried-&#xD;
"Why, Abel, where are you going ?"&#xD;
It was the voice of Colonel Elk, and in another moment the tall-stepping&#xD;
horse and the dashing cab stopped close to the curb-stone, and the colonel&#xD;
himself looked out of the vehicle with a smile, as he added-&#xD;
"Where are you bound to, Morton, my boy, and so fast, too'? Don't let&#xD;
me interrupt you if you are hunting. Game ought to be strictly preserved&#xD;
for those who find it."&#xD;
"I am mad !" said Abel, placing his hand upon the side of the cab, and&#xD;
looking the colonel in the face--" I am mad !",&#xD;
"You don't say so?  Pho ! What's the matter'? Comne, get in here, be-&#xD;
aide me, and tell me all about it. What's amiss, my dear fellow?  Mad,&#xD;
indeed ! That's rather an odd idea, although some folks say we are all mad at&#xD;
times. Come, get in."&#xD;
"Why not ?" said Abel, with a strange, hysterical laugh, as he sprang into&#xD;
the cab-" Why not?   I will dare, even if he be thle fiend himself."&#xD;
" Ah, why not ?" said the colonel. "You are right enough there, my boy.&#xD;
But I see that something has put you out of your way a little. Now, Abel,&#xD;
I don't ask you what it is. I am a man of the world, and might advise you;&#xD;
but I press myself upon no man's confidence. You can do as you like, and I&#xD;
shan't take it as any offence ; but, my dear fellow, if money is at the bottom&#xD;
of your difficulty, only say the amount, and if my means or my credit will&#xD;
help you to it, you will soon smile again."&#xD;
"Colonel," said Abel, "I am now in that mood that if any one would be so&#xD;
good as to pick a quarrel with me, and kill me, it would be about the great-&#xD;
est favor he could do me."&#xD;
"Stuff! Here we are."&#xD;
"Where-oh, where ?"&#xD;
"Why, at my rooms, to be sure. Don't look so sad. Abel. It's all right,&#xD;
and 1 am not the devil, as you politely hinted just now I might be."&#xD;

In the course of a few minutes more, they were seated in the handsome&#xD;
room where Abel had already been initiated into the mysteries of rouge-et-&#xD;
noir, piquet, and blind hookey. A bumper glass of old wine sent the blood&#xD;
through Abel's-veins with new activity; and drawing a long breath he&#xD;
said-&#xD;
"Colonel, all is lost, now. My father throws me off, and disowns me. I&#xD;
went to his hotel, and he had gone, leaving a note for me, which contained&#xD;
only the words, 'Abel, farewell!' And,- therefore, I am a beggar, Colonel&#xD;
Elk. I am encumbered with debts that I have not the slightest means of&#xD;
liquidating. I am cast off by the only person who could and who would&#xD;
help me; and the prospect before me is despair."&#xD;
"Indeed !"&#xD;
"You smile, Colonel Elk ; but it is wrong of you, who only sit as the spec-&#xD;
tator to the dismal drama of my destruction, to smile. I, the actor, have dif-&#xD;
ferent feelings."&#xD;
"-Abel Morton, if you thought I smiled because you were unhappy, you&#xD;
are wrong.- I smiled because you seemed to think that there was no hope of&#xD;
your emerging from that state of'unhappiness ; and give me leave to state, my&#xD;
good friend, that any man in the world would smile to hear you say as much.&#xD;
Why, good gracious ! Abel, what does all this come to? You are in debt:&#xD;
you have quarrelled with your father. That is all."&#xD;
"All?"&#xD;
" Yes; and. not t very fearful amount, either, whatever your fears may&#xD;
make of it, believe me. Come-come, fill your glass, and we will talk over&#xD;
the affair, and see what is to be done. Did you ever do a bill ?"&#xD;
"Then it's time to begin--"&#xD;
The door of the colonel's room was at this moment opened, and a man ap-&#xD;
peared at it of so singular an appearance, that Abel felt alarmed. The man&#xD;
was so red in the face-so-shabby in his apparel-so bleared about the eyes,&#xD;
and such a picture, to take him altogether, of intoxication and ruffianism, that&#xD;
he was quite a sight to see.&#xD;
" Hilloa !" he cried; "hilloa ! Twenty pounds,-I say, and no mistake!&#xD;
D-n it, twenty pounds !"F&#xD;
The coutenance of Colonel Elk became as pale as death, and he plunged&#xD;
his hand into the bosom of his apparel with so significant a look and gesture,&#xD;
that no one could doubt but that he grasped a. weapon there.&#xD;
"It's nonsense !" cried the man at the door. "It's no use trying it od with&#xD;
me. Twenty pounds, and I'm off for a week. This is my time. Should&#xD;
go quite mad all the year round, if I didn't drink now and then-quite mad.&#xD;
You know me, and I know you. Give me the money and let me go. By&#xD;
Heaven-yes! I should go quite-quite raving mad !"&#xD;
As the mysterious man spoke these last words, he held his head with both&#xD;
his hands ; and, indeed, to look at his face and eyes, one would think that&#xD;
there was ample occasion for him to do so.&#xD;
"Infernal scoundrel !" growled the colonel-and he sprang upon the man.&#xD;
A fierce struggle ensued, which ended in their both rolling out of the room;&#xD;
and then the door was closed, as though by some other agency, and Abel was&#xD;
left alone.&#xD;
While he was wondering at this, a tall inner door, at the farther end of the&#xD;
room, which was so papered that one could hardly tell it frith a panel of the&#xD;
apartment, opened, and a female figure appeared, and came a few paces into&#xD;
the room. Attired in simple, but elegant drapery, this'young girl-for she&#xD;
was very young, indeed-looked more like a spirit tn nything human, with&#xD;
- her pale face and her long, dark hair ; and yet sh  extremely beautiful,&#xD;
'  and Abel Morton thought that surely he had see = . ace before.&#xD;
It was quite evident that the young girl did-no  erve that any one was&#xD;
in the room, for she spoke as she slowly advanced. .&#xD;
"A weary time," she said. "A weary time. Oh, what will become of&#xD;

&#xD;
me at last'? Alas ! alas ! I feel at times as though I could throw myself upon&#xD;
the mercy of the world."&#xD;
Ah ! she had seen Abel, and started back with terror.&#xD;
"Do not be alarmed," said Abe. "I am no enemy, believe me. I am a&#xD;
friend of Colonel Elk's."&#xD;
" A friend of his, sir-so young, toQ ?"&#xD;
"Should that disqualify me ?" said Abel. "Let me offer you a seat."&#xD;
"Oh, no-no ! You are a friend of his, or-or do you take him to be a&#xD;
friend of yours? Which is it ?"&#xD;
"I hardly know what to say. Colonel EJk is so good as to honor me with&#xD;
his friendship and advice."&#xD;
" Ah ! that is it ?" said the young girl.&#xD;
"I fancied as much. Oh, sir, fly from this place, I implore you. You do&#xD;
not know-&#xD;
The door of the room opened, and Colonel Elk strode into the apartment.&#xD;
There was now an angry flush upon his brow ; but the moment he saw the&#xD;
young girl, he staggered back as though he had been shot.&#xD;
" What is the meaning of this ?" he cried. "You here ?"&#xD;
"Yes, uncle, and by accident," said the girl. "I thought you were out,&#xD;
and that the apartment was vacant, so I came here to dispel the ennui of my&#xD;
mind, as Mrs. Green was out."&#xD;
"If I mistake not," said Abel. "this is the young lady who-"&#xD;
Abel stopped short. He feared that ho was getting upon rather tender&#xD;
ground, since he was going to say--" This is the young lady who sought&#xD;
refuge in my chambers from you, Colonel Elk ?"&#xD;
"Mr. Sydney-;-my niece," said the colonel, in a very bland manner. "You&#xD;
may go now, Dora."&#xD;
"Why call me Mr. Sfdney, colonel ?"&#xD;
"Call you Mr. Sydney' What do you mean'?&#xD;
"Just, that you introduced me to your niece as Mr. Sydney, that is all, and&#xD;
it struck me as rather odd."&#xD;
"Did I, though? Well that shows what a state my mind must have been&#xD;
in. That fellow's name $ydney who came in here just now, drunk ; and&#xD;
his infernal name is so ruinnind in my head, that I should not be at all sur-&#xD;
prised if I had called the girl herself Mr. Sydney. The fact is, he is an old&#xD;
soldier, and one of the greatest ruffians when he is in liquor-'-which, to do&#xD;
him   mmon justice, is not above twice a year-in the world. I bought his&#xD;
di, , from the army, and have kept him ever since."&#xD;
"  strange taste, colonel."&#xD;
' Nay, not so. The fellow is a complete nuisance to me, but he saved my&#xD;
life in India, and I told him that while I lived he should never want a friend ;&#xD;
so t am bound to keep my word ; and if he were to plague me to ten times&#xD;
thi extent he does, I should feel that I ought to put up with it. But we will&#xD;
nd   talk of our own pecuniary perplexities, and my opinion is that we most&#xD;
throw ourselves upon the Jews. I can get a few bills done off hand, and at&#xD;
once,     t much bother ; and if you give me your acceptance for five&#xD;
thus     ounds, why, upon my credit, they can be turned into  sb. That&#xD;
is the    : g sehleme that I can think of just at present for yonr scue frail&#xD;
your little   ulties."&#xD;
Yes, but-abt hills, you know, colonel, have to be paid. There is .s ta.&#xD;
thing as a bill moved at maturity.".s&#xD;
"ha, ha, ha ! hat is good ! Paid, indeed ! I think I see it. That is to&#xD;
say, until it is quiteggnvenient so to do. Then it is better to pay them, and.&#xD;
[should be the te   frst; person to advise such a course; but, until then,&#xD;
Abel, we go throng     riess of renewing them, you see.?-&#xD;
"There is sometW     that."&#xD;
"There is everytlii  in it, my dear Abel. There is peace of mind-there&#xD;
is pleasure-there is a full purse-the smiles of beauty, and all the thousand&#xD;
and one delights of youth, with ample means, in such a city as this."&#xD;
&#xD;
" And you really think that such a thing could be done ?"&#xD;
" I-know it;. and Iwill,do it, if you like it, Abel."&#xD;
"Like it? Why, a--a-that is to say, how can I do otherwise than like it?&#xD;
;_ia like some mariner stranded upon a desert shore, who is asked if he likes&#xD;
wapecast to him."&#xD;
"That is just it, Abel. You take a very proper and capital view of'the&#xD;
matter, indeed. And now we will have another glass or two of wine, and I&#xD;
will tell you further what I expect will be the results of my plan of operation."&#xD;
The colonel then explained the modus operandi, taking good care that Abel&#xD;
@ank enough to stultify his better feelings.&#xD;
Uow he got home that night, Abel could not tell exactly; but he did find&#xD;
Aiwself upon the couch again in the morning, dizzy, and sick, and faint, and&#xD;
ihhbead throbbing, and Rowley creeping about the rooms as usual and wait-&#xD;
ig till his,master should have sufficiently recovered to say anything to him,&#xD;
At length, a knock coming at the door, Abel started, saying,. "What is&#xD;
A note for you, sir."&#xD;
Abel opened the note, while Rowley drew up some of the blinds so as to&#xD;
give him sufficient light to read it, and he saw that it contained the following&#xD;
words:&#xD;
"My dear Abel-Don't forget that you are to b   me at one to-day.&#xD;
"Yours in this world, and in  hers.&#xD;
'"From the colonel." said Abel, faintlyas the noe topped fromhis hands ;&#xD;
and then, shading his -eyes, he began to try to recollect what it was that he&#xD;
had to be with the colonel at one for.&#xD;

HEADS AND HEARTS; OR7&#xD;
CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
IT is half-past three in the morning. Abel Morton has been out with the&#xD;
colonel, and he has come home again--home to the colonel's lodgings, as he&#xD;
calls them, although the whole house was his, and only inhabited by his crea-&#xD;
tures. Lights were flaming in the chandelier of the large room, where Abel&#xD;
has already seen so much of the road to ruin. The roar of laughter came from&#xD;
that room, and the shout of tipsy revelry.&#xD;
Who is there?&#xD;
First, then, there is Colonel Elk himself, cool and cautious, and affecting a&#xD;
wild and boisterous mirth that is nothing but affectation. Then there is poor&#xD;
Abel-his cautionflung off-his complexion heightened-his eyes dancing with&#xD;
an unnatural lustre, and the wine cup in his hand. There is Lord Rokeley,&#xD;
too, lounging back in his chair, and looking half asleep, asif it were really too&#xD;
great a trouble to get drunk ; and there were four others -round the table,&#xD;
choice spirits and instruments of the colonel ; and one of them, a man who, by&#xD;
his appearance, one could see wore the mark of a geptleman. The others were&#xD;
born blackguards.&#xD;
With what a shouting, roaring madness, the, mirth of the tipsy crew came on&#xD;
those early morning hours. But it is not with their sayings and doings that&#xD;
we would fill our page. Let us repair to a room upon the upper story of the&#xD;
house. It is an apartment adjoining a bed-room, and may be called a dress-&#xD;
ing-room, a study, a boudoir, or what you will, inasmuch as it belonged not&#xD;
to any of the principal apartments of the house. There is a.solitary light burn-&#xD;
ing upon the front of a mirror in a gilt sconce, and kneeling by the side of a&#xD;
chair, and striving to hide from her perception the roar of the wild riot below,&#xD;
is a young girl.&#xD;
The long ringlets of her beautiful hair hung right down to the ground, and&#xD;
there lay in beauteous levity. She shudders, as now and then the riot below&#xD;
assumes a yet wilder tone, and she fancies that even that room adjoining to her&#xD;
chamber may not be sacred. .&#xD;
"This is too dreadful !" she said. "I cannot stay--I will not stay here. It&#xD;
will kill me. If I could only gain the street, if I could but get some convey-&#xD;
ance to my uncle Josiah's house, all would be well. He knows not-he can-&#xD;
not dream of what goes on here, or he would never, for a moment, permit me'&#xD;
to be the spectator of such scenes. I am the spectator of them with my hear-&#xD;
ing; and who knows how -soon, in the insanity of intoxication, they may not&#xD;
compel me to be present at such rude riot'?  Yes, I wil-l leave the house at&#xD;
once. Sleep I cannot ; and if I could, I dare not."&#xD;
She rose, and with trembling steps passed into the adjoining room, from&#xD;
whence in a few minutes she emerged with a shawl wrapped tightly round her,&#xD;
and with a bonnet in her hand.&#xD;
"Oh, if I could but pass the door of the dining-room," she said, "in safety,&#xD;
I shall be able to escape, I hope-that is, I think there is no one in the house&#xD;
who will stop me.",&#xD;
She had got about half-way across the room to the door, when there came&#xD;
a gentle tap at it.&#xD;
'Dora would not have heard that tap. but that at that moment there wasa&#xD;
lull in the racket below. Some one of the party seemed to be making a speech&#xD;
and the others, in tipsy gravity, listening to it, therefore it was that Dora heard&#xD;
the tap at the room door. Y&#xD;
Now, in that house there was but one woman as a resident, and she was a,&#xD;
hag-like creature, who kept up a kind of state in the parlor. The cook was&#xD;
an old man wlfo had been a kind of waiter or cook at some hotel, and who&#xD;
never emerged from the' wer regions. The impression of Dora, therefore, was&#xD;
that the person tapping at the door of the room was the hag-like female afore-&#xD;
said, who went by the name of Mrs. Booker.&#xD;
"Come in," said Dora.&#xD;

&#xD;
MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.                       59&#xD;
Then a head and a face peered round the edge of the door into the room, and&#xD;
a voice said-" Don't be alarmed. It's only me-Jobus. Don't you know&#xD;
Jobus ?  Oh, Miss Dora, it's only me, humbly me, if you please. Oh dear-&#xD;
oh dear ! May I come in'? They are rather coming it down stairs, Miss Dora,&#xD;
but I have got something on my mind to tell you, and I can't sleep-I can't&#xD;
eat-I can't drink. Humbly now, if you please, Miss Dora, I should like to&#xD;
speak to you, if it's only for five .nuaes. Oh dear-oh dear ! I wasn't&#xD;
always what I look like now, I assure you, Miss Dora. Time was when I&#xD;
could walk about and look at the bright sunshine and not cower past my fel-&#xD;
low ieen as I do now-oh God ! yes, as I do now-as I do now !"&#xD;
"Speak freely, Mr. Jobus," said Dora.&#xD;
"Oh dear, she calls me 'Mr.!' Oh-oh! Don't do that, young lady, if you&#xD;
please. Call me plain Jobus. I am very plain Jobus.",yog      y&#xD;
"Very well, Jobus ; what have you to say to me?"&#xD;
".Ah! that's better; but she did call me  Mr.' Oh, Miss Dora, I was a&#xD;
Mr. once ; but I am only Jobus now. I once walked, and looked, and spoke&#xD;
like a man; but now I only crawl about like a worm of larger size than com-&#xD;
mon, and all the world treads upon me, and I dare not turn, no-no-no---I&#xD;
dare not turn,, I am sink too low for that. But-still, if I thought--"&#xD;
"Mr. Jobus, if you really have anything to'say to me, let me beg that you&#xD;
will say it at once, and not keep me in this terrible state of suspense."&#xD;
"Well, I will. Miss Dora, I am very humble; and when the colonel throws&#xD;
his boot-jack at-my head I say nothing; bIut stillI am human, and the worm&#xD;
now and then feels the heels of his enemy. I come to serve you. There is no&#xD;
good intended for you in this house, Miss Dora. There is one below-he is a&#xD;
great man; too; a nobleman, who will stay here to-night, Lord Carlinis hi4&#xD;
name. Beware of him-oh, beware of him! I am a poor wretch myself, but&#xD;
I didn't like to see you fall! Oh, no-no! I warn you! That is what I had&#xD;
first to say to you; and if this Lord Carlin comes to you, and if he is sober&#xD;
enough to understand what you say to him, say that you will call up Dor"ndL&#xD;
-    If you tell him that, he will, iii his amazement and his terror leave.you. lie&#xD;
is superstitious, and he has a fancy that the disembodied spirit of one whp i  °&#xD;
this world loved that man, is often, if not always with him. Ohisn'tit s&#xD;
thing to think that with all his wealth, with all his power, and with all&#xD;
wickedness; that man is made the veriest wretch upon God's earth b dread&#xD;
of a shadow of the imagination. Ha ! Oh dear, oh !"&#xD;
"What is the matter, Jobus?"&#xD;
"I am afraid I enjoyed that, and laughed."&#xD;
- "You did lugh. But Jobus, I will leave this house at once. Surely I&#xD;
need not stay here to be even forced to protect myself from any one's brutal-&#xD;
ity."&#xD;
-"No, you needn't leave the house. Don't do it. Don't, I say. The door&#xD;
is fast, and you cannot leave it. Your uncle, Josiah, is out of town, and yon&#xD;
have nowhere to fly to. Besides, you have a mission here. Oh, dear--oh,&#xD;
dear !"&#xD;
'. mission'? What mean you'?"&#xD;
"1 will tell you! Oh, would that I dared tell you all! But no-no, not&#xD;
yet. It would be no use now-for too much mischief is, I fear, done already.&#xD;
You must save Mr. Sydney who is brought here as a victim."&#xD;
"But--ruh                           ee savci.&#xD;
"Nay, hear me out-I humbly beg of you to do so. That young man has&#xD;
a father who will be sent with sorrow to the grave. He has a mother _wlio&#xD;
will break her heart if he is not rescued from Colonel Elk. He has a cousin,&#xD;
a girl who loves him with her whole heart and soul, who will be but a listless'&#xD;
mourner through the world if he fall ; but I think that you may winhim and&#xD;
save him."&#xD;
"But of what must I warn him'?"&#xD;
"Just of this. Tell him that it is the trade of your uncle the colonel, to&#xD;
inveigle young men of fortune to play at dice or cards with mim, and to rob&#xD;

&#xD;
them of their all. Tell him that the colonel carries on a vast amount of busi-&#xD;
ness as a discounter of bills;; and by that means, and the gaming-table, he&#xD;
will succeed in being the absolute ruin of any one who trusts to him. Tell&#xD;
him to fly from this frightful temptation while he can."&#xD;
"No, Jobus; I cannot do it."&#xD;
"You cannot?   Oh dear ! Oh-oh !"&#xD;
"No. It would be unseemly of me, a young girl, to go to a strange gentle-&#xD;
man and tell him such a thing. What would he think of me?"&#xD;
"Oh dear-what worms we are ! Ha ! I laughed again, I'm afraid. Lis-&#xD;
ten to me, Miss Dora. Have you forgotten the father-the mother-the cou-&#xD;
sin who loves him? Does it not strike you that the-great God will bless you&#xD;
for looking over a little conventional impropriety to save a soul ?"&#xD;
"Mr. Jobus," said Dora, "you are not what you seem."&#xD;
"Oh, yes; a worm-a mere earth worm."&#xD;
"No. You have been off your guard, and you have spoken in a style which&#xD;
assures me that, in your humble position here, you are acting a part. You&#xD;
have been very different from what you now are."&#xD;
Jobus clasped his hands together with great force.&#xD;
"Tell me, is it not so?  Oh ! why should one who can speak as you speak&#xD;
-one who cannot help showing that he has education and moral ability-&#xD;
stoop to such a degrading position as you now hold here in this house."&#xD;
Jobus uttered a strange cry, and covered his face with his hands.&#xD;
"Oh, tell me !" said Dora. "Perhaps, weak as I am, I can do you some&#xD;
god."-&#xD;
"No-no. Touch me not-do not speak kindly to me. I am in the power&#xD;
of your uncle,.and-and that power is based upon his knowledge of my crimi-&#xD;
nality."&#xD;
" Alas ! is it so?  Will he have no mercy ?"&#xD;
"None, but upon condition that I be his abject slave. But you will speak&#xD;
to Mr. Sydney?  I know you will. Blessings-blessings. Farewell,-fare-&#xD;
well! I will come to you again "&#xD;
CHAPTER        XVII.&#xD;
" HuRiA !" cried Colonel Elk, as he burst into a roaring laugh at his well-&#xD;
covered board, upon which glistened an array of decanters and glasses. "You&#xD;
don't drink, all of you. Come, Carlin, you fight shy of the bottle. Why,&#xD;
Rokeley, you are as sober as a judge; and as for you, Abel, I suppose you&#xD;
mistake this for a conventicle, you are so shy of the decanter."&#xD;
"No, by Heavens-no !" said Abel, as he hastily filled himself another glass,&#xD;
and tossed it off. "I-I-almost-begin to think that-I-that is-what was&#xD;
I going to say ?"&#xD;
"Try back," said one of the colonel's other guests, who looked like some-&#xD;
thing between a horse-jockey'and a member of the swell-mob.&#xD;
" Oh-ah !-so I will. I was going to say---D-n it! I don't know what&#xD;
I was going to say. But I will give you a toast."&#xD;
"That's right, my boy !" shouted the colonel. "Now for4your toast. What&#xD;
is it?  Bumpers, I suppose, Abel ?"&#xD;
" Oh, yes; bumpers-bumpers all round."&#xD;
"All's right. Here we are, fully charged. Now for the toast, Abel."&#xD;
"Well, the toast and the sentiment is, Dando-oh, yes, to be sure-Dando-&#xD;
loski, the loveliest of her sex ; but-the toast is, the loveliest of her sex, and I&#xD;
don't mean to mention the name, though it is Dandoloski-the fairest of her&#xD;
sex-no, hang it, she ain't, for she's dark. Bumpers, then, gentlemen, to the&#xD;
fairest face, who is dark, and her name remains in the recesses of-of-be quiet&#xD;
-the recesses of this bosom."&#xD;
"How prudent," said the colonel. "I suppose, Abel, you think that some&#xD;
of us will cut you out-eh ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
Un'.&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHER' THE COLONEL.&#xD;
&#xD;
4 No, I don't."&#xD;
"Then why don't you tell whq she is ?"&#xD;
"Go to the deuce, and fill you glasses again. I suppose you will be inti-&#xD;
nating that .Iam drunk next ?"&#xD;
' Oh, no-no---no !" cried everybody. "Ha !-ha '-ha !"&#xD;
"Upon my word," said Rokeley, rising, 'this is dreadful. I have now the&#xD;
fatigue of going home, and to bed. Good evening."&#xD;
"What, are you off Rokeley ?"&#xD;
"Yes. Ah ! Oh, dear me! My cab is outside, I dare say. What a tro&#xD;
ble ! Good night, all of you-good night."&#xD;
Lord Rokeley left; and then, at a wink from the colonel, the two make.-&#xD;
weights, in the shape of sporting-looking gentlemen, rose, and declared that&#xD;
they must go likewise sothat in a little time, Lord Carlin and Abel were the&#xD;
only guests of the colonel.&#xD;
This Lord Carlin, of whom the reader has already heard indistinctly more&#xD;
than once, was a man past, what may be considered the middle of life. He&#xD;
had a large head of very curly black hair, and whiskers of the same hue,&#xD;
which met under his chin, and stuck out in a rounded roll most strongly from&#xD;
each side of his face. His eyes were deep and sunken, and his complexion in-&#xD;
flamed by strong potations, which upon some constitutions has such an effect.&#xD;
He was dressed in an easy, fashionable style, for the taste of which, doubtless,&#xD;
his valet was accountable; but it was the expression of the face of this man&#xD;
that made you see in a moment that he was a heartless scoundrel; and by&#xD;
coming to such a conclusion, there was- no risk whatever of doing him the&#xD;
lightestCinjustie.&#xD;
hWell, Carlin," said, the colonel, as he glanced at Abel, "our friend here&#xD;
has,I hope, enjoyed himself."&#xD;
Lord Carlin laughed, and pushed the decanter towards him, and while Abel&#xD;
was filling another glass, the colonel leant over to Carlin, saying-&#xD;
"To-night .'&#xD;
-Yes, to be sure, if you like. Is it all right ?"&#xD;
"Quite ! And you may as well hand me over the bills."&#xD;
"Here they are ; so now, I hope, you are satisfied, colonel? The entailed&#xD;
property cant be touched, but the proceeds--"&#xD;
"Of course can-so listen to me. I will sit here. You go up stairs. We&#xD;
have nothing in this house. You understand, Carlin? I have told you which&#xD;
door. Go, and prosper. Our friend, Abel here, will not be able to inter.&#xD;
fem."&#xD;
"I don't know what the devil, Colonel Elk, you invited our friend Abel&#xD;
here for on such an occasion.~"&#xD;
"No ?  You are well aware that I have my reasons for what I do ; and I&#xD;
say, that unless Abel had been here, the affair should have gone off. Let that&#xD;
ifllace. I have the bills. You have kept your word. The girl is up stairs,&#xD;
hillo  hAbel, my boy, are you asleep ?"&#xD;
"Eh? what is it ?-I-that is, surely I am nodding. I hope I igaven't&#xD;
taken too much wine, colonel ?"_&#xD;
," Not a drain."&#xD;
"Oh, well, in that case it's all right. Where's that ugly fellow you: calhi&#xD;
Carlin, eh?. I don't see him now ?"&#xD;
"Oh, shirked his glass, has he? Ha! ha! How odd it is. When I begin&#xD;
a " ha bl-laugh, now, I feel as if I couldn't leave off-ha ! ha! And yet&#xD;
I am as sober as a chief justice! Ha ! ha n"&#xD;
'  I'm afraid I have. A pause ensued, which the colonel broke by saying,&#xD;
Abel ill you win a few hundreds of me ?"&#xD;
"Yes, I will; but don't'-..don't--say-that I won your money while you&#xD;
were drunk, that's all. I pity you very much. Where's my handkerchief?&#xD;
Let me weep for my friend who has taken his other glass. Let the snipen-&#xD;
tJetic tears fall on the carpet.--I will play at cards, but don't say now, my&#xD;

'd without disturbing her by any attempt to reach it through the little sitting-&#xD;
room that has before been alluded to.&#xD;
Lord Carlin produced a key from his pocket. That key had been given to&#xD;
him by Colonel Elk the day before. It belonged to the door that had not&#xD;
been opened for so long ; and then, before he applied it to the lock, he again&#xD;
looked cautiously around him, with his brows drawn down, so as to concen-&#xD;
trate his gaze into every corner.&#xD;
Without the slightest noise, the dour yielded to the touch of the villain who&#xD;
opened it, and then appeared the narrow passage that wound round the little&#xD;
room, and finally terminated in the bed-room of that innocent girl who had&#xD;
been brought to that house to'be betrayed-betrayed. too, by one who called&#xD;
himself her uncle !&#xD;
Lord Carlin advanced with slow and noiseless steps. It did not take twelve&#xD;
of those steps to reach the door that opened into the bed-chamber ; and that&#xD;
moved upon its well-prepared hinges as noiselessly as the other door had&#xD;
done.&#xD;
Lord Carlin all but held his breath, now, as he found himself in that sanc-&#xD;
tuary of innocence. The room was quite dark ; but the door between it and&#xD;
the outer apartment was open, and through that there streamed a reflection of&#xD;
a light.&#xD;
"She is'up," whispered Carlin to-himself as he peeped into the outer room,&#xD;
and there saw Dora sitting in an old-fashioned, high-backed chair, with her&#xD;
hands clasped, and such a sweet, meditative look upon her face, that that alone&#xD;
ought to have been sufficient to deter him from his dastardly purpose.&#xD;
" All is well," he muttered. "The colonel has not played me false. All is&#xD;
well., She will, of course, try to escape by the ordinary mode of egress from&#xD;
the room, so I must get between her and it. The door at which I have&#xD;
entered is closed, and she will not dream of it. Now-dear in your exquisite&#xD;
beauty, and dear to purchase-Dora you shall be mine i"n&#xD;
With a bound he passed the chair upon which the young girl sat, and&#xD;
reached the ordinary door of her room, against which he stood, as he regarded&#xD;
her with flashing eyes. She heard the step in her room, and in another&#xD;
moment she saw the man. One cry-burst from her lips, and then she rose&#xD;
and looked in the bloated face of the rou6, with such a death-like paleness upon&#xD;
her own features, that no sculptured form, of rare and exquisite beauty, could&#xD;
have looked less life-like than did she.&#xD;
"Well, my dear," said Lord Carlin, "you are rather alarmed, I daresay. I&#xD;
am Lord Carlin, and you will be a lady. Your uncle quite understands it all,&#xD;
my love. He knows that I will do what is right to-morrow, and elevate you&#xD;
to the peerage ; and he, knowing how much I love you, has given me permis-&#xD;
sion to have a little conversation with you to-night, you see, first. Don't let&#xD;
me disturb you. Sit down."&#xD;
Dora seized the bell-rope by the side of the chimney-piece.. At a touch it,-&#xD;
fell. It had evidently been tampered with.&#xD;
"Come, come," added Carlin. "I don't wish to be rough or rude to you;&#xD;
but you must be pleased to consider that you are my wife and so you may&#xD;
scream, you may rave, but mine you are, and mine you shall be. I speak to&#xD;
you fairly. You shall want no luxury that London can produce for you. It&#xD;
is for you to make your conditions, or to be that worse than wretch which&#xD;
your own obstinacy will make you. You re beautiful; I am rich. I love you.&#xD;
You have charms--&#xD;
"Yes, and a knife," said Dora.&#xD;
As she spoke she produced from the fol  of her dress about her bosom, a&#xD;
knife, and held it with a desperate clutch.&#xD;
" Pshaw ! Do you think I am afraid of a knife in the hands of *ayscared&#xD;
girl?"&#xD;
He advanced a step or two, but Dora held up her disengaged hand to her&#xD;
ear, and said-" Ah-! there is that moaning noise again; yes, there it is again&#xD;
in the chamber-in yonder chamber. Oh, sir, was it manly to seek to unmerve&#xD;

me by supernatural terrors. before you came there to attack a weak girl?'&#xD;
Was it to drive me mad that you sent a figure through this room to that one&#xD;
-a female figure, like a cloud. ,it said to me, 'Beware-beware !' and it&#xD;
named the name of Dorinda."&#xD;
Lord Carlin staggered back till the door stopped him.&#xD;
"Hell and fury!" he shouted, "you don't say that?  It did not say that.&#xD;
There is nothing-nothing !"&#xD;
" Ah !" cried Dora, "there it is again ! It comes-it comes ! Oh; one glance&#xD;
at its glassy eyes, and at the bloodless lips of the shadowy form is enough to'&#xD;
drive those who can take that glance and live to madness ! it comes now!&#xD;
There, in the gloom! It will be through the door in a moment now! Oh, do&#xD;
not-do not !"&#xD;
Then Lord Carlin turned, and dashing open the door of the room, made a&#xD;
rush to the landing-place. The light on the staircase was out, but he just saw&#xD;
a something tall and white close to the stairs-head. He fell, uttering a loud&#xD;
shriek, and then rolled from top to bottom of the flight of stairs.&#xD;
Dora sunk to her knees in the little room, and burst into tears.&#xD;
"Miss Dora," said a voice. "Oh, dear! here I am. Be composed-I hum-&#xD;
bly ask you to be composed, Miss Dora. It is much better to be composed,&#xD;
if you please. Ha !"&#xD;
"Is that you, Jobus ?  You have saved me."      .&#xD;
"Don't mention it. I am only a worm ; but I think that Lord Carlin is&#xD;
rather the worse for his tumble down stairs. Oh dear, yes ! It will do him&#xD;
good, perhaps. Ha ! Oh dear, did I laugh?  I borrowed a sheet from the&#xD;
colonel's bed, and met him on the head of the stairs. Ha ! I have laughed&#xD;
again. Pray excuse me, Miss Dora, for laughing again."&#xD;
"Oh, Jobus, you have befriended me, and now I will leave this house."&#xD;
" Stop ! the younggentleman below, Sydney as they call him. Don't you&#xD;
seem to remember him, Miss Dora? He is lying on his back by this time im&#xD;
the drawing-room. The colonel will go home with Lord Cailin now, and the&#xD;
young man will sleep of the fumes of the drugged wine."&#xD;
"Drugged wine?"&#xD;
"Oh dear, yes, of course. The colonel knows how to do that. When there&#xD;
is a victim wanted he just puts a little something in the drink, and then,&#xD;
whether there is little or much taken, it does just as well. But in a few hours&#xD;
you will have an opportunity of going and speaking to him. You may save him.&#xD;
Will you not try to save him ?"&#xD;
"Why is it, Jobus, that this young man of all others, excites your sym-&#xD;
pathy ?"&#xD;
"Will you pardon me if I do not tell you that just yet'?  Be satisfied that&#xD;
you cannot go wrong with a good motive. I am very troublesome, and it is&#xD;
great presumption in me to say this. But will you promise ?"&#xD;
" I will."&#xD;
"That is well. I humbly thank you. Sleep now till you hear me, humbly&#xD;
tap at your door. You will be undisturbed ; I will take care of that. I am&#xD;
but a mere worm, but I will protect you."&#xD;
Without waiting for any reply, Jobus closed the door softly and crept.&#xD;
away.&#xD;
The first act of Dora now was to rise and fasten the door again. and then she&#xD;
sank to her knees, and prayed and wept.&#xD;
ae*          *      *      *      *      *      *&#xD;
It will be recollected that we left affairs in the drawing-room of Colonel Elk&#xD;
in rather a state of disorder. The colonel himself was alarmed at the cry that&#xD;
had come from Lord Carlin, and had sprung to his feet. Abel, in an attempt&#xD;
to do so likewise, had found his length upon the floor, amid a wreck of bottles,&#xD;
glasses, wax-lights, and wine coolers, and the broken chair, the back of which&#xD;
had given way in its fall with him.&#xD;
There was something very ominous and alarming about the profound still&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHER, TUE COLONEL.&#xD;
ness that reigned in the house. You might have heard a pin drop. Theeo1-&#xD;
onel got fidgetty.&#xD;
"Holloa!" he cried. " Holloa! what's that?"&#xD;
With a nervous gesture he rang the bell, and he could hear the tingle of it&#xD;
for some moments ; but no one came. A full five minutes passed thus, avid&#xD;
then the door was very slowly opened, inch by inch, and a head appeared. It&#xD;
vas the head of our friend, Jobus.&#xD;
" Scoundrel !" cried the colonel.&#xD;
"Humbly, yes," said Jobus. "Your worm is here."&#xD;
"You crawling hound I" said Elk.. "What has been the- occasion of that&#xD;
noise in the house? Tell me this moment."&#xD;
"Humbly, yes, sir. When I had the honor of hearing the bell ring, and&#xD;
knew that such a worm as i am was wanted, in consequence of the-excellent&#xD;
Frogs being dreadfully inebriated, I rose from my stool with three legs, in the&#xD;
pantry, and ran up stairs, and upon the landing I saw the great Lord Carlin,&#xD;
noble sir, lying on his illustrious back in, I think, a' kind of swound. I&#xD;
hope a worm as has crawled over him did not damage the peerage. Oh dear f&#xD;
Ha!. I didn't laugh, I assure you,,.great sir, that I did not laugh."&#xD;
Colonel Elk strode to the door of the room, and, flinging it open, there he&#xD;
saw Lord Carlin, as Jobus had said, lying upon his illustrious back, in a state&#xD;
of complete insensibility.&#xD;
"How could this come about ?" muttered Elk. "I am astonished and star-&#xD;
tied at this event. What can it meadt? Did he merely fall?' Is it an accident&#xD;
and nothing more 7"&#xD;
The colonel then called Jobus.&#xD;
"Humbly, yes, s&#xD;
"Can you bring Lord Carlin into the room ?"&#xD;
"I will try, sir. I humbly, and with all respect to you; sir, think I can."&#xD;
Jobus went on to the landing, while the colonel returned to the drawing-&#xD;
room, and then grasping Lord Carlin by the throat with a force that must have&#xD;
gone a long way towards strangling him, and which left a livid mark for days&#xD;
upon his throat, Jobus carried him into the room, and placed him on a sofa.-&#xD;
The colonel had provided himself with a decanter of cold water, which he now,&#xD;
from a height of about two feet, deliberately poured, splashing, upon the face&#xD;
of Lord Carlin.&#xD;
"If that don't revive him, he is dead," said Elk..&#xD;
"Humbly, yes, sir.&#xD;
Lord Carlin gave a gasp or two, and opened his eyes.&#xD;
The colonel took up another decanter of water, and went through the same&#xD;
operation with it, and Lord Carlin, getting a good mouthful of the water, was&#xD;
as nigh choking as possible.&#xD;
"He is better," said the colonel.&#xD;
"Humbly, yes," said Jobus.&#xD;
"Leave the room, curse you.&#xD;
Jobus glided away in a moment. He knew that if he delayed only time&#xD;
enough to engender the thought that he did not go as quickly as he might,&#xD;
the decant r would be at his head, for the colonel still had it in his hand.&#xD;
As soon as the door was closed upon Jobus, the colonel gave Lord Carlin a&#xD;
shake by the arm, and said--" Come my friend, tell me if you please, or can,&#xD;
how all this came about ?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes, I will tell you. Wine-give me a glass of wine-not in that tum-&#xD;
bler. Give me one of the water glasses-yes, that will do. I am parched-&#xD;
quite parched, and sickat heart."&#xD;
Without any remonstrance upon the amount of the dose of stimulant, the&#xD;
colonel handed to Lord Carlin the wine he required, and the goblet, which held&#xD;
about half a pint, was drained to the very bottom.&#xD;
"Take another tumbler of wine," said Elk.&#xD;
" No, no ; no more, if you please, colonel."&#xD;

MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Do you think it possible that the dead may be permitted to visit this world&#xD;
and drive those mad who had known them in life?  I say do you think it&#xD;
possible that a girl who dies by her own hand, just because she plunges into&#xD;
an intrigue, and afterwards turns spooney and repents, can live after the'grave&#xD;
has closed upon her and-and-and, as I say, drive a man almost mad ?"&#xD;
" Do you?"said Elk.&#xD;
"I don't know-I don't know. She was there, though."&#xD;
"What, up stairs ?"&#xD;
"Yes-oh yes-Dorinda."'&#xD;
"What, the little creature who took the poison that you lefton her dressing&#xD;
table for her about a year ago 2"&#xD;
" Don't-oh, don't say that ! But she was there ! That was why I fell&#xD;
down your staircase."  He sprang to his feet. "I cap't stay in this house !&#xD;
The air is thick, I tell you, and long wavy streaks of blood are in it. She was&#xD;
in the room above, and she met me as I came out. Only for a fleeting moment&#xD;
I saw her, but that was enough. I can't live and see such sights as that !&#xD;
Why am I haunted, and a hundred thousand men, who have done the same&#xD;
things, ay, and worse, are permitted to go smilingly to rest, as though nothing&#xD;
were amiss-why is this?  I must go ! The door-the door ! Where is the&#xD;
door ?"&#xD;
Lord Carlin made his way out of the room with precipitation, and in'the&#xD;
course of a moment or two more, the bang of the street door announced to the&#xD;
colonel that he had left the house. Then Elk looked grim and thoughtful, and&#xD;
with his hands clasped behind his back, he slowly paced the magnificent apart-&#xD;
ment to and fro for some time in silence.&#xD;
A deep groan came upon the colonel's ears, and he starred and uttered a cry&#xD;
of alarm, and pressed both his hands upon his heart.&#xD;
"What is that?  Oh, what is that?  Help-no, no ! Oh, fool-fool! It&#xD;
is the drunken moan of yon slumbering man. Abel Morton, you are in my&#xD;
power. I could kill you now, but I reserve you for a worse fate than that ;&#xD;
for I do think, in my soul, that I can make you kill yourself in the time that&#xD;
is to come."&#xD;
He reeled to the door of the room and opened it.&#xD;
" Jobus-Jobus! Attend to this Mr. Sydney, who is a little the worse for&#xD;
champagne. I am going to bed."-&#xD;
"The worm, sir, will do your bidding.. Good-night, sir."&#xD;
The colonel ascended the staircase, and Jobus looked after him.&#xD;
"Ha! Oh, dear, did I laugh?  Oh-oh ! The worm laughed. Perhaps&#xD;
it won't be a'worm always, though !"&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
Jonus stood for a little time gazing upon the wreck that was upon the&#xD;
table.&#xD;
Broken glasses-cards-dice-one smashed decanter, and a large slop of&#xD;
sherry pouring along the table-fruit-a few flowers-cigars, and on the floor&#xD;
-Abel Morton.f&#xD;
Poor Abel did not lie very pleasantly. To tell the truth, his head was a&#xD;
little lower than his heels, for they were still upon the wreck of the chair&#xD;
that had gone over with him ; and the probability was strongly in favor of&#xD;
a fit of apoplexy before the morning.&#xD;
Jobus approached him, and laid him more level. He then placed a couple&#xD;
of cushions from off one of the couches under his head, and Abel had a chance&#xD;
of surviving then the wild riot of that night.&#xD;
But Jobus wanted to say something to him, and he wanted, too, to keep&#xD;
Dora to her promise of saying something to him; therefore, it was a great&#xD;
point with Jobus to rouse Abel Morton up, and having seen the colonel oper-&#xD;
ate upon Lord Carliti he adopted the same mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
Abel on opening his eyes asked-" Where is the colonel ?"&#xD;
" Up stairs."&#xD;
"And you ?"&#xD;
"Oh, don't mind me. I am only a worm-a thing of nought. But tell&#xD;
me, are you sufficiently in your senses to understand what is said to you?&#xD;
Does your brain throb with the fumes of the wine? Are you sane enough&#xD;
to listen to good advice, young man?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes, yes.e I feel tolerably well. A little dizzy or so, perhaps, but the&#xD;
cold upon my head is very grateful-I don't think I have taken too much&#xD;
wie"&#xD;
"Don't you?"&#xD;
"No; I could not have done so, or it would be impossible for me to feel as&#xD;
I do now. Indeed, I am rapidly recovering-save a little feeling of weakness&#xD;
at the stomach. Is this your remedy, my good friend ?"&#xD;
"Don't call me a good friend, if you please. I am a poor humble wretch--&#xD;
a mere worm ; but I will fetch one who has something to say to you; and I&#xD;
too, if I were not such a poor creature, I, too, could say something."&#xD;
"What would you say ?"&#xD;
Jobus went to the door of the room, and peeped out, and listened, before&#xD;
he would venture to say it; and then, creeping up to Abel Morton, in a low&#xD;
vice spoke to him-&#xD;
" Young ,man,,if you have a spul to pollute-a soul to lose, and to allow to&#xD;
writhe in anguish for countless ages to come-if you have a home-affection&#xD;
which you wish not absolutely to blast forever-if you have the smallest ven-&#xD;
eration for the great God who made all things, and who willeth'not that the&#xD;
meanest thing he has so made should perish-leave this house at once and&#xD;
forever, and close your own door forever against its owner."&#xD;
Abel looked at Jobus with astonishment.&#xD;
"Do you comprehend me ?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes, you speak plainly enough; but--"&#xD;
"That will do. I have said what I had to say. Now be quiet, and I will&#xD;
bring you another who Will say it likewise."&#xD;
Jobus left the room abruptly, and Abel Morton clasped his head with both&#xD;
his hands, and tried to think.&#xD;
"Oh, .fool, fool !" said Abel. "Why did I plunge so madly into the wine&#xD;
cup? Why did I bring this confusion over my brain, and this fever to my&#xD;
lips! What can that strange man mean by his solemn warning? lie is one&#xD;
of the attendants of the colonel, and ought to know. What can I do ?-what'&#xD;
ought I to do?  Did I play?  Ah, there are cards and dice. What was the&#xD;
result?  Did I lose?  Have I to be told the tale of how much more near to&#xD;
perdition I am than when the sun last rose--"&#xD;
The door of the apartment opened, and Jobus appeared. He was beckon-&#xD;
ing some one to follow him, and then Dora appeared. How pale she was !&#xD;
She looked more like a spectre than .a living being, and her hands shook as&#xD;
she strove to still them by holding them one within the other.&#xD;
"Sir," said Dora, "be assured I come to say to you that you stand upon&#xD;
the brink of ruin-that all true affection-all dear ties of love-all joy and&#xD;
purity of heart and purpose-will be wrecked and lost-utterly lost, if you&#xD;
listen not to the sober voice of warning. Leave this place. Never return tG&#xD;
it. Speak no more to the bold bad man who is master here.. I can say noth-&#xD;
ing further, for I know not who and what you are; but this'much promised&#xD;
to say, and I have said it. I hope to heaven it may save you. You are&#xD;
warned."&#xD;
Dora turned and slowly left the room. Abel followed her with his eyes,&#xD;
and when she was gone he looked at Jobus as he muttered--&#xD;
"A rare vision, that-who is she ?"&#xD;
"The colonel's niece."&#xD;
. His niece?  Oh, I recollect. I have now a kind of confused idea.&#xD;
Abel covered his face with his hands for several minutes, and let his head&#xD;

gions; but I liked you, Morton--you will, I am sure, now, excuse me&#xD;
speaking in the past tense. I say, I liked you, and I did my utmost to save&#xD;
you. I have failed, and so, farewell. I will not quarrel with you."&#xD;
The captain took up his hat and left the room. Once only did Abel say-&#xD;
" Lorrinet, come back ;" but the captain was too far off to hear him, and with&#xD;
a groan the wretched young man fell back upon the pillows of the couch.&#xD;
"If I could only die, now," said Morton-" Oh! if I could only die just&#xD;
now, it would be better for all-so much better for all."&#xD;
Rowley made a rush into the room, and stood looking, for once in the wa;&#xD;
a little alarmed by his master's couch.&#xD;
"What now ?" said Abel, feebly.&#xD;
"Oh, sir-sir! it's all up now. You see. They-the Philistines, you see&#xD;
-sir-are coming in full force, sir ! They have held off for a day or so, and&#xD;
I had my ideas'that something was brewing, sir, and now, here they are!&#xD;
The staircase is full of 'em, sir ! There's the fellow about the bills for the&#xD;
parties, I'm sure, and there's-Oh, for ! oh, for !"&#xD;
Bang, bang, hang, bang, bang ! went the knocker of the outer door of the&#xD;
chambers, which Rowley had just managed to shut after Captain Lorrinet.&#xD;
Abel sprang to his feet. and uttered some of the most awful oaths that ever&#xD;
came from his lips. How did they manage to lodge in any portion of his&#xD;
memory?-&#xD;
Oh, don't, sir," said Rowley. "Oh. don't."&#xD;
Get me my razors-stay, my pistols ! Oh, God, I shall go mad !"&#xD;
Bang, bang, bang, bang ! came again upon the door, and each ylow of the&#xD;
knocker seemed to go through Abel's brain. He felt his strength-desert him,&#xD;
and he staggered towards the sofa again, and fell upon it. Rowley got a chair,&#xD;
and mounting upon it, he placed his eye to the peep-hole he had established&#xD;
above the door, and while he kicked with one leg'to his master to keep quiet,&#xD;
he reconnoitred the enemy without, who were certainly in very great force&#xD;
upon that memorable and most malapropos occasion to poor Abel.&#xD;
"Oh, for !" said Rowley, as he looked out like a warder from a tower, or&#xD;
like the fair Rebecca upon the storming of Front de-Bouf's castle, when Ivan-&#xD;
hoe lay sick with wounds upon his couch. "Oh, for ! there will be. a pretty&#xD;
game now, I rather think. Indeed, my 'private opinion is, that all the fat's&#xD;
in the fire."&#xD;
With this allegory Rowley was so completely satisfied, that he winked to&#xD;
himself several times, and kept his eye rather away from the hole in the wall,&#xD;
so that the aforesaid Philistines should not notice him.&#xD;
An old weazen-faced, blear-eyed looking man, with an expression of much&#xD;
low cunning in his face approached the door. This specimen of humanity&#xD;
was followed by a shabby, hulky-looking fellow, who kept his hat down over&#xD;
his brows, and who looked as if he had not had the advantage of an inter-&#xD;
view with soap and water for a month at the very least.&#xD;
Rowley instinctively knew who these people were.&#xD;
"A broker and his man !" said Rowley. "The Philistines are a-coming i.,&#xD;
rather, I don't think."&#xD;
Bang, bang ! at the door-tingle, tingle ! at the bell-the kicking of feet-&#xD;
the bawling of voices-the oaths of those who were locked in the throng-&#xD;
the murmurs of those who were foremost-the jeers of others who, being&#xD;
only newsmongers, took no per onal interest in the aff~iir, and rather enjoyed&#xD;
the riot-all made up such a babel of sounds, that Abel sprang from his&#xD;
couch, and stood in the doorway of the inner room, looking the very personi-&#xD;
fication of confusion and despair. "-&#xD;
"Tell me-tell me, Rowley, who they are that are really without making&#xD;
this mad riot."&#xD;
"Yea, sir, I'll tell. There's lots of 'em, sir. There's a broker and his man&#xD;
close to the panel, and I rather take it, sir, they come about the little bill that&#xD;
was due last week on account of the goods and chattels, you know, sir."&#xD;
"Oh, ah-yes, I did give a bill, and-and-"&#xD;

"I am shot !" yelled the broker. "I'm shot t I'm a dead broker and apprai-&#xD;

"Murder !" shouted several of the others, and there is no knowing what&#xD;
might have ensued, if a tall figure, arrayed in a handsome military cloak, with&#xD;
a deep scarlet collar, and no end of tassels and silken frogs about it had not&#xD;
suddenly appeared in the midst of the throng, and cried out in a voice of com-&#xD;
mnand--" What is the meaning of all this? Has bedlam broke loose? Row-&#xD;
ley, where are you? What does it all mean ?"&#xD;
"Oh, colonel," said Rowley, from his peep-hole. "It's only the Philistines,&#xD;
that's all-and they won't call again."&#xD;
CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
THAT some rather serious catastrophe might have occurred at the door of&#xD;
poor Abel's chamber, if Colonel Elk had not suddenly appeared among the&#xD;
besiegers, is probable enough; but his appearance produced a, cessation of&#xD;
hostilities, and a great effect upon all parties. To be sure, the creditors all&#xD;
began to speak at once at first, but the colonel raised his hand, and cried-&#xD;
" Silence ! One of you will be enough to tell me what all this is about."&#xD;
"Really," continued Elk, this disturbance is of the most disreputable char-&#xD;
acter. I am quite amazed to see men of seeming respectability engaged in such&#xD;
an affair. What on earth does it all mean ?"&#xD;
"In the name of,the law," said the old broker, whose calling had made him&#xD;
irrascible and wroth, and who now shook with passion, "in the name of the&#xD;
law I will have the door open! I have an execution against the goods. I will&#xD;
put in the execution, in the name of the law."&#xD;
The colonel turned sharply to the old broker, and in a tone of voice that&#xD;
seemed to go right through the old man's head, he staggered back so, he&#xD;
cried-&#xD;
" What is the debt ?"&#xD;
"One hundred and eleven pounds, six shillings."&#xD;
"Where's your authority ?"&#xD;
"The execution is-is---"&#xD;
"No; your authority to take the money. Here is the amount. Can you&#xD;
give a receipt for it ?"&#xD;
"I-I--that is the execution. I didn't, of course, expect to be offered the&#xD;
money on the place-the staircase. There are the costs."&#xD;
"Yes, up to this moment; but no costs to you, for you have done nothing.&#xD;
I leave to you, if you have any authority to take the amount-the debt and&#xD;
costs. Charge what you will; and I can only tell you, that if there is one&#xD;
sixpence taken beyond what you are legally entitled to, I will place the mat-&#xD;
ter, within an hour, in the hands ofthe sharpest attorney in London, who will&#xD;
have your skin rather than not make you pay for your indescretion."&#xD;
" I won't stay !" cried the old broker. "I don't care about the debt and the&#xD;
money. and all that sort of thing. I came to get the furniture I won't stay.&#xD;
Come along Bill-come along. I don't like the job."&#xD;
The colonel quickly put the others at their ease; for, turning to them, he&#xD;
said, in quite a mild and bland tone of voice-&#xD;
" I am sorry that you have all thought proper to come in this way to tor-&#xD;
ment Mr. Morton. I know, and very little inquiry might have let you all&#xD;
know, that he is a young gentleman of great expectations, and that your money&#xD;
is perfectly as safe as if you had it in your awn pockets. And I tell you&#xD;
all, that I have such a knowledge of the resources of Mr. Morton, that I am&#xD;
ready and willing, within the hour, to'pay all his debts to the tune of ten&#xD;
thousand pounds, if they went to as much."&#xD;
"I 'Il call again, sir," said the confectioner,-" I'll call again. It's Mr. Mor-&#xD;
ton's custom is all I want, sir."&#xD;
"Yes-yes," said all the others in chorus. 'It's his custom, sir, that we&#xD;
are all anxious about, nothing else in the world, sir."&#xD;

"I wouldn't, if I could help it; but the real truth is, Morton, that when I&#xD;

"A thousand thanks, Abel, Mind, I shall expect you to the minute; for&#xD;
now I have made up my mind to ask your advice and to follow it, I amall&#xD;
impatience till I hear what you have to say concerning the affair that i shall&#xD;
lay before you.&#xD;
"I will be with you to the moment, colonel. At eight this evening '?"&#xD;
"Yes, at eight. And now, Morton, pa don me for hurrying away  emo you&#xD;
in this way. I see you are better, though."&#xD;
Colonel Elk walked to the corner of the Albany, where his cab was in&#xD;
waiting for him, and beckoned to the servant, who approached with such a&#xD;
multitude of touches of his hat, that it was quite a wonder the brim stood such&#xD;
constant manipulation.&#xD;
"Drive after me.".&#xD;
"Yes, sir.&#xD;
Elk walked on till he came to a. French restaurateur's, of fashionable, pro-&#xD;
fligate, and expensive notoriety, and the cab followed him. He entered the&#xD;
place like an habitue, as, indeed, he was, and ascending to the magnificent&#xD;
saloon on the first floor, he repaired to the deep recess of a back window,&#xD;
which was partially secluded from the rest of the room by a screen, and there&#xD;
he sat down, and took the letter from his pocket that he had just so cleverly&#xD;
intercepted from reaching the-hands of Abel.&#xD;
A diabolical smile crossed his features as h read the superscription of the&#xD;
letter.&#xD;
"Abel Morton, Esq., Albany, London."&#xD;
" Ah !" he added, "Isaw the Hampstead postmark upon it, or I shouldhave&#xD;
let him have it; but then I guessed it was from the father, or the mother, or&#xD;
the pretty cousin-ha! ha !-and so I thought it might as well reach my&#xD;
hands first, and last too, for you can never see it, my most simple Abel."&#xD;
The colonel broke the seal of the letter, and, without the quiver of a nerve,&#xD;
opened it wide at once.&#xD;
Colonel Elk turned the paper about,'and upon three of its sides there&#xD;
appeared to be separate letters signed by three different writers.&#xD;
"Why, what on earth are tiey all about ?" he muttered. "John Morton&#xD;
to one-Ah ! that's the father ! Eliza Morton to another-that's the mother&#xD;
Emma Chester to the third page---that's the cousin !"t         h&#xD;
The colonel's dark eye flashed with triumph, as, holding the letter careless.&#xD;
ly before him, he added,-&#xD;
"Why, by---, I have the whole family in my grasp ! Well, well, we will&#xD;
see what John Morton has to say."&#xD;
This diabolical villain then read the following letter addressed to Abel by&#xD;
his father,-&#xD;
" Mg DEAR Boy,-I do not know, but I will not doubt, that you came to&#xD;
the hotel in Clarges-street after I and Emma were compelled to leaves on ac-&#xD;
count of a little indisposition that laid hold of me, and the anxiety that your&#xD;
mother was sure to suffer from our long absence from home.&#xD;
"Now, Abel, all I have to say is, that I am much better than I was, and&#xD;
that I long to see you at home, when every little entanglement that may be&#xD;
about you can easily be set to rights.&#xD;
"Come Abel, soon-come at once, Abel, for we all expect you. I believe&#xD;
your mother is going to write something to you On the other side of this page,&#xD;
so-I leave it clear for her, ard subscribe myself right down in the=oorner,&#xD;
*Your affectionate father,&#xD;
" Jomx MoRTorN."&#xD;
"Very good," said the colonel, as he turned the page. Now, we will see&#xD;
what the affectionate mother says."&#xD;

MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.                      77&#xD;
"Not understand me? Well, that is a good one. To tell the truth, though.&#xD;
I hardly expected to find you here.. I thought you would be amongthetrqop&#xD;
and flowers Abel, with the pretty cousin on your arm, and the mamma lookv,&#xD;
in so pleased, and the byes of'the papa dancing with joy; I thoughtto tell&#xD;
the honest'truth,-that-by this time you were snug at home, and:able toIook"&#xD;
upon past follies as'a fellow may look at tfc world through the wrong end ofK&#xD;
his lorgnette, sending everything a longway o11 and wondering he could ever&#xD;
have been there, But it is all right now, isn't it?  You have made tling;&#xD;
square with the governor now?"&#xD;
Abel rose and looked at Lorrinet as though he would eat him up; and there&#xD;
was a pause of a few minutes' duration, and the two young men looked=at eaeh&#xD;
other 'as though each would look right into the heart of the other.'&#xD;
I""Well;"=said Lorrinet at last; " what's the matter now ?"&#xD;
"The matter'?"&#xD;
" Yes;-out with it; you don't seem all right. Have you, or have you not,&#xD;
made up:matters with the home authorities'? 'Can you ever have, been AIbo&#xD;
enough to go backsliding again? That is not likely. Why, man, I left you&#xD;
at the door of the hotel. You didn't, after that, play any tricks, surely'?"&#xD;
"Captain Lorrinet, does it strike you, or does it not, that you are 'taking&#xD;
very great liberties with my affairs ?"&#xD;
"Then I beg to inform you that you are, sir."&#xD;
Alas I how low had Abel sunk now, that in order to cover the disgrace&#xD;
of his own conduct, he was forced to pick a quarrel with the only persona&#xD;
London whom he could call a friend, and who had the manliness oftheart to&#xD;
try to put him in the right path, from which he was so woefully strayi in,&#xD;
Lorrinet looked at him compassionately for a few moments, and thea he said,&#xD;
"Do you mean this, Morton?"&#xD;
" I do, sir,"&#xD;
"Well, I perhaps ought to have expected it. These are the things that stop&#xD;
the fresh-current of a man's honest-intentions. Morton, you are too weak.to&#xD;
withstand the temptations of the town, and the wicked philosophy;of that&#xD;
fiend in human shape, Colonel Elk.'&#xD;
"Sir, Colonel Elk is my friend, and I do not choose to hear him reviled&#xD;
beneath my roof."&#xD;
"Just so, Abel my boy-just so. But if your roof stretched up to Heaven&#xD;
I would say what I say, and that is that Elk is a villain. and-I do not know&#xD;
it, mind you--but Isuppose that you are his dupe."&#xD;
" Sir I"&#xD;
"Oh, rave away; it's the truth for all that. Why, your tell-tale face is&#xD;
quite suflflcient to convince any one that you know it is the truth.. Thefact&#xD;
is, you have been weak enough to forego the purpose which you had when&#xD;
leftyou, and so you are ashamed to look me in the face, because you know&#xD;
that it was an honest-purpose. You wish to get rid of me. You would rather&#xD;
not see 'me any more, I know it. I have committed the great crime of stand-&#xD;
ing between a weak mind and its follies and impulses, and so I am no longer&#xD;
welcome. Come now, you know that is, the truth)'&#xD;
w" Sir,' cried Abel," good morning., You shall heir from me."&#xD;
"Do you mean a challenge'? because if you do, I-won't fight."&#xD;
"You won't fight, sir'?"&#xD;
"Oh dear no. I will send the communication to Hampstead, my dear Abel,&#xD;
with an 'urgent request that Sir John Morton will provide you with a strait-&#xD;
waistcoat as soon as possible. and have your head shaved. But come. nnr,&#xD;
Abel, I like you after all."&#xD;
"Go to the devil, sir !"&#xD;
"I won't-I'll see you further, first ; but I want to save you from going&#xD;
there. I will forgive you now, all the past, if you will start fair again."&#xD;
"Will nothing rid me of your presence, sir. I decline your acquaintance.&#xD;

MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.                       79&#xD;
self-subduing cat walked round him like a property she was pleased to protect,&#xD;
With her tail on end.&#xD;
Abel leant against some iron railings, and burst into tears.&#xD;
Well, that was the crisis, if you like, in the history of Abel Morton.&#xD;
There he was in Bond street still-a few doors only from Oxford street&#xD;
though, and so affected by the earnest beauty of the vision that had thronged&#xD;
to his heart, that he was compelled to-pause upon that spot.&#xD;
And now a troop of good angels should have surrounded him, and withsmiles&#xD;
and gentle ministerings urged him on. Perhaps amid the dim shadows around&#xD;
him they were beginning to collect. Who shall say no to that,? k Whowill&#xD;
take upon him to thrust from his heart such guileless beings? Perhaps their&#xD;
purer essence though, after all, could not bear the jar and trouble of the great&#xD;
world ; and so, when there came a horse with a light-built cab with a dash to&#xD;
the curb-stone, and when a voice cried out-." Morton, as I live !" they lied.&#xD;
Abel looked up.&#xD;
Colonel E!k was there, stretching his gloved hand out of the cab to greet&#xD;
Morton. The tall horse was chafing the bit, and stamping upon the curb of&#xD;
the pavement. The little tiger was holding on behind as though his life depen-&#xD;
ded upon the frantic character of his clutch-and so it did.&#xD;
"Why, Abel, my boy, this is a treat."&#xD;
"No, no," said Abel.&#xD;
" Yes ; but I say it is. I was afraid of being late home for our appointment&#xD;
and here I meet you en route."&#xD;
" No-no ! Oh God, no !"&#xD;
"Why, what's the matter, Abel ?"&#xD;
" Nothing-nothing ! Oh, leave me, Colonel Elk. Leave me now, Ibeseech&#xD;
you, I implore you !"&#xD;
"Well, as you please. Here is a note that was sent to my place ibr you&#xD;
from the Dandoloski, She thought it safer t send it through me. It is an&#xD;
acceptance of your kind offer. Eh ? my boy, ou are a lucky one. But come,&#xD;
get into the cab. All's right, Abel. I can mnage the cash affairs easily, and&#xD;
all will be well."&#xD;
"No, Colonel Elk, I am going home."&#xD;
"Very good ; we will have a cool night of it in your chambers."&#xD;
"I am going to Hanipstead."&#xD;
"To the Home Office ?"&#xD;
"To my father's house, Colonel Elk."&#xD;
"Well, no living being has a right to-But stop-a little closer, Abel. My&#xD;
lad has ears, and I don't want him to know all your affairs. Step into the&#xD;
cab, and I will speak to you. Nay, I will expedite you on your route, if&#xD;
you will have it so. The horse is fresh, and a few miles to the north will do&#xD;
him no harm."&#xD;
Abel had a bewildering doubt, but he did get into the cab, and the colonel,&#xD;
true to his word, set off at a trot to the north.&#xD;
" Now, Abel," he said, "have you made up your mind to go home?"&#xD;
"I have."&#xD;
"And to give up the town, and the town friends?"&#xD;
Abel muttered something about being always delighted to see the colonel,&#xD;
to which that patient individual replied by merely saying, with an emphasis,&#xD;
" Stuff l"&#xD;
"I feel that I have at length made a right determination," said Abel. "That&#xD;
is a feeling that I have no doubt about."&#xD;
"Right or wrong, Morton, it is your business and no one else's, y good&#xD;
fellows it would be taking a very great liberty indeed, for any one to tell you&#xD;
you were a geose.&#xD;
"It would, Colonel Elk. I assure you, sir, that I should feel myself bound&#xD;
to resent such a liberty."&#xD;
"Very good,". added the colonel, "I may have my opinion, but that, Ipre-&#xD;

Abel, and he fainted and slipped off the seat of the cab downsto the floor of&#xD;
it, and there lay, dead to all the world and its gossips.&#xD;
"Morton-Morton! By Jove, he has fainted !--.Ah!"&#xD;
The colonel slowly and carefully turned the horse's head towards town&#xD;
again. The whip just touched the horse gently on the neck, and as if it had&#xD;
been guided by a flash of fire, the animal crouched for a-moment; ere it darted&#xD;
off at such a trot that it was awful to look at it. The wheels flew round&#xD;
noiselessly-the horse seemed by six inches nearer to the ground than he had&#xD;
been, owing to the length of the stride he made-the tiger's- hat ew ofd and&#xD;
he held on in alarm, with his hair streaming out on end ; and in one quarter&#xD;
of an hour, Colonel Elk got over three miles and a half of ground, and drew&#xD;
up at the door of his own house.&#xD;
A pelting rain was falling at the time, and=the colonel, the moment the&#xD;
door was opened, called out-&#xD;
" Jobus-Jobus !"&#xD;
"Humbly, here, sir," said a voice.&#xD;
"Place a light in the small dining room."&#xD;
"Yes, sir. Oh, dear, yes, in a moment."&#xD;
The colonel took Abel from the cab, and placed him upon his feett He had'&#xD;
partially recovered, and could just walk with help. Jobus lingered to see&#xD;
that it was Abel, ansd then darted up the stairs to obey the order he hads&#xD;
received ; but yet he was not in time.&#xD;
Jobus had just got a lamp partially lighted as the colonel came into the&#xD;
room with Abel, and let the latter fall upon the sofa.&#xD;
"Beast !" cried Elk, "why is the lamp not ready ?"&#xD;
"Humbly,' sir, I didn't know--.-"&#xD;
"Be off with you, idiot !"&#xD;
"Oh, dear, yes, sir, I'll be off with pleasure. Always yours humbly, sir."&#xD;
Colonel Elk caught up a horsewhip that lay across a side-table, and struck&#xD;
Jobus with it, and then fung it after him out to the staircase-landing. Jobus-&#xD;
picked up the whip and hid it beneath his coat.&#xD;
"Wait-wait-wait !" he said. "Oh, wait. The time may come for me..&#xD;
Oh, Jobus, don't now-don't be impatient don't be angry-oh, don't. Be,&#xD;
humble and meek, Jobus, and listen.-Ah !"&#xD;
The door of the room was flung open again, and the colonel cried out,--&#xD;
This lamp has gone out. Jobus-Jobus,'I say ! Curses on him I he has&#xD;
gone off, now, for the night, I shouldn't wonder."&#xD;
Jobus was as flat up against the wall, close to the door, as he could possi2&#xD;
bly b , and the colonel passed him to descend the stairs. Then Jobus, after&#xD;
a moment's thought, stepped into the room,-and got 'under a sofa that was&#xD;
between the windows, and which had a loose Holland cover over it,.reaching&#xD;
to the floor, which effectually concealed him.&#xD;
The colonel 'came up stairs again with a light ; he had found one in they&#xD;
hall. The oaths he uttered, and the threats he pronounced'against both Jobus,&#xD;
and Frogs, were awful to hear. The latter, he knew, was upon his drunken&#xD;
carouse; but the former he expected to have found, although he suspected that&#xD;
he had left the house to recover himself from the blow of the whip&#xD;
The colonel closed and locked the door of the room, and lit the lamp that.&#xD;
was upon the table again. It must have been'some sudden draught thathad&#xD;
Blown it out, for it burnt now quite well enough. The room-was small though,;&#xD;
ahd there was a still and close air in it, which was'farlfrom being favorable&#xD;
to the recovery of Abel; so Elk openedthe Window, and then;he poured out&#xD;
a glass of port wine, and got Abel to swallow it; and the -poor -bewildere&#xD;
wretch looked about him like a man but newly awakened fromsome disas-&#xD;
tfons dream.&#xD;
"Well, how are you now, Morton 7"&#xD;
Abel only shook his head, and murmured something in which Elk detected&#xD;
the word "Home !"&#xD;

HEADS AND HEARTS; OR,&#xD;
Oh, what a demoniac smile crossed his lips for a moment ere he spoke&#xD;
again.&#xD;
"Well, Abel, here we are."&#xD;
"Yes, here-we are"&#xD;
Abel looked about him and shuddered ; and then he said, in a low voice,-&#xD;
'-Five thousand pounds-that is all !"&#xD;
"Yes," said Elk, " that-is all; but it need not matter, that I am aware of,&#xD;
unless you make something of it. Now, Abel, listen to me. You know, as&#xD;
well as I do, for you are a fellow of sense, and sound, good judgment, when&#xD;
you like to use it."&#xD;
Abel felt a little flattered, and the colonel administered another dose.&#xD;
"I say, Abel, you are just the sort of young fellow, with a fresh and vigor-&#xD;
ous intellect, to fight your way through anything, if you like to do it ; but&#xD;
there is the difficulty."&#xD;
"The difficulty ?" said Abel.&#xD;
"Yes. The difficulty is to get you to bring your undoubted abilities to the&#xD;
purpose in view. You know, as well as I do, that it will never do for us to&#xD;
go to Hampstead, and say to your father-' Here we are-'I am coming home;&#xD;
but my friend here must have a cheque for five thousand pounds, and after'&#xD;
that, there are all my debts to pay that you before heard of.'"&#xD;
" Oh, no-no !" shuddered Abel. " It would never do !"&#xD;
"Of course it wouldn't. When you will but condescend to think, there is&#xD;
no one in all the world comes to a more correct conclusion than you do, Abel&#xD;
-but there is no getting you to think at times. I tell you, my boy, there is&#xD;
no reason on earth why we should not fight through the matter, and especi-&#xD;
ally without letting your friends know anything of it. That is the great&#xD;
point."&#xD;
"Oh, yes; that is the great goint."&#xD;
Abel took the wine that Elk placed before him.&#xD;
"Your father is old ; and why, in the name of all that's good, should the&#xD;
remainder of his life be embittered about these pecuniary affairs?  A bold,&#xD;
brave young spirit like yours should stand between the old man and such&#xD;
affairs. If you go to him, you must go with your lips sealed, as regards'&#xD;
these matters, and with a feeling in your own mind, that you have really and&#xD;
truly settled them."&#xD;
"Settled them ?"&#xD;
"Yes, to be sure ; did I not tell you that I had thought of a way of doing&#xD;
it?"&#xD;
"You did ; but-how is it possible ?"&#xD;
"That is the point, my dear Abel. But are you better now than you were?&#xD;
Don't drink without eating something. There are biscuits-although the wine&#xD;
is too good to hurt you; but how do you feel ?"&#xD;
"-Wonderfully better."&#xD;
"Very well. Don't turn round to-morrow, now, and say that you were&#xD;
coaxed and persuaded, and all that sort of thing. If you still wish to go home,&#xD;
say so."&#xD;
"Oh no-no! You said five thousand pounds ?"&#xD;
"I did."&#xD;
"Then I have no wish to go home."&#xD;
The tone of voice in which poor Abel spoke, ought to have melted a heart&#xD;
of stone; but the colonel's coolness was.a great deal harder than any stone&#xD;
could possibly be. And now Elk's conduct became very mysterious, indeed.&#xD;
He crept to the door of the room, and unlocking it, he looked out, and lis-&#xD;
tened. All was profoundly still. Then closing and locking the door again,&#xD;
he drew his chair close to the table, upon the other -side of which, corner-&#xD;
wise, and facing the colonel, was Abel, and he spoke in a low, confidential tone&#xD;
of voice, little dreaming that Jobus was under the sofa.&#xD;
"Abel," said Elk, "I have given much attention to the subject of our joint&#xD;
difficulties, an4 I find that your name is a good one."&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.&#xD;
&#xD;
83&#xD;
&#xD;
"A good one ?"&#xD;
"Yes. I see you don't understand me, Abel Morton ; allow me to explains&#xD;
The money lenders have no aversion to your name, you comprehend ?"&#xD;
"Oh ges. Ah, to be sure."&#xD;
"Well, Abel, I propose raising the sum of five thousand pounds. Don't shake&#xD;
your head, old fellow; I am not going to pocket it. Never mind the play debts.&#xD;
Let them wait. What I want to do, is te get you clear of all those trades-&#xD;
men, who are plaguing your life out, and to place in your hands funds to go&#xD;
on with."&#xD;
"Yes, I see."&#xD;
" Well, Abel--your name is Abel?"&#xD;
"uWhy, yes, I suppose it is, colonel."&#xD;
"We will take it for granted that your name is Abel. Your father's name&#xD;
is John, I believe ?"&#xD;
' Yes,"&#xD;
"How old is the governor ?"&#xD;
"I think about fifty-eight."&#xD;
"Oh, well, he can't last very long, at all events."&#xD;
"Colonel 111k, 1---"&#xD;
"Oh, come now, don't get into a passion, my dear fellow. This is business.&#xD;
and when I speak in this way, I don't mean any disrespect to your father,&#xD;
any more than an insurance office would, in making inquiries concerning his&#xD;
health, before granting a policy on his life; but you are so hasty. Now, as I&#xD;

much better on the face of a bill, that---"&#xD;
" What ? Good God, what ?"&#xD;
"I advise you to accept for five thousand pounds in the name of John!"&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
.   AT the very communication of this terrible and criminal project from the&#xD;
colonel, Abel started to his feet aghast, and shook in every limb.&#xD;
"Gracious Heaven !" cried Abel, "is it possible that to me you could make&#xD;
such a hideous proposition, Colonel Elk? You are joking. surely ?"&#xD;
"I don't see any joke in it," said Elk, drily.&#xD;
"Joke, sir?  No, there is no joke in it; but I mean that it is quite impos-&#xD;
Bible that you can be serious in making such a proposition to me."&#xD;
Very gobd.'&#xD;
This imperturbable coolness upon the part of Elk had all its effect upon Abel&#xD;
Morton. He found it something impossible to speak passionately to a man&#xD;
who looked so calm and collected, and he sunk .back into his seat again, say.-&#xD;
ing, as he did so-&#xD;
"No-no, you did not mean it. You could not mean that. That was not&#xD;
the scheme that was to snatch me from embarrassment. You have only enun-&#xD;
eiated such a proposal to try me, colonel."&#xD;
The colonel replied by a shrug of his shoulders, and an elevation of the&#xD;
eyebrows.&#xD;
"It is forgery," added Abel. "Rank, deliberate, villanous forgery, I tell&#xD;
you, Elk."&#xD;
"Don't be violent, my boy. I know it."&#xD;
"And yet you-you-that is--that is, you thought-you still think that I&#xD;
--that it would be a means--"&#xD;
"Abel," said Colonel Elk, as he coolly lit a cigar, without showing the&#xD;
least tremor of a nerve. "Abel Morton, I enunciated to you a proposition, in&#xD;
which I am quite serious. At the first flash of it, without hearing anything&#xD;
about it, or of the feasibilities, or advantages, or safety, you fly off at a tan-&#xD;
gent, and get alarmed; so let it drop."&#xD;
Well, but-but--"&#xD;

&#xD;
"If my explanations which I intended to give to you are not desired, we&#xD;
will say no more about it, Morton ; and in that case, why, the most manly&#xD;
thing you can do, is to pass your life in a debtors' prison."'&#xD;
"Oh. no-no !"&#xD;
"Well, I thought you had decided against going with me to Ilampstead ?"&#xD;
Abet wipced again, at this, .while every particle of color for a moment left&#xD;
his face, and then the hot blood came slowly back again, until his highly&#xD;
heightened color showed the state of agitation he was in ;-he at last said,&#xD;
"Well, there can be no harm in listening to what you were going to say.&#xD;
I do not commit myself by that, colonel. Go on-I will hear-all."&#xD;
There was a slight twitching of the eyes of Colonel Elk at these words F:om&#xD;
poor Abel ; and a more than common compression of the lips, for from that&#xD;
mpy cpt he made sure of his victim.&#xD;
"' Since you have a desire to know what I have to say in defence, or rather&#xD;
in explanation of the proposition which I have made to you. I would not&#xD;
shrink from given you that further proof of my confidence. You are in those&#xD;
desperate' circumstances which -require desperate remedies, Morton ; but, for-&#xD;
tunately, the one I propose to you is not desperate at all. It simply points&#xD;
out a means by which you may safely extricate yourself from your difficul-&#xD;
ties."&#xD;
"Safely ?" gasped Abel.&#xD;
"Yes; the word rather surprises you, I see; but I say safely, and I mean&#xD;
it. I will now explain to you how. If you were to put your name to bills,&#xD;
no One would cash them. because it is well known, or it would be well known&#xD;
upon inquiry, that you had nothing, but were even dependent upon your&#xD;
father's good opinion for your future prospects. He may leave you the bulk&#xD;
of his fortune, or a bare subsistence, or nothing."&#xD;
"Or nothing," repeated Abel..                         '&#xD;
"Well, such being the case, everything connected with your future pros-&#xD;
pects depends upon the sort of estimation in which you are held at home. I&#xD;
need not point out to you, Abel, that if you go with me to your father, and&#xD;
ask him for a cheque-to pay me and others, you are lost forever in his opin-&#xD;
ion.&#xD;
"Go on-go on&#xD;
"Therefore," added the colonel-and he placed a great stress upon the&#xD;
word therefore, as if the consequences were quite cldar-" therefore, you will,&#xD;
by agreeing to this little plan of mine, be serving yourself in the end, and not&#xD;
losing character with the home authorities. Now, the plan is simply this:7&#xD;
If your father don't think very ill of you, he will leave you the bulk of his&#xD;
cash, since he has but you to provide for. An annuity to your mother, should&#xD;
she outlive him, and something to Emma, will'be the only drawbacks upon&#xD;
your enjoying all he possesses.".&#xD;
" Well," said Abel, half choking, as his mother and Emma were thus spo-&#xD;
ken of-" Well, what then ?"&#xD;
"Why, of course, you will eventually marry Emma, so that part of the&#xD;
affair will he no hindrance ; and even if your mother were left, solely depend-&#xD;
ant upon your affection, I know, Abel, that she would lead the life of an em-&#xD;
press if you had the means in'your power."&#xD;
This was a cunning piece of flattery to the affections of Abel, and the colonel&#xD;
saw it in a moment.&#xD;
"By signing your father's name to bills for a considerable amount," he said,&#xD;
".you will :soon be put into possession of cash to such a figure as will snake&#xD;
all your difficulties vanish unto thin air at once. I can and will get the money&#xD;
for the acceptances, inisuch a quarter that they will never see the light, and&#xD;
it is really impossible that your father should ever hear of their existence;&#xD;
and before each of the bills becomes due we will see the party holding it, and&#xD;
substitute another for it, paying the interest for the amount, and so let the&#xD;
affair go on till you are in possession of the property which will be yours&#xD;
assuredly, and then you can pay them all of at once inan hour."&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHER! THE COLONEL.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
Abel looked bewildered and shocked.&#xD;
"Now for the advantages," added the colonel. "You get rid of all your&#xD;
debts at once. You are able to go on in the course ofenjoyment which your&#xD;
fine intellect and keen perceptions so eminently lit you for. You are able to&#xD;
go to Hampstead, and make your peace there,'saying that you  have yourself&#xD;
arranged all your debts, and have nothing but his love to ask of your father,&#xD;
and you are at once, then, on the best te ms with cousinEmma. These -are&#xD;
the results, Abel."&#xD;
"Oh, if I could only be sure of all that !"-&#xD;
"Come, now, where is the difficulty ?"&#xD;
"Discovery !"&#xD;
The colonel smiled.&#xD;
"If that be all," he said, "you may banish such a thought from your mind,&#xD;
Morton. First of all, it is quite out of the question that any suspicion should&#xD;
arise concerning the genuineness of the signature to the bills; and if it did,&#xD;
the parties among whom it would rise, would be the very'ones whose inter-&#xD;
est would be most endangered by a discovery."&#xD;
"Do you think so 7"&#xD;
"No-'-i know so. I tell you, Abel, that if you like to do it, the thing is as&#xD;
safe as sitting here."&#xD;
" Oh, colonel, if you should be mistaken-if you'should be too sanguine&#xD;
about this affair-i--"&#xD;
"I am not the likely man, Abel."&#xD;
'' I have stooped to folly, but not yet to guilt #"&#xD;
r' Psha ! Now, consider how you spare the feelings of your father by this&#xD;
little ruse. Will it not be delightful to you to know that he is passing the&#xD;
few remaining years he has to live in serenity, rather than in disquiet con-&#xD;
cerning you ?  Oh, Abel, filial affection ought to protipt you ?"&#xD;
Abel shuddered.&#xD;
"Besides," continued the colonel, "who do you wrong in the transaction '&#xD;
No' one. Into whose pocket do you ultimately dip'your hand? 'Why, your&#xD;
own. In fact, the whole transac ipn ine'ans nothing' more nor less than an-&#xD;
ticipating, in a great emergency, some of 'that °forttlne which will be yours in&#xD;
the time to come. But you know, Abel, that a guinea when you want it is&#xD;
Worth. ten" when you don't. Of' ourse, pay-day m1ust come. It generally&#xD;
does come sooner or later, always; in a commercial country likethis; but&#xD;
you are willing, and you will be i'eady to'pay."&#xD;
"Oh, yes, that is'clear enough."&#xD;
"Well, then, is there any other objection, Abel?"&#xD;
"Nothing but that the deed'itself is criminal, and that by 'ome unforeseen&#xD;
accident it may be'discovered.&#xD;
"That is a fear that besets all enterprises; Abel. 'Yonu haveaminind able to&#xD;
judge for yourself. I can but, as a tan of'thOWorid, whw has:seen a great&#xD;
deal of it, give my opinion-and that is that no posible ccha ,ezists by&#xD;
wieb you may be'harmed' in the transaction. Itsehmr td me to-be full to&#xD;

" Then you' nistake it very much, Abel. It is your'esoi whichis  be-&#xD;

is always the case with fine intellects like yours."&#xD;
'No-no!"&#xD;
"  Oh, but I say yes. I have seen too many 'cases, not to be a judge of them&#xD;
by this time, Abel. Come, now-all you have to do, my good fellow, is to&#xD;

position of debt, danger, and difficulty, to one of ease, affluence, and joy.&#xD;
Then, there is the Dandoloski your own. There is the London season, with&#xD;
all its delights, just beginning, and the universal cry is-'- Where is Morton?&#xD;
Will he be the hero of the season, or is he going to skulk away with scorched&#xD;
pinions, and be heard of no more'? Is he to show himself a man, or to be&#xD;
considered a boy, who only for a brief space escaped from school, and then&#xD;
was caughtabecause he got a few hundred pounds intordebt, and was taken&#xD;
back again?' Come-come, you laugh at all that.&#xD;
"I do, colonel. They shall find I aig no boy."&#xD;
"Of course not. The intimate friend of Colonel Elk, I think, might be some-&#xD;
body in the gay world of fashion, even if he were not Abel ofthoems whose&#xD;
career, from his own style and intellect, is calculated to be oeo h  otbi-&#xD;
liant upon record. I can tell you, Abel, that if you do retire from life there is&#xD;
not a few who will be devilish glad of it."a&#xD;
" Glad of it ! How so ?"&#xD;
becausee they will not have your rivalry to dread. I would just ask you&#xD;
candidly, putting all self out of the question, how are such fellows as Lord&#xD;
Rokeley and Captain Lorrinet, and a host of others I could name to you, to&#xD;
stand up against you and your capabilities ?"&#xD;
-"Well I-you flatter me, colonel."&#xD;
' I flatter?  You don't know me, Abel, yet, or you would not say that'?"&#xD;
"Well, don't be offended."&#xD;
"Not at all. I am, to tell'the truth, rather a cynic. Take another glass of&#xD;
wine. Thank you, I can reach the decanter myself. Here's to Dandoloski,&#xD;
Abel, and may her smiles never want the sunshine of preference from you.".&#xD;
"Thank you. She is a fine creature."&#xD;
iie"Well, I never saw her equal."~&#xD;
"Nor ever will, my boy. Here are some slips, you see--just reach that pee,&#xD;
you see, on the side-table."&#xD;
Abel did so with trembling hands ; and the colonel, from the depth of a&#xD;
very large pocket-book that he had with him, took out five slips of paper, and&#xD;
spread them out upon the table before Abel.&#xD;
"Theseematters are easily managed," he said. "Suppose we make them for&#xD;
two thousand pounds each, and that will spare 'a deal of trouble, you know.&#xD;
We will make them due respectively one month after each other. It will just&#xD;
look like a ready and common mode of raising ten thousand pounds, that is all,&#xD;
Morton, and nobody will think anything of it. You know I will cash the first&#xD;
one without saying anything of the others ; and then produce them, old fel-&#xD;
low, as we happen to want them. Who knows hut that some slice of luck n&#xD;
play may enable us to pay them off, and be done, with them'? I say we,&#xD;
because, from this timeI look upon itthat our interests are identical, Abel;&#xD;
and if I  have any good luck, I will take care that you share it."&#xD;
The colonel stretched his hand over the table as' he spoke, and shook hands&#xD;
with Abel. Poor Abel's hand was as cold as if death had struck it.&#xD;
"More wine," cried Elk, as he filled Abel's glass, for he saw the state in&#xD;
which his victim was.&#xD;
"Yes; I am rather cold. I will take more wine, colonel. It is good wine."&#xD;
"None better. And now to business."&#xD;
Morton's very lipsshook as he looked at the slips of paper, with the omi-.&#xD;
nous-looking stamps in one corner of each of them. If they had been death-&#xD;
warrants, each of them to be filled up with his name, in case one should fail&#xD;
from any informality, he could not have gazed upon them with more shrink-&#xD;
ing dread.&#xD;
"I have not consented." he said-" surely I have not consented ?n&#xD;
"Consented, my dear fellow?  What do you mean&#xD;
"I mean, that surely I-I-that is, I did not say that I would do it?"&#xD;
"If you did, it don't matter; for you can draw back easily enough, and leave&#xD;
it alone. Why, my good friend, if you don't like a thing that is so easy, so&#xD;
&#xD;
C'&#xD;
&#xD;
SpT&#xD;
&#xD;
safe, so really kind to your father--for it eases his mind, and takes nothing&#xD;
from him--you need not do it."$&#xD;
"That is a relief."&#xD;
"Edxactly; so you know quite well, my dear fellow, what must be done in-&#xD;
stead, that is all. You value, or you do not value the peace, the calm serenity&#xD;
of your father's last days-you do not value, or you do, the quiet serenity f-&#xD;
your mothers evening of life-you do no value, or you do, the love ofhat&#xD;
cousin, with the sparkling eyes-for T know she has such;: but if you do, Abel,&#xD;
you will spare them all, by adopting this little bit of finesse, which will enable&#xD;
you to laugh at fate."&#xD;
"But, Colonel Elk, once more let me entreat' you to pause. Is there -n&#xD;
dishonor in this course '?"                                       n&#xD;
"Dishonor'? Do you think that I would give up  my position in society, or&#xD;
even jeopardise it to clear you of a few difficulties? No, Abel ; I don't mean&#xD;
to say but that I have all the wish in the world to do all I can for you-I&#xD;
don't mean todsay but that you-are a fellow after my own heart;but I cannot&#xD;
commit a kind of moral suicide for you."&#xD;
"Then you really, from your soul, think that if I sign those bills in my&#xD;
father's name there is absolute safety'"&#xD;
"As absolute 'as the world can make it. I repeat, situated as you are, it is&#xD;
a duty. Now, there was the Marquis of Deuceace: he enjoyed one half of his&#xD;
patrimony in the sane way, before he became Duke of Swindelham."&#xD;
"Did he really'?"&#xD;
." To be sure he did.-Well how do you feel -now'7"&#xD;
bBetter--I--think-that is--I feel as if I were really inclined to draw' the&#xD;
bills.",&#xD;
"Accept them, you mean, old fellow. I will draw them. Come, is it all&#xD;
right?2"&#xD;
" Yes-yes ! How close the room is, though. But it's all right, colonel. It's&#xD;
as you say; the only course. I will do it !'&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
COLONEL ELK took one of the blank stamps, and wrote those fearful words&#xD;
that have made many a cheek blanch to look upon--those words which in&#xD;
their results, have beggared the proud, rich man-have made the poor desti..&#xD;
tute--words, which have turned the widow and the fatherless out of house&#xD;
and home to perish-words which, in time gone past, have strangled wretches&#xD;
at the Old Bailey-words,. which now float about the brains of' needy. strug-&#xD;
gling tradesmen, like hideous gnomes, gibing them to despair-words which&#xD;
have strained the trembling hand to the throat of the suicide-words which&#xD;
it i well for men to look keenly at, and to ponder upon ere they endorse !&#xD;

Then, hearing the sound of the colonel's returning footsteps, he, pulled his                "Very likely. Take a seat old fe&#xD;

ter,'that Jobus felt the blood retreat from his heart with a strange gush as               a     coloe      One hound,&#xD;
he heard it.&#xD;
"Why, it's done !" said Elk. " It's all as good as done, now. Brother-                   "Oh-oh      I onish I had it."&#xD;

Awitha bang that shook the whole house.                                                    "Very good. As you have been&#xD;

Jobus crept from the room and down the stairs, at a slow pace; and when&#xD;
he was nearly in the passage, there came a sullen dab at the street-door.                  The two Jews made some telegr&#xD;
"Frogs, for a thousand pounds !" cried Jobus, as he opened it, and his fel-              "ou touhdrae      to tadeany&#xD;
low servant fell right in, and lay insensible from'drink in the passage.&#xD;
" Ah !" said Jobus, as he closed the door again. "He's come home, has he?              suppose .&#xD;
I'm afraid the bottle is Frogs's little failing. Dear me.                                  "O    -n very w er ol  w&#xD;

&#xD;
"Very good. I drew this bill. and Abel Morton took it away, and brought&#xD;
it back to me in three hours, accepted. There it is."&#xD;
The colonel threw the bill before the Israelites, and Mr. Lyon took out of&#xD;
his pocket a greasy cheque-book, and gave a draft for five hundred pounds,&#xD;
upon a banking-house in Chancery Lane, which does not disdain to keep the&#xD;
accounts of such worthies.&#xD;
"That will do," said Elk. "I am rather short of tin now ; but you know&#xD;
where to find meat an time."&#xD;
"Oh, yesh, colonesh-oh yesh. It is all right, no doubt."&#xD;
The colonel left Mr. Lyon's premises with the five hundred pound cheque&#xD;
in his pocket, and went direct to the banking-house, where he procured notes&#xD;
and gold to the amount. After that he made his way to the chambers of&#xD;
Abel Morton in the Albany.&#xD;
It would be vain to attempt to describe the state of Abel during the night&#xD;
after he had left Elk's house. Half maddened by conflicting sensations, poor&#xD;
Abel paced his room to and fro, looking for the daylight ; and when it cane&#xD;
he fancied that he could sleep, and he fell into a strange and fitful slumber on&#xD;
a sofa.&#xD;
"Colonel Elk, sir," said Rowley, close to his master's ear, for he had made&#xD;
some half-dozen attempts to arouse him. "Colonel Elk, sir."&#xD;
Morton sprang to his feet.&#xD;
"No-no !"'he said. "Destroy it ! I did not do it! Help !"&#xD;
" Lor, sir, it's only the colonel."&#xD;
Abel'sunk back again. His eyes met those of Elk, who had glided into the&#xD;
room, and who shook his head at him over Rowley's shoulder. -&#xD;
"Oh, colonel how are you ?"&#xD;
Poor Abel looked like as malefactor in the presence of the executioner, and&#xD;
when Rowley had left the room, he glanced at Elk as though hewould look&#xD;
into his very soul.&#xD;
"Well, Abel," said Elk, "it is all right."&#xD;
"Right ?"&#xD;
"Yes, to be sure. Here is the money, and I may congratulate you upon the&#xD;
profound safety of the transaction, as the bill is in the bands of the highest&#xD;
Character. In fact, there is no calculating the nice sense of honor of those who&#xD;
hold it. By-the-by, as you never had a cab of your own, and it is a thing&#xD;
you ought to have, for it is not up to the mark to hire one, I have given an&#xD;
order for a nice set-out for you. Only two hundred pounds in all. It will be&#xD;
at the door in half an hour. Then the Dandoloski is delighted, and says that&#xD;
you must drive with her to-day. Your infernal creditors shall all have their&#xD;
mouths stopped. We will arrange our series of fetes for the week to come,&#xD;
and you will be the happiest dog alive; and all so safe, too, that you need not&#xD;
give a thought to the morrow."&#xD;
Now, Morton was not the strongest minded person in the world, as the&#xD;
reader well knows ; and during the speech of the colonel he had, as it were,&#xD;
rocked to and fro in his distraction, and at its conclusion he knew not what&#xD;
to say or to do. There were many advantages enumerated by the colonel--&#xD;
there was money before him-there was the assurance of positive safety; and,&#xD;
lastly, there was the fact that the bill was actually parted with.&#xD;
"Well," said the colonel, "why don't you laugh ?"  ,&#xD;
"Laugh ?"&#xD;
"Yes. They who win ought to laugh ; and Fortune and you, I take it, have&#xD;
played a game in which you have come off the winner. Is it not so?  Have&#xD;
you not beaten the slippery goddess? To be sure you have. Come, Abel,&#xD;
this whole matter just resolves itself to this-you are afraid that the bill will&#xD;
be found out to be a-a----"&#xD;
"Oh, hush '"&#xD;
"Well, well--there is no occasion to say it. Language is given us to express&#xD;
ideas; and if we have the ideas without the language, we may as well hold&#xD;
&#xD;
MY NROTHN4l~    Tt!N COLON2Lt.&#xD;
ouir tangues. I say, then, you are afraid of a discovery, that is all Abel; and&#xD;
I tell you t'banish that from your mind, and not be under the smallest&#xD;
apprehension that your father will have to pay the bill to save you from a pro-&#xD;
gecution."&#xD;
Abel started to his feet. That was the first time such a'view of the 'dae&#xD;
had ever occurred to him.&#xD;
"What's the matter ?" said the colonel.&#xD;
"I did not think of that.rIt never struck me that, in the event of a dis&#xD;
Otvery, that W'ould be the result."                    eeto      i.&#xD;
"Why, where were your wits, Abel?  You did not suppose, did you, now,&#xD;
that if the worst case to the worst, your father would prosecute you for using&#xD;
his name-did you.we&#xD;
"hush !-speak low. No: he could not-he would not. I did not think&#xD;
of that ; it did not strike me."&#xD;
"Well, this is good," said the colonel. "Why, Abel, I do believe you have&#xD;
had the Old Bailey in your mind's eye. Ho! ho ! The worst that can po..&#xD;
sibly come of the whole afihir (and that is almost an impossible contingency)&#xD;
is,. that the old man would have to pay the bill. That's the very worst that&#xD;
could happen ; and I don't know, Abel, but that the chance of that is bettr&#xD;
than the certainty of the disgrace and the horror of goinghome'and telling all,&#xD;
now."&#xD;
"Peace'!" said Abel--" Oh, peace ! Colonel Elk, I will no longer talk of&#xD;
home-I will no longer think of home. The deed is done, and so far it ispast&#xD;
regret. I will tl'y, by plunging into the vortex of pleasure, to drown all recol-&#xD;
lection of it. Since the means of raising money does presentitself to my grasp,&#xD;
I will avail myself of it. I will be all that I can be with extended resowces,&#xD;
and with youth and the love of delights that with me shall know no change,&#xD;
I will revel in the smiles of beauty-I will drink deep of the wine cUp.&#xD;
fusic with its thousand witcheries, shall awaken the'echoes of my soul; and&#xD;
then, if fall I must, as some day haply I shall, I will yet fall in glittering frag-&#xD;
ments !&#xD;
"Bravo !" said the colonel.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
Wnmrt Jobus opened the door of Colonel Elk's house to let in his fello .o&#xD;
laborer in the vineyard of Elk's wickedness, Frogs, he hardly expected to hd&#xD;
him so far gone as he was.&#xD;
" Ah," said Jobus. "Here you are, just like a pig. Get up, will you?"&#xD;
.Go'to the devil !" said Frogs.&#xD;
Jobus shook his head, declining the proposition, and then he stood for some&#xD;
few minutes in deep thought.&#xD;
"Oh, if I could only get Frogs now," he said, "to help me, sorely something&#xD;
might be done by two worms-surely it might. But dare I mention it to him&#xD;
-dare I ask him?   Oh dear-oh dear ! What a thing it is to be so dread-&#xD;
fully drunk as this Frogs delights in being! lie is a very bad man-oh, ver&#xD;
bad, indeed. And yet-and yet he is human, and he cannot love Elk or Elks&#xD;
service: for what does he get by either ?-Blows-oaths--threats. Ah, deai&#xD;
me ! that's what he gets. Now, if I could only venture upon saying to him,&#xD;
Oh, Frogs, let us try and do what is right-let us save the innocent,? what a&#xD;

"Eh?   What do you say'? Surely he means half-and-half and a screw&#xD;
of tobacco, only he puts it so oddly together. I'll try him with a little cold&#xD;
water."&#xD;
Jobus crept down stairs and brought up a jug of cold water which he fill..&#xD;
ed Frogs's hat with; and then, as that gentleman sat up, with his back against&#xD;
the wall with tipsy gravity, Jobus suddenly clapped his hat on his head.&#xD;
"It rains," said Frogs.&#xD;
"A little," said Jobus. "How are you now ?"&#xD;
Frogs sneezed twice or thrice, and then he managed to get to his feet and&#xD;
staggering into one of the parlors, he flung himself on to a sofa and fell asleep.&#xD;
It was a weary time that poor Jobus had there to wait for the awakening&#xD;
txf Frogs. The colonel was out the whole of the night at the gaming-table;&#xD;
and even when the faint light of early dawn began to peep in at the half&#xD;
closed shutters, he had not come home. But Frogs began to babble of past&#xD;
events in his sleep.&#xD;
"No-no !" he said-" no, I say ! You shall not do it Stevens. No ! The&#xD;
curse of the innocent blood will cling to you, I say ! Give me up will you -&#xD;
Hal! ha ! Give yourself up for the murder, i'f you like ! Ha ! ha ! Oh, God,&#xD;
I can see a child's hand through the red flames !"&#xD;
"Oh, dear," said Jobus, "what worms we areas"&#xD;
"Yes-yes, I say ; the fire is too hot !" cried out Frogs. "I did not light&#xD;
it ! You did that, fiend that you are ! Why should I save you?  We are&#xD;
both guilty'!-both-both !"&#xD;
"Frogs ?" said Jobus.&#xD;
"Yes," replied Frogs, still in his sleep.. "Oh, yes."&#xD;
"What are you talking about ?"&#xD;
"Why, the fire in Calcutta, to be sure. They all perished-all-all I say!&#xD;
And yet the one man escped whom I wished-to burn. Yes, I wished it as&#xD;
well as Stevens! He was hunted by the colonel."&#xD;
"What colonel?"&#xD;
"Morton, now Sir John, you know."&#xD;
"The Lord have mercy upon us !" said Jobus, "and he is answering all this&#xD;
in his sleep. Oh, dear-oh, dear ! Frogs !"&#xD;
"Well, what now?  Don't talk to me of this. To be sure, my own child&#xD;
would scorn me now ; and I dare not look-at her ! Oh, God, no ! And yet&#xD;
I did, only yesterday, peep. through the old hedge, and I saw her. She&#xD;
screamed, and the people came out to chase the tramp-yes, that was what&#xD;
they called me, the tramp-from the door."&#xD;
Jobus crept to the feet of Frogs, and looked at his boots.&#xD;
"Ah !".he said, "the worm knows the look of London mud from soil off&#xD;
the country roads. Frogs has been out of town. -Oh, dear, me! Frogs -"&#xD;
"Well, go on ! What now'?"&#xD;
"Who is Stevens ?"&#xD;
"Ha !-ha! You know, don't you, reverend sir ?"&#xD;
"Oh, Lord ! he calls me a reverend sir. No, I don't; and, besides, if I do,&#xD;
you must declare it to me, you know."&#xD;
"And you promise, then, to save my life ?"&#xD;
"To be sure," said Jobus.&#xD;
"Well, then, of course, Elk is Stevens-Lieutenant Stevens, of the Bombay&#xD;
Artillery, you know ?"&#xD;
"Oh, dear, you don't say so'? And how old is your child, Frogs, now?"&#xD;
"Oh, God, why do you talk of her? She is-is mine-my only one. I&#xD;
killed her mother, you know ?"-        -&#xD;
"Oh, no, no!"'&#xD;
" Not by a blow. I did it by degrees. I broke her heart ; and my little&#xD;
Lucy is now thirteen. Has.the reprieve come yet?  Oh, then, the hangman&#xD;
stares at me, and points at the rope. No, no ! I say, I did not do it all&#xD;
alone ! Save me! Oh, God help me, now! The fire is in my blood ! my&#xD;
brain bubbles ! Ha, ha ! Murder !"&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.&#xD;
With a yell, he sprang to his feet, and looked around him. Johns had&#xD;
made a dart from the room, so Frogs fo ad himself alone.&#xD;
"Where am I?    Where'?  Oh at ho    ! Home! No! I won't call it&#xD;
that ! Where is the crowd, and the hangman, and the gallows?  Nowhere ?&#xD;
Was it only a dream after all-only a horrid dream?  Gracious Heaven  I&#xD;
thought that I confessed all to the clergyman at the foot of the scaffold; and&#xD;
that he promised me a reprieve if I did so; and now it is all a dream ! Well,&#xD;
that is as good as a reprieve of itself ! How ill " feel 1"&#xD;
Jobus tapped at the door.&#xD;
" Who's..tat4- Who's that?"&#xD;
"Only me," said Jobus. "How are you now, Frogs?  You qame in a lit-&#xD;
tle time ago and laid yourself down there, and I thought I would come to see&#xD;
how you were, you know. Well, are you all right ?"&#xD;
"Be off with you. Go to the deuce. Where's the colonel ?"&#xD;
"Gone out, Frogs. Oh, Frogs, I want to speak to you."&#xD;
"Speak away, then. I'm parched, and nearly mad. What is it, idiot ?"&#xD;
"My good friend-."&#xD;
"It's a lie. I'm not your good friend, nor any one else's. I never was a&#xD;
good friend but to the devil, and he isn't at all grateful, as he ought to be."&#xD;
"Very likely not, Frogs. He hasn't I believe, the reputation of being so.&#xD;
But I want you to listen to me for a little while, Frogs. Don't it strike you&#xD;
that we have served this Elk long enough ?"&#xD;
"El ?"&#xD;
"I say, don't it strike you that we have served thi Elk long enough?&#xD;
What do we get by it, good Frogs?"&#xD;
"What do you get by it, you mean ?"&#xD;
"And you ?"&#xD;
"Well, you get safety. He told me you had done something."&#xD;
Jobus's face flushed, and he let his head drop into his hands, as he uttered&#xD;
a deep groan.&#xD;
"He told me you had done something, and that he knew it," added Frogs,&#xD;
u and that was why secresy and a home were all the world to you; and as&#xD;
for me, I don't mind owning, that I am'pretty much in the same predicament.&#xD;
Jobs looked up, and then he crept closer to Frogs, and laying his hand&#xD;
upon his arm, he said, in a low tone, broken by emotion-&#xD;
"Frogs, there is a future even in this world, for every wretch who has but&#xD;
one day between him and eternity. We may have many days."&#xD;
"What do you mean ?"&#xD;
"I mean, that you and I may yet do something, that may have the effect&#xD;
of reinstating us in the opinion of the world, and in our own opinion, which-&#xD;
is of more importance still."&#xD;
"Stuff!"&#xD;
"Well, I am a poor forlorn creature. There is no one in all the wide world&#xD;
who can claim kindred to me. I am the last, I do think, of my race. Home,&#xD;
kindred, all have gone from me; so, after all, but for the sake of dying with&#xD;
some one gentle deed of charity nestling in its sweet recollection at my heart,&#xD;
-I would be content, now, if Heaven's lightnings struck me, and there's an&#xD;
end. But--"&#xD;
" Eh ?"&#xD;
"But, I say, oh, Frogs, I have pften thought, if I had had a child, now, for&#xD;
example-"&#xD;
"cA child ?"&#xD;
"Yes; I have often thought that if Heaven had only given me one little&#xD;
one-one of those little ones which God the man said where to come.untobim&#xD;
I would make the endeavor to break through the mist of wickedness around&#xD;
me, and by some one deed strive to obtain the right to hold that child to my&#xD;
heart, and in the face of the great world cry out, 'I am your father!"&#xD;
Frogs breathed very hard.&#xD;
"You mean to say-you-you--".&#xD;

&#xD;
"I mean to say, Frogs, that if I had such a blessed incentive to virtue as you&#xD;
---nd I have not-I would set about counteracting Elk in the most hellish&#xD;
scheme he ever thought of ; and I would rescue five innocent beings from the&#xD;
fell destruction that otherwise will light upon them: I say, I would do that,&#xD;
Frogs; but alas ! I have no little one to wind its arms about my neck, and&#xD;
while its soft lips nestled on my cheeks, whisper, 'that was well and truly&#xD;
done, my father."&#xD;
" Air-water-I-choke !" gasped Frogs. "God !, I never thought of&#xD;
that ! I shall-choke-choke     "'&#xD;
Jobus hastily held water to his lips, and then dashed some on to his face ;&#xD;
and then, with his handkerchief, he patted the water off the haggard connte-&#xD;
nance; but it came again, streaming down the cheeks, and then Jobus saw&#xD;
that the tears were flowing fast from the eyes of Frogs.&#xD;
"Blessed-blessed !" said Jobus.&#xD;
"What?" gasped Frogs. "What is blessed ?"&#xD;
"Why, these tears, to be sure, my old friend. Are they not blessed ?"&#xD;
Frogs sobbed aloud, and flung himself back upon the couch ; and for more&#xD;
than five minutes nothing broke the stillness of that room but the deep grief&#xD;
of that wretched man, as he wept the weeping of years in that one hour.&#xD;
At length the torrent of feeling thus suddenly and 'strangely awakened,&#xD;
ceased to overpower all other perceptions, and stifling his sobs, Frogs looked&#xD;
up in the face of Jobus.&#xD;
" Jobus," he said, "I too-No-you said you had no dhild?"&#xD;
"' None-none."&#xD;
"Well, Jobus, old fellow-don't look at me so-but-but I have a child,&#xD;
and if, by any magic, she could rest upon my breast and say, 'Well done,&#xD;

"Magic," said Jobus, slowly rubbing his hands together. "Did you say.&#xD;
magic'? Oh, dear ! I think, worm as I am, that in the intention and the&#xD;
determination around you, Frogs, to do a great and a good deed, there is a&#xD;
magic such as Heaven itself sanctions, and lends the might'of all its powers to&#xD;
render beautiful."&#xD;
"Hush !" said Frogs; "the street door !"&#xD;
CHAPTER        XXVII.&#xD;
AT eight, o'clock P.M., when many hard-working and sober-minded peo-&#xD;
ple, in and about London, were thinking of settling down quietly with their&#xD;
lhmilies, and rationally passing an hour or two before retiring to rest, Abel&#xD;
rose from his chair in the chambers of the Albany, ready for the life that was&#xD;
to be his during the next eight hours of the night and early day.&#xD;
Lord Rokeley has dined with him-Colonel Elk, too, has done him that&#xD;
honor, and looks, indeed, as if he had taken just a little too much wine. There&#xD;
are two other guests, whom we need say nothing further of, than that they&#xD;
were well known as men upon town-that is to say, young men of good family&#xD;
and ample means, who were doing their best to dissipate the latter, and to&#xD;
effectually get rid of whatever credit or repute had ever attached to the&#xD;
names they bore.&#xD;
" Now,.Abel, my boy," said the colonel, "what is'it to be I Here we are,&#xD;
all as fresh as mountain daisies, and ready for anything in a respectable way."&#xD;
"Well only say what is to be the programme of the night's proceedings,"&#xD;
said Abel, "and I am your man. - What do you say, Rokeley ? Can't you&#xD;
think of some novelty I"&#xD;
Rokeley shook his head, and replied that it was a great deal too much&#xD;
trouble to think at all, and that he never did anything so d--d low.&#xD;
"Well, said the colonel, "is it to be the opera first ?"&#xD;
" Agreed," said the others.&#xD;
&#xD;
'I&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BRO1 ER, THE COLONEL.                      97&#xD;
"But it's rather early," added one. "We have almost time for a drive in&#xD;
your tandem, Morton."  Yei&#xD;
"What, five of us!" said the colonel.&#xD;
"That's the fun pf it. Some of us will have to hold on  it'&#xD;
for three."&#xD;
"No, I vote against that," said a young gent, with an affected lisp. "I&#xD;
think we may kill an hour at the Opera, and then it will be  ttinon forten&#xD;
O'clock, and then I should advise we tty the suburban alarm dodge for an&#xD;
hour or two, by which time London will be getting quiet, so that we can do&#xD;
the war-whoop in the quiet streets;- and what do you say to trying the oa..&#xD;
pital dodge'? Then we can turn in and have some broiled bones and cha-&#xD;
pagne somewhere, and after' that we can beginonthe lamps, and knockers,&#xD;
and bell-pulls about Russel Square and thereaway, till we get tired of the fun."&#xD;
Well done," said Abel.&#xD;
"Certainly," said Elk, "we might do more than all that; and if we feel&#xD;
tred of the out-of-door enjoyment, there will be no difficultyat all in turning&#xD;
tn somewhere and having a hand at cards, or rattling the ivories a little-while&#xD;
"Thank you all the same. But what do you mean by the hospital dodge?&#xD;
that's above me altogether. I hope it's nothing that involves a  trouble ?"&#xD;
"Not much," said the gent who had proposed it. Allow me to explain it&#xD;
to you."&#xD;
Ah, do.&#xD;
"Well, you know, at the hospitals in London, as well as everywhere else&#xD;
peace and quietness are considered to be everything, as you ma naturally,&#xD;
expect ; and the hospital dodge consists of all of as going with speaking&#xD;
trumpets, and getting right in as far as the hall, or further if we can, andthen&#xD;
all bellowing out'at once--' The end of the world has come!' Or--' Prepare&#xD;
for your final doom !' Or else, uniting in a great roar that shall transcend&#xD;
anything the terrified patents ever heard; and ten to one but you frighten&#xD;
"Has that been tried ?" said Lord Rokeley.&#xD;
"No; it's only a suggestion," said Abel Morton; "but it's rather clever&#xD;
don't you think? "&#xD;
" Why :-ah !--I dare say it is ; but not very-ah !--humane, is it ? ~r1&#xD;
"Humane ?" cried the proposer. "My dear  okele  yu     t    h&#xD;
all belong to the lower classes who are in the public hospitals."&#xD;
"In fact, all poor people," said another.&#xD;
Ah, well, if there's anything I hate more than another, it's poor people&#xD;
so do it if you like."&#xD;
"Well, now," said Colonel Elk, "here are five of us. you knew; and it's&#xD;
out of the question that we can all go in the tandem. I will get my qog-cart&#xD;
and that will hold three nicely, you know, and thus it will leave thE tandem&#xD;
with only two ; which, after all, is its proper complement; but I should ad-&#xD;
vise Morton not to drive tandem fashion at night. It only gets you into a&#xD;
tangle if you are in a hurry ; and you never know when you may be on these&#xD;
occasions. Take the gray cob, Morton, and then, you know, you will be&#xD;
equal to any emergency."&#xD;
"I will. That is good advice. But it's to the Opera first, I suppose ='"&#xD;
Oh, yes, to kill time."&#xD;
,Come on," said Morton-" come on Rokeley. Rowley where are you?&#xD;
illoa, there, Rowley 1"  \y&#xD;
"Here, sir !"&#xD;
"You will have the tandem, with the gray cob only, at the corner of the&#xD;
Cera colonnade, at ten; and you will go the colonel's, and order his' man with&#xD;
t dog cart."&#xD;
Rowley held open the door, and the party left Morton's chambers, talking -&#xD;

HEADS AND HEARTS ; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
very loudly, and occupying very much of the pavement, as they walked down&#xD;
to the Haymarket.&#xD;
Lord Rokely's uncle, the Marquis of Santre, had a box at the Opera; and&#xD;
after ascertaining that that noble personage was not present, Lord Rokeley&#xD;
took possession, and conducted his companions into the box, where they'&#xD;
all talked very loud during the grand scena ; and when the Prima Douna&#xD;
of the season was dwelling upon a long sustained note, which seemed like the&#xD;
last trill of a lark, as it mounts heavenward, to be dying away in space, one&#xD;
of the party finished it by such a sneeze, as made everybody in the house jump&#xD;
again, and completely obliterated all the effect of the dying cadence of the&#xD;
singer's voice.~&#xD;
"'Pen soul, that was good," said Rokeley, "only rather a trouble."&#xD;
"Capital !" said Morton, wiping his eyes, into which his stifled laughter had&#xD;
brought tears.&#xD;
By ths time general attention was turned towards the box, and many a&#xD;
lorgnette in the circle was directed to the occupants, so that Rokeley, for fear&#xD;
the affair should come to the ears of his uncle, the marquis, suggested that it&#xD;
would be better to beat a retreat at once, as it was cose upon ten o'clock.&#xD;
When they reached the colonnade, they found that Rowley and a groom&#xD;
were there with the two vehicles; and they at once mounted, and turned their&#xD;
horses' heads westward.&#xD;
"I suppose the villages and detatched houses down the western road," said&#xD;
the colonel, "will do? We can go by the Uxbridge Road, and get back&#xD;
through Brompton and Kensington, and so on into London again, if that will&#xD;
suit."&#xD;
"All's right," said Morton. "Rowley, are the speaking trumpets in the&#xD;
tandem?"&#xD;
"Nows fr ite.&#xD;
"Be sure you all scream if you see anybody crossing the roadway," said the&#xD;
gent who seemed most prolific in expedients to show off his practical wit. "If&#xD;
it's an old woman, you will see what fine fun it is. But you must all scream&#xD;
together."&#xD;
's By-the-bye," said the other, "we had better pull up at the end of Oxford&#xD;
Street, and all shriek at once, and call out 'The child-the child and if that&#xD;
don't frighten everybody that hears us I don't know what will.&#xD;
We can try it," said Elk..&#xD;
They now went on at a rattling pace; but about half way up Oxford street&#xD;
they saw a milliner's shop still open, and through the various articles in the&#xD;
window might be observed the heads of some half-dozen females, bending over&#xD;
their work, which no doubt was wanted for the gorgeous convenience of some&#xD;
female specimen of pride and selfishness on, the morrow, who cared little what&#xD;
sleepless nights she condemned the poor slaves of fashion to, so that her pride&#xD;
was pampered.&#xD;
"Stop-stop !" cried M'Leon, who was quite the wag of the party. "Do&#xD;
you see that donkey ?"&#xD;
"Yes." said Abel, "what of i t ?"&#xD;
"What of it? Why, its providential. Colonel, draw up a little closer, here.&#xD;
You see the donkey opposite that shop ?"&#xD;
"To be sure."&#xD;
"Well, it will be fine fun, won't it, to put him in at the window ?"&#xD;
"Rather. But I don't see how."&#xD;
"Three of us can do it. One on each side of him can lift him up on his hind&#xD;
legs, and another behind him with the gig whip, you see, and in he goes&#xD;
." Good : let's do it."&#xD;
Abel took care of his own vehicle, and Lord Rokeley of the dog cart while&#xD;
the colonel and the two gents alighted, and made their way up to the monkey&#xD;
-who, with drooping head, was wondering when his master. who was taking&#xD;
his glass at a public house some. three doors off, would think of going home&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.&#xD;
and relieving him of the weight of the two baskets that were slung across hs&#xD;
back,.&#xD;
The window of the milliner's shop was quite close to the pavement and&#xD;
came nearly down to the ground, so that everything was tolerably favorable&#xD;
tren Lao hRokeley entered into the fun; and putting one of the Bpean&#xD;
trumpets to his mouth, he prepared to second the affair as well ashe could,&#xD;
Colonel Elk stood with the whip reh,"and one gent got, to the astonishment&#xD;
of the donkey, on one side of him,  the other on the other, with each a&#xD;
shoulder under his fore-leg.&#xD;
"Now for it-hoist away I"&#xD;
"Here you go 1" said the other; and the donkey was lifted to&#xD;
in a moment. Crack ! came the whip, and with one bound the animal "went'&#xD;
right through the milliner's window, to the intense gratification of the con-&#xD;
federates. At the same moment Lord Rokeley executed such a yell through&#xD;
the speaking trumpet, that it made even Abel Morton start again.=&#xD;
Screams came from the people of the shop-awatehman sprang his rattle.&#xD;
and people began to rush out of the public house, just as the tvo gents and&#xD;
Colonel lk regained their vehicles, and set off at such trot, that pursuit was&#xD;
a chimera.&#xD;
"'Pon soul," said Lord Rokeley, "that's what I call clever, now. Was it&#xD;
much trouble?"&#xD;
"Not a hit," said elk, laughing. "But here we are at the corner of Oxford&#xD;
Road. Now for a general yell. Get the "trumpets out. All together, now.&#xD;
I will cry Out first, and then do you all raise as awful a shout as you can,"&#xD;
"Yes-yes! All right."&#xD;
"Are you ready ?"&#xD;
" Quite."&#xD;
"The child ! The infant l" shouted Elk, in a dreadful voice, and the others&#xD;
raised such a yell in chorus through the speaking trumpets, that both the&#xD;
horses took fright, and ran off at a break-neck speed.&#xD;
The effect of this sudden alarm at such a spot, was truly great. Every win.&#xD;
dow for nearly a quarter of a mile round th neighborhood was flung;open.&#xD;
The maddened passengers ran against each o er in their distraction. Some&#xD;
echoed the wild cry of " The child-the child !" others wondered what sort of&#xD;
infant was run over that could raise such a yell upon the occasion as the speak-&#xD;
ing trumpets had produced ; for if an elephant had been having his eye-tooth&#xD;
extracted, such a terrible roar could hardly have been expected s&#xD;
Two or three people in their fright, sprang upon strange persons' steps, and&#xD;
hammered away at the knockers; and one old lady, who was rather corpulent,&#xD;
actually scrambled right over a broad marble slab., in front of a fishmonger's&#xD;
window, and alighted in the show, amid a perfect ruin of soles, and salmon,&#xD;
and lobsters.&#xD;
"Well," said Morton, as he held his -sides, and tried to cheek his laughter,&#xD;
after be had succeeded in quieting the gray cob. " Well, if this isn't life,- I&#xD;
don't know what is, that's all. It's exquisite."&#xD;
"'Pn soul, its good, rather," said Roieley. "This will he a glorious even-&#xD;
ing,. notwithstanding the trouble."-"&#xD;
"Oh, hang the trouble !" said one of the gents. "I'think that donkey busi         _&#xD;
ness was first rate."&#xD;
"And so was the child," said another.&#xD;
"Well, I admit that it was good. But here we are in the country, and we&#xD;
certainly ought not to leave a bell-pull to any gate or doorway on either aside_&#xD;
of the road."&#xD;
"Nor will we; so here goes for a beginning. Draw up close under this&#xD;
wall, Morton."l&#xD;
The two vehicles were soon at a stand still under the shadow of the wall of&#xD;

Rowley was much more reserved and respectful to his master sincere had&#xD;
found out that plenty of money had sprung from somewhere.&#xD;
"I shall rise. Nobody has been, of course ?"&#xD;
"Well, sir, nobody of any consequence. There has been two females, sir,&#xD;
that's all.&#xD;
" Females ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir ; a cat and a kitten, as one may say--that is, an old one and a&#xD;
youngone ; but when I told them you were not up, they said they would call&#xD;
again."&#xD;
"Who the deuce can they be ?" said Abel, as with his brains rather in a&#xD;
state of confusion, he hastily dressed himself ; and then copious ablutions in&#xD;
cold water cleared for a time the cloudy state of intellect which had been in-&#xD;
duced by the potations of the night previous.&#xD;
"Are you sure they asked for me, Rowley ?"&#xD;
"Oh yes, sir, and.--"&#xD;
Rat ! tat ! came a kuiock at the door of the chambers.&#xD;
"That's the same knock, sir."&#xD;
"Stop ! say that--that--Yet who can they be. Stop a moment, I-Well,&#xD;
show them into the breakfast-room. Is breakfast laid, do you know. Row-&#xD;

"Oh yes, sir--all's right ?"&#xD;
"'Then show them in, and say that I will come to them in a few moments.&#xD;
'do you hear ?"&#xD;
" Yes, sir."&#xD;
Abel looked at himself in the glass, and would have been glad if he could&#xD;
have washed away the haggard look of dissipation which was beginning to&#xD;
cling to him, despite his youth and fair constitution ; but that was out of the&#xD;
question ; so, hastily making himself as passable as he could, and wrapping&#xD;
around him his costly dressing-gown, he left his chambers, and entered the&#xD;
gorgeous apartment which did duty. with all its glitter, as breakfast, dining,&#xD;
drawing, and supper-room, being called by those different disignations as the&#xD;
time of day, or the use it was being put to, for the time being warranted&#xD;
Two females were seated before him, and. Abel bowed.&#xD;
Ladies," he said, "I understand you desire to see me."&#xD;
Upon this, one of the figures lifted its veil, and a voice said, in accents be-&#xD;
tween anger and grief.-&#xD;
" Oh, Abel-Abel, has it come to this, indeed, you bad, indifferent youth,&#xD;
that I am forced to come here to such a sink of iniquity4 to tell you that you&#xD;
are going as fast as you can to ruination !"&#xD;
"What !" exclaimed Abel. "Mrs. Bennet, my mother's old housekeeper !"&#xD;
"Ohdear, yes-you needn't look surprised ; and here's Miss Emma, too."&#xD;
" Yes, Abel," said the other female, throwing back her veil. "After much&#xD;
prayer and many shrinkings from the act, I at length felt that whatever cor-&#xD;
struction you might mistakingly put upon this visit. it wasmyduty to make&#xD;
one effort to restore you to those who--who--.--"     y&#xD;
Emma's heart failed her at this juncture, and she burst into tears. Abel&#xD;
would have flown forward to clasp her in his arms, and to tell her how much&#xD;
he loved her still, for at that moment he felt that he did ; but Mrs. Rennet,&#xD;
when he made a movement so to do, gave him a poke in the chest with the&#xD;
huge ferrule of an umbrella she had with.her, as she said-&#xD;
"Get along, do. We don't want none of your pertended infections here.&#xD;
Get along. Its again my will that poor Emma is here at all, and they think&#xD;
that she has come to London with ine to go to the dentist's, but for my part, I&#xD;
would rather have all the eye-teeth in my head pulled out by a hundred mad&#xD;
elephants, if I was Emma, than hare a word to say to you. Get along, do."&#xD;
Mrs. Bennet made another demonstration with the umbrella, which she kept&#xD;
at the charge, so that Abel was quite defeated, and he could only say-&#xD;
"Emma--Emma, I know I am unworthy of you-quite unworthy that you&#xD;

MY BROTHERS TUE COLONEL.                      194&#xD;
CHAPTER RXXIX.&#xD;
Wa have heard that Emma had stated the fact of Sir John's presence i&#xD;
London, at his hotel in Clarges street ; and that he was full of the intention&#xD;
that had brought him to London, and now we will state what that intention&#xD;
was.&#xD;
There existed in Lincoln's Inn Fields, in one of those tall houses on its&#xD;
southern side, which were once the residences of chancellors and lord-keepers,&#xD;
a Mr. Carnac, a solicitor of experience and skill. He was, to be sure, now,&#xD;
declining into the vale of years, but a youth well spent, had procured to the&#xD;
old age of this man of law and justice, too--for he was as rigid in equity as&#xD;
he was learned in all the doubles and shuffles of legal science-a green old&#xD;
age. His intellect was still vigorous, and with a love for his profession which&#xD;
had grown upon through many years of practice, he still sat day by day inl&#xD;
his consulting-room, surrounded by the insignia of his practice.&#xD;
Now, Mr. Carnac had long since made a very pretty fortune ; but he felt&#xD;
that without something to do, the active mind that had been doing something&#xD;
for so long would soon decay and go to ruin, so he still practised.&#xD;
It was to Mr. Carnac that, while fighting the battles of the Merchant Prin'ees&#xD;
in India, Sir John Morton had from time to time forwarded portions of his&#xD;
earnings for investment, and it was to the skill and integrity with which those&#xD;
investments were made, that Sir John, in his old age, owed that competency&#xD;
which made the decline of his life easy and elegant.&#xD;
Now then for the plans of the old baronet.&#xD;
He intended to go to this Mr. Carnac, whom he had not seen for nearly a&#xD;
year, and to make him acquainted with the whole particulars of the defection&#xD;
of Abel from the right course of affection and duty, and to abide implicitly&#xD;
by his advice in the matter. Sir John when he made up his mind to consult&#xD;
a physician never set up his own opinion in opposition, and so with regard to&#xD;
Mr. Carnac, before he went to him he asked himself, "Am I prepared to abide&#xD;
by his fiat in this business ?" and having answered, "Yes," hewent.&#xD;
it was about midday when Sir John Morton-stooping more than he had&#xD;
ever done before, for his heart was bowed down with grief, and looking as if&#xD;
twenty years had been added to his age during the'last twelve months--&#xD;
stopped at the broad court in front of the mansion in which Mr. Carnac's&#xD;
chambers were situated.&#xD;
The poor, fond father now paused for a moment, and in a weak voice he&#xD;
spoke-&#xD;
"Oh, Abel, Abel. my son, what a cruel necessity it is that forces me to repair&#xD;
to a stranger, and tell him all that I feel for you, and all that you have done,&#xD;
to force such feeling from me. Abel, my boy-my child, are you quite lost&#xD;
to me.&#xD;
The old man-the bereaved old man, for he felt that he was such at that&#xD;
time, leant against the iron rails, and waited awhile to recover some outward&#xD;
show of composure before he ventured to face the stern integrity of Mr. Car-&#xD;
nac.&#xD;
Yes, Mr. Carnac was a man of stern integrity, perhaps, after all, a little too&#xD;
stern, and that was the only thing that Sir John Morton had a lingering fear&#xD;
of in the transaction. He thought it possible that the old lawyer might be&#xD;
just a little too harsh and energetic in the business.&#xD;
"Well, well," he said, as he ascended the steps of the mansion, " we will&#xD;
talk the matter over. He will soon see what my feeling is upon the sujeot ,&#xD;
and we shall come to some conclusion, no doubt--no doubt."&#xD;
"Sir John Morton, sir," announced a clerk of Mr. Carnac's, who occupied&#xD;
a small apartment adjoining that of his principal.&#xD;
The old lawyer sat still and silent.&#xD;
"Sir John Morton, sir !"&#xD;
The old man started. He had lapsed into one of those dreamy reveries of&#xD;

to confide his wishes at once to his old man of business, in which case there&#xD;
would have been no difficulty or publicity.&#xD;
"I am, dear Sir John Morton,&#xD;
"Yours, very respectfully,&#xD;
"AnoLraus LAK    CARno."&#xD;
Word for word, with a painful sense of the distinctness of the statement,&#xD;
did poor, bewildered, agonised, Sir John Morton read the copy of the letter&#xD;
through, and then he laid his hand upon the back of the chair and looked at&#xD;
Mr. Carnac.&#xD;
"Is this all real ?"&#xD;
The lawyer nodded.&#xD;
"And am I not quite mad ?"&#xD;
"I hope not, Sir John."&#xD;
Sir John rose and leant on the table, and Mr. Carnac rose likewise, and was&#xD;
a little alarmed when the old baronet took hold of him by the collar; placing&#xD;
his lips close to the ears of the attorney, Sir John said-.&#xD;
"Sir, I never placed my name to a bill for a thousand pounds, or a thousand&#xD;
pence, or any other sum, in all my life !"&#xD;
Then each sat down with a plump upon their chairs, and stared at each-other&#xD;
more fixedly than ever.&#xD;
"Then you mean to say," gasped out Mr. Carnac, "that-the--the bill-"&#xD;
"Go on, sir." ,&#xD;
"The bill is a-forgery ?"&#xD;
"A d-d forgery !" cried Sir John, banging his hand down upon the table&#xD;
with a force that made the papers thereon jump again, and knocked the ink&#xD;
out of the stand. "A rank forgery, Mr. Carnac ! I know nothing about i;&#xD;
-1 never heard anything of it till this hour, sir !"&#xD;
"This is serious.&#xD;
"I don't care whether it is serious or droll ; it is a lie, sir--a stamped lie!&#xD;
Abel will tell you as much, Mr. Carnac. The poor boy is being made a victim&#xD;
as well as I. We must now see each other to expose this horrible deception.&#xD;
But yet I can hardly think it. Who is this man, Lyon'? What is he? How&#xD;
comes he with my name appended to his bills?  Where is the rascal ?"&#xD;
'Stop,-Sir John."&#xD;
"I won't stop."&#xD;
"You shall stop, Sir John.&#xD;
" Shall ? Shall, did you say ?"&#xD;
"Yes; because I will tell you why. The man Lyon is now, as you heard,&#xD;
in the outer room. Quietly and calmly we will find out how he came by the&#xD;
bill. He need not know who you are. Nay, I will pass you off as a gentle-&#xD;
man who possibly may advance the money. It is of the utmost importance,&#xD;
Sir John, that we should hear his statement regarding the possession of the&#xD;
document. There is villany somewhere, and it is worth the unmasking."&#xD;
"I submit, sir. I submit ; but, of course we must give the forging rascal into&#xD;
custody. I will prosecute him while I have a drop of blood in my veins."&#xD;
"Not so fast-not so fast, Sir John; you must first ascertain that this Mr.&#xD;
Lyon is the forging rascal,"&#xD;
" Do you doubt it ?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"Are you mad to doubt such a self-evidenced fact? Why you yourself told&#xD;
me that the rascal had brought you the bill to get it discounted."&#xD;
"I did; but I have too good an opinion of Mr. Lyon's cunning to suppose,&#xD;
for one moment that he is cognisant of the fact of it being a forgery." It would&#xD;
aiot pay him, Sir John, I tell you. It would not pay him."&#xD;
"Not pay him?   What do you mean by that ?"&#xD;
"Just what I say; but you shall judge for yourself. Say nothing but in&#xD;
reply to me, and we will have this man at once into this room. You will soon&#xD;
See, ir John, whether or not I am correct in my opinion conerning him."&#xD;

MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL,&#xD;
&#xD;
colonel, Mr. Elk, has drawn me into worse than extravagances. He has gone&#xD;
far beyond that, and dragged me with him. He has drawn me into crime -"&#xD;
"Crime?   Oh, no !"&#xD;
" Yes, sir, he-he-,---"&#xD;
Abel turned pale as the thought flashed across his mind that, perchance, he&#xD;
was acting very foolishly in himself declaring the fact of the frightful means&#xD;
that had been resorted to to raise money. How could he tell what the stern&#xD;
rectitude of Mr. Josiah Elk might prompt him to do in such a case? Poor&#xD;
Abel trembled at the thought of the abyss down which he had nearly plunged,&#xD;
and he was silent.&#xD;
" My dear young friend did you say crime ?"&#xD;
" I-no--that is "&#xD;
"You certainly did use the word, and I hope that you will have the good-&#xD;
ness to explain it to me. Who knows but that I may be able to save you yetI&#xD;
Let me beg of you to tell me all. Alas, that I should be compelled by truth&#xD;
to siiy so much, but the real fact is, that my brother, the colonel, has led a&#xD;
wild and lawless life abroad, and he is not very particular about how he accom-&#xD;
plishes his objects."&#xD;
" LIe is not, indeed," groaned Abel.&#xD;
"But yet I hope he has not been so persuasive with you as to induce you&#xD;
to join in any nefarious scheme?"&#xD;
"No-no; you mistake-that is to say-yes, you mistake, my good sir 1"&#xD;
"But you said crime."      --&#xD;
"Did I?"&#xD;
"I will take my oath in every creed in Christendom that you said crime."&#xD;
"No-no. But if I did, is it no crime to widen the breach between a father&#xD;
and'son? Is it no crime for a man of extended experience to involve a young&#xD;
and inexperienced one in extravagances and vices? Oh, tell me, sir, if you caa&#xD;
where the wild riot of improvidence ends and crime begins ?"&#xD;
"Alas! that is all too true."&#xD;
Abel drew a long breath, as he thought that at any rate he had got well out&#xD;
of the difficulty which his rather imprudent words had drawn him into.&#xD;
"My dear young friend," said Mr. Elk, "I wish now that, despite the im-&#xD;
portant business which called me from London, I had remained in it to watch.&#xD;
over you; but I had not an idea that you were quite so-so-excuse me&#xD;
for using the term-weak. I say I did not think that, or I would have&#xD;
remained. But now I gather from what you say, that you have been led into&#xD;
a disreputable mode of life by my brother, the colonel.&#xD;
" Yes."&#xD;
"Well, you repent of all that ?"&#xD;
"Oh, so bitterly !"&#xD;
"Then the remedy shall be found at once."&#xD;
" Impossible, sir !"&#xD;
"Nay," added Mr. Josiah, Elk, as he rose, and a kind of benevolent smile&#xD;
played around his mouth. "There you are wrong, Abel Morton. You are&#xD;
very wrong. There is always a way out of every difficulty, if we choose to&#xD;
embrace it. You are very wrong, indeed, my dear young friend. Now I will&#xD;
tell you what I advise."&#xD;
"Go on, sir. I am obliged to you."&#xD;
" My carriage is in Burlington street, and you will at ouce come with me,&#xD;
and we will go to your. father and tell him exactly how you stand with my&#xD;
brother, the colonel, and with every other person with whom you may be in&#xD;
any way involved. I am a man nearly his own age, and I suppose, can speak&#xD;
to him candidly and reasonably, and I do not doubt for a moment but that&#xD;
you will be received into the bosom of your family again, and that all will be&#xD;
well."&#xD;
Abel laughed discordantly;&#xD;
"Oh, sir, you know not what you say. You speak of what you know&#xD;
&#xD;
nothing, Mr. Elk. What you propose is impossible. Ah weeks&#xD;
only one short week, and such a course might eAeeksago, perhaps&#xD;
But why not now ?,           r             saved me.&#xD;
"Oh, peace, sir, peace ! Do not speak to me of this again.&#xD;

laughed loudly, and then looking serious for a moment or two, he said-&#xD;
"By George! there was something I had to say to Josiah Elk, that I have&#xD;
not said. What on earth could it be?  I was on the point of saying it, too,&#xD;
I don't know how often, and it always slipped me somehow. What on earth&#xD;
could it be?"&#xD;
Abel paced his room twice, and then he added-&#xD;
" Ah ! I know now. It was about that girl, Dora, at the colonel's. I wan-&#xD;
ted to beg him, at least, to remove her from beneath the contamination of&#xD;
that roof.' How could I forget it ?-How could I forget? She is not fit for&#xD;
such company and his set, I being one ; yes, she is not fit to be associated&#xD;
with us. More wine, Rowley -"&#xD;
"Oh, 1or 1" said Rowley ; he's a-coming it rather; now, I don't think, above&#xD;
a bit."       -&#xD;
"Do you hearascal?"&#xD;
" But'the drag is t the door, sir, if you please, and-and the things are all&#xD;
in, and I rather thi k, sir, you said you were going to Richmond, didn't you,&#xD;
sir ?"&#xD;
" Yes. I will go at once. My coat. Curses on you, what do you mean by&#xD;
being so slow?  There, there, never mind ! shut up the place, and come with&#xD;
me, Rowley. You don't get out often, confound you !"&#xD;
"Yes, sir-no, sir," said Rowley, replying to both remarks.&#xD;
"That will do. The sun shines, Rowley, and we will make a day of it, old&#xD;
fellow. Ha-ha ! Hang care, Rowley."&#xD;
."Oh, very, sir."&#xD;
"I say, hang care, you dog. What do you mean by staring at me in that&#xD;
sort of way, sir ?"&#xD;
"Who ?-I, sir?   Lor bless you, sir, I was looking out of the window, sir,&#xD;
that's what I was. Oh, for ! champagne on an empty stomach has done it,"&#xD;
said Rowley, aside.&#xD;
"Quick-quick, Rowley."&#xD;
"Yes, sir-I'm ready, sir. AlPs right, sir."&#xD;
&#xD;
1i&#xD;
&#xD;
"ha-ha! of course it is. hang care, Rowley, I say."&#xD;
"Certainly, sir; and pull his legs."&#xD;
"Tobe sure-to be sure, Rowley, did you ever see that little Arabella&#xD;
Julie?"&#xD;
"No, sir."&#xD;
"Then, you dog, you have lost a treat-round as a dove in full feather, you&#xD;
log-plump as a little partridge--rosy as twenty cherubs-such eyes-such&#xD;
lips-Curse you Rowley, what are you grinning at ?"&#xD;
"Me, sir? Oh, dear!I"&#xD;
"Come along at once, and don't be making a fool of yourself there, will&#xD;
you ? Come along V&#xD;
Well, he is funny at times," said Rowley.&#xD;
The chambers were locked up, and Abel and Rowley mounted the "drag.)&#xD;
Rowley had rather a dread of Abel's driving on that occasion but he deter.&#xD;
mined to hold on and chance it.&#xD;
With a sickly smile, and a strange wild kind of light in his eyes, Abel&#xD;
Morton started for Richmond at a slashing pace, Alas ! poor, poor Abel.&#xD;
At the express desire of the Dandoloski, that day had been set apart for a&#xD;
ftechampetre in the grounds of the villa which Abel had.- taken fotbher at&#xD;
hnond, and the ladies and gentlemen invited were all of a kipdred class as&#xD;
regarded morals and habits. Alas, poor Abel, again!&#xD;
But we shall see that, bright as the day looked, there was a storm hovering&#xD;
in the horizon of Abel Morton's fortunes which was destined to burst with&#xD;
fury over him ere nightfall.&#xD;
CHAPTER          XXI.&#xD;
Ir will be remembered that we left poor Sir John Morton with his man of&#xD;
business, in no very enviable frame of mind, after the startling discovery that&#xD;
Mr. Lyon had been the means of making to him, Sir John, of the length that&#xD;
Abel had gone to supply himself with cash.&#xD;
The old man sat for some moments gazing in silence at the lawyer, who&#xD;
seeing a change coming over his countenance, got alarmed, and rose from his&#xD;
chair, saying-&#xD;
"Sir John, you are not well!"&#xD;
to the flo of th camber.John Morton, and thenfell fainting from his chair&#xD;
A carriage was procured, and he was taken carefully to his hotel in Clar-&#xD;
ges-street, where, fortunately, Emma was not at the apartments to be shock.&#xD;
td by the sudden arrival of her uncle in such a state. They put the old man&#xD;
to bed, and then they left him to his own sad thoughts for a titne; but it&#xD;
was not likely that Sir John Morton would, after he had rallied from the&#xD;
first shock of the direful intelligence that had been brought to him, content&#xD;
himself with remaining inactive.&#xD;
The sound, prudent, good sense of the old man was sure to suggest speedily&#xD;
some course of action; but, pending that fact, we must follow Mr. Lyon'from&#xD;
Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, upon a mission which that worthy painted to hi self-to&#xD;
be of the first importance.&#xD;
The precipitancy with which the scio -f the chosen people left the chain.&#xD;
hers of Mr. arnac, was something terrible. He had-darted pastthe elerk ia&#xD;
theouter office like an apparition, and was in the-open air witha speed that&#xD;
he would himself; in his more sober moments, have considered to be: quite&#xD;
fabulous.&#xD;
But Mr. Lyon had an object.&#xD;
What object could it be that had such an effect upon the speed of Mr. Lyon,&#xD;
but one connected with money? What but the ruling passion of such minds&#xD;
could induce such efforts of agility as he made in dashing through some courts&#xD;
and alleys in the neighborhood of Clare Market, until he reached the Strand ?&#xD;

&#xD;
HEADS AND HEARTS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
It did not occur to Mr. Lyon that Sir John Morton would gladly have paid&#xD;
ten times the amount that was specified upon that stamp rather than a hair of&#xD;
Abel's head should be injured, notwithstanding all that he had to regret in&#xD;
the follies of his son.&#xD;
If Mr. Lyon had happened to take that view of the case, he might have&#xD;
thought that the keeping.of the bill might not be a bad speculation ; but, on&#xD;
the contrary, he acted upon his first impulse-the same impulse that would&#xD;
have actuated him if he had suddenly found himself in possession of a bad&#xD;
sovereign-the impulse to-rush to the person of whom he got it, and demand&#xD;
change for it.&#xD;
Thus, then, was it that Mr. Lyon, with trepidation, flung himself into a&#xD;
cab iin the Strand, and directed the driver to the lodgings of Colonel Elk.&#xD;
With what trembling anxiety Mr. Lyon looked at the bill, as the cab sped&#xD;
on ! How he turned it over and over, and seemed to think that the very&#xD;
stamp and the paper had a spurious look, now that he had been taught to&#xD;
know that the "Accepted, John Morton," that was its principal charm, was&#xD;
no longer correct, and as it ought to be.&#xD;
'Oh, what villains," exclaimed Mr. Lyon, "there ish in this world ! Oh,&#xD;
what villains!"&#xD;
And now the cab turns into the street where the colonel resides, and Mr.&#xD;
Lyon cranes his neck from the window. The colonel's cab is at the door, and&#xD;
the door is open.&#xD;
"Faster !" cries Mr. Lyon to the cab-driver. "Faster 1"&#xD;
"Eh ?" said the man, drawing up.&#xD;
" Go on, wretch ! Go on !"&#xD;
"What did ye pull the blessed check-string then for, stupid ?"&#xD;
"Go on. Oh, go on. Never mind."&#xD;
"Oh., it's all very well to say never mind. Kim up."&#xD;
The colonel appeared at the door of his house, drawing on his gloves. Mr.&#xD;
Lyon, in an agony of apprehension that he would spring into his cab with his&#xD;
usual celerity and drive off, opened the door of the hack vehicle in which he&#xD;
rode, and called out-&#xD;
" Colonesh, colonesh !"&#xD;
The cab-wheel went with a jolt over a stone, and Mr. Lyon overbalanced&#xD;
himself, and fell sprawling into the kennel, just in front of the tall horse in&#xD;
the colonel's cab.&#xD;
"Oh, my eye !" said the cabman, "there you go! But you wont bilk me !&#xD;
I sees you !"&#xD;
Rolling off his seat, the cab-driver collared the mud-bedraggled Mr. Lyon&#xD;
and demanded his fare.&#xD;
" S'elp me," said Mr. Lyon, "I means to pay. Colonesh, stop ! Don't go&#xD;
colonesh ! How much is it?&#xD;
"Three-and-eight-pence."&#xD;
"Three-and-eight-pence for a mile and a half?  Oh, s'elp me. Oh, colon-&#xD;
esh, I must speak to you. Don't go."&#xD;
"What the deuce is all this about ?" said Elk. "I can't wait here all day&#xD;
for you, Lyon."&#xD;
"Stop, stop !"&#xD;
"Go to the deuce."&#xD;
The colonel had his foot upon the step of his cab, when Mr. Lyon threw&#xD;
the three-and-eight-pence frantically to the cabman, and rushed up to the&#xD;
colonel, and seizing him by the arm, whispered-&#xD;
" Colonesh, the bill-the bill !"&#xD;
"What bill ?"&#xD;
"For a thousand-the bill--Morton's acceptance---" -&#xD;
" Well ?"&#xD;
'- It's a--forgery !"&#xD;
"You don't say so ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.&#xD;
&#xD;
ii1&#xD;
&#xD;
" Yesh, colonesh ; it ish noting but stuff. It is a forgery, and it won't be&#xD;
paid."&#xD;
"You don't mean that '"&#xD;
"1 do. S'elp me! I do I"&#xD;
' What have you had to drink this morning, my good friend, Lyon ?"&#xD;
"Nothing-nothing. I ish not drunk, colonesh. It ish a forgery, I tell&#xD;
you. Sir John, himself, told me."&#xD;
"Really, now-you don't mean that ? Abel Morton wouldn't play me such&#xD;
a trick."&#xD;
"Ha-ha !" laughed Mr. Lyon, hysterically. " Ha-ha ! Perhaps not&#xD;
colonesh-perhaps not."&#xD;
"Just so. Well, what do you mean to do ?"&#xD;
"To do ?" cried Lyon, swinging his arms like a windmill. "To do? What&#xD;
do I mean to do ?"&#xD;
"Yes-that's it."&#xD;
"My money-my money !"&#xD;
"Well ?&#xD;
"I say, colonesh; my money. I--I will have my money. I will go to a&#xD;
police-office--.I will have everybody taken up-I---"&#xD;
"Go on."&#xD;
Oh, colonesh, what shall I do?&#xD;
Well, I think yd'u had better come inside with me, and let me hear how&#xD;
you found out this affair, if it ain't, after all, one of your swindling tricks;&#xD;
for you know what a vagabond you are."&#xD;
' The colonel took his foot off the step of the cab, and lounged into the house'&#xD;
followed by Mr. Lyon, who shook again from apprehension that he might lose&#xD;
his money ; for the idea of going to law with Colonel Elk, about whose resour-&#xD;
ces and person there was much mystery, appeared desperate to the "scoun-&#xD;
ter.&#xD;
Jobus had the street-door in his hand, and bowed very low as M  Ilons&#xD;
and the colonel entered the house.&#xD;
"Come this way," said Elk, as he led Lyon up stairs.&#xD;
The colonel conducted Mr. Lyon to the drawing-room, and Jobus closed&#xD;
the street-door, and rushed to the room above, into which he locked himself;&#xD;
and then, adroitly removing a piece of floor-board which he had loosened from&#xD;
about the centre of the floor, he lay down flat upon the aperture, and could&#xD;
see into the drawing-room through the interstices of a large rose ornament&#xD;
that was in the middle of the ceiling, and which had been pierced for the pur.&#xD;
pose of ventilation.&#xD;
This position not only gave Jobus a sight of whatever took place in the&#xD;
room below, but enabled him to hear distinctly every word that was uttered.&#xD;
The colonel locked the door ; and then, turning to Lyon, he said--&#xD;
"Now, Lyon, what is all this about'V"&#xD;
In a few words Mr. Lyon told him of what had taken place at Mr. Car-&#xD;
nac's.&#xD;
"And so the old man repudiated the bill 1"&#xD;
" Exactly, colonesh."&#xD;
"Where is it?"&#xD;
"(Oh, s'elp me ! it ish here ;4but it ish waste paper."&#xD;
"Lyon, I am done by this young fellow, Abel; but that is no business of&#xD;
yours. It was upon my responsibility and word that you advanced money&#xD;
upon this bill, and it is but fair that I should repay you every farthing. If&#xD;
there be any loss, it should'be mine."&#xD;
As he spoke, the colonel took from his pocket a black pocket-book, of rather&#xD;
large size ; and selecting a bank cheque from it, he wrote Mr. Lyon a draft&#xD;
for the amount he had advanced upon the bill, and flung it across the tablo&#xD;
to his.&#xD;
"That puts you all right, Lyon. Give me the bill."&#xD;

&#xD;
"Take it, coloiesh-oh, take it. You ish a real gentleman. It ish a plea-&#xD;
sure to do business with you. my dear colonesh."&#xD;
"Now, Lyon, this has taken me by suprise, you see, and I must make in-&#xD;
quiry about it; but if I want you to give evidence of what you have seen and&#xD;
heard to-dy, you will come readily forward ?"&#xD;
"S'elp me ! yesh, colofesh !"&#xD;
"That will do. But it will oblige me if you keep quiet till I give you the&#xD;
word to speak. I don't know how the affair may turn out, my good friend,&#xD;
but bear in mind that you shall gain by it in all its stages, as soon as I give&#xD;
you the hint to act."&#xD;
" Yesh, colonesh."&#xD;
"Good morning.""&#xD;
Mr. Lyon bustled out of the house, and the colonel placed the bill in hiS&#xD;
pocket-book, and the pocket-book deep in the recesses of his breast-pocket.&#xD;
Then he paced the drawing-room to and fro for a few moments in silence,&#xD;
after which he paused in thought.&#xD;
"It is blown rather too soon," he said. "It almost amounts to a blunder.&#xD;
Well, never mind. It was to come to this. Let it be. Sir John Morton--&#xD;
ha!--I now have you on the hip ! Nothing short of all you are worth in the&#xD;
world, together with such tears and cries as are wrung from a despairing heart&#xD;
shall now pay this bill. Ha-ha! I triumph, now-t triumph ! I have you&#xD;
in the toils. Through your affections, now, as I ever swore I would, I crush&#xD;
you!"&#xD;
The colonel stalked from the room, and left the house.&#xD;
"Oh, dear !" gasped Jobus. "The worm crawls about, and-and-hears&#xD;
strange things, and now and then it-ha !-no, it don't laugh. I didn't-Oh,&#xD;
dear ! Not yet-not yet ! Murder !"&#xD;
Frogstapped at the door of the room.&#xD;
"It's only me, Jobus. Are you there ?"&#xD;
CHAPTER        XXXII.&#xD;
THERE is a special providence, Shakspeare tells us, in the fall of a sparrow&#xD;
and certainly there is some such spirit-aiding safeguard over the actions or&#xD;
a man in such a state as Abel Morton was, when with Rowley he started for&#xD;
Richmond, for be got there perfectly safe and sound.&#xD;
Abel, too, was sobered by the light cool air and the exercise, so that when&#xD;
he reached his destination, he was very nearly in his hsual condition.&#xD;
Rowley, who really had had the most serious fears that his master would&#xD;
upset him on the road to Richmond, was quite delighted to reach the villa in&#xD;
safety ; and he alighted with animation to assist in arranging the littlefete in&#xD;
the beautiful garden of the petite chateau, that sloped right down to the very&#xD;
margin of the river ; and yet was so shut in by evergreens from curious eyes,&#xD;
that it was as private as possible.&#xD;
The party consisted of the Dandoloski, a couple of dear friends-of hers, whose&#xD;
manners, albeit graceful and theatrical, were just a trifle freer than the usages&#xD;
of ordinary society sanctions, Lord Rokeley, the two gents who had played&#xD;
their parts so well upon the occasion- of the night's amusement in and about&#xD;
the metropolis, and Colonel Elk was to have been there, but he did not cone.&#xD;
There was a strange flush upon the face of Abel, as he advanced to hiS&#xD;
guests who were there before him, that sufficiently let them know that he had&#xD;
been indulging in some stimulating potations, early as it-yet was.&#xD;
"Ah, you are one bad rogue !" cried the Dandoloski, as she patted his cheek&#xD;
with her fan. "You have go for to drink de wine."&#xD;
"Well, I certainly have had a little champagne," smiled Abel._&#xD;
. "He have had one little champagne, the beau gargon. Is he not what you&#xD;
call red in one face ?"&#xD;
"Red in the face am 1?" said Abel.&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BOTHER, THE COLONEL.                      117&#xD;
"Ah, yes, is he not, and all because he go for to forget one petite small little&#xD;
souvenir for me."&#xD;
"No," said Abel, as he took from his dcket a small parcel. "The bracelet&#xD;
I promised you is there, my charmer, and I only regret that it is so utterly&#xD;
impossible any jewels can come near the brightness of your eye; so, of course,&#xD;
my bracelet must look but dim."&#xD;
" 7'res bon !" said Dandoloski. "That is what you calLyery good compli-&#xD;
ments. Oh, you love !"&#xD;
These last words were addressed to the bracelet, for which Abel had only&#xD;
given sixty guineas.&#xD;
"'Pon soul," said Lord Rokeley, "I wonder how I came to get here. It&#xD;
was such a trouble."&#xD;
"I only wonder you get anywhere," said Abel, "my dear fellow; and yet,&#xD;
if the fashionable chronicles are to be believed, you are at most of the enter-&#xD;
tainments in high life."&#xD;
"Ah--am 1?"&#xD;
"Are you?   Come this is a good one. Here is Rokeley going from place&#xD;
to plade, and pretends he knows nothing about it. Come, now, that is too&#xD;
bad."&#xD;
"Well, 'pon soul, you see-.allow me to explain. My fellow, you see-one&#xD;
of the most useful servants in the world--only has two bad q ities about&#xD;
him."w                                  ybo&#xD;
"What are they ?"&#xD;
" Oh, he is a thief and a liar !"&#xD;
" Trifles," said one of the gents. "What more of him. Rokeley ?"&#xD;
"Why, you see, he keeps all the cards and invites that'come for me, and at&#xD;
the proper time he puts me into a coach and takes me somewhere where there&#xD;
is a lot of people, and demme, that's all I know about it."&#xD;
A roar of laughter followed this lucid explanation of how Lord Rokeley&#xD;
patronised the re-unions of high life ; but lunch being announced soot turned&#xD;
attention to that substantiality. The absence of Colonel Elk was dnly.com-&#xD;
amented upon; but everybody agreed that he would be there before sunset.&#xD;
Champagne corks flew out at intervals, and Rowley, by the aid of Lord Roke-&#xD;
ley's man, and the Dandoloski's tiger, mauged to attend upon the party very&#xD;
well.      '&#xD;
The Dandoloski and the two young ladies from the opera contrived;4o iabibe&#xD;
a very serious quantity of champagne ; and as the gentlemen were-not at all&#xD;
behindhand in that particular, the. fun, if it was not very clever or salient, get&#xD;
fast and furious.&#xD;
"What shall we do now ?" said one:of the young ladies.&#xD;
"Here you are," said a gent. "Cards, if you like, or whatisay yon all: to-a&#xD;
game at blind-ian's-buff?"&#xD;
"What !" said Lord Rokeley; "do you think that would take the trouble&#xD;
sir, to catch any one, or to allow myself to be caught by anybody. No,:air,&#xD;
catch me at it."&#xD;
"We will play some cards, Abel," said Dandoloski, "and you shall pay me&#xD;
all the win, and Ishall make you pay allt he lose, so one adantage will all be&#xD;
to you very much."&#xD;
'That will do."&#xD;
A couple:of hours passed rapidly away at cards, very muehto te advan&#xD;
tage of the ladies, who pocketed all the stakes without the smallest cren y,&#xD;
let who would: win or lose. Coffee was handed round and. then more cham-&#xD;
pagne, and then grapes, and then barrels of oysters were, opened ; and there&#xD;
was singing and dancing, and a chase of' the two young ladies by the gents&#xD;
among the shrubbery ; and when the sun, with a fiery glow; began slowly to&#xD;
descend in the western sky, and a cool air swept over the surface of the river.&#xD;
Abel proposed, with a champagne bottle in one hand, the cork of which he&#xD;
held down with his thumb, as the wire was snipped, and a glass in the other,&#xD;
a toast and sentiment.&#xD;

No--stay=-yes. I have seen you."&#xD;
"Ah ! you know the worm now."&#xD;
"You are in the service of colonel Elk," added Abel, and his voice shook as&#xD;
the idea crossed him that something had gone amiss. A death-like paleness&#xD;
came over Abel's face, and the perspiration broke out upon his browas he&#xD;
looked keenly at Jobus, and said-&#xD;
"Well-well ?"&#xD;
" Ah !" said Jobus.&#xD;
"You have a message for me&#xD;
"Oh dear, no."&#xD;
"From the colonel ?"&#xD;
Jobus shook his head.&#xD;

to you from myself. Will it please you to listen ?"&#xD;
"Ando and-Colonel Elk did not send you ?He has no message for me?&#xD;
Nothing has gone-that is-'-.he does not want me ?"g&#xD;
"Oh dear, no.&#xD;
"Ha, ha !" Abel laughed, and dashed his hands across his eyes, as he whia-&#xD;
pered to himself- What a relief !"'&#xD;
"You will listen tp me ?"&#xD;
Not now, my good fellow! Another time ! I am occupied now ! Go and&#xD;

sparkling glass of the bubbling seduction, which he'blhdsootnper-.&#xD;
mitted to be the enemy that had gone into his mouth tobselaaysobrains.r&#xD;
Abel took the glass, and his hand shook.     to steal away his brains,&#xD;

said in a hissing whisper in his ear-'P                        ,n&#xD;

Abel staggered back a pace or two.&#xD;

Abel drew a long breath.&#xD;

seem gay and at his ease, "Don't mind me. I am-that is, it's all right-&#xD;

ing fellow."&#xD;
" Come," said Johns to Abel-" cone !"&#xD;
"I will-I will. You-vou will all excuse me for a few moments, only a&#xD;
few moments, that is all. Ha ! ha ! It is quite a joke, that is all. Ha ! ha!1"&#xD;
Jobus led him away from them across the lawn, and past a clump of trees,&#xD;
and so out of sight, though not of sound, of the rather astonished party on the&#xD;
lawn.&#xD;
"Now." said Abel, "tell me all-all; for the love of God tell me all. What&#xD;
is it vou would say ?"&#xD;
"Hush! Everything is to fear from precipitation-everything to gain from&#xD;
coolness and courage."&#xD;
"Go on-tell me all. Do not madden me."&#xD;
"Young man, at the solicitation of Colonel Elk, and under the influence of&#xD;
his bad and debasing spirit, you signed your father's name to a bill for a thou-&#xD;
sand pounds."&#xD;
"I-did. But how came you to be aware of it ?"&#xD;
Johns pointed upwards, and Abel looked up, too, at the sky.&#xD;
"He," said Jobus, "works his way with the meanest tools. At times I feel&#xD;
that it is appointed to me to save you."&#xD;
" Save me&#xD;
'Yes. Do not grasp my arm so tightly ; you know not what you do. Oh !&#xD;
be calm-he calm."&#xD;
"I will try. Take your own course. Go your own way to work. I will&#xD;
only listen to you. Tell me all, though, I implore you."&#xD;
"I will. But you will promise me that nothing shall induce you to let Col-&#xD;
onel Elk know that I am your informant ?"&#xD;
"So help me Heaven, I will not !"&#xD;
"That will do. The'time will come when I shall tell him myself. I hope,&#xD;
poor degraded wretch that I am; but not yet-oh, not yet. Young man I&#xD;
saw you sign the bill-I saw you."&#xD;
Go on-tell me all."&#xD;
"Well, the colonel got money for the bill from a Jew discounter named&#xD;
Lyon. He again took it to get money for it to a Mr. Carnac, a lawyer."&#xD;
" Good Heavens--my father's solicitor !"&#xD;
" He-he ! Just so."&#xD;
"And you laugh !"&#xD;
"Oh, dear, no; quite a mistake-worms don't laugh. Don't say I laughed ;&#xD;
I'm afraid I was near it-but, no-no--not yet. It will be a singular fact in&#xD;
. natural history, that a worm has laughed, when some day I laugh ; but not&#xD;
" Well--well ?"&#xD;
"This Mr. Carnac showed the bill to your father."&#xD;
"Oh, God!"&#xD;
" ie repudiated it. Lyon brought it back to the colonel, who at once&#xD;
returned him his money, and I am here to tell you."&#xD;
"And the colonel has it ?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"Then I breathe again. There is but one-but one. Oh, what a relief !&#xD;
It has got back to the colonel's hands, and all will be well. Oh; why did you&#xD;
not tell me that at once&#xD;
"I thought it best to keep the worst news to the last."&#xD;
"The worst news !-but what else can you have to tell ?"&#xD;
"I will tell all. The colonel intends to assert that he new nothing of the&#xD;
forgery. but that you gave it to him as the genuine signature of your father,&#xD;
and he intends to threaten to prosecute. Do you understand me?"&#xD;
"Your words. I do."&#xD;
"And my meaning ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
12G&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
rwrr.. m j&#xD;
&#xD;
"That is impossible. Why the colonel is my friend."&#xD;
"Ah-ah ! Oh, I'm afraid I nearly smiled."&#xD;
"He is the man who would stand between me and:dishonor, rather than&#xD;
inflict it upon me. You judge him too harshly, Mr. Jons. You are much&#xD;
mistaken. From my heart I thank you for all that you have done fr ea&#xD;
and I will richly recmpense you; but as the colonel has the bill, all will&#xD;
well."&#xD;
"Unhappy young ran 1 I tell you that nothing short of your father a&#xD;
whole fortune will rescue that bill from Colonel Elk. He is your deadly foe.&#xD;
liHe will destroy you !"                                        fe&#xD;
"I will go to him at once."&#xD;
"noer-.4 say, no. There is another you should go 'o--not to dim."&#xD;
"Another?"&#xD;
"Yes,your father. There you know you will find a friend. Oh Mr. Mor-&#xD;
ton, it is not yet too late. Throw off at once and foreverthe mask ofdisguise&#xD;
that you wear, and that would haunt you for ever if you were totry to retain&#xD;
it still. Go to your father and tell him all. Conceal nothing-atmtr ot&#xD;
extenuate or fritter away nothing. Tell him all, and let him feel thathe has&#xD;
a son again. He will forgive you-he will aid you. With the money t han&#xD;
in your hand to redeem the bill, go to Elk and try your fortune withbiw.&#xD;
If he refuse, then you will know him thoroughly, and must fight with his&#xD;
evilmachinations as best you may. But now let me implore you to go to&#xD;
your father."&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
c I WILL go to my father at once," said Abel.&#xD;
"Thank Heaven for that !" exclaimed Jobus.                 will go&#xD;
"I will go at once. My father is at his hotel in Clarges-street. I sl will go&#xD;
there at once. A thousand thanks. I feel better with the very resolution to&#xD;
go to him. Rowley-Rowley, I say I"&#xD;
"Yes sir," said Rowley, as he ran across the lawn to his master.&#xD;
"The carriage !-in a moment--the carriage .!&#xD;
Yes, sir"&#xD;
The guests began to approach the spot, and Jobus said to Abel-&#xD;
"Go at once, I will speak to them."&#xD;
Abel darted through the house, and got to the outer gate abutting on the&#xD;
road.&#xD;
"What is it ?" cried everybody to Jobus. "Come, old fellow, tell us,"&#xD;
said one of the gents.&#xD;
"Now, ugly," said Lord Rokeley, "what's it all about ?"h    ladies&#xD;
"You'll be pitched into the river if you don't tell," said the young lde&#xD;
from the opera.&#xD;
"Come this way," said Jobus, in a mysterious whisper. "I'll show you.&#xD;
Hush ! hush ! this way."&#xD;
They all followed him down to the water's edge. ha d bought wJoas&#xD;
spreading itself over the scene, and there was the boat that  g&#xD;
over the river.&#xD;
"Now, ugly,"~ said Lord Rokeley, "tell us."&#xD;
"Tell'us, beautiful," said Dandoloski. "Tell us about the one small family&#xD;
of the bad Abel."-&#xD;
Johbs sprang into the boat, and seizing an oar, he said to the waterman-&#xD;
" Push off quick-that will do. Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.!-&#xD;
He ! he !-Oh, dear! A worm laughs at fools and rogues-at ladies of liberal&#xD;
morals, and their dupes. Good evening ! He !-oh -"&#xD;
*      *      *    '*       *      *      *      *      *&#xD;
Abel Morton took the advice that had been given him, in the garden at&#xD;
3Richmond, by the worm, as Mr. Jobus delighted to call himself.&#xD;
it was quite dark when the wretched victim of his own thoughtless pas-&#xD;
sions staggered up the steps of the hotel in Clarges-street, where he expected&#xD;
he would find his father.  -&#xD;
It would be impossible to depict the state of mind of the unhappy Abel&#xD;
during his rapid journey from Richmond to London. If he had led a long&#xD;
life of real extravagance and sensual enjoyments, the sufferings of that hour&#xD;
and a half would have been a dear price to pay for such fleeting enjoyments.&#xD;
Perhaps Abel really thought more, and more to the real purpose of thought&#xD;
during that time than ever he had done in his whole life before.&#xD;
And what an errand he was going upon !-what a confession he had to&#xD;
make !&#xD;
Time was, and that only a very short period before-so short, that it&#xD;
might be reckoned almost by hours-when he had shrunk from the idea of&#xD;
going to his father, merely to tell him that he owed a few debts.&#xD;
Abel thought it quite impossible that he could face his father, his mother,&#xD;
and Emma, and tell them he had exceeded the allowance that had been made&#xD;
to him.&#xD;
Oh, what a relief now it would have been to him, if he could have felt that&#xD;
he had no more to tell than that!a&#xD;
But Abel is upon the steps in Clarges-street. Now, Abel, i dress, man-&#xD;
ners, and general appearance, is a gentleman ; but how like a poor, cringing&#xD;
varlet does he ascend those steps ! How abject is his look-how shuffling&#xD;
his gait-how completely has that nobility of rectitude which all men inherit,&#xD;
and which none but themselves can ever deprive them of, departed from him!&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.                      128&#xD;
It is quite a moral to look at Abel Morton as he ascends the steps of that&#xD;
hotel.&#xD;
But now he has reached the hall, and he he has pushed open the swinging&#xD;
glass doors that noiselessly close either way. A smart dapper waiter makes&#xD;
the hurried, offhand bow of his fraternity, and utters the words.-&#xD;
'Coffee-room, ir?   first door tothe left, sir.-Yes, sir-coming, sir!n&#xD;
A bell had tingled sharply, and the waiter was gone.&#xD;
Abel staggered to the bar, at which he had received that letter which the&#xD;
diabolical craft-of Colonel Blk had left for him with the hope' that it would&#xD;
Sever, or tend to sever, the ties that bound him to his once happy home, aid&#xD;
he addressed the girl who presided there.&#xD;
"Is Sir John Morton staying here at present ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"I--that is, I wish to see him."&#xD;
"Thomasl"&#xD;
" Yes miss."&#xD;
"Is Sir John Morton at home ?"&#xD;
Think somiss. The young lady and Mrs. B. upstairs. Think Sir John's&#xD;
'with 'em, miss."&#xD;
"Take up, this getleman's name, Thomas."&#xD;
"Yes, sir--card, sir?  Yes, sir-yes, miss."&#xD;
"I-a--that is, I haven't a card with me," said Abel. "I will go up at&#xD;
ponce. They don't know me-I mean they know me quite well."&#xD;
"Yes, sir-no, sir.?&#xD;
The waiter looked a little suspicious, and timidly counted over six silver&#xD;
spoons that were on the front of the bar; but the young lady who presided&#xD;
-at the bar came to Abel's aid, and said, in her most winning accents-&#xD;
I think I recollect, you, sir ; you called once before. Are you not Sir&#xD;
John Morton's son, sir?"&#xD;
C f-_am"&#xD;
"It's all right, Thomas. The gentleman can go op. How can you be so&#xD;
stupid, Thomas ? I have no patience with you."&#xD;
Abel reached the landing upon thetop of the stairs. A grimly black statue&#xD;
carried a lamp there, which cast a tolerable radiance around the spot. There&#xD;
was the door which he had but to open to confront those dear friends who&#xD;
had never known so much unhappiness for many years as he had used&#xD;
them.&#xD;
Well might the guilty son tremble.&#xD;
Once he wavered in his resolution, ,and the idea that he might yet manage&#xD;
to leave the hotel without his presence being known to those whom he h&#xD;
come to seek, crossed his mind; but his good angel at that moment prevailed&#xD;
and persuaded him to stay.&#xD;
Where else'was he to go&#xD;
To Colonel Elk? Alas'! had not Johns said enough to dissipate the idea&#xD;
that he would receive much commiseration in that quarter? At all events,&#xD;
could he expect that such a man would listen to him, to the detriment of his&#xD;
own pocket?&#xD;
"No-no," sighed Abel. "If I go to him, as go I must and will, I must&#xD;
ga with the means of paying that dreadful bill; and where are those means&#xD;
to come from but from my father, whom I have so deeply wronged? I sst&#xD;
go through with this dreadful ordeal."&#xD;
So Abel tapped gently with his knuckles at the door of the room. :&#xD;
There was no answer.&#xD;
A faint feeling came over.Abel, and he tapped again.&#xD;
Now, he thought, or it might be only fancy, but yet he did think, that he&#xD;
heard a sound as if some one were sobbing in the room; and as he heard such&#xD;
sounds, the blood seemed to pause at his heart, and he leant against the black&#xD;
and grim-looking statue with the lamp for temporary support-&#xD;
" Who is it ?" he gasped. "Who is it that weeps for me I, Yes; it must&#xD;

be for me, for who else have they to weep for but Abel, the profligate, the&#xD;
criminal ?"&#xD;
Again he tapped at the door of the apartment, and as before, no notice was&#xD;
taken of the demand for admission. The fact was, that such a trembling ter-&#xD;
ror was at the heart of poor Abel, that the third time he tapped for admission&#xD;
he did so lighter than at first..&#xD;
Still he could hear that sobbing from some one in the room.&#xD;
"God, who can it be?"&#xD;
A waiter came shuffling up the stairs, and ashamed of being seen upon the&#xD;
landing in such a state of agitation, Abel gathered boldness for the moment,&#xD;
and opened the door.&#xD;
In another moment he was in a large and handsome room, and he had closed&#xD;
the door behind him. All was darkness in the room, save the weak reflection&#xD;
of a light that came from an adjoining apartment, the door of communication&#xD;
to which was open about a couple of inches ; but that ray of light fell upon a&#xD;
kneeling figure, who was resting upon a chair and sobbing.&#xD;
It was a female figure.&#xD;
Abel shook again, as he by a single glance saw all this ; and as the door&#xD;
when he closed it went with rather a sharp noise shut. the kneeling figure&#xD;
looked up a little, and said quietly-&#xD;
"Is it you, dear uncle ?"-&#xD;
Then Abel knew the voice, and in an instant he recognised the kneeling&#xD;
figure as that of his cousin Emma.&#xD;
Abel had to make a great effort to speak, but at last he did manage to say-&#xD;
" Emma !"&#xD;
With a cry she sprang to her feet, and clasping her hands, she said-&#xD;
"Oh, it is Abel ! It is he ! He comes at last. Abel ! Abel !-Oh God, it&#xD;
is Abel, at last !"&#xD;
She sprang forward and fell into his arms in an hysterical passion of weep-&#xD;
ing. The door leading to the adjoining room was flung open, and Mrs. Ben,&#xD;
net, with a lighted candle in her hand, came into the front room.&#xD;
"Oh, gracious, what is this ?"&#xD;
" Abel! Abel!'" sobbed Emma. "It is our Abel, who has come to us at&#xD;
last !"&#xD;
"What !" cried Mrs. Bennet. "The alligator ?"&#xD;
" Yes-no, no-I do not mean that. It is Abel, and he comes to us in love&#xD;
and-and in repentance; do you not, Abel ?"&#xD;
He tried to speak, but a choking sensation in his throat prevented him, and&#xD;
he staggered to a chair, upon which he fell rather than seated himself.&#xD;
"Abel, can you not speak to me&#xD;
" Fiddle-de-dee !" said Mrs. Bennet.&#xD;
"Oh, ring the bell quickly."&#xD;
"No, Miss Emma, we don't want all the waiters and pert chambermaids of&#xD;
the hotel here, hardly. I suppose the real 'truth is, that the orang-outang is&#xD;
ashamed of himself, and has nothing to say."&#xD;
"You are very cruel, Mrs. Bennet."?&#xD;
" Oh, dear, yes-no doubt I am, of course. Now, porcupine, how dare you&#xD;
look us in the face ?"&#xD;
Mrs. Bennet held the candle close to poor Abel,,so that when he made an&#xD;
effort to look up, which he did directly, he saw nothing but it.&#xD;
"How pale he is," sighed Emma.&#xD;
" Ah, to be sure.' Tigers of the jungle may well look pale, I rather think,"&#xD;
added Mrs. Bennet.&#xD;
" Emma," said Abel faintly&#xD;
"Yes, Abel, I am here."&#xD;
"Father-my father ! I do not see him."&#xD;
Abel's eyes wandered round the large and handsomely decorated apartment&#xD;
and certainly Sir John was not visible.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE sound of a slow and solemn footstep upon the stairs now came quite&#xD;
plainly, upon -the ears of all in the room.&#xD;
Emma was too terrified at the vehement language of Abel to be capable of&#xD;
making any reply to his fierce interrogatories; and it devolved upon Mrs. Ben-&#xD;
net to cry out-&#xD;
"Good gracious ! why it is Sir John, of course !"&#xD;
" My father ?"&#xD;
"in his galoshes," added Mrs. Bennet.a&#xD;
"1-I thought-no matter. I am very faint! Some water-water i.    is&#xD;
my father. 'My heart tells me now that it is. I came here to see him. Why&#xD;
should I try to shun him now&#xD;
Emma tremblingly poured from a decanter that was onthe table, a glass of&#xD;
water, and held it to the fevered lips of Abel.&#xD;
"What have you to fear ?" she said, "What is that you can possibly have&#xD;
to fear'? Is it possible that any one can have made you doubt your father's&#xD;
affection for you, Abel ?"t                                   -&#xD;
"No-no! But he ought not to love me-he ought not.. HItisI-   I n&#xD;
-I myself that have raised-the impassable barrier betwixt him and me.  e&#xD;
comes !"&#xD;
Abel let his head fall upon his breast as the door of the room opened, and&#xD;
Sir John Morton, with a slow and heavy step, looking so deathly pale that&#xD;
he might have been taken for the spectre of himself, entered the apartment.&#xD;
Emma crept towards the door, and stood before him for a moment.&#xD;
" Uncle," she said, "dear uncle."&#xD;
"Yes, my dear Emma. What would you say to me, my darling?      You&#xD;
are all that is left to the old man to love now."&#xD;
" Oh, no-no--no, uncle !"&#xD;
"Yes, my dear, yes. Abel is-that is, he has left me now. We shall never&#xD;
meet again."&#xD;
Emma could not speak, but she stepped aside and pointed to the figure of&#xD;
Abel, as it sat doubled up upon the chair, with the face hidden in its hands.&#xD;
Sir John Morton stared and uttered an exclamation.&#xD;
"What is this '" he cried. "Abel ! Impossible ! No-no -"&#xD;
"Yes, uncle, it is Abel !"&#xD;
"The rhinoceros has come, sir," said Mrs. Bennet&#xD;
"Your son !" said Emma.&#xD;
"No! I have no son&#xD;
" Oh uncle, uncle, say not so !"&#xD;
"It is true, girl !"&#xD;
"It is true," said Abel, rising with an effort. "It is true, and I-I have no&#xD;
father, and that is true tool I have no purpose here ! This is an intrusion,&#xD;
very great intrusion. I know it is-I feel it is-I feel that it is! I will go !"&#xD;
"Abel, you shall not !" cried Emma.&#xD;
"Yes, yes ! Farewell ! Sir, I-that is, Sir John Morton, you see, I say&#xD;
nothing to deprecate your just anger. Sir, you are right-quite right. No&#xD;
son of yours could act as I have acted. You have no son&#xD;
" Abel !" shrieked Emma, "-this must not be."&#xD;
"I-will go now! I will go'"&#xD;
"Uncle, can you look upon him as he is, and hold to this stern purposehIs&#xD;
it possible ?  Is it your nature?  No, it cannot be, it is not! Abel, you shall&#xD;
not go! Kneel at your father's feet ! He loves you still! He does! By&#xD;
Heaven he does love you still !"&#xD;
Sir John Morton fell heavily upon the floor.i.de.n&#xD;
Emma shrieked for aid, and Abel flew to his father's side, crying out in&#xD;
frantic accents-&#xD;
" He is dead ! He is dead ! He is no more, and I have killed him,1 I am a&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.                       127&#xD;
murderer now ! It wanted but this last stroke to make me all that I was&#xD;
surely born to be. A forger-a thief. and now a murderer !"&#xD;
"Help! Murder !" cried Mrs. Benret.&#xD;
There was a rush of footsteps upon the stairs, and the door was flung open,&#xD;
as the landlord and several waiters appeared, alarmed by the cries from the&#xD;
rooms of Sir John Morton.&#xD;
"What is it?  Oh. what is it ?" cried everybody.&#xD;
"He breathes," said Emma.&#xD;
"He lives !" cried Abel.&#xD;
"it's only a slight faint," said Mrs. Bennet. "Go awl all of you, do.&#xD;
The old gentleman hadn't seen his son for never so lo  and, you see, as&#xD;
there was not much light, he took him for a ghost."&#xD;
"Dear me !" said the landlord.&#xD;
"Bless us !" said all the waiters.&#xD;
"There, now, go all of you, do," added Mrs. _Bennet. "We are much&#xD;
obliged, but Sir John is better now."&#xD;
The landlord and the waiters retired, and then, with some difficulty, Abel&#xD;
and Emma and Mrs. Bennet got Sir John Morton on the couch, and he -was&#xD;
able to sit up in a moment or two. He looked wildly about him, and then&#xD;
suddenly bursting into a flood of tears, he spread out his arms, crying-.&#xD;
"Abel ! my boy, Abel!"&#xD;
In another moment Abel was pressed to his father's part.&#xD;
Mrs. Bennet slunk away, shaking like an autumn leaf, into the next room,&#xD;
and Emma, too, felt that the interview between the father and the son was&#xD;
too sacred a thing for any one else to participate in-so she went to the far&#xD;
end of the large room, and sat as still as a statue, trying to persuade herself&#xD;
that she was looking out of the window, and that she saw the people and the&#xD;
carriages that were passing in the street below.&#xD;
It was some minutes before either the father or the son could speak, and&#xD;
then it was Sir John, who said-&#xD;
"Your father's heart is still your home, my Abel."&#xD;
Abel felt choking, but he managed to say-&#xD;
"Can it be possible that you can forgive me, father ?"&#xD;
"Yes, my dear-yes. Anything, and everything; so that I hold you thus&#xD;
to my heart again. Oh, my child, my Abel-I was so desolate without you !"&#xD;
"You know all, father ?"&#xD;
"Yes, my boy, I do know all. But why do you weep?     Come, now, we&#xD;
will be all happy once again."&#xD;
"Happyw?"&#xD;
"Yes-and why not ? Have you not, like the prodigal, returned at last--&#xD;
and shall we not rejoice on your return ?"&#xD;
"Oh, God !" said Abel, "and this world of pure and holy forgiving affec-&#xD;
tion was what I disregarded for the follies that have occupied me. Father,&#xD;
father, I was mad-mad !-I must have been mad !"&#xD;
"We will think so, Abel-youth has its follies, which, in excess, may be&#xD;
considered to be a sort of midsummer madness-and so we will say no more&#xD;
about it. You are with me, and that is all I care to know. Come, I must&#xD;
see you smile again, and we must go home to-night."&#xD;
"To-night, father-so late ?"&#xD;
"Ay, my boy--late as it is, we will give your mother a few hours of hap-&#xD;
pier refreshing sleep than she would otherwise have. Where is Emma ?"&#xD;
" Here, uncle."&#xD;
"Come, my darling-you see that all is well, now."&#xD;
Emma began crying so bitterly that nothing would comfort her; but she&#xD;
kissed her uncle, and then held out both her hands to Abel, who pressed&#xD;
them to his lips ; and then, still sobbing, Emma rushed into the adjoining&#xD;
room, where Mrs. Bennet had taken refuge.&#xD;
" Dear girl !" said Sir John. "Oh, Abel, indeed she loves-you!n&#xD;
"I am not worthy of her, father."seo                yu&#xD;

"But you may be. The future is your own yet, Abel. But let me look at&#xD;
you, my boy. Alas ! how thin, and pale, and wan you are ! Why, we shall'&#xD;
have to nurse you to get the color back into your cheeks again. You see that&#xD;
I-I am quite hearty !"&#xD;
Poor Sir John ! He was but the shadow of his former self. Abel quite&#xD;
shuddered as he looked at him.&#xD;
"Now, my son, we will sit quietly for about an hour, to let Emma recover&#xD;
her composure, and then we will go to lampstead."&#xD;
"But, father-father -"&#xD;
"What would you say, Abel ?"&#xD;
" That-di'eadful-bill !"'&#xD;
"Say no more about it. A mistake--a mere mistake. I will pay it when&#xD;
it becomes due, and there will be an end of it."&#xD;
"But listen'to me, father. It is in the hands of Elk--that man who was&#xD;
my ruin. While it remains with him, we know not what may happen; and&#xD;
-and I owe him other monies. Oh, father, you do not know how very heed-&#xD;
less.and how very wicked I have been !"&#xD;
"The bill has got back to Elk, has it ?" said Sir John. "Well, he will be&#xD;
no friend of yours, Abel, when he finds out that he has lost you; so it will&#xD;
be as well to pay him, and be done with him. You shall go to him in the&#xD;
morning with the money for the bill, and redeem that, and then ask him for&#xD;
an account of all other claims he hus against you."&#xD;
. "Oh, father, to-night-to-night !"&#xD;
".To-night ?"&#xD;
"Yes-yes ! I know I am unworthy that you should do this much for me&#xD;
at all-I know that well, father ; but yet I know that it pleases you to do it,&#xD;
and that in doing it, you wish it well done ; and so I say, let it be to-night,&#xD;
if you love me' I cannot sleep while that bill is in the hands of Colonel Elk.&#xD;
Oh. let it be to-night !"&#xD;
'If you like, Abel, certainly. And yet, if I pay where is the danger ?"&#xD;
"Father, you have already properly and truthfully repudiated it."&#xD;
"Yes, but-but if the money be forthcoming, surely all will be well ?"&#xD;
"I tremble, to doubt that, father. But let me go at once.. If that arch-vil-&#xD;
lain Elk, for such he is, should strive to make a market of the bill-should&#xD;
attempt to use it for revenge, as well as for profit-oh, father, there are many&#xD;
awful possibilities."&#xD;
"You alarm me, Abel. I will give you a cheque for the amount at once.&#xD;
And now, in my turn, I say, to-night let all be settled. You shall go to him&#xD;
at once. You have information that I have not."&#xD;
"I have, father."S&#xD;
"Then you shall tell me all at another time, Abel."&#xD;
"Yes, father, indeed I will."&#xD;
Abel shook with apprehension as the words of poor Jobus recurred to him&#xD;
-those words which signified, although obscurely, how much danger there&#xD;
was to be apprehended from Elk's continued possession of the forged accep-&#xD;
tance.&#xD;
I .am warned by a friend," he added ; "but as you say, father, there will&#xD;
be time to tell you all when I return. I will go at once."&#xD;
"Do so, Abel; and I hope to see you soon return with a happier aspect.&#xD;
Calm yourself, my dear. There is, after all, nothing in your case that money&#xD;
may not put to rights."&#xD;
"No, father, I hope-that is, I think nothing."&#xD;
Sir John Morton drew a cheque for a thousand pounds, being the full amount&#xD;
of the bill; and as he handed it to Abel, he said-&#xD;
"Give him that, without reference to what he received from the Jew, or paid&#xD;
to you. Let him have the amount in full, and that will surely satisfy even hia&#xD;
cupidity to the utmost."&#xD;
"Father, I know not how to thank you."&#xD;
"Hush, Abel; between you and me there is affection, which' goes so far&#xD;
&#xD;
b&#xD;
&#xD;
1ItY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.                  i29&#xD;
beyond thanks that they should never be mentioned at all. ' Now go at once,&#xD;
my dear boy, for I see you are anxious to do so."&#xD;
I am, father-I am."&#xD;
"And tell him to call here to-morrow, when I will see him and settle alI&#xD;
with him upon your account."&#xD;
"Too good-you are too good, father."&#xD;
"Go-go, now. I have not been so happy, my boy, for a long, long time,&#xD;
as I am at this present moment."&#xD;
Abel would have left the room at once, but Emma just at that moment came&#xD;
from the next apartment, and Sir John, laying his hand upon Abel's-arm, said&#xD;
in a low voice-~&#xD;
" The bill affair is between you and me only, Abel. Not even your mother&#xD;
will ever know of it."&#xD;
Oh, what a relief that was to Abel! -He was almost upon the point ofgreet.&#xD;
ing Emma with a smile as he said-&#xD;
"Dear Emma, I shall soon return."&#xD;
"What, Abel," she said, "are you going from us again so soon ?"&#xD;
tOnly for a little time, my dear," said Sir John. "Let him goat onde, and&#xD;
then he will be the sooner back to us."&#xD;
"Go then, Abel."&#xD;
Emma was smiling through her tears, and Abel Morton: with the cheque for&#xD;
a thousand pounds in his pocket, at once left the room and the hotel.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXV.&#xD;
HEEDLESS now of a thick rain that was falling, poor Abel dashed through&#xD;
the reeking streets in the direction of the colonels house. The distance from&#xD;
the hotel in Clarges street to that ill-omened abode was very short; and Abel&#xD;
could go quicker on foot than he coul if he delayed the time to look for and&#xD;
hire a conveyance.&#xD;
It would be difficult indeed to define the feelings of Abel Morton as he thus&#xD;
sped madly on, jostling aside the passengers on his route to the colonel's house..&#xD;
At times, the reception he had met with from his father and from Emma quite&#xD;
overcame him, and the tears would gush to his eyes.&#xD;
then a feeling of deep and desperate indignation would come across him at&#xD;
the conduct of the colonel, accompanied by another which was of wild and&#xD;
strange wonder how he, Abel, could have allowed himself to be the victim of&#xD;
such a man,&#xD;
Yes, now that he began to see Colonel Elk in his true colors, he began, in-&#xD;
deed, to think that some hallucination, must have been over him to induce him&#xD;
ever to listen to such weak and gross temptations.&#xD;
When some poor victim quaffs the cup of pleasure, and is giddy with enjoy-&#xD;
ment and delight at finding it at his lips, it generally happens that at the period&#xD;
of reaction he wonders at himself for yielding to what then he cares not for,&#xD;
bnt which was at the time such an all-engrossing delight.&#xD;
Perhaps the repentance of the profligate and debauchee is only in proportion&#xD;
to his sins.&#xD;
Abel reached the colonel's house, and stopped, faint and staggering at the&#xD;
area rails. He drew his breath laboriously, and now he felt that he might as&#xD;
well have walked easily all the way, for he had to wait to recover himself a&#xD;
sufficient time to have done so without hurrying at all.&#xD;
Abel glanced up at the indows of the house. Through the inte stices of&#xD;
its Venetian bins came long va °ed pencils of light, and once a roaring laugh&#xD;
came upon the ears of the listener.&#xD;
Colonel Elk was evidently enjoying himself with his friends, and Abel Mor-&#xD;
ben, who but a short time since would have been first and foremost at the&#xD;
board, was clinging to the area railings and looking more like a ghost than a&#xD;
living man.&#xD;

HEADS AND HEARTS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
"I will see him though," thought Abel, "were he in the midst of the wildest,&#xD;
maddest crew that he ever assembled within these walls, I will see him-&#xD;
Abel seized the knocker and thundered at the door. It was opened by a&#xD;
strange man, whom Abel had never seen before.&#xD;
"Is Colonel Elk within."&#xD;
No, s."&#xD;
"It's a lie, that," said Abel, and dashing aside the opposition of the man, he&#xD;
strode through the hall, and up the stairs to the door of the room he knew so&#xD;
well as that in which he had stultified his faculties with the wild orgies that&#xD;
the colonel was in the habit of holding with his intimates.&#xD;
A roar of laughter followed some sally of wit, as Abel laid his hand upon&#xD;
the handle of the door of the apartment. He waited half a minute until the&#xD;
mirth was on the subsidence, and then he entered the room. .&#xD;
Some half-dozen people were there, and the ill-omened Lord Carlin sat op o-&#xD;
site to the door. Colonel Elk was lolling upon an easy chair at the head of&#xD;
the table.&#xD;
Decanters-vases of flowers-fruit-wine-coolers, and all the wild disorder&#xD;
of a drinking party strewed the table. The eyes that turned upon Abel were&#xD;
for the most part unsteady with inebriety, but the glance of the colonel was&#xD;
like a flash of lightning.&#xD;
"Colonel Elk," said Abel.&#xD;
"Well, Morton my boy-what now, eh?    You are late."&#xD;
"And unexpected."&#xD;
"Not at all. I sent to-your place to say I had forgot an appointment. I&#xD;
had to meet the present good company, and to hope that when you got away&#xD;
from the fete business at Richmond, you would come round ; and here you&#xD;
are."&#xD;
"No, Colonel Elk."Ba&#xD;
"Indeed! Then I see what others see not, I suppose. But come, take a&#xD;
glass of champagne, if ghosts drink at all. If you are not Abel Morton you&#xD;
are his double; and I like the original quite well enough to say welcome to the&#xD;
imitation."&#xD;
"Colonel Elk, I have something to say to you."&#xD;
" Say it, my boy."&#xD;
"In private."&#xD;
"Stuff! Say it here. Has the fair Dandoloski jilted you at last, or has&#xD;
your bay nag bolted?  What's the row&#xD;
" fa ! ha !" roared the guests. "What is it ?"&#xD;
"Why don't you sit down'1" said Lord Carlin. -" It ain't civil to be stand-&#xD;
ing there looking on and playing the spy upon other men's potations."&#xD;
Abel placed his hand upon his head, and then turning to Lord Carlin, he&#xD;
saidl-&#xD;
" Ah, I recollect. You and I, my lord, have met before in this room, I&#xD;
think ?"&#xD;
"Very likely. Ha! ha ! Come, spy, sit down."&#xD;
"I'd rather be a spy, although I am none, my lord, than a villain !"&#xD;
"A what '"&#xD;
" A villain !""&#xD;
Lord Carlin half rose, aid seized a bottle, as he cried-&#xD;
"Say that again, and I'll throw this bottle at your head."&#xD;
"No, thank you, my lord," said the person next him. "That's my bottle.&#xD;
Throw your own if you please."&#xD;
A roar of laughter followed this, during which Lord Carlinflung a decanter&#xD;
at Abel ; but it passed him, and shivered to pieces an antique vase that was&#xD;
upon a pedestal behind him.&#xD;
"Hold !" cried Elk, rising. "If Mr. Morton comes here to insult my guests,&#xD;
I beg to request his absence."&#xD;
lie shall hear from me," said Lord Carlin.&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.                      131&#xD;
"It will be a disgrace," said Abel; " but through life one must, at times,&#xD;
hear from disreputable people."e&#xD;
"I will have no more of this," said Elk. "Gentlemen, continue in your&#xD;
seats. I will soon return to you. Mr. Morton says he has something to say&#xD;
to me in -private. I, too, have something to say to him, which probably he&#xD;
would not wish to be too public. Now, Mr. Morton, if you will follow me&#xD;
although you have neither studied time nor place for your interview, you shall&#xD;
have it.&#xD;
"I will follow you,'4aid Abel.&#xD;
The room to which the colonel led Abel Morton was upon the ground-floor.&#xD;
It was a handsome apartment, but very dimly lighted; and yet what light&#xD;
there was came from above, and was passable.&#xD;
After closing the door, the colonel turned to Abel, and said-&#xD;
"Well?"&#xD;
"Colonel Elk, I--"&#xD;
"Go on, sir."&#xD;
"You call me 'sir!'"&#xD;
"Why, yes. The fact is,-I feel a little aggrieved at something, that is all.&#xD;
But say what you have to say, for your looks seem to imply that you come&#xD;
here in a hostile spirit."&#xD;
"Then my looks belie me, Colonel Elk, for I do not. I come on a specified&#xD;
errand. The bill--"E                 f.i&#xD;
"What bill ?"&#xD;
"Can you affect ignorance?  The bill for a thousand pounds that you--&#xD;
that is, that I- "&#xD;
Oh, I comprehend. The bill of your father's ?"&#xD;
"No, colonel-do not call it that: you and I know better. You know with&#xD;
what anguish-with what mental throes I yielded to your persuasions, and,&#xD;
in an evil hour, signed tlat bill !"&#xD;
"Eh?"&#xD;
The look of intense astonishment that the colonel put on was one of the&#xD;
most admirably acted things in the world. -.&#xD;
- "Can this be possible ?"&#xD;
"What possible ?"&#xD;
"Why, that you--that--But it don't matter. Colonel Elk here is a&#xD;
cheque for a thousand pounds, the full amount of the bill. What I have&#xD;
received of its proceeds does not, as you well know, reach one-half-nay, not&#xD;
one-third of that sum. Take the cheque, and give me the bill."&#xD;
The colonel at once suspected that Abel knew something of Mr. Lyon's&#xD;
trepidation, and he became anxious to know through what channel he got his&#xD;
information--although, in his own mind, he set it down that Sir John and Mr.&#xD;
Carnac had ferreted him out, and told him all.&#xD;
"Well, Morton, and when you have paid the bill-what then ?"&#xD;
"Then, colonel,°you and I part, and I hope to Heaven I may never look upon&#xD;
your face again."&#xD;
"Oh, indeed ! And pray, my young friend, what put it into your head&#xD;
that I had the bill ?"&#xD;
"Lyon returned it to you."&#xD;
"He knows all," thought the colonel. "But how, is the mystery-Ahb&#xD;
well ! who told you that-eh ?"&#xD;
"I decline giving the name of my informant. There is the money : I ask&#xD;
you for the bill."&#xD;
"I have it not."&#xD;
"You have it not ?"&#xD;
"Certainly not. The fact is, when Lyon came to me-you know he came&#xD;
to me ?"&#xD;
"Yes, in a rage and a fright, and demanded his money again."&#xD;
The colonel paced the room twice.&#xD;
"Who in the name of all that's- wonderful has told him that 7" he mut-&#xD;

tered. Then, suddenly pausing, he said, "When you saw Lyon, did he say&#xD;
anything about meeting me to-morrow, at twelve-?"&#xD;
"I have not seen Lyon."&#xD;
The colonel was thrown completely back again into .the region of conjec-&#xD;
ture, and he glared at peor Abel as if he would look right into his heart, and&#xD;
there discover what it was that was hidden, and that he so much wanted to&#xD;
know.&#xD;
"Mr. Morton," he said, with rigid calmness, "Lyon did come to me and&#xD;
informed me that your father had repudiated the acceptance."&#xD;
"He did-naturally he did."&#xD;
"And I felt obliged to give the money back to Lyon."&#xD;
"Here is the full amount."&#xD;
"And as I, in my unsuspecting nature had been so grossly deceived by you&#xD;
whom I considered a friend-so grossly as to have palmed off upon me a for-&#xD;
gery-_"&#xD;
"Colonel Elk !"&#xD;
"A forgery, I say, for a true bill, I feel that there is a duty I owe to my-&#xD;
self ?"&#xD;
"Yourself?"&#xD;
"A duty I owe to society."&#xD;
"Monstrous !"&#xD;
"As you please, sir. The bill is in the hands of a professional man, who,&#xD;
at my request, will keep it for the purposes of public justice, or give it up to&#xD;
me, according as I shall dictate to him. Sir John Morton, if put upon his&#xD;
oath, dare not own the acceptance as his. Mr. Lyon is one witness, Mr.&#xD;
Carnac is another, I am a third."&#xD;
"You ?"&#xD;
"Yes. I can see that you came here to-night, and dragged me from my&#xD;
hospitable board to listen to your wild offers to bribe me to forego a prosecu-&#xD;
tion !"&#xD;
"A prosecution ?"I&#xD;
"Yes. Areyou too far gone in the stupidity of guilt to understand me?  I&#xD;
say, a prosecution for forgery ! Forgery, sir-a base, deliberate forgery !--&#xD;
Do you understand me now?"&#xD;
Abel sank faint and dizzy into a chair.&#xD;
"Oh, this is not real !" he said.                        .&#xD;
"Very good, sir ; I will leave you to that idea. Perchance its reality&#xD;
will become a little more apparent shortly."  -&#xD;
"No, no, stop ! You are jesting?"&#xD;
"Sir!&#xD;
"I say you cannot mean what you say. You or I must be mad. I&#xD;
tell you, Colonel Elk, my father will pay you all. This is his cheque.&#xD;
'Tis only for the bill. Whatever other claims you may have against me&#xD;
he will settle with you in full. Let me not think you worse than a devil !"&#xD;
"And what do you see in me, sir, that you should think I would sully&#xD;
my hands by compounding a felony ?"&#xD;
"What?"           -&#xD;
"Compounding a felony, sir. That is the term. That is the act you&#xD;
propose to me. For a few paltry hundreds of pounds, you think, sir to&#xD;
jnduce me to forego my duty to the public of this commercial country? No,&#xD;
sir, you are mistaken."&#xD;
"But you--you it was who urged me to commit the act. It was at&#xD;
your most earnest intercession I did it. You it was who painted to me, in,&#xD;
alas ! too seductive colors, its advantages, and declared its absolute safety&#xD;
If I am guilty, then are you doubly so."&#xD;
"Dreams, sir, dreams !"&#xD;
"No, Colonel Elk, these are no dreams. I too, can threaten !"&#xD;
The colonel stepped up to Morton and whispered in hissear-&#xD;
" Where are your witnesses-eh ?  Where are they?&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROrHER, THE COLONEL.&#xD;
The name of Johns came to the lips of Morton but he di&#xD;
lie merely said-ps                       o   ,    h   d not utter it.&#xD;
"I have them.&#xD;
" Ha ! ha!" laughed the colonel. aEven if you had, Abelwhere&#xD;
would be the use? They would not be believed. You would only he&#xD;

and if you succeeded, Abel Morton, would that whiten you-eh ?--Answere&#xD;
that."                                                          m&#xD;
"No-God, no !"&#xD;
"Of course not. You are yet, Abel, a reasonable man-a very reasonable&#xD;
man. Come, you want the bill."&#xD;
"I do--I do !"&#xD;
"You want it of me at any price ?"&#xD;
"Yes-oh, yes. My father will pay you all. To free me-fromyour&#xD;
devilish grasp, he will pay you all that you can demand."fy&#xD;
"That is well. Now we understand each other, Abel. . I have your life&#xD;
in my handso-mark you, your life. As a gentleman of public spirit, I could&#xD;
take that bill to armagistrate, and at once relate such a tale as would secure&#xD;
your immediate arrest and committal for trial, upon the enforced evidence of&#xD;
your father, Mr. Carnac, Lyon, and myself; but-but, Abel, you can tell&#xD;
your father that I would come to terms, and no better go-between could&#xD;
be found, for if the negotiation should fail, and you attempt to give an account&#xD;
of it, no one will believe you, the felon !" , andnyouoattemptato giveanaaccoun&#xD;
" Go on," said Abel, faintly.&#xD;
"I set some store by the bill, but yet I will sell it to youalongwithall&#xD;
its powers of mischief."i                        o        g   ia&#xD;
"Yes-yes. My father will satisfy even your cupidity."&#xD;
"Very good. You were kind enough to inform me, my dear Abel. that&#xD;
your father had in the public funds a sum of thirty thousand pounds. What&#xD;
he has at his bankers I will not inquire into. BtuoatrferWohmao&#xD;
the thirty thousand pounds in the funds, I will give up this bill !"&#xD;
Abel sprang to his feet.&#xD;
"God !" he cried, "am I trafficking with the father of all sins ?-i&#xD;
human' being with whom I hold converse, or a devil ?"S-this&#xD;
"Go on-go on ! This is highly melodramaticc"&#xD;
"Elk! Monster ! Fiend I"&#xD;
"Bravo !-bravo ! Bravissimo !"&#xD;
"The' bill ! Give it to me, or by Heaven I will force it from ou at the&#xD;
hazard of your life, villain !I"y&#xD;
"And do you think that I am fool enough to carry it about with me? No&#xD;
no, my old friend, Abel, I am too old a fox for that; and if anything serious,&#xD;
you understand, happens to me, my professional friend carries-the transaction&#xD;
to a magistrate at once. Come-come, calm yourself. All will be well."&#xD;
"This is too much. Wretch ! is it my soul that you would entangle in the&#xD;
snares of your diabolical villainy? Is it murder you would wish me to com-&#xD;

upon me, and you will rue it.""Nbtetodeha-tan"&#xD;

HEADS AND HEARTS; OR,&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ir was at an early hour in the morning following the interview between&#xD;
Abel and Colonel Elk. that Jobus, who was not as yet suspected by the colo-&#xD;
nel, rose and stepped out of the house.&#xD;
Jobus went towards Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, and deliberately ascended, the&#xD;
steps of the house in which were situated the chambers of Mr. Carnac, He&#xD;
tapped gently at the outer door, and was desired by the clerk to come in,--&#xD;
and in he went, in his quiet, creeping way.&#xD;
"Is Mr. Carnac within ?"&#xD;
'cNo-not come yet."&#xD;
"Oh, dear me. Well, I must wait."&#xD;
"There's a chair."&#xD;
"Thank you. I am only a worm, I assure you."&#xD;
"A what 2"&#xD;
"A worm, my good sir, if you please. We are all worms-he! he ! you&#xD;
are a tapeworm !He ! I nearly laughed."&#xD;
"Bother take you and yo   jokes !" muttered the clerk ; but the arrival&#xD;
of Mr. Carnac put an end to te colloquy ; and upon hearing that the stran-&#xD;
ger wished to speak to him, le asked him his name and business,-for the .&#xD;
exterior of Jobus was by no,  a  prepossessing.&#xD;
"You will have bo&amp;amp;h in private," said Jobus. "If you will not, I go at&#xD;
once ; but you will live to regret it deeply." "Come in," said Mr. Carnac,&#xD;
and he led the way into his private room. "Now. sir, what is it ?"&#xD;
" You are a good lawyer," said Jobus ; "that I have ascertained. Your&#xD;
opinion is quite sound enough upon any subject that you choose to give it."&#xD;
Well, go on."&#xD;
"Listen to me," added Jobus, and he held up a shrivelled hand, and touched&#xD;
the thumb with the forefinger of the other hand. "If A. has committed a&#xD;
forgery by using the name of B. on a stamp, and C. holds the bond or bill so&#xD;
forged, can C. force B. to do more than acknowledge it by the implication of&#xD;
paying it upon demand, or wouldthe civil law step-in-and compel B. to pro-&#xD;
secute ?"&#xD;
"C. may make a public complaint consistent with his knowledge of the&#xD;
facts," said Mr. Carnac, "and then no compromise of the felony would be&#xD;
allowed."&#xD;
"Oh! If C. delays doing that, can he still do it, notwithstandingsuch delay&#xD;
for selfish purposes ?"&#xD;
"C. may allege reasons for delay ; but whether he did or no, the case as&#xD;
against A. would be good."&#xD;
"Oh! X. having committed a felony, is he barred by that fact from giving&#xD;
his testimony in a court of law ?"&#xD;
"Oh! Can A., as in the former case,.be successfully prosecuted without the&#xD;
production of the forged instrument ?"&#xD;
"Oh! Good morning."&#xD;
"Stop-stop !"&#xD;
Jobus was gone like an arrow from a bow, out of the private room, past the&#xD;
derk, out of the chambers, down the steps, across Lincoln-Inn-Fields, and down&#xD;
a turning out of sight.&#xD;
"Clarges street," muttered Jobus, "Clarges street ! Ah ! Oh ! Now for&#xD;
the old man.,Ha!"&#xD;
Shufflingaalong at a much quicker pace than any one would have given him&#xD;
credit for, Jobus reached Clarges street, and slunk into the hall of the hotel.&#xD;
No beggars here !" cried a waiter.&#xD;
"Certainly not, young man. Is Sir John Morton at home ?" .&#xD;
"Gone away."&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.                     185&#xD;
"Gone away ?"&#xD;
"Yes ; this morning, early."&#xD;
"Failed," said Jobus, as he left the hotel, "failed there at all events. Well&#xD;
--well, we shall see-we shall see. Ah !"&#xD;
Emma and Mrs. Bennet came slowly up the steps of the hotel.&#xD;
" H umbly,". said Jobus, as he gently laid his hand upon Emma's arm.&#xD;
"Humbly, a poor worm would speak to you for Abel's sake."&#xD;
"For Abel's sake ?"&#xD;
"Ay. You will listen to me ?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes-yes. Come in."&#xD;
"No-no. I will tell you here. I find, now, that they told me an untruth&#xD;
just now when they said Sir John had gone. No matter. Perhaps they&#xD;
thought I wanted to beg of him. But it is better to see you. Do you know&#xD;
all."&#xD;
"Yes, oh yes. You warned Abel. He described you well. I know it was&#xD;
you who went to Richmond and warned him."&#xD;
" Ah, he told you it was a worm; I suppose ?"&#xD;
Oh, no-no! A dear friend."&#xD;
"A what? A-dear friend?   Ha ! no I didn't laugh. But young maiden,&#xD;
listen to me: tell the poor father-tell Lim to give time--tell him to tempo--&#xD;
rise-to give colonel Elk hopes--tell him that a worm is grubbing, grubbing&#xD;
in the dark, to do him good service, and that when he has done it he will call&#xD;
again. But time.-4time must be granted, and that can only be by temporising&#xD;
-playing with Elk. Do you understand ?"&#xD;
"I think I do. You mean that we should give him hopes of acceding to his&#xD;
terrible terms, do you not ?"&#xD;
"I do. Good morning."&#xD;
Jobus was off again, and took his way to the colonel's house as quickly as&#xD;
he could, for he dreaded that his absence might attract Elk's attention and&#xD;
awaken suspicion. As Jobus neared the colonel's house, Lord Rokeley's cab&#xD;
drove from the door, but before Jobus could see it, or he would have pondered&#xD;
a little before crossing that threshold again.&#xD;
The only two persons that Jobus had at all to dread might, within a few&#xD;
days following that fact, declare to the colonel that it was he, Jobus, who haq&#xD;
been to Richmond with some communication to Abel Morton, was the Dan-&#xD;
doloski and Lord Rokeley. The other gents and the other ladies were not&#xD;
visitors of Elk's, except by special invitation.&#xD;
The danger which poor Jobus dreaded had come to pass. But he could not&#xD;
be said to be altogether unprepared for it, inasmuch as he had well considered&#xD;
it, and intended to secrete himself elsewhere if it should happen, and to take&#xD;
such steps as he could to save Abel.&#xD;
It so happened, however, that Rokeley was getting up a yachting expedition;&#xD;
and despite the trouble, he called upon the colonel to speak to him about it.&#xD;
Elk received him with his usual cordiality, and after saying how sorry he was&#xD;
that his engagements in London would deprive him of the pleasure of going, he&#xD;
added-&#xD;
"Well, how did you get on at Richmond ?"&#xD;
b Pon soul, demme, I hardly know," said Rokeley. "It was rather slow;&#xD;
bt Abel gave us the slip in a deemed unhandsome way."&#xD;
"I deed ?&#xD;
"Why-ayes. A fellow came to him, and said something to him, and off&#xD;
he went, you see."a&#xD;
"A Jew-looking fellow ?"&#xD;
" Why-nay-_no."&#xD;
"Oh, yes. A veritable Jew in tawdry finery, and a three days beard? A&#xD;
rather thin fellow, with lots of whiskers ?"&#xD;
"Demme   o."&#xD;
"Who the devil, then? I beg your pardon, Rokeley, but this is just the&#xD;
thing I want to know. Who was it ?"&#xD;

" Why-a--ftha's good when you sent him. We all came to that conclu-&#xD;
sion afterwards, for after taxing my memory, and a deuce of a trouble it was,&#xD;
I recollected where I had seen the fellow."&#xD;
"Where ?"&#xD;
"Here, to be sure. One of your familiars-one of your domestic friends-a&#xD;
very odd-looking fellow, indeed, and he said he was a mere worm. Poor soul,&#xD;
he looked like one."&#xD;
"He dies!"&#xD;
'Eh ! Did you speak 7"&#xD;
" I merely said 'indeed.' And so you found that out, did you ?"&#xD;
" Why-a-yes, I did ; but it was a trouble. So you can't come to Cowes&#xD;
in the yacht dodge, eh ?"&#xD;
"Precious sorry I am that I can't."&#xD;
"Oh, well, I don't know that 1 shall myself, for when it comes to the time,&#xD;
I dare say I shall find it such a trouble that I shan't be able to prevail on&#xD;
myself, you see, to go ; only as it's my yacht, you see, I'm bound to ask the&#xD;
fellows I wish to go. Ah !"&#xD;
"Exactly. Well, as it's this day week, I will make an effort."&#xD;
"An effort ?  Oh, demme, don't do that. It puts me in a perspiration to&#xD;
think of such a thing. If it's any trouble, of course, I can't expect a fellow to&#xD;
go. Good morning. I shall go and lunch somewhere, and that's such a trou-&#xD;
ble as never was known. Oh, dear !"&#xD;
"Good morning, Rokeley. I am much obliged to you."&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXVIL&#xD;
PoOR Abel, when he left the house of Colonel Elk, after the agitating inter-&#xD;
view he had had with that villain, staggered along the street like a drunken&#xD;
man. The very worst that his imagination could possibly picture to itself in&#xD;
the conduct of Colonel~Elk had actually now at last taken place.&#xD;
"It is over-it is over!" said Abel, as he clung to some iron railings&#xD;
for support. "That man will kill me ! Yes that man will kill me !&#xD;
An awful idea then crossed the mind of Abel. It was an idea engendered&#xD;
by the despair of his heart-it was one of those ideas which made folks think&#xD;
in old monkish days that the enemy of mankind dogged the footsteps of&#xD;
the wretched.&#xD;
"Would it not be better," whispered Abel, and he looked around him and&#xD;
at the night sky, and then shudderingly to the earth again-" would it not be&#xD;
better, by a sudden and speedy end, to save all those who are so dear to&#xD;
me the thousand pangs that they may still have to suffer-to save myself-to&#xD;
concentrate into one rude shock the terror and the agony of all the time that&#xD;
is to come-to-to depart of my own will from the great world-to die even&#xD;
by my own hand ?"&#xD;
It was, in truth, an awful thought that, and well might Abel Morton shudder&#xD;
as he gave utterance to it.&#xD;
The streets were now nearly deserted, and it was only now and then'that&#xD;
in the distance Abel could hear the footfall of some solitary passenger,&#xD;
wending his way homewards, perchance from some late revel, or mark the&#xD;
unsteady gait of one who had loved the bottle wisely and too well. '&#xD;
"Yes !" he muttered. "it surely would be a deed well done ; and how&#xD;
easy-how very easy it would be."&#xD;
It seemed, now, as if some palpable fiend were whispering in the ears&#xD;
of poor Abel its fell counsels, for he added, in a half-smothered voice-&#xD;
"Yes, there is the river ! A sure and silent death. Then a pistol would do&#xD;
it easily-or-a knife-no, no-poison! I have knowledge enough to ask&#xD;
for the drug that would at once arrest the progress of this most exquisite&#xD;
human machine, and start the soul upon its journey to that other world from&#xD;
whence there is no return. Yet poison will do it well !"&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHER, THE'COLONEL.&#xD;
&#xD;
Alas, poor Abel!&#xD;
After the dreadful suggestion had found a home in his heart and brain,&#xD;
it each moment grew into more and more tangible, yet horrible cohsisteney.&#xD;
He thought how his father would grieve at first for him, and how hie&#xD;
gentle cousin would shed many tears--how his mother, too, would give way&#xD;
to much agony of grief; but then he thought of that universal law of human&#xD;
nature, which makes grief for the dead so very transitory a feeling, and which&#xD;
dries in such an incredibly short space of time the eye of the mourner&#xD;
t would be a shock." he said, "but that would be all, and from the&#xD;
moment that it was felt'it would be diminishing, for there would be nothing&#xD;
more to drad7&#xD;
He walked on a few paces, now, down the street he was in.&#xD;
There came a glare of green light upon the eyes of Abel Morton, and with&#xD;
a feeling of sudden confusion, he stepped back, and shaded his eyes with his&#xD;
hands to escape the influence of the sudden illumination.&#xD;
A glance then showed him from what it proceeded.&#xD;
lie was close to a large chemist's shop. A lad was putting up the shut-&#xD;
ters, and yawning between each one.&#xD;
"Poison !" said Abel to himself. "Poison !"&#xD;
In another moment he was in the shop.&#xD;
The lad put down the shutter he was about to stagger out with, and'look-&#xD;
w at Abel, he said-&#xD;
"Did you want Mr. Brown,.sir ?"&#xD;

"Oh, you will do it-you can serve. I suppose you can."&#xD;
"Ohyes, sir."&#xD;
Th bye wentbehind the counter, and looked at Abel with a glance of in&#xD;
iry. Abel put as calm a countenance as he could upon the transaction, as&#xD;
he said--&#xD;
"h y pet spaniel is so old that I want to put it out of the world as tenderly&#xD;
as possible-give me some drug that would dhere ut it me  be lometh&#xD;
quick and effe ive .t like to hear that it had lingered in agony.".&#xD;
"Yes, sir, I understand, sir.. If you bring it to-morrow, Mr. Brown will&#xD;
do for it, sir."&#xD;
"Oh, thank you.'~&#xD;
Abel felt that he was suspected, and he moved towards the door ; but with&#xD;
his hand upon the lock, he turned and smiled as he said-&#xD;
"It wou   save trouble, though, ifyou could give me the drug at once."&#xD;
"Well, so it would, sir. If you will be careful-"&#xD;
"Indeed I will-it shall never get out of my own possession, I assure you.&#xD;
You will let me have it ?" added Abel.&#xD;
"Yes, sir, if you please."&#xD;
The boy took from a drawer a small bottle, and decanted from it about&#xD;
twenty drops of colorless liquid into a lilliputian phial. That he securely&#xD;
corked and tied the cork down, and then wrapped it in paper; and as ha&#xD;
handed it to Abel, he said-&#xD;
cc That will do it, sir."&#xD;
"A thousand than&#xD;

"What is it ?"&#xD;

contingent upon the strange conduct of the gentleman whom hehad served&#xD;
with enough of the most deadly drug in the shop to kill a company of grena-&#xD;
diers.&#xD;
Morton crossed the roadway at once, with the bottle in his grasp. He&#xD;
heard a footstep after him. That it was the boy from the shop,e whose o uspifr-&#xD;
ons had been again excited, he could not doubt, and, tearingho&#xD;
its envelope, he cried-&#xD;
'iYou shall not baulk me ! FatherEmma-mother-all-all-farewell!&#xD;
God 1"&#xD;
A fearful hand dashed the little phial from his grasp, and it was smashed&#xD;
upon the pavement at the same moment that a voice cried-&#xD;
"Good Heavens, Morton. what is the meaning of this ?" fCaptaLorr-&#xD;
Abel uttered a cry, and 'sank half fainting into the arms of  pain&#xD;

"And if the jontleman is a little bit on the wrong side of the whiskey bot-&#xD;

ways, I should like to be after knowing ?"ayor t'other&#xD;
"I am better !" said Abel.&#xD;
The Coachman heard the voice, and it seemed to have the effect of assu-&#xD;
ring him that it was really sickness, and nit inebriety that wstefmatter.&#xD;
" Oh. well," he said, "if sobe'as the gemman is hill, in as the matter&#xD;

Captain Lorrinet saw that it was useless to ask any questions of&#xD;

aae the orders aloud, so that'if Abel had had any particular objection to ge&#xD;
there, he might have said so; but as he did not, Capain Lorrinet was at once&#xD;
assured that that would do.waatoc&#xD;
Half a sovereign sent the Irishman away a richer man than he had been&#xD;
since the would times, as he said, when the O'Gradys were the born kin  of&#xD;
Connaught. The coachman carefully shut the door of his crazy vehicle and&#xD;
rumbled it off to the Albany,.                              eice n&#xD;
"Morton-Morton !" said Captain Lorrinet, in a low tone, close to the ear&#xD;
"Yes-yes, who speaks? It is done--it is done."&#xD;
"Don't you know me ?"&#xD;
"No-no."&#xD;
"I am Lorrinet-your old acquaintance,Lorrinetyou&#xD;

" Dead'?ano, man, no; you are not dead, nor anything like it, Ihope. The&#xD;
fact is, I was going home and I happened to see you in a chemist's shop by the&#xD;
mere accident of casually glancing in at the door as I passed it. The expres-&#xD;
sion of your face struck me as being such as I had never seen it wear before;&#xD;
and a feeling that it was a duty incumbent upon me to do so, made me stay'&#xD;
and watch you. I saw you come out of the shop, and then you crossed the&#xD;
road; and as you did so, and I followed you quietly, I heard enough to con-&#xD;
Vince me that you had a dreadful project in your head. Oh, Morton, I was in&#xD;
time to save you from yourself."                               wsi&#xD;
Abel covered his face with his hands. and sobbed.&#xD;
Good, said Lorrinet.&#xD;
The coach rumbled on;ubut the young officer said not a word to Abel Mor-&#xD;
ton until these sobs had subsided, and the wild passion of the overwrought&#xD;
feelings had had itshway. He knew well the virtue that there is inroug&#xD;

"Yes, old fellow. How are you no,w.?"&#xD;
There came agleam of light from the lamp at the centre of the Alban in&#xD;
at the coach window and by its light Abel held out his hand to Lorrinet, say-&#xD;
"Can you forgive the past ?"&#xD;
"it is forgiven and forgotten both, Abel," said the young captain, as he hear-&#xD;

It wanted a little persuasion upon the part of the young captain to get Abel&#xD;
to touch the wine. He associated it with the ruin that had come upon hin.&#xD;
and the very sight of it made him shudder.&#xD;

It is excess, Abel; that converts the good genius into a fiend. Come, drink t&#xD;
glass, and you will be all the better for it."&#xD;
Abel did drink the one glass, and he was all the better for it; since it 2w&#xD;
wine, and not the strange compound which people generally believe, in the&#xD;
ordinary experiences of life, to be such.&#xD;
"Come, now, you are better ?"&#xD;
"I am, Lorrinet-I am."&#xD;
"That's right. And now, Abel. what can I do-anything, or nothing?&#xD;
Speak out, old fellow. Is it possible'for one who wishes to do you a good turn,&#xD;
if he can, to do it, or to try to do it? Don't be afraid of the magnitude of the&#xD;
task ; only say what you would have me do."&#xD;
"I will-I will !"&#xD;
"That's right, now, and friendly. Go on, Abel."&#xD;
Abel spoke with difficulty ; and his voice was low and gentle. It had a&#xD;
hurried, broken sound with it, too.&#xD;
"Lorrinet, you are good and kind. You have not opened my eyes to your&#xD;
character to-night, for I feel that I knew you were what you have proved your-&#xD;
self long ago ; and even while I spoke to you with words of bitterness, I felt&#xD;
that I was a guilty spirit, driving an innocent one from its side, rather than&#xD;
suffer from the constant contrast."&#xD;
"Nay, Abel, don't say that."&#xD;
"Yes, I ought to say it, for it is the truth."&#xD;
"Well, now, Abel, you began by saying that you had something for me to&#xD;
do, and you have wandered from that."&#xD;
"So I have-so I have. What was it? Oh, I know now well what it was.&#xD;
Lorrinet, it is because I love your good and candid noble nature, that I ask&#xD;
you now to leave me, and never more to think of the cunning, guilty Abel&#xD;
hMor ton."&#xD;
"Leave you now ?"&#xD;
"Yes. For your own sake, leave me. There is such a thing as the coa-&#xD;
tamination of guilt. I am like one with the plague-I should be deserted of&#xD;
my fellow-creatures. Go-go ! You do not know me yet."&#xD;
"Nonsense. Abel. This is just some crotchet of yours. Come-come, I&#xD;
know all about it."&#xD;
"No-no !"&#xD;
" Bit I say yes. You have been going into all sorts of wild extravagances,&#xD;
and, in fact, leading a life of riot. That is it. But how many have done so&#xD;
before you. old fellow? Let it suffice, now, that you have awakened to the&#xD;
folly of such a career ; and then at once, quick presto! it is over and you are&#xD;
a new man."&#xD;
"He knows nothing," said Abel.&#xD;
"Oh, don't I ! Come, now. Unburthen your sorrows to me, Abel, and I&#xD;
will talk you out of them."&#xD;
"Captain Lorrinet," said Abel, as he dashed the empty wine-glass to the&#xD;
ground, "unite those fragments again by a word, and then you.can fathom&#xD;
my position ! I am lost !"&#xD;
"Lost?  Why what on earth do you mean, Abel ?"&#xD;
"Go-oh go from me, sir. I--I am not worthy that you should sit thus&#xD;

A violent knocking at the outer door of the chamber at this moment star-&#xD;
tied the friends. Rowley fell into the fire at once, but it had luckily nearly&#xD;
expired, and Abel, with his very lips bloodless, sprang to his feet, crying-&#xD;
"They come to drag me to death--to a felon's death !-to the scaffold !-&#xD;
God !-the scaffold !"&#xD;
He fell heavily to the floor.&#xD;
The violent knocking continued.&#xD;
CHAPTER . XXXIX.&#xD;
COLONEL ELK was furious at the idea that it was Jobus who had been to&#xD;
Richmond to give notice to Abel Morton of what had passed concerning the&#xD;
bill. The death of Jobus, from that moment, was, in the mind of Elk, an&#xD;
affair all but finished. It was thoroughly decided upon.&#xD;
Truly. Jobus's revenge, that he so much wanted against the colonel, was&#xD;
beginning, even then, for his name had become a terror.&#xD;
"Curses on him !" muttered Elk with bitterness ! "who now, could have&#xD;
supposed that such a cringing, wretched hound as that would even have been&#xD;
able to give one-half the uneasiness that I now feel?  But so it is. I am&#xD;
compelled to work with mean tools, and at times must feel the consequence&#xD;
of so doing. I will put an end, though, to this state of things tolerably&#xD;
quickly."&#xD;
Now Jobus slept in one of the attics of the colonel's house, and most&#xD;
miserable, indeed, were the accommodations for repose that Elk had vouchsafed&#xD;
to allow Jobus and Frogs. They occupied adjoining rooms, but the colonel&#xD;
had sent Frogs upon an errand, which would keep him out of the house until&#xD;
the following morning, and he looked upon that fact as quite providential, for&#xD;
at the time he had done so the idea of making an end of poor Jobus's earthly&#xD;
career that night had not crossed the villain's mind, as the occasion for it to&#xD;
do so had not arisen. Now, however, there seemed to be nothing to impede&#xD;
the execution of his villanous design.&#xD;
The clock in the hall of the house struck two in a muffled tone, and when&#xD;
the dull sound had died away, Elk said-&#xD;
"Surely, if he sleeps at all he must be in that state now. It shall be the sleep&#xD;
of death."&#xD;
Elk retired to the private room which he called his study, although the only&#xD;
thing he ever studied there was how to carry out his plans of cruelty and&#xD;
mischief, and opened an iron safe that was fixed in one of the walls, and the&#xD;
doors of which were papered over so as to resemble as much as possible the&#xD;
remainder of the room.&#xD;
From that iron safe he took a small pair of pocket pistols, and carefully&#xD;
loaded them.&#xD;
"c hese will do," he said. " They have never missed yet, and it is not at all&#xD;
likely they are going to play me such a trick now ; and yet--"&#xD;
Elk paused, for the notion had just struck him that the noise of the discharge&#xD;
of the pistol might arouse the woman who was in the house, and Dora, who&#xD;
was still there, occupying the room immediately above the drawing-room.&#xD;

"rNo,"' he said,, after a thoughtful pause, "there are silenter and quite as&#xD;
sure modes of putting him to death than by the pistol. I have the means here&#xD;
at hand.'&#xD;
From the iron safe then, Elk took several weapons, evidently of foreign man-&#xD;
ufacture, and from among them he selected an Indian-made dagger, the handle&#xD;
of which was as long, and just about as heavy as the bladeneither being above&#xD;
eight inches.&#xD;
Elk touched the point of the weapon with the tip of hisfinger, and smiled&#xD;
as he muttered to himself-ti&#xD;
"It will do. One blow with this, even given with the weakest hand, would&#xD;
drive it to the hilt. In my grasp it cannot fail."&#xD;
Elk replaced the other weapons in the iron safe, and had closed the door of&#xD;
it sharply, and turned the key in'the lock, when something touched his arm,&#xD;
and with a cry of surprise and terror he bounded back, and fell over an otto-&#xD;
man that happened to be in his way..&#xD;
"Uncle," said a voice.&#xD;
It was Dora, in a loose morning wrapper, and with a small night lamp in her&#xD;
hand. She was very pale, and appeared as if she had risen from her bed in&#xD;
some alarm.&#xD;
"Curses on the girl !"said Elk. "What do you mean by stalking about the&#xD;
house in this way?  To bed !--to bed !"&#xD;
"No, uncle."&#xD;
"And why not'? Dreaming again, are you? I suppose you are half asleep&#xD;
now. What new crotchet has taken possession of you ?"&#xD;
Dora trembled, and placing the lamp upon a table, she sunk into a chair and&#xD;
wept bitterly.&#xD;
" A plague take you !" cried Elk. "What is the matter now ?"&#xD;
"Oh, uncle, let me go to my uncle Josiah. I am safer there, surely, than&#xD;
here. Oh, let me go, I implore you !"&#xD;
"What for?   D--n it, do you mean to say you are not safe in this house?'&#xD;
What do you mean by it?"&#xD;
"This is what I mean. Read that."&#xD;
As she spoke Dora placed before the colonel a little slip of paper upon which&#xD;
was written-&#xD;
"Dora, fly from this place. There is danger. The street door is not fast as&#xD;
usual. You may escape. Do so while you can."&#xD;
"Where did you get this ?".&#xD;
"It was thrust through the keyhole of my bedroom door, and a slight noise&#xD;
awakening me, I rose in alarm and saw it."&#xD;
" Indeed ! And mho wrote it?"&#xD;
The colonel asked this question in the most calm and quiet manner in the&#xD;
world, as if it did not at all irritate him to find that any such writing had been&#xD;
given to Dora. It is possible enough thab Dora, in her innocence of heart,&#xD;
might have been deceived by the colonel into telling who it was that had given.&#xD;
her the written paper if she had known, but as she did not, she could only&#xD;
shake her head and reply--.&#xD;
"I know nothing further of it than I tell you; but it has alarmed me, and,&#xD;
coupled with what occurred here not many nights ago, it makes a continued&#xD;
residence in this house irksome and impossible."&#xD;
'You don't know what you speak about, Dora," said Elk. "What other&#xD;
circumstance do you allude to ?"&#xD;
Dora looked calmly at him as she said-.&#xD;
."I presume that I ought to look to you for protection, as you call yourself&#xD;
my ancle; but after such a man as Lord Carlin, by your connivance, made an&#xD;
attempt to intrude into my bedroom, I can hardly think that you value my&#xD;
safety, or your own honor."&#xD;
" Listen to me, girl. As.I said before, you -know not of what you speak.&#xD;
Carlin, upon that occasion, had taken too much wine, and did not know where&#xD;
he was. lie has apologised to me.'&#xD;

"And am I nobody ?"&#xD;
"Oh, he will apologise to you if you like."&#xD;
Dora shuddered.&#xD;
No," she said, "that would be an additional degradation. It would be a&#xD;
disgrace to any who valued their honor, or who had any fair repute to lose, to&#xD;
talk to such a man.d&#xD;
"I am much obliged to you, Dora, for the compliment, as Lord Carlin is my&#xD;
friend, and came here to-night as my guest."&#xD;
"You choose your own friends, uncle, and please yourself. All I ask of you&#xD;
is to allow me to quit this house. I have been to the outer door and find it&#xD;
fast, contrary to the statement in the note that now lies before you on the&#xD;
table ; and so I come to you and demand my liberty."&#xD;
Demand ?"&#xD;
"Yes, uncle, I demand it."&#xD;
"To-morrow." ,&#xD;
'No, to-night.",&#xD;

town, you are quite welcome to do so. If you think yourself safer there, though,&#xD;
than youeare here, I can tell you that is a delusion."&#xD;
"There is not the same rude riot there, if there be the same-"&#xD;

"That is not a question which should be argued between you and me, uncle.&#xD;
Let me go, I implore of you."&#xD;
"Alas !-alas! why I should stay here till to-morrow, when there may be&#xD;
danger to-night. I know not. Oh, uncle, let me go! I do not ask you to go&#xD;
with me-I do not wish to take up any of your time ; but I implore you to&#xD;
let me go from this house, for I am terrified to remain longer in it.&#xD;
"Dora, you are excited by fears that the light of day will dissipate. It&#xD;
neither befits your honor nor mine that you should leave this house to-night.&#xD;
if you think calmly and seriously for a few moments, you cannot fail to per-&#xD;
ceive the justice of what I say. Rest assured that I will protect you, and that&#xD;
you may sleep in peace.".&#xD;
Dora saw that it was quite useless for her to urge h1er imperious uncle fur-&#xD;
ther; for although he spoke to her without passion, and even strove to do all&#xD;
that he could to put an expression of kindness into his face, and manner, and&#xD;
tone, she saw that he was thoroughly determined.&#xD;
."1 must submit."&#xD;
"Do not call it submission, Dora. Go to rest, and be assured that you are&#xD;
quite safe."&#xD;
She slowly left the room, and proceeded to the upper floor ; and Colonel Elk&#xD;
placed his head upon his hands, and remained for some few moments in deep&#xD;
thought. thenn he said-    ,&#xD;
"Jobus again-Jobus again -"&#xD;
Snatching up the little note that Dora had laid before him, he closely exam-&#xD;
ined the writing.&#xD;
"It is not his hand," he said, "but that is nothing-that is nothing. It is&#xD;
clear to me that he is plotting mischief, and he dies; and with him dies the&#xD;
mischief. But whence the cause of this warning?  Carlin was not to come&#xD;
here again till to-morrow night. He cannot surely be trying to steal a march&#xD;
upon mre in this aitir ?  It is very strange."  -&#xD;
Elk paced.the room for some few minutes in-silence, and then pausing he&#xD;
muttered-&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.                     147&#xD;
"Yes, the arrangements were all clear and distinct enough. Carlin was to&#xD;
come here to-morrow night at the hour of one, and I was to let him into the&#xD;
house ; previous to which I was to take care that the lock of Dora's chamber&#xD;
door was sufficiently tampered with to afford him easy enough ingress to that&#xD;
apartment, and then I was to hear nothing. But not to-night-not to-night.&#xD;
Oh, it is the mistake of the good Mr. Johns, without doubt. Peeping, prying&#xD;
and listening-discovering my secrets in some way that I know not of, but&#xD;
which will matter nothing when he shall be dead-he has found that there is&#xD;
some such little arrangement between me and Carlin, and so he warns Dora&#xD;
in time. Good--good-very good, Mr. Jobus; we will' see if we cannot put&#xD;
an end to your little ambition, and scatter your plots and maneuvres co the&#xD;
wind. We shall see-we shall see, my good, kind, Jobus."&#xD;
The colonel then hid the Indian pQniard in his bosom, and slowly left the&#xD;
room, and crept upstairs in the dark.&#xD;
In order now to explain the position of affairs in the house of Colonel Elk&#xD;
upon that important night, we must leave him for a few minutes to go upon&#xD;
his bloodthirsty errand, while we say a few words of other people and their&#xD;
hopes and wishes.&#xD;
Lord Carlin, although one of the most utterly dissipated noblemen in the&#xD;
kingdom, had never been able thoroughly to understand why it was that Col&#xD;
onel Elk had been so anxious to sell to him his niece Dora ; for with all his&#xD;
tact, Elk had not managed to conceal that he was more anxious for Dora's&#xD;
complete destruction, than for the sum of money which Lord Carlin would give&#xD;
him for his silence and connivance at the atrocious piece of villany.&#xD;
With this view, Carlin, instead of leaving Elk's house upon that night, had&#xD;
managed, amid the confusion of the departure of the half drunken guests, to&#xD;
slip into a small room adjoining the hall, and there to secrete himself.&#xD;
Frogs had given Jobus notice of the fact ; and Johns had, of course, natu-&#xD;
rally enough come to the conclusion that it was with the full authority and&#xD;
connivance of Elk that Carlin had so acted, and therefore had found it only in&#xD;
his power to warn Dora of her danger, and put it to her reason to attempt an&#xD;
esca pe.&#xD;
If she should fail in that, he fully intended, with the assistance of Frogs, to&#xD;
keep up the watch, for the purpose of defeating the villainous intentions of the&#xD;
colonel and his lordship.&#xD;
Jobus, tob, was aware of the attempt which Colonel Elk was about to make&#xD;
upon his life, and he had-"his own plans regarding that-plans which would&#xD;
necessitate his leaving the house, probably, but which would still let Elk re-&#xD;
main in the dark regarding the fact of whether he were dead or alive.&#xD;
Now Jobus had no idea of how the colonel meant to try to deprive him of&#xD;
existence; but he could guess that it would be by some effeitual and silent&#xD;
method, so he took his way to the attic of Frogs, and there waited in expec-&#xD;
tation of what would occur, much wishing that Frogs would come home so&#xD;
that they might concoct measures together for mutual safety ; but it had so.&#xD;
happened that the colonel had sent Frogs from the house upon an errand-a&#xD;
protracted errand-almost immediately after he had warned Jobus of the fact&#xD;
of the presence in the house of Lord Carlin.&#xD;
Such, then, was the state of affairs at the house of Colonel Elk upon that&#xD;
eventful night-a state of affairs which looks pregnant of mischief, and which&#xD;
could not possibly continue for long without producing some rather important&#xD;
results.&#xD;
Johns, after having warned Dora, had gone up to the attic of the house, and&#xD;
there had remained in deep thought for some time, after which he leant over&#xD;
the balustrade of the staircase, and listened if he could hear any sound below.&#xD;
All was silent-for a titie, but at last the sound of some one weeping cane&#xD;
upon his ears, and he then saw Dora slowly ascending from the floor upon&#xD;
which Elk usually held his wild orgies.&#xD;
That she had been not only unsuccessful in her attempt to leave the house,&#xD;
but that she had encountered Elk, appeared to him to be propositions not at&#xD;
&#xD;

MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.                     149&#xD;
"Not so loud, my lord.&#xD;
"Good. I suspect he is playing with me, and that is what I do not feel&#xD;
disposed to put up with; so here I am, without his leave, and now you, Mr,&#xD;
a-a----&#xD;
" Jobus Worm, Esq."&#xD;
" Pho ! pho-! none of your jokes just now. All I want you to do is to&#xD;
conceal me for another hour somewhere, and then to let me know when Elk&#xD;
has left the house, or retired for the night."&#xD;
"Certainly. Follow me."&#xD;
Jobus led the way quietly up the staircase, followed by Lord Carlin; and&#xD;
passing by the door of Dora's chamber, he took him right up to the attics of&#xD;
the house, and into his own room.&#xD;
"My lord," said Jobus, as they stood in a stream of calm and quiet moon,&#xD;
light, that struggled through the latticed window-panes into the low-roofed&#xD;
attic-" My lord, this is my humble chamber. This is where the worm coils&#xD;
himself up of a night, to pretend to sleep. You can stay here."&#xD;
"In safety ?"&#xD;
"I suppose so-Stop !"&#xD;
Jobus had no sort of idea of laying any traps for the life of Lord Carlin;&#xD;
and it just occurred to him, that if Elk should come there to seek him, Jo-&#xD;
bus, there might be an awkward eclaircissement ; but then, after all, it would&#xD;
serve both Elk and Carlin right if they were mutually to recognise each other&#xD;
in that attic, and the probable contingent upon such a circumstance would&#xD;
force Elk to put an end to the idea of taking his, Johus's life that night. Of&#xD;
course, too, he considered that Lord Carlin would soon enough make himself&#xD;
known if there were any danger. The more Jobus thought of Elk's surprise&#xD;
and disappointment, the more amused he was at the idea; and he chuckled&#xD;
in his odd way.&#xD;
"What is the matter now ?" said Carlin. "Why are you so silent ?"&#xD;
"He !-ha! It's a curious fact that I did laugh; but it's over now. I&#xD;
was thinking, that is all."&#xD;
"About what ?"&#xD;
"The colonel. There is no one in the house to come here but the colonel&#xD;
and myself. If he should come, of course you will know him; but he may&#xD;
not come, after all."&#xD;
"Not unless he has some suspicions."&#xD;
"Certainly not. Good-night. This is a homely place, my lord, and you&#xD;
can amuse yourself in it for awhile. I will let you know when the colonel&#xD;
has retired to rest, or left the house, as he often does at this hour; and then,&#xD;
my lord we will see what is next to be done."&#xD;
"You are sure the girl is here in the house ?"&#xD;
" Quite."&#xD;
" Yery well, that will do. And as for Elk, let him come or stay, I don't&#xD;
think that he can oppose me. Do you be faithful and energetic, and you&#xD;
shall have more gold."&#xD;
"Oh, what a promise !" said Jobus. "How well do you know the human&#xD;
heart, my lord-how well aware are you that those little bright, sparkling,&#xD;
golden media of exchange are quite sufficient to make a man sell his fellow-&#xD;
man, or plot for the destruction of such innocence as Dora's. How well you&#xD;
know, my lord, for the poor avarice of gold, even I, worm and wretch as I&#xD;
am, will aid you, the despoiler, in your wickedness this night. You could&#xD;
not doubt it, knowing human nature as you do: it is impossible to-doubt it.&#xD;
Oh, my lord, you are a great philosopher ; and you have studied the human JN.&#xD;
heart in general by studying your own in particular."&#xD;
"I'm d-d if I know what you are at !" said Lord Carlin. "I am rather&#xD;
in doubt whether you are most rogue or fool."&#xD;
"A little of both, my dear l'rdd-a little of both," said Jobus. "I have,&#xD;
in common with the human race, that delicious mixed Character-'-he !-he !&#xD;

MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.                      151&#xD;
the dagger gleamed for a moment;like a comet in the moonlight, and the next&#xD;
instant it was buried to the hilt in the heart of Lord Carlin.&#xD;
One agonizing shriek-a struggle to disencumber himself of the bed-clothes&#xD;
-a strange, gurgling sound like a man drowning-a sob-and then all was&#xD;
still.&#xD;
Still as death !&#xD;
CHAPTER XLI.&#xD;
AFTER directing the blow with the poniard, which he thought had termina-&#xD;
ted the mortal career of Jobus, Elk folded his arms and stood with apparent&#xD;
calmness regarding his victim.&#xD;
The death silence did not seem to appal him-that brief, but terrible strug-&#xD;
gle in the bed-clothes was remarked by him in silence-the strange gurgling&#xD;
sound. terminated by one deep sob which proclaimed death, passed him un-&#xD;
heeded.&#xD;
When all, then, was still, and when the body had in its writhing turned upon&#xD;
its face, and lay there in the repose of death, Elk spoke.&#xD;
"It was sure to come to this sooner or later," he said, "and now it is over.&#xD;
Farewell, Jobus ! You might have lived a little longer; but as it did not suit&#xD;
you to do so, go. Farewell !"&#xD;
The colonel wiped the dagger on the corner of the coverlet of the bed, and&#xD;
then he glanced about him as he muttered-&#xD;
"It will be just as well to place this somewhere where no prying eyes will&#xD;
find it."&#xD;
After a little consideration, he-reached his hand and arm as far as he could&#xD;
up the chimney, and struck the dagger into the brick-work, and there left it.&#xD;
".They will not look there for it, even if it be sought," he said. "And now l&#xD;
think it will be the turn of Frogs next; for the time has nearly come when&#xD;
these two men will be a hindrance rather than any benefit to me ; and what&#xD;
with Jobus's real treachery, and Frogs' dangerous drunkenness, I should live&#xD;
in terror if I did not get rid of them both."&#xD;
Elk then paused awhile, and rested his chin upon his hand, and appeared to&#xD;
be lost in deep thought.&#xD;
"The body," he said at length. "Ay, the body ! - That is the question.&#xD;
What shall be done with it ?"&#xD;
There was another pause of thought for a time, and then he said, sudden-&#xD;
ly---&#xD;
" What does it matter'? Nobody will miss him. If I do not inquire for&#xD;
him nobody else will. A few days slow must settle this business with the&#xD;
Mortons, -and then I'm off--off from England for ever with my wealth that I&#xD;
will wring from them, and be well satisfied that I have had my revenge."&#xD;
The colonel stepped to the attic door, and possessing himself of the key that&#xD;
was in the lock on the inside, he took it out and transferred it to the out.&#xD;
Then leaving the room with its dead and bleeding occupant, he closed the door&#xD;
and locked it on the outside and walked deliberately down the stairs.&#xD;
Reaching the private apartment in which he kept his iron chest, he opened&#xD;
it and took from his pocket the black pocket-book in whichhe kept his most&#xD;
valuable papers ; and after a brief glance to see that the bill which had the&#xD;
forged signature of the elder Morton was safe, he placed the book in the iron&#xD;
chest and locked it up.&#xD;
It was at that moment that Elk thought he heard a noise on the stairca&#xD;
and he reeled back and turned pale.&#xD;
It was only for a passing moment, though, that he allowed himself to give&#xD;
way to any fear. Snatching one of the wax lights that he had lit from a&#xD;
branched sconce that was upon the table, he sprang front the room to the&#xD;
landing.&#xD;
" Who is there ?"&#xD;

IADaS AND nEArs  O,                   Y  OT;C     NL1&#xD;
&#xD;
There was no reply. and the house seemed to be as still as death itself--as&#xD;
still as that inanimate and bleeding form was in the attic, the soul of which&#xD;
Elk had so suddenly and so awfully sent to its account.&#xD;
"A delusion," he said. "It was nothing. I am full of strange fancies to-&#xD;
night. It was nothing; or perhaps some accidental movement of the door,&#xD;
that was all."&#xD;
As he stood. he could not but feel conscious, though, of a very strong cur-&#xD;
rent of wind coming up the staircase, and he walked down to see what occa-&#xD;
sioned it.&#xD;
To his surprise he found the street door of his house wide open.&#xD;
This gave Elk rather a shock at the moment, for he could not, for the life&#xD;
of him. understand what it meant. lie closed it again carefully, and then he&#xD;
found that the little patent lock, upon which he depended always, to keep every&#xD;
one in at night whom he did not choose to let leave the premises, was broken&#xD;
and partially wrenched off.&#xD;
A dark flash of anger and surprise crossed the countenance of Elk as he saw&#xD;
this, but he could not devise who had done it, or for a few minutes come to&#xD;
any opinion concerning it. Then he suddenly started as he said-&#xD;
Ah ! it is part of the scheme of Carlin, to be sure. 1 had nearly forgotten&#xD;
him. Ha ! ha! so he is to find his way here by the front door; is he?  We&#xD;
shall see-we shall see."&#xD;
The colonel then left the hall of the house, and proceeded up stairs, and as&#xD;
he did so, he muttered to himself-&#xD;
'Everything goes on well. Quite well. I destroy the Mortons, and I get&#xD;
from them a large sum of money. I will get from the old man an enormous&#xD;
price for the bill, of which I will give him a well-executed copy, and the origi-&#xD;
nal I will send with my compliments to the sitting magistrate at Bow street.&#xD;
But not till I am far away--far enough from all reach. Then by that time,&#xD;
too, Frogs will be dead-dead as Jobus is. I shall be quite contented if he&#xD;
be as dead as Jobus is at the present moment ; and then, too, by that time,&#xD;
thanks to the ungovernable passions of Lord Carlin, and the facility that I&#xD;
shall throw in his way, Dora will be such a wreck that they will all wish her&#xD;
dead."&#xD;
Colonel Elk reached his own room, and sat down in rather a self-gratulatory&#xD;
mood.&#xD;
" I wifl take care, though," he added"to furnish myself with the means of&#xD;
ready escape. Within the next few hours I will see to that, and then all will&#xD;
go on excellently well-excellently well. Ha! ha ! What fools are they who&#xD;
take it upon themselves to say that a clever man may not bend even circumn-&#xD;
stances to his wishes and vices. I bend them, and how very successful I am&#xD;
We leave the colonel to his self-felicitation, at a moment when, to tell the&#xD;
truth, everything was in reality going wrong with him.&#xD;
He'had committed a murder that he never dreamt of committing.&#xD;
He had let a man escape whom he thought he had numbered with the dead.&#xD;
lie had himself done the very act which saved Dora from the ruin and des-&#xD;
truction which he was even then prophesying would be hers.&#xD;
Yes. Colonel Elk, who so flattered himself that he could even bend circum-&#xD;
stances to his stern will, was the veriest slave of them that ever drew breath&#xD;
in this strange world of change and instability.&#xD;
Let us now take a peep at our friend Jobus.&#xD;
After leaving Lord Carlin in his own room, Jobus had retired to the elegant&#xD;
apartment-equally elegant with his own. and adjoining to it-which had been&#xD;
in the recent occupation of Mr. Frogs. There he had heard the approach of&#xD;
the colonel.&#xD;
That Elk's stealthy progress up the staircase was to seek him and take his&#xD;
life, Jobus did not doubt for a moment ; and when Elk entered the attic in&#xD;
which Lord Carlin was, it became a great surprise to him, Jobus, that ho&#xD;
heard no sudden exclamation indicative of the surprise of them both at such a&#xD;
meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
Not having the least idea that Lord Carlin would find, or attempt to find&#xD;
any hiding place from the colonel in the attic, poor Jobus could not suppose him&#xD;
in any danger of his life.&#xD;
But as moment after moment slipped by and he heard nothing, a strange.&#xD;
undefined fear began to creep over Jobus that he had unintentionally been the&#xD;
means of dragging Lord Carlin into.a trap which would be his destruction.&#xD;
With all his detestation of Lord Carlin, and with all his knowledge of hip&#xD;
utter worthlessness, Johns did not intend such a thing as that, so he cautiously&#xD;
opened the door of Frogs' attic to listen, and if needs be to save a life.&#xD;
All was so fearfully still that Jobus was puzzled how to account for it; but&#xD;
yet that very stillness had something awfully ominous about it, and the deep&#xD;
curiosity that had taken possession of Jobus's mind increased each moment.&#xD;
Not for many minutes longer could Jobus have endured the state of sus-&#xD;
pense in which he was, but he little suspected it was to be put an end to in so&#xD;
awful a manner as it was.&#xD;
Suddenly, as if a thunderbolt had fallen upon his heart, came that one shriek&#xD;
from the murdered man.&#xD;
Jobus staggered back into Frogs' attic, and if the wall had not stopped him,&#xD;
there is no knowing how far he would have gone ; but as it was, there he&#xD;
remained, with his arms outstretched before him, his mouth and eyes preter-&#xD;
naturally wide open, and his very hair almost standing on end with terror.&#xD;
What took place after the one frightful scream from the murdered man,&#xD;
Jobus knew not. The echo of that one fearful cry filled up his whole sense of&#xD;
hearing, and it was not until he heard the sharp click of the lock, as Colonel&#xD;

Abel, made him think that the officers of justice were upon his heels, and that&#xD;
he was about to be dragged to a prison.&#xD;
'They must let me in," groaned Jobus, and he leant against the doorpost&#xD;
to try and recover himself a little.&#xD;
While he thus leant, he asked himself-&#xD;
"How little or how much of what I know, shall I tell to Abel Morton, if he&#xD;
be here, or shall I tell him any as yet ?"&#xD;
This was a question tolerably in accordance with the cautious timidity of&#xD;
Jobns's character. The, fact of the murder of Lord Carlin pressed upon his&#xD;
intellect like a dead weight; and he was distracted by a thousand doubts and&#xD;
fears, when the door was suddenly opened and as he had been partially lean-&#xD;
ing against its panels, he fell upon all-four into the outer room of Abel Mor-&#xD;
ton's chambers.&#xD;
"What is it ?" said a voice.&#xD;
" Oh-oh-oh !" said Jobus.   "Who may you be?      I am only the&#xD;
, worm."&#xD;
It was Captain Lorrinet who had opened the dooi, and upon recognizing&#xD;
Johns, he called out-&#xD;
"Why, Abel, it's Elk's odd man."&#xD;
"I am-I am," said Jobus. "The Lord have mercy upon us all !"&#xD;
" Jobus ?" said Abel.&#xD;
"Yes, Mr. Morton. How do you feel now ?"&#xD;
"Who is with you," said Captain Lorrinet, as he observed that Jobus&#xD;
looked over his shoulder every moment suspiciously.&#xD;
'Nobody, excellent sir," replied Jobus; "but if it would be all the same&#xD;
to shut the door, it would be much more satisfactory to me, I beg to assure&#xD;
you; for though I don't think there is anybody after me just now, I don't&#xD;
know who may be."&#xD;
"Close the door, Rowley," said Captain Lorrinet ; and then pointing to the&#xD;
inner-room, he said to Jobus--" Come, you have not sought this place with-&#xD;
out a reason, and if it be Mr. Morton whom you seek, you will find him&#xD;
there. You have already done and said things to let him and his friends&#xD;
think that you are befriending him, so you are welcome."&#xD;
"I will follow you, noble sir," said Jobus.&#xD;
Nearly bent double, and looking more horribly pale and ill than usual, Jo-&#xD;
bus followed Lorrinet into the inner-room, and there sat poor Abel, with&#xD;
scarcely more color in his cheeks than Jobus had in his.&#xD;
" Good morning," said Jobus.&#xD;
"My good friend," said Abel, "you bring me some news, Iam sure?"&#xD;
'Why, a-oh, dear !"&#xD;
"Speak," said Lorrinet.&#xD;
" I-a-a-Yes, I am speaking ; but I don't know where to begin. I feel&#xD;
as if I should like to say a great deal, but-but"&#xD;
" But what?"&#xD;
"My story is in my heart and brain like a tangled thread, and I can't get&#xD;
hold of the end of it to draw it out properly. But, oh, young sir, you stand&#xD;
upon a precipice-indeed you do ;'and I almost think that flight, instant&#xD;
fight, till something can be done, will be the best thing for you to think of.&#xD;
There have things happened at the present time which have so strange and&#xD;
significant a connection with the things of the past, that I-I don't know&#xD;
what to say ?"&#xD;
Bang !-bang! came a knock at the door of the chambers, and the whole&#xD;
party sprang to their feet. Jobus then slid down to his hands and knees, and&#xD;
crawled under the table at once.&#xD;

HEADS AND HEARTS; OR,&#xD;
CHAPTER XLII.&#xD;
&#xD;
THAT this sudden and alarming knocking at the outer door of Abel's cham-&#xD;
bers portended the arrival of Colonel Elk, who. with inhuman powers and&#xD;
unblushing assurance, had come to drag him, Jobus, away to death, that in-&#xD;
dividualin his present state of mind, had no more doubt about, for a few&#xD;
minutes, than he had of the fact that he still breathed.&#xD;
The state of agony that Jobus was worked into, under these circumstances,&#xD;
completely finished the confusion and mystification of mind that had been&#xD;
growing upon him ever since the murder of Lord Carlin.&#xD;
But for that diabolical deed, Jobus would have preserved his usual calm&#xD;
imperturbability, and, doubtless, would have communicated in the best way,&#xD;
and at the best time, all that he knew of Elk and his proceedings ; but, cer-&#xD;
tainly, his mind was to some extent now unhinged.&#xD;
Abel was not without his fears, too, that the loud summons for admission&#xD;
to the chambers came from foes ; and even Lorrinet looked anxious. The&#xD;
young captain, however, felt the impolicy of refusing admission to whoever&#xD;
might be there ; and after the first feeling of surprise was over, he called out&#xD;
in a clear voice-&#xD;
"Rowley, open the door."&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
Rowley flung the door wide open, and Sir John Morton, with Mr. Carnae,&#xD;
appeared upon the threshold. The old man looked ten years older than he&#xD;
had done the day before, and his very lips were white with agitation and&#xD;
dread as he advanced a couple of steps into the room.&#xD;
His glance first fell upon Captain Lorrinet, and to him he spoke.&#xD;
"Sir," he said, "my son&#xD;
"Is here, Sir John Morton." said Lorrinet. "Pray walk in, sir."&#xD;
"Thank Heaven ! Oh, Abel-Abel! is this right to keep me waiting in&#xD;
such an agony of suspense ?"&#xD;
ua Quite wrong." said Mr. Carnac.&#xD;
"Father," said Abel, "things have happened-Oh, father, I-"&#xD;
Abel glanced at Lorrinet; but the captain felt how needlessly cruel to all&#xD;
parties it would be to say a word about the projected suicide of Abel, so he&#xD;
stepped forward, and relieved him from the state of embarrassment in which&#xD;
he was, by saying-&#xD;
"Sir John Morton, the fact is, that Abel delayed calling upon you at the&#xD;
hotel in Clarges street because he was in the hope that by so delaying he&#xD;
should have been able to bring you better news than he now has,"&#xD;
"Sir," said Sir John Morton, "the worst news is that which is engendered&#xD;
by the frightful anxiety of an expectant visitation. I have counted the min-&#xD;
utes, and each one seemed to be fraught with some new horror. I speak to&#xD;
you, as one who seems to know a dreadful fact."&#xD;
"I do know, sir."&#xD;
"Father," said Abel, faintly, "that is Captain Lorrinet of the Guards."&#xD;
"Are you the son of Colonel Lorrinet, sir, who fell at Burgos ?" said Sir&#xD;
John Morton.&#xD;
"The same, sir," said Lorrjnet, and his voice faltered.&#xD;
"Well, young man, your father died in my arms."&#xD;
Lorrinet staggered to a seat, and tears came to his eyes; but Sir John&#xD;
walked up to him, and took both his hands in his.&#xD;
"Young man," he said, "I do not know if you have been one of my poor&#xD;
boy's tempters or not; but Iam glad to see you for the name you bear."&#xD;
"Father," cried Abel, "Captain Lorrinet was the only man who made a&#xD;
bold attempt to step between my soul and the follies that I am guilty of.&#xD;
For that attempt I quarrelled with him, and sent him from me ; but in the&#xD;
hour of regret, and distress, and anguish, he came back to me, prompted by&#xD;
his noble spirit, and forgetting all theinjustice of which I had been guilty to&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
him--forgetting all the foolish petulance which should have offended him, he&#xD;
has held out his hand to me-that hand which I am not worthy to touch-&#xD;
and said, "Abel what can I do for you ?"&#xD;
Sir John Morton wept as he again shook hands with Lorrinet, and said&#xD;
faintly-&#xD;
-'Another time, my dear young friend-another time. I can't Say to you&#xD;
now what I would say. God bless you. There, now, that is the blessing, re-&#xD;
turned from my lips to you, that your father gave me in his last moments&#xD;
his last words were, 'God bless you, Morton !"&#xD;
Captain Lorrinet stepped to the window to hide his emotion, and then Mr.&#xD;
Carnac, after a preliminary "Hem !" said-&#xD;
"Mr. Abel Morton, your father, finding you did not return from the little&#xD;
mission he had sent you on, sent for me, and I attended him at once. His&#xD;
great anxieties brought him here, and I would not permit him to come alone.&#xD;
Have you seen Colonel ELk ?"&#xD;
"Ah, my dear boy," said Sir John, "only tell me that you have seen and&#xD;
settled with him, and all will yet be well."&#xD;
"I cannot, father."&#xD;
"You cannot see him ?"&#xD;
"I have seen him, but-but he declares that-he will not part with the bill,&#xD;
unless-unless---&#xD;
" Unless what, 4bel ?"&#xD;
Abel was about to give utterance to the proposition of Elk to the effect that&#xD;
he would not part with the bill but at the sacrifice of the whole of his father's&#xD;
fortune, but he checked himself, and would not say it. He only added in a&#xD;
weak voice-&#xD;
"That is all.---He will prosecute."&#xD;
"Prosecute when I will pay him ?-I will pay him three times over !"&#xD;
AeStop,' said Mr. Carnac. "Are you sure he has the bill himself, Mr.&#xD;
Abel?"      "&#xD;
"Quite !" said a voice from under the table, and Jobus laid hold of the at-&#xD;
torney's ankle to assist him in emerging from his place of concealment.-&#xD;
"' Quite !"&#xD;
Murder !" shouted Mr. Carnac.&#xD;
"Don't .be alarmed, sir," said Jobus, "it's only me ! The poor earth&#xD;
worm, sir, that's all!"&#xD;
"Why, good gracious, that is the man who came to my chambers and put&#xD;
to me some half-dozen hypothetical legal questions, and then ran off so that&#xD;
nobody could stop him. Don't let him go now, gentlemen. He must be the&#xD;
devil himself."&#xD;
.'Ah," said Jobus, "you lawyers are always thinking of that retired dig-&#xD;
nitary ; but I am, on the contrary, only a worm. How do you do, Sir John?&#xD;
Hope you are pretty well, Mr. Carnac. If X. gives a bill to W-"&#xD;
"Oh, plague take you," cried Mr. Carnac, "-I won't answer any more ques-&#xD;
tions, but I will give a general opinion, and that is, that if any letter of the&#xD;
alphabet can procure in any way, a certain bill from E. and hand it to M. it&#xD;
will be a good piece of work done."&#xD;
"Oh," said Jobus, "perhaps J. if he did that, might call upon Q. and say,&#xD;
"What the deuce is all this," cried Sir John. "The only Q. I know is Mr.&#xD;
Quested, Lady Morton's uncle."&#xD;
Jobus clapped his hands together, and cried-&#xD;
"Lady Morton's uncle, is he ?"&#xD;
"You are sure of that ?"&#xD;
"O' course."&#xD;
"And-and-for you-that is, for Lady Morton, Mr. Quested, the great&#xD;
East India nerchant will do a favor-eh? eh ?"&#xD;
"Anything in his power !"&#xD;

&#xD;
Jobus lifted his right leg, and spun round on his left as he cried, to the&#xD;
amazement of everybody-&#xD;
" Ri-to-looral-loo !"&#xD;
"H~e's mad !" cried Sir John. "Keep off, sir !"&#xD;
"Tol-de-rol-lol-de-li !"added Jobus. "Did you ever see a worm dance the&#xD;
polka?  Oh dear, I'm afraid I'm committing myself very much, indeed. Oh&#xD;
-oh! Ah, dear me ! Is his name Abel Quested ?"&#xD;
"It is. Abel is his god-son."&#xD;
" Tiddi-iddi-iddi! Oh, no-I didn't mean that-I-Oh for ! I rather think,&#xD;
gentlemen, that you see before you an impetuous worm, who, by the power&#xD;
of unforeseen circumstances, is just a little insane at present ; but he will be&#xD;
better soon, I assure you."&#xD;
He is quite mad," said Sir John.&#xD;
"Not quite, Sir John, let me remark. And now I must be going ; but be-&#xD;
fore I go, I have a little bit of advice to give, and that is, that Abel Morton&#xD;
keeps out of the way for a day or two-only three days we will say. There's&#xD;
an empty house next door !"&#xD;
These last words were an aside by Jobus, but.although no doubt quite pro-&#xD;
perly connected with some idea of his own, they seemed so totally irrelevent&#xD;
to what was going on, that they only the more confirmed the parties present&#xD;
in the ides that he was a little cracked.&#xD;
' He," said Mr. Carnac, indicating Jobus, "is a very extraordinary person,&#xD;
and it is not for me to give any opinion concerning his mental peculiarities ;&#xD;
but the advice regarding the departure of Abel. from London for a few days,&#xD;
while we endeavor to negotiate with the ma ,lk, is too good to be neglected."&#xD;
"He shall go at once," said Sir John.&#xD;
"Let him go to Oxford," said, Captain  et, approaching the party from&#xD;
the window where he had been. "There is a coach within one hour of the&#xD;
present time starts from Hyde Park Corner for that city. Let Abel go by it,&#xD;
and the promptness of the step 'will be its security."&#xD;
"Yes," cried Sir John.  ' Come, Abel, come."   a&#xD;
"Father, I will go if you wish it," said Abel; "but let me implore you not&#xD;
to give way to that man, Elk. He will make the most terrible demands. Oh,&#xD;
do not allow your affection for me to wrong you ! Better that I should fall,&#xD;
than that the latter part of your life, and of my mother's too, should be spent&#xD;
in want."&#xD;
"Want !" cried Sir John. "He-he don't ask all we have surely, Abel ?"&#xD;
"He-does !"&#xD;
"The villain !" said Lorrinet.&#xD;
"I expected it," said Mr. Carnac.&#xD;
"I knew it," said Jobus.&#xD;
Sir John Morton was the first to recover from the shock of this stunning&#xD;
communication, and then taking Abel by the hand, he said-&#xD;
"Cheer up my boy. We will fight and conquer this bold, bad man, yet.&#xD;
Fear nothing. Come. We will take the advice of Lorrinet here, and go to the&#xD;
Oxford coach office at once. Let us all go. The streets are quiet and still at&#xD;
this hour, and you will be off in safety. Come, Abel-come."&#xD;
"God bless you all-I can say no more."&#xD;
"I will ride twenty miles on the road with you, Abel," said Lorrinet, "and&#xD;
then you won't feel dull."&#xD;
Sir John thanked the young officer by a glance, and Abel shook his hand,&#xD;
but did not utter a word.&#xD;
They all left the Albany together, and Jobus hovered on the outskirts of&#xD;
the party, rubbing his hands together, and now and then uttering the name of&#xD;
Abel Quested to himself. Rowley looked after them till they were out of his&#xD;
observation, and then shaking his head, he said-&#xD;
"Something wrong with the governor. Don't know what it is; but there's&#xD;
a blessed screw loose somewhere, or the linch pin out of the blessed axle.&#xD;

Well, we shall see what we shall see, I suppose. Oh, what a nice cove that&#xD;
Johus is !"&#xD;
The coach office at Hyde Park Corner was soon reached, and Jobus was just&#xD;
chuckling over the name of Abel Quested again, when he suddenly flung him-&#xD;
self on the pavement, and ran off half the length of a quiet street close at hand&#xD;
upon all-fours, and then, with a shout of dismay, he got upon his feet, and off&#xD;
he went at his utmost speed, leaving the whole party stricken dumb with&#xD;
amazement at his sudden flight.&#xD;
CHAPTER        XLIII.&#xD;
WHNw Jobus ran off in the sudden and mysterious manner we have&#xD;
recorded, the only one of the Morton party that was at all disposed to go after&#xD;
him was Captain Lorrinet; and he having an idea-a perfectly correct one, too,&#xD;
as the reader is well aware-that Johns had a great deal to tell if he could&#xD;
only be brought to tell it, was determined not to lose sight of him if he could&#xD;
possibly help it.&#xD;
The fleetness of Lorrinet soon brought him up to Jobus, and catching him&#xD;
by the collar, the young captain cried out to him-&#xD;
"Stop, my friend, we cannot spare you just yet."       '&#xD;
"Murder !" shouted Jobus.&#xD;
"Don't you know me ?" said Lorrinet. "I am a friend."&#xD;
"Police! Murder !" roared Jobus again, for his fears had so overcome him,&#xD;
that he could not believe it possible anybody had hold of him but the redoub-&#xD;
ted Colonel Elk himself, and he fully believed that in the course of the next few&#xD;
minutes he would be sacrificed to his fury.&#xD;
It was fortunate for Lorrinet that the hour was one at which there were very&#xD;
few people about, as Jobus, by his cries would soon have collected a crowd,&#xD;
and when that is done it is not so easy to get rid of it again.&#xD;
"Peace-peace !" cried Lorrinet, as he turned Jobus round and made him&#xD;
look him in the face in spite of all his resistance. "Look at me, man, and dis-&#xD;
pel your fears. Do you know me now ?"&#xD;
"Oh-oh-oh dear !" said Jobus.&#xD;
"I say, do you know me ?"&#xD;
"To be sure I do. You are the general-no, the corporal-bless me, no,&#xD;
you are the captain."&#xD;
" Well; and what made you run off in such a way ?"&#xD;
"I saw-I saw-oh !"&#xD;
"'What ?"&#xD;
"It wasn't a what. I saw him!"&#xD;
"Who?"&#xD;
"Oh-oh !"&#xD;
"Speak, I charge you. If you are what you affect to be, namely, a friend&#xD;
to Abel Morton, you will shake off the degrading fears that possess you and&#xD;
speak freely to me, if you dread to do so to him. I am one who will do all&#xD;
that can be don for him and his; and I am one, too, who feels largely inter-&#xD;
ested in what taes  ce at the house of Colonel Elk. If it be necessary that&#xD;
some part of your munication should be held by me in strict confidence, I&#xD;
pledge my word of  n   s an officer and a gentleman that such shall be the&#xD;
case ; but I implore yo  longer to deal in mysteries or half-communications,&#xD;
but to speak freely in the cause of right and of justice, and to tell all you know.&#xD;
Better tell me nothing than leave me wandering about 'n a maze of conjecture&#xD;
that cannot but be most prolific of error andof destruction. Speak, I say, and&#xD;
speak freely."&#xD;
"Oh, dear !" said Jobus. 4"Oh l"&#xD;
"Come, now, be a man."&#xD;
"A what?"&#xD;

&#xD;
"A man, I say, be a man. Discard these unworthy fears, and speak to&#xD;
me freely."&#xD;
A man !" groaned Jobus. "I'm only a worm !"&#xD;
"Nonsense. Tell me, is it possible that you repent of the manner in which&#xD;
you came forward to try and serve those who were oppressed by that atrocious&#xD;
scoundrel, Elk ?"&#xD;
" flush ! Oh, hush !-&#xD;
"Nay, I speak freely, and I call him a villain of the first magnitude. I would&#xD;
just as soon say as much to his face as here to you."&#xD;
"Oh dear-oh dear! I will tell you, young man, what made me fly from&#xD;
vou and your friends in such a way. Yes, I will now tell you. But don't&#xD;
let us stay here. Let us get as far as possible from that coach office." "&#xD;
"Whef-efore ?&#xD;
Jobus turned and looked the young captain in the face, as he said slowly&#xD;
and solemnly-.-&#xD;
" Because Colonel Elk was standing in the doorway of it."&#xD;
" Colonel Elk ?"&#xD;
" A h !"&#xD;
"Impossible !"&#xD;
"Very likely ; but it's as true as the gospel for all that. I saw him. lam not&#xD;
very likely to mistake him. Oh dear, no. I saw him."&#xD;
"Then poor Abel is foiled in his attempt to leave London. By what con-&#xD;
founded jugglery could he be there? Are we living in the days of witchcraft&#xD;
that that fiend, in the shape of man, can have a premise of our thoughts and&#xD;
desires, as quickly as we can ourselves conceive them ?"&#xD;
"No !" said Jobus, "no! It has been some cross accident, that is all. The&#xD;
colonel meditates flight."&#xD;
" Ah indeed 2"&#xD;
"But not before he has settled all his affairs in London. The probability&#xD;
was that his errand to the coach office was connected with such a meditated&#xD;
flight. He was there to make inquiries. But he did not see me. Oh, dear !&#xD;
I don't think he saw me."&#xD;
"Nor I either." said Lorrinet. "I don't think it was possible; and you were&#xD;
off so quick, and in such an extraordinary manner, that he could not observe&#xD;
you, even if he heard an alarm."&#xD;
"No-no. That is true. He was not looking my way at all, so I feel sure&#xD;
that I escaped him."&#xD;
"Not a doubt of it. And so, he means to leave London when he has settled&#xD;
all his affairs, does he ?"&#xD;
"Yes, and England as well as London. He thinks that he has settled one&#xD;
of his little affairs ; but he hasn't. I live !"&#xD;
"You are an extraordinary man, Mr. Jobus, and I wish you .would be&#xD;
explicit, instead of dealing in such mysteries as you do. But come, now I will&#xD;
trust you with a secret of mine, and I hope that may induce you to trust me&#xD;
with one of yours."&#xD;
"What is it ?"&#xD;
"I love Dora."&#xD;
"Ah, I partly guessed it. Are you sure you love her ?"&#xD;
"As sure as that I live."&#xD;
"A cup of coffee !"&#xD;
"A what ?"&#xD;
"A cup of coffee. Only three-halfpence. . Come into this shop-I will tell&#xD;
you something."&#xD;
"Nay," said Lorrinet, with a smile at the kind of coffee accomodation which&#xD;
Jobus seemed to think would suit him. "I will take you where you will be&#xD;
more comfortable and more private, too. This neighborhood is very well&#xD;
known to me. Trust me to take you somewhere."&#xD;
"There's an empty house next door," said Jobus.&#xD;
"Next door to what ?"-&#xD;
&#xD;
"I was only making a little remark to myself; you go on, and I will fol-&#xD;
low you. Yes, I will tell you that something that you ought to know. She&#xD;
shall be saved, poor child-poor child !"&#xD;
"Of whom speak you ?"&#xD;
" Of Dora.'&#xD;
"Then I could listen to you all day, my good Jobus. But here is a private,&#xD;
quiet hotel, where they know me, and we will breakfast here, and you can&#xD;
communicate to me freely what you please. I feel that in listening to you I&#xD;
am, probably, doing more good to Abel Morton than if Iran back to apologise&#xD;
, for my desertion of him just now."&#xD;
"You are so."&#xD;
Th'young captain was well known in the hotel; and as it was now fairly&#xD;
morning, although, certainly, the hour was rather an early one, they found no&#xD;
difficulty in getting admittance to the place; and in'a quiet, cheerful-looking&#xD;
private room, Jobus and Captain Lorrinet, to the vast suprise of the waiters&#xD;
-a surprise, however; which they were too well bred to permit to appear in&#xD;
their manner, or in their faces--breakfasted together in good style.&#xD;
"Young man," said Jobus, "it does not often happen that a mere worm like&#xD;
myself is able to say anything to a young and ardent lover that he will think&#xD;
of such importance as what I am now about to say to you."&#xD;
"For Heaven's sake say it quickly, Jobus."&#xD;
"I will. You loye Dora?  Well, there is but one drawback in yqur own&#xD;
mind, to your happiness, for she loves you."&#xD;
She loves me! Ah, yes, I know-I feel that she loves me ! I will take-".&#xD;
"Another bit of toast ?"&#xD;
"No-no !-my oath that she loves me.    Beautiful Dora !-dear, dear&#xD;
girl,! I think I see her now. I would not grieve her pure and gentle heart&#xD;
for-"&#xD;
"A new laid egg ?" said Jobus--"&#xD;
"Not for the universe. She is, I tell you, Mr. Jobus, dearer to me than life&#xD;
itself, and without her I should feel like  "           ,&#xD;
"A small lump of sugar ?" said Jobus.&#xD;
"But tell me all. Come, I am all impatience to hear you."&#xD;
"Very good. Then, you would like her ten times better if she had not Col-&#xD;
onel Elk for.an uncle ?"&#xD;
No-no !"&#xD;
"You wouldn't? Oh, dear !"&#xD;
" No; but I can tell you that I would rather such were not the case. I&#xD;
eould not possibly love her better than I do. But yet I know that it will be&#xD;
a source of grief to her and regret to me, that she is in any way connected with&#xD;
that man."&#xD;
" Just so. Then, she ain't."&#xD;
"What?"&#xD;
"I tell you Dora is not the niece of Colonel Elk, nor in any way in the world&#xD;
related to him."&#xD;
"You astonish me ! You-take away my breath !"&#xD;
"I thought I should. Listen to me: Did Abel Morton ever tell you that&#xD;
many years ago he lost his sister Loo, as they called her, and that his father&#xD;
became prematurely old in consequence of his grief; and that from that day to&#xD;
the present they had never caught sight of her, or been able to get any news&#xD;
of her fate? Did Abel ever in a moment of confidence tell you that ?"&#xD;
" He did-he did!"&#xD;
"Ah I".&#xD;
"But you don't mean to tell me, Jobus-that is to say, you don't intend to&#xD;
assert-you-you cannot say-that-    "&#xD;
"I do."&#xD;
"That Dora is Abel's sister-the child of Sir John Morton? You don't&#xD;
surely mean that ?"&#xD;

HEADS AND HEARTS; OR7&#xD;
&#xD;
The young officer had risen from his chair in his anxiety and agitation, and&#xD;
now he sank back into it again, and looked keenly at Jobus for some few&#xD;
moments in silence, after which he said in a low, deep-toned voice of much&#xD;
emotion-&#xD;
"And how long have you known this ?"&#xD;
Jobus felt the reproach keenly.&#xD;
"How long have you let the father gro  prematurely old by grieving for&#xD;
his child?  How long is it that you have let the mother's tears flow for the&#xD;
loss of her darling?  How long is it since you have cast a shadow over the&#xD;
heart of the brother for the loss of his sister? How long is it since you have-&#xD;
deprived that young girl of all the dear and fond delights of home, kindred,&#xD;
affection, such as she might have had ?"&#xD;
Johns shuddered.&#xD;
"Answer me this !" cried Captain Lorrinet, with vehemence. "I demand&#xD;
that you answer me this !"&#xD;
Johns rose, and tottered towards the door of the room.&#xD;
"It is enough," he said; "I know it all. I see altthat. and it is natural&#xD;
that you should think as you think, because you do not know all. Farewell&#xD;
.--farewell. "&#xD;
'"Stay."&#xD;
"No. It is better not. Henceforth I am in your eyes too criminal to be&#xD;
attended to. What I would say will now pass for nothing. I know that you&#xD;
are quite right, young man. I know that I am all you say I am, or think I&#xD;
am. Forget me. Farewell !"&#xD;
Jobus would have left the room, but Captain Lorrinet sprang after him. and&#xD;
stopped him at the door, and led him back to the seat he had risen from, and&#xD;
then said to him-&#xD;
'.Forgive me ; I am too hasty., and in all probability I have said to you&#xD;
what I ought not to have said. It is true enough that I cannot tell how you&#xD;
were situated-I cannot be a competent judge of the circumstances that di-&#xD;
rected you to act as you have done. Forgive my hasty speech, and let us only&#xD;
think now of the best mode of saving that young and gentle girl from the&#xD;
contamination of further residence beneath the roof of Colonel Elk."&#xD;
Jobus sighed deeply.&#xD;
"Young man," he said{  t is true that you do not know all the circum-&#xD;
stances with which I was surrounded, but I will tell you that for all the years&#xD;
that have passed away since the child was snatched from the arms of Sir John&#xD;
Morton, I have watched over her safety, although I could not-dared not re-&#xD;
turn her to him; I have night and day attended upon her, and I have warded&#xD;
m her  any dangers. Perhaps I ought to have told all long ago, long&#xD;
--lona go ; ut my spirit was broken, and I could not-I could not !"&#xD;
Jobus   his head droop upon thQ breakfast-table, and wept.&#xD;
Then it was that Captain Lorrinet reproached himself for what he had said&#xD;
to him, and thought how wrong it was for him, in health and spirits, and with&#xD;
no depressing influences about him, to speak plainly and boldly of what was&#xD;
right, and of what another ought to have done, and yet how impossible it&#xD;
might be for that other to pursue such a course, when, perchance, he was&#xD;
bankrupt in health, spirit, and pocket-when the very lassitude of a nearly&#xD;
broken heart was upon his mind-when to live appeared a burthen, and when&#xD;
even the justice of Heaven was converted into a shuddering doubt.&#xD;
"Come, my friend," said the young officer, gently laying his hand upon&#xD;
Jobus's arm. "Come, my friend, I feel that you have not forgiven me yet."&#xD;
_' Oh, yes-yes. Have you forgiven met?".&#xD;
'1 have nothing to forgive, but much-very much to thank you for. Let&#xD;
us, in the name of Dora, shake hands, and banishing from our minds the past,&#xD;
except in so far as its recollection may aid us in the future, let us concert to-&#xD;
gether for her benefit."&#xD;
"Call her Louisa Morton."&#xD;
"Oh, yes. What a happy change !"&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.&#xD;
&#xD;
'It is a happy change; but we will make a happier change&#xD;
man, you have now a mission to the house of CoelrEchan eoYoung&#xD;
wise. We can help each other."               onel Elk; I have one lik.&#xD;
"Assuredly we can."&#xD;
' But I must exact from you one promise."&#xD;
" Name it.&#xD;
"It is, that when you succeed in saving Dora from the dangers that&#xD;
round her, you will take her to some place where she can remain in honor asur&#xD;
in safety, and not at present say anything to Sir John, or to Abel Mrton of&#xD;
her happy discovery.&#xD;
"Believing, my friend, that you have a good reason for all you say, or d&#xD;
in the matter," said Lorrinet, "I cheerfully consent to your wish."ay,&#xD;
"Be it so, then, and now I have much to tell you. Yes, I know from sad&#xD;
experience how dangerous a thing is a half-confidence. I ought to have told&#xD;
you nothing, if I did not tell you all."&#xD;
"That is true. But you do not repent telling me what you have 1"&#xD;
"Oh, no--no. It seems to have ,taken a mountain off here."  Jobs, a&#xD;
he spoke, touched his heart, and then he faintly smiled as he added-" I think&#xD;
that all will be well at last."&#xD;
"Without a doubt," said Lorrinet. "But now let me beg of you to leep&#xD;
nothing from me. I feel assured that there is much, even in yo ur own his&#xD;
tory, which it is well that I should know, for I will hepyou, if it be possi..&#xD;
ble, and recover you from the state of mental thraldom in whichyou a&#xD;
to have been so long."                                     3o   ppe&#xD;
Upon this. Jobus, in a low tone, made a long statement to the u ofcer,&#xD;
which greatly excited his surprise. and to which he listened witheyoungstianer&#xD;
ions attention.nanz"&#xD;
At the conclusion of the statement, the heads of which will he soon known&#xD;
to the reader, they remained in consultation for about half an hor longer,&#xD;
and then Jobus rose to go, and as he did so, he said to Lorrinet--omret&#xD;
" Remember, we meet at twelve o'clock t-nighato." rmt&#xD;
rn    of CHAPTER       XLIV.&#xD;
WHEN Jobus ran off in so sudden and mysterious a manner from the party&#xD;
ty that was making its way to the Oxforys crosa omcande frmwhe Cpaty&#xD;
Lorrinet ran after him, the rest of the party had not the least idea of wh&#xD;
or wherefore they so disappeared.  pwhy&#xD;
Abel and his father looked at each other in surprise, and Mr. Carnac looked&#xD;
at them both as much as to say--&#xD;
"Are the people all out of their wits ?"&#xD;
They were none of them, though, for long kept in this state of suspense,&#xD;
for Abel Morton caught sight of Colonel Elk, as Jobus had truly described&#xD;
him to Lorrinet, standing upon the steps of the inn-door, at the very moment&#xD;
that he, Elk, had caught sight of Abel and his friends.,a   y&#xD;
" Father l" said Abel. faintly. "Colonel Elk stands now before you."&#xD;
For a moment, then, the father staggered at the idea that the man who had&#xD;
been, and was the direst enemy his son had ever had, or was ever likely to&#xD;
have, was before him; and then he recovered his composure, to outward ap&#xD;
pearances at all events, and was upon the point of advancing towards Elk,&#xD;
saying as he did so--p&#xD;
"I will speak to him," when he was stopped by Mr. Carnac who in a de-&#xD;
termined manner said-e,&#xD;
"No, Sir John. No."&#xD;
" Yes, hut---.&#xD;
"Nay, my dear sir, permit me, if you please, as your solicitor and m&#xD;
busmess. I am here, and I am the'fit and proper person to speak to the-&#xD;
hem! the individual now before us."  n&#xD;

HEADS AND HEARTS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
With a slow and sauntering step, the colonel approached the party. The&#xD;
truth was, he was as much surprised to see Abel and his friends, as they&#xD;
were to see him. His first idea was to avoid them, as their's was to avoid&#xD;
him ; but both parties had improved upon that notion, and thought, upon a&#xD;
little reflection, that it would be better to remain.&#xD;
And now Sir John placed his arm within that of his son,-and strove to look&#xD;
the enemy of his family in the face. Alas ! Sir John did not know how great&#xD;
an enemy that man really was to him and his !&#xD;
Mr. Carnac advanced a few paces, in order to prevent the colonel from ap-&#xD;
proaching to within speaking distance of the Mortons, and then slightly bow-&#xD;
ing to him, more from habit than from the remotest idea of paying such a man&#xD;
any respect, he said-&#xD;
"Your name, I'am informed, is Elk, sir ?"&#xD;
"Wellsir," said the colonel, " and yours 7"&#xD;
"I am Mr. Carnac, of Lincoln's-inn-fields, the attorney of Sir John Morton,&#xD;
and likewise of his son, Mr. Abel Morton."&#xD;
"Indeed, sir !"&#xD;
"=And." added Mr. Carnac, I have to request, upon the part of my clients,&#xD;
that anything you may have to say concerning them or their affairs as con-&#xD;
nected with you, you will be so good as to say to me."&#xD;
Colonel Elk looked keenly at the attorney, and then he said-&#xD;
"Have your two worthy and exemplary clients, sir, been  confidential,&#xD;
with you?"&#xD;
"My clients, sir, are confidential with me&#xD;
"Very well, sir; perhaps, then, you are aware that I can have nothing to&#xD;
say to you, as you are not a metropolitan magistrate, with one of whom my&#xD;
business must lie in the matter with which you, no doubt, are well acquainted ?"&#xD;
"I have very little doubt," said Mr. Carnac, calmly, "that you allude to&#xD;
an alleged forgery. If you wish to go before a magistrate upon the subject,&#xD;
we are willing to meet you there forthwith."&#xD;
"Say you so, sir ?"&#xD;
' Certainly. We are in a position to meet you before a magistrate ; but&#xD;
vet we would avoid even that, if we could, at some expense too, as we do not&#xD;
court publicity to affairs that no family would wish blazoned to the world,&#xD;
however they might feel confident they have nothing ultimately to fear."&#xD;
"You are quite a man of business, sir," said the colonel. "Do you know,&#xD;
I think I shall, be able to arrange matters very well with you. I have no&#xD;
particular desire to give publicity to the transaction'you so ingeniously allude&#xD;
to, although the result of that publicity 'would be to hang one of your&#xD;
exemplary clients."&#xD;
" Not at all."&#xD;
"Or transport the other for perjury."'&#xD;
"Oh dear, no."&#xD;
Mr. Carnac calmly took a pinch of snuff.&#xD;
"Sir," said Elk, "Sir John Morton repudiates or owns the signatures to the&#xD;
bill?"&#xD;
" Ah !"&#xD;
"If he repudiate it, Abel hangs."&#xD;
" Ah !"&#xD;
"If he owns it, I indict him for perjury, and have witnesses to prove that&#xD;
he did repudiate."&#xD;
"We are in a position liemeet all that. Perhaps we may find an important&#xD;
witness too."&#xD;
"Ha! ha! Noyou won't !&#xD;
At that moment, Colonel Elk, in his inmost heart blessed himself for&#xD;
murdering Jobus, as he thought he had done, for, by some means, it was&#xD;
pretty evident that he. Jobs, knew more of the transaction than the colonel&#xD;
thought known to mortal man with the exception of himself and Abel Morton&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHERS THE COLONEL,                      165&#xD;
"Very good," said Mr. Carnac, as he indulged in another pinch of snuff-&#xD;
"you can do as you please, sir."&#xD;
"But what-.--."&#xD;
"'Go on, Colonel Elk."&#xD;
"What do you mean to do ?"&#xD;
"Nothing. We are quite contended if you are, and if you are not, we wait&#xD;
quietly and patiently for your acts, resting quite certain that we shall have&#xD;
early information of them."&#xD;
Colonel Elk glanced around him for a moment to be satisfied that no one&#xD;
was within hearing, and then he said to Mr. Carnac-&#xD;
"hark you, sir. Your clients will have to pay. They have, no doubt,&#xD;
told you as much. Call upon me, at twelve o'clock to-morrow, and I will&#xD;
speak to you."&#xD;
"c No."&#xD;
"No ?  You will not ?"&#xD;
"Certainly not. You can call upon us, if you like-you will find us all at&#xD;
the Albany to-morrow, at the hour you mention, when, if you like to make&#xD;
any reasonable proposal, I shall advise my clients to accede to it, and if not,&#xD;
we can at once adjourn from there, with all our witnesses, to a magistrate,&#xD;
for I shall advise my clients to bring the affair to as speedy an issue as&#xD;
possible."&#xD;
Elk bit his lips.&#xD;
"To-morrow, at twelve, then. At the Albany."&#xD;
" Be it so.&#xD;
At this moment, Abel sprang foward ; he was no longer able to maintain a&#xD;
prudent reserve; and confronting the colonel, he cried-.&#xD;
"If you were a man !--if you had a little of the courage you always made&#xD;
such loud profession of, you would meet me face to face, and let the death of&#xD;
one or both'put an end to this complexity !"&#xD;
"Ha! ha !" said the colonel.&#xD;
"Villain! coward ! assassin"&#xD;
"My dear Abel," said the colonel, producing a splendid gold snuff-box,&#xD;
and indulging himself with a pinch of its contents. "My dear Abel, I strongly&#xD;
advise you to keep your temper, not that it matters to me a jot, not a jot-&#xD;
for I can put it all in the bill ! Ha ! ha !"&#xD;
" Monster !"&#xD;
"The ladies don't say so," smiled the colonel, "or if they do. it is by that&#xD;
rule of. contrary, which makes the sex so delightfully enigmatical..-Good&#xD;
evening, Abel  Remember me, by-the-by, to the fair cousin. Ha! ha!-&#xD;
At twelve to-morrow, Mr. Carnac; and remember, a hundred eyes are upon&#xD;
the actions of that young eman, Abel Morton. My myrmidons hem him in&#xD;
upon all sides. You understand me. Any attempt of his to escape can only&#xD;
produce an awkward eclaircissement, and cannot by any possibility succeed.&#xD;
Good evening. A cool air up this evening."&#xD;
The colonel turned on his heel and sauntered down Piccadilly as if nothing&#xD;
at all were amiss.&#xD;
"Mr. Comae looked after him with a kind of admiration, although he thor-&#xD;
oughly comprehended the villany of the man. During a tolerably long expe-&#xD;
rience he had never come across a man with such thorough self-possession as&#xD;
Colonel Elk, and he felt all the difficulty that there would be in dealing with}&#xD;
such a person.&#xD;
Turning to Abel, the lawyer said-&#xD;
"Permit me to observe, Mr. Abel, that you were very indiscreet. You&#xD;
cannot hope to better your position with such a man by speaking to him as&#xD;
you have."&#xD;
"I could not help it," said Abel.&#xD;
" Well--well, it is done now, Bot what say you, Sir John Morton? Do&#xD;
you feel disposed to give Elk an interview to-morrow at twelve o'clock at the&#xD;
Albany.&#xD;

' Well, if I might advise, I should say, oh, yes-yes."&#xD;

",lcst this, that every hour we gain in the way of negotiation with Elk&#xD;
dauges the case he has to bring against Abel, and places him in a worse posi-&#xD;

give ih the meeting he desires, and I am of opinion that hewould shrink&#xD;
from onvthing in the shape of pr'osecution much more than we should."&#xD;
S that isa blessed thought," said Sir John.  "Abel, we will pay this man,&#xD;
and ;,.t rid of him,"&#xD;
Oh, no-no father !"&#xD;
"is myboy, we will. At any price we will get rid of him. What does&#xD;
't matter if he does take all our money?  I have some claims as an old officer&#xD;
upon the government, and you and I can get into the army at once; so if we&#xD;
can but keep the old house over our heads that we are all so accustomed to,&#xD;
we shall be happy enough."~&#xD;
"Father, father, rather than Elk should so triumph, I would'&#xD;
Abel paused.&#xD;
"My son," said Sir John, "I will not pretend to guess what dreadful&#xD;
thought was in your mind at that moment, but remember we suffer now upon&#xD;
your account; and if you have one spark of feeling for me and for your mother.&#xD;
you will allow us to act as we think proper, and most conducive to our own&#xD;
happiness in the affair now in progress. You must leave all to us."&#xD;
I will," said Abel, faintly.&#xD;
"Come, come." said Mr. Carnac, "let us give up all ideas for the present&#xD;
of Abel leaving London. Th e colonel has been kind enough to state that he&#xD;
has surrounded him with spies, and I think from what I have seen of the man&#xD;
that nothing is more probable than that he has done so; and therefore, let us&#xD;
agree upon the meeting for to-morrow at twelve at the Albany."&#xD;
"Be it so," said Sir John.&#xD;
"I am content that it should be so," said Abel. "But let it be the only&#xD;
and the last meeting between you and that man, father. Refuse his terms at&#xD;
"We shall see, my dear boy," said Sir John, "we shall see.. But what has&#xD;

"lie ran after that man, Jobus," said Mr. Carnac.  "Doubtless Johs&#xD;
saw his old master, the colonel, and naturally wished'to avoid him, seeing that&#xD;
if IBk had observed him, he must likewise have observed that he was in our&#xD;
company. They will doubtless find their way back to the Albany."&#xD;
"At twelve to-morrow, then," said Sir John;- "all will be settled at twelve&#xD;
to-m~orrow."&#xD;
The old man shuddered as he spoke.&#xD;
OJHAPTER XLV&#xD;
As one clock sounded in rather cracked tones from the clock-tower of St.&#xD;
James's Palace, Jobus reached the bottom of St. James's street, and paused&#xD;
to wipe his face, with an apology for a pocket handkerchief. We say apology,&#xD;
for it was a rag with an extraordinary collection of rents in it; but Jobus was&#xD;
not very particular.&#xD;
With a cat-like andstealthy tread, Jobus approached the gate of thepace,&#xD;
as though he contemplated making-a sudden spring at the soldier on duy&#xD;
there: he regarded him for some minutes in silence. Then, in his odd way,&#xD;
Jobus spoke-&#xD;
"Oh, dear me ! there is a man with a gun on his shoulder. Oh-oh! what&#xD;
a strange thing it is that worms are to be found who will go and kill other&#xD;
worms, and run the risk of being smashed themselves, for sixpence a day I&#xD;
Dear me ! Oh-oh, dear ! I didn't laugh, if you please, Mr. Soldie."&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.                      167&#xD;
"Stand back !"&#xD;
"Oh, certainly--with great pleasure. But-he! he !-'-is it pl-eaant walking&#xD;
np a drun here, and only now and then achieving the victor of getting&#xD;
onto a trunk set up on end ?"                           yogetn&#xD;
"Eh?   What do you want ?" said the sentinel.&#xD;
Jobus pointed within the gate.&#xD;
"Be of ' !" cried the soldier, "or I shall take you in charge, and give you to&#xD;
the guard !"                             yua    hre n     ieyut&#xD;
"it would be no great gift," said Jobus. "But do you have to find your&#xD;
own pipe-clay? I have often wondered, but never thought of asking any gal-&#xD;
The soldier made a charge at Jobus with the butt-end of his muske&#xD;
when he found that that did not alarm him, he brought it dow, s set, and&#xD;
upon the intruder's toes; but Jobus by a spring on oe side, avoed th hoped,&#xD;
p iment, and held on the instant a small slip of paper so close to the eyes of&#xD;
tesentinel, that, dreading some artful mode of despatching him by thatans,&#xD;
the man bobbed back his head so quick that ie nearly broke the side-ans&#xD;
the sentry-box by the crack he gave it.                      aelo&#xD;

"I hope you didn'thutyuhed          aiwsn&#xD;

The light of a neighboring lamp shone upon the paper, and the soldier, who&#xD;
possessed the accomplishment ofiebeing able to read it, saw that it was an order&#xD;
from one of his officers.r&#xD;
"Oh !" he said, "'Pass the bearer.&#xD;
Why the deuce didn't you say at first that youhad a pass?"&#xD;
"Oherear," iosaid Jobus, "I would have done so, but the fact is, I was so&#xD;
interested in your delightful conversation, that you see, I had no time. Ah,&#xD;

Jous, with his hands behind him so as to prop his back up as well as he&#xD;
could, walked into the courtyard of the palace.       Fh&#xD;
"Who goes there 7" cried a sharp voice, as though the words had been jerked&#xD;
out by some ingenious piece of machinery that condensed them into as small&#xD;
a  space  as  possible. " easaimab s&#xD;

"Certainly," said Jobus, "with great Leasure."&#xD;
"Guard !" said the voice again.&#xD;
"Anything you like," said Jobus; "but  t get in a passion."&#xD;
A sergeant hearing the call for the guard, hastily made his appearance from&#xD;
a doorway, through which Jobus could see the glare of a comfortable firemand&#xD;
making up to Jobus and the soldier on duty in the court he said-- rean&#xD;
" What is it ?"&#xD;
"Prisoner !" said the soldier.&#xD;
"Anything you like, gentlemen," said Jobus. "But perhaps as the id-&#xD;
vidual with the muff on his head, and the little shaving brush hanging to the&#xD;
side of' it, outside the gate there, has let me in, you might, as youare great&#xD;
worms, think I had some authority. He ! oh-I didt laugh! But read&#xD;
that."&#xD;
" Oh-ah !" said the sergeant, "a pass from Captain Lorrinet. He told me&#xD;
he expected somebody. Hem! My friend Lorrinet mentioned you."&#xD;

&#xD;
"Oh, yes, he just mentioned to me a friend of his would be here, and you&#xD;
arb that person, no doubt."&#xD;
"No doubt," said Jobus. "I'll mention to the captain, when I see him,&#xD;
your friendly way of speaking of him."&#xD;
"Eh? God bless me! don't do that, I beg of you. You see, sir, that-that&#xD;
in a way of speaking, the captain is rather a kind of-odd-tempered man, you&#xD;
see, and he might possibly not like it. I don't mean to say that he would&#xD;
not like it, but he might not, you see; so its better to say nothing about it."&#xD;
" Ah !" said Jobus, in his odd, dry way, "then from all that, I suppose, one&#xD;
may gather, that the friendship is all on one side."&#xD;
-- Wrhy, a-a-that is-this way, sir, if you please-this way, sir, to the&#xD;
captain's quarters, if you please."&#xD;
Jobus was conducted to rather a handsome and well-lighted room, in which&#xD;
there was a good fire,'and in which he found Captain Lorrinet resting upon a&#xD;
couple of chairs.&#xD;
A gentleman for you, sir," said the sergeant, "if you please."&#xD;
Yes," said Lorrinet, rising. " Jobus, you are welcome."&#xD;
Ah !" said Jobus, "it's the first time that a worm has been in a royal&#xD;
palace. And so this is St. James's, is it, young man'? A i! And pray, what&#xD;
does thgt represent on the roof of the room ?&#xD;
That," said Captain Lorrinet, "is some allegorical picture. The ceilings&#xD;
of the palace are almost all so painted ; but they have got so blackened by&#xD;
age and neglect that one can hardly see the subjects."&#xD;
' Ah-oh dear !" said Jobus. And then, when the sergeant had left the&#xD;
room, he laid his hand upon the arm of Lorrinet, and said-&#xD;
"Young man, there may be danger in the enterprise that we are going upon ;&#xD;
but, danger or not danger, we must manage to carry it out."&#xD;
Of course."&#xD;
"You will go armed ?"&#xD;
'Certainly I will. lam resolved that nothing shall prevent me from taking&#xD;
Louisa Morton from the house of Elk this night, but her own determination&#xD;
not to come with me. I have written to my aunt Lady Sylvester, asking her&#xD;
to receive Louisa for a day or two, and she has sent me word that she will do&#xD;
so with pleasure ; so that there will be no difficulty in the matter if Louisa&#xD;
Morton makes none."&#xD;
"And that she will not, when she hears that there is no tie or kindred that&#xD;
binds her to Elk."&#xD;
"Will she'believe us, Jobus ?"&#xD;
"I should say yes. There is always a something about the truth which&#xD;
makes it quite impossible to be doubted for a moment. Besides, her heart wilt&#xD;
plead in favor of all that you say to her, be it what it may."&#xD;
I hope so."&#xD;
Captain Lorrinet had been upon guard that night ; but he had exchanged&#xD;
with another officer, who might be glad of a similar accommodation another&#xD;
time ; so he now rapidly took off his uniform coat and put on a plain frock&#xD;
one, and a round, ordinary hat, and was ready to accompany Jobus on the&#xD;
expedition to the colonel's house.&#xD;
-"I have as important a task to do at Elk's house as you have," said Jobus.&#xD;
"No doubt you can guess it ?"&#xD;
"I think I can. But I can tell you some. news. Since I saw you in the&#xD;
morning I have seen the Mortons, and by the advice of-their solicitor they are&#xD;
going to give a meeting to Elk to-morrow at twelve o'clock, in Abel Morton's&#xD;
chambers in the Albany."&#xD;
Ah, at twelve."&#xD;
1em ! Oh, well, perhaps I may be there."&#xD;
--I will take you with me if you like. For the good feeling you have shown&#xD;
to Abel they will all be glad to see you."&#xD;
&#xD;
" We will talk of  atanother time. Let us now devote our wholeenergies&#xD;
to what we have to  to-night."&#xD;
No one could be very well more anxious than was Captain Lorrinetfto devote&#xD;
his whole energies to the work that was then in hand, and he left the palace&#xD;
along with Jobus, determined that nothing should stand in the way ofhs res.&#xD;
cuing her-whom he delighted to call Louisa Morton, nowinsteadof Dora;*fom&#xD;
her fearful situation in the-house of Colonel Elk.&#xD;
The reader will now recollect that Dora would, of her ownaccoird; ham Iong&#xD;
since left the spurious protection of, the Elks, if it-had-not :been that sueh a&#xD;
story was told her as, no doubt, lives in the recollection of those Who have&#xD;
attentively perused this. narrative concerning-the kind of connexion 'that had&#xD;
subsisted between her and the Morton family at one time.&#xD;
That artfully concocted tale had had the effect of horrifying Dora,-and of&#xD;
effectually, for the time being, causing her to hate the very name ofiMorton,&#xD;
and to associate it'withr anepoch in her life-which-she dreaded to thinkof.&#xD;
It was this prejudice that Captain Lorrinet would, ofcourse, haven&#xD;
over ; but the astounding -intelligence that she was the daughter of Sir ii&#xD;
Morton must surely go far to put an end to it at once.&#xD;
The night happened to be a very dark one, for although-the moou was neh&#xD;
at its4ull, a bank of heavy clouds had come up from the south, and hadge'du-&#xD;
ally spread all over the sky, so that nothing of the pale but heautifultrays of&#xD;
the moo-conld be-visible.&#xD;

prise in which he was associated with the young officer of the Guard&amp;amp;&#xD;

HEADS AND HEARTS ; ,OR&#xD;
&#xD;
Once during their progress to Elk's house, Captain Lorrinet made an effort'&#xD;
to extract from Jobus some information concerning himself; but Jobus stop-&#xD;
ped him at once by saying--&#xD;
"Not now-not now. When all is settled, as I hope it will be settled, as&#xD;
regards our friends the Mortons, then we may say something about a worm ;.&#xD;
but not now, young man-not now."&#xD;
For some time Captain Lnrrinet, in his impatience, walked rather too quickly&#xD;
for Jobus, although the latter tried all he could-to keep up with him; but&#xD;
finally, losing one of his shoes in the process, he was compelled to stop, say-&#xD;
ing-&#xD;
" Dear me, the worm has lost his shoe."&#xD;
"Lost what ?" said Lorrinet.&#xD;
"A shoe. It was always a trifle too large: Oh, here it is. The worm has&#xD;
got his shoe again,"&#xD;
At any other time Captain Lorrinet would have laughed aloud at the curious&#xD;
antics and phraseology of Jobus ; but now his heart and brain. were much too&#xD;
full of what he had set himself to do, to indulge in any such feeling towards&#xD;
the man who was assisting him might and main to do it.&#xD;
"I go too quickly for you, my friend," said Lorrinet, "do you go first, and I&#xD;
will adapt my pace to yours."&#xD;
"Very good," said Jobus.&#xD;
In that way, then, they approached Elk's house; but as the shoe became&#xD;
refractory again, Jobus carried it in his hand, despite the remonstrance of Cap-&#xD;
tain Lorrinet.&#xD;
In this way they reached the corner of the street in which Colonel Elk&#xD;
resided ; and then Jobus paused, and in a whispered voice, as though he feared&#xD;
that even there his dreaded foe might hear him, said--&#xD;
" There is an empty house next door. I have the confidence of the poor&#xD;
woman who is taking care of it. It has been in my power to perform some&#xD;
acts of charity to her., She had a child who was very ill only a fortnight since,&#xD;
and she told me that the doctor had ordered wine for it. Ah-oh dear, where&#xD;
was she to get wine ?"&#xD;
"Where indeed, Jobus?-&#xD;
"Well, the worm got it, though, out of the colonel's cellar."&#xD;
"It is not possible to commend you, Jobus, for taking even the superfluities&#xD;
of another ; but still the circumstance forms something- like an excuse if not&#xD;
a justification."&#xD;
"Just so; and the effect has been. that the woman is willing to oblige me&#xD;
to the utmost of her ability, and we shall get into the empty house. After&#xD;
that, I know well how to proceed.".-&#xD;
" Well, Jobus, I will be guided by you entirely in this matter, for I see that&#xD;
you have made all your arrangements to carry it out with success."&#xD;
"I have tried to do so," said Jobus ; "and here we are."&#xD;
The speed and dexterity with which Jobus suddenly opened the area gate&#xD;
of the residence next door to Colonel Elk, and dived down rather a precipitous&#xD;
flight of stone steps, surprised Lorrinet ; but he did not, for a moment, hesitate&#xD;
to follow him.&#xD;
"Have you shut the gate ?" said Jobus.&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"Come along, then. The first danger is over. We are here without being&#xD;
observed by any one, to the best of my belief."&#xD;
"Is that you, Mr. Jobus ?" said a voice.&#xD;
"Yes, maa, said Jobus.&#xD;
"In the airy ?" said the voice again.&#xD;
"Oh, I-Godness, gracious !"&#xD;
A woman made her appearance at the kitchen door with a light, which&#xD;
Johs,eas the shortest way of dispensing with, had at once blown out.&#xD;
"We don't want a light ma'am."&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.&#xD;
&#xD;
eOh.! to be sure, Mr. Jobus. Ah ! dear me, this is a mortial spear as we&#xD;
resides in. Mr. Jobus''                               aserasw&#xD;
"It is, ma'am."&#xD;
"As my poor husband as is dead and gone used to say--When you-&#xD;
k"Yes, ma'am, that is correct of the deceased," interrupted Jobu as he&#xD;
By this Ct t kitchen "Come along, Mr. Smith."&#xD;
Be ths Cadain Lorrinet found that he was to be Mr. Smith to the good&#xD;
dame who had charge of the empty house; and, as he was quite willing to be&#xD;
Mr. anything provided he could rescue Dora from Colonel Elk, he answered&#xD;
to the name at once, as though he had been.&#xD;
"In a manner born to it."&#xD;
."Now, ma'am, said Johns, "about the colonel ?"&#xD;
."hoe, n hou ago s, ad te clone. "sa in airy, on a cane-botton,&#xD;
ne very one you see here, Mr. J., for a matter of two hours and a quarter&#xD;
" That will do.Nw&#xD;

nothing and see nothing.,                                     dha&#xD;
"Oh, very good, sir."&#xD;
"Don't expect us at any particular time, and then you won't be impatient."&#xD;
Expect you here, sir 7"&#xD;
Yistenin, eand 'We shall come back as soon as we can. But don't be&#xD;
hapened jumpingg up every moment, and thinking that something has&#xD;

"Just so, sir. Living there in this kitchen&#xD;

"That's what I should have expected ma'am," said Jobus.&#xD;
Should you really, sir 7"&#xD;
"Yes, ma'm, with the noise above of a worm now and then."&#xD;
Jobs left the kitchen, closely followed by Captain Lorrinet, who despite&#xD;
all the iep anxieties that were pressing upon him, could not help being&#xD;
much amused at the the little odd bit of conversatio between Jobus and the&#xD;
lady of the empty house.&#xD;
"Now young man," said Jobus whenthe h        reached the top of the&#xD;
kitchen stairs, "we have got to reach the to of e house. I will get there&#xD;
as soon as I can; but if you are at all impatint, you can run up first and&#xD;
wat for me."'&#xD;
"Oh, no, I will go with you," said Lorrinet.&#xD;
"Very good."&#xD;
Their footsteps echoed strangely and startlingly in, that empty house as&#xD;
they ascended the creaking staircase, and awakened many an echo as they&#xD;
went,.                                            aya     coate&#xD;
CHAPTER XLVI.&#xD;
CAPTAIN LdnRINE, as yet, was but dimly acquainted with the pla&#xD;
Jous had elaborated in his politicbrain for the rescue of Dora from the&#xD;
clutches of Colonel Elk; but he was quite prepared to carry i out;,f let the&#xD;
danger and the difficulty attending it be what the mi ry it out, let&#xD;
"Jobs" he said, "It is better that you should tell me all, for then I shall&#xD;
be better able to aid you."&#xD;
"Stop !" said Johns.&#xD;
ItHappears that we must stop; for if I mistake not, here we are at the top&#xD;
"Yes, that is true-that is very true. Look up."&#xD;

&#xD;
HEADS AND HEARTS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
Jobus held the light near to the ceiling on the landing of the attic stairs ;&#xD;
and when Captain Lorrinet did look up, he saw one of those mysterious look-&#xD;
ing little square trapdoors, which are in that situation in the roofs of most&#xD;
houses, and which go by the name-given to them, no doubt by the facetious&#xD;
inventor-of fire-escapes.&#xD;
The idea of any persons not ordinarily accustomed to gymnastic exercises&#xD;
pushing or pulling themselves through such an orifice, even in broad daylight,&#xD;
and with nothing to distract them but the difficulty of the navigation of the&#xD;
little hole in the wall, looks desperate ; but for some substantial citizen and&#xD;
his family, awakened with the dread sound of "Fire !" in the dead and mid-&#xD;
dle of the night, and bewildered by the horrid gleam of flames-half choked&#xD;
by volumes of dense smoke, and driven nearly mad by the shrieks of his chil-&#xD;
dren, to wriggle through such a contrivance, is about as hopeless a proposition&#xD;
as was ever heard of.&#xD;
But no matter. There was the fire-escape-there was the nearly impracti-&#xD;
cable little square hole in the roof which was to be the refuge of an English&#xD;
family, in case they should be pushed to such an a#ful extremity.&#xD;
"You see it ?" said Jobus.&#xD;
"I do."&#xD;
"Well, that's the way out of this house. In the roof of the next one&#xD;
there is just such another opening, and that will be the way in.&#xD;
"I understand you, Jobus. We are to drop into the colonel's house by the&#xD;
aid of this kind of affair. Well, be it so. I have no doubt but that you&#xD;
have considered the matter well, Jobus, and that this is the most eligible&#xD;
mode of action ; but yet, for my own part, how I should have preferred break-&#xD;
ing down his street door-defying him, and taking the young lady away in&#xD;
spite of him !"&#xD;
""Ah! and then he would have been quite satisfied to take his revenge out&#xD;
of the family ; for he would have gone to the nearest police-station with the&#xD;
bill !"&#xD;
"He might."&#xD;
"I say he would. I know him. He has teeth, and he will bite when he&#xD;
can ; but I am going to draw them. and then he can but howl. Ha ! I-oh,&#xD;
dear ! I nearly laughed. But young man, you must get through that trap-&#xD;
door, though I don't know how you are to do it."&#xD;
Captain Lorrinet was tall and active. He looked at the trap-door for a&#xD;
moment or two, and saw that if he could only get the little cover to it unbolted,&#xD;
he might easily draw himself through it; but it was just a foot beyond his&#xD;
reach.&#xD;
" Jobus," he said, "if it were open I could make a spring at it and clutch&#xD;
by the sides, and where once I get a hold I am not likely to let go again; but&#xD;
I must reach it to unbolt it, and so must have something to stand upon."&#xD;
"To be sure," said Jobus. "I thought of that."&#xD;
"Yes, but there is nothing here."&#xD;
"Oh, yes, there is-I brought something. Here you are."&#xD;
Jobus dropped upon his hands and knees, and there he was, ready for the&#xD;
young captain to stand upon his back, and so reach the bolt of the trap-door.&#xD;
"I'm afraid my weight will hurt you, Jobus."&#xD;
"So am I, but it don't matter. I beg that you will be quick about it, for&#xD;
the colonel may come home, and then there will be more difficulty still, and&#xD;
Dora--"&#xD;
Johns had no occasion to say more. At the mere mention of the name of&#xD;
Dora, Captain Lorrinet felt that anything was better than not to succeed in&#xD;
rescuing her, so he stood as gently and as lightly as he could upon Jobus's&#xD;
back, and in a moment had got the couple of bolts withdrawn that held the&#xD;
little trap-door in its place.&#xD;
By a push, then, he sent the trap-door aside from the opening in the roof,&#xD;
and by a muscular effort, that to him was as easy as it seemed to bj he drew&#xD;
himself up through the opening.&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHER, THE COLQEL.                     '73&#xD;
"Oh," said Jobus, as he looked up. "It's all right?"&#xD;
cc Yes," said Lorrinet. "Here I am."&#xD;
"But how is a worm to get up?"&#xD;
"Make a spring at it," said Lorrinet, "and when you get hold of the edge,&#xD;
draw yourself bodily up."&#xD;
"You don't say so ? It's rather a long time since I made a spring, young.&#xD;
man; aid as for drawing myself bodily up, it is one of those things that I&#xD;
dn't think is at all likely to come to pass."&#xD;
"Stop a bit; then," said Lorrinet. "Hand me the light up here,"&#xD;
"It's of no use ; it will be blown out when we get to the top of the house.&#xD;
I will put it out now. Puff!"&#xD;
" We shall want a light, though, in the next house."&#xD;
"Oh, yes, I have provided against that. I have put the candle in one pocket&#xD;
and the candlestick in the other, and in my hat I have a box of matches; so&#xD;
the worn, is quite well provided, you see."&#xD;
" Stretch up your arms," said Lorrinet, "and let me get hold Qf you, I&#xD;
will soon draw you up. Now for it, Jnbus. All's right. Here you are, old&#xD;
friend. How do you feel now?"&#xD;
"All the skin off my knees," said Johns.&#xD;
Lorrinet had stooped down, and by sheer strength lifted Jobus up through&#xD;
the trap-door by the arms; but Jobus had made such a scuffling against the&#xD;
edge of the opening in the roof when he was high enough to do so, that the&#xD;
result he had mentioned had ensued.&#xD;
"Never mind ; that is the fortune of war." said the captain.&#xD;
"Oh, is it? Very good."&#xD;
They were now between the ceiling and the roof of the house. Immedi-&#xD;
ately opposite to the fire-escape was a door among the tiles, which opened intp&#xD;
the night air. Lorrinet soon found that it was not fastened at all, andawing.-&#xD;
ing it open, he stepped out into a kind of gutter that run between two ridges&#xD;
of roof.&#xD;
We need not now pursue minutely the passage of Jobus and the young off-&#xD;
eer over the roof of one house and on that of the other; suffice it to my, that&#xD;
after some dangers, and poor Jobus being twice or thrice indebted to the&#xD;
strength and presence of mind of Captain Lorrinet for his life, they got through&#xD;
the trap-doors in the roof of Colonel Elk's house, and dropped on the landing.&#xD;
Jobus had-taken care that there should be no fastenings to those trap-doors&#xD;
to delay their proceedings.&#xD;
The most profound darkness was in the colonel's house ; and now than&#xD;
Johns was there, a fit of trembling came over him, and he thought that the&#xD;
expedition he had come upon was surely one of the most fearful and hazard.&#xD;
ons that it was possible for the mind of man to conceive.&#xD;
It was probably the danger and excitement that he had gone through in his&#xD;
perilous passage across the roofs of the two houses that had affected Johus's&#xD;
nerves, and produced this kind of emotion.&#xD;
Captain Lorrinet, on the contrary, by what he had already had to do was&#xD;
only all the better nerved to further exertion in the matter, and he whispered&#xD;
to Jobus--&#xD;
"Now, my friend, the light."&#xD;
"Ye-e--es," said Johns.&#xD;
4 what's the matter ?"&#xD;
"Oh, nothing-I.-I, you see, don't feel very well, that's all. Worms havy&#xD;
not very strong constitutions, that's all. Oh, dear!"&#xD;
My dear friend, do not give way, now, I beg of you. If you have any fears,&#xD;
place a firm reliance upon me. I am well armed, and not one who is likel&#xD;
to allow either you or myself to come to any hurt that can be avoided. Much&#xD;
yet depends upon you, and I beg that you will rouse yourself for immediate&#xD;
. action."&#xD;
"I will-I will.. I am better,"&#xD;

HEADS AND HEARTS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
"We are on the top landing here, of course. I can dimly see several doors.&#xD;
Here is one."&#xD;
"No-no ! -Oh, God-no !"&#xD;
"What is it ?"&#xD;
"Don't open any door. There is a sight in one of those rooms that--that&#xD;
-Oh, don't look into one of them! It will be too terrible-much too tern-&#xD;
ble."&#xD;
"Mr. Jobus, in the relation you gave me of affairs here, you candidly&#xD;
admitted that you kept back some information, which you said must come out&#xD;
in time. What is it 7",&#xD;
"Oh, nothing-nothing ! Murder -"&#xD;
"Murder, did you say ?"&#xD;
"No, I didn't. It is too soon. Let me save Abel first-let me save Dora&#xD;
-let me deprive Colonel Elk of the power of avenging himself, beforewe&#xD;
think of carrying'him to circumstances which would let him see that revenge&#xD;
and death were all that fate had left to him."&#xD;
"You are right, Jobus-I won't ask you any more. You can   teed in&#xD;
your own way. I feel that you are right. We are in the dark, t ; I&#xD;
suppose there is no objection to our having a light?"&#xD;
"Oh, no-no. I-that is, the worm will soon light the candle athin hi&#xD;
that is, captain, go a little way down the stairs and listen;&#xD;
is any one stirring in the house."&#xD;
"You may depend there is not," said Lorrinet.  "My-earis are till tt&#xD;
acute, and if there were, I should be sure to hear them. All  quitetill&#xD;
the place."                                        L     e    ndae&#xD;
Jobus was reassured by this statement on the part of Lorrinet; and a e&#xD;
considerable difficulty, for he had smashed the candle quite fiat, he succeeded&#xD;
in setting it up in the stick, in a very dilapidated condition, indeed; and then&#xD;
placing it upon the floor, he got his matches, and soon set it alight.&#xD;
" Here we are," said Jobus. "Here we are. It will soon burn up. Oh,&#xD;
gracious ! where are you ?"to&#xD;
Captain Lorrinet had gone a few steps down the attic stairs to listen, while&#xD;
Jobus was lighting the candle, so that Johns for the moment missed him.&#xD;
"I am here," said Lorrinet. "You may be quite at ease, for the house is,&#xD;
I assure you, as still as the grave."&#xD;
Jobus held the light up about the height of his head, and suddenly le&#xD;
began shaking so, that Captain Lorrinet was quite alarmed to see him, and&#xD;
thought some fearful form of indisposition had come over him. Jons made&#xD;
several efforts to speak, but could not. He pointed to the floor, and his hag-&#xD;
gard lips parted, and his eyes seemed starting from their sockets; and at last&#xD;
he managed to say-.&#xD;
" There ! there ! Oh, look!I"&#xD;
Captain Lorrinet did look, and he saw a broad stream of dark colored&#xD;
liquid upon the landing. It had crept out of one of the attics, under the ill-&#xD;
fitting door, and had made its way right along the landing, and was dropping&#xD;
in coagulated masses down the stairs.&#xD;
"It is blood !" said Lorrinet.                            The blood&#xD;
"Blood !" shrieked Jobus, as he dropped the light  "Blood!  T blo&#xD;
of the murdered man ! Yes, it is blood ; and so murder, you see, will out ."&#xD;
"Hush !" cried Lorrinet. "Hush! for Heaven's sake ! You will ruin all&#xD;
by these exclamations. Hush ! I implore you !"&#xD;
&#xD;
BROTHER, THE~'OLONEL.                    17b&#xD;
CHAPTER XLVII.&#xD;
Tu terrible sight that had come upon the senses of Captain Lorrinet and&#xD;
Jobus, upon the attic landing of'Colonel Elk's house, had the effect for a few&#xD;
moments of completely petrifying them, as it were, and preventing them. from&#xD;
either moving or speaking, after the utterance of the first natural exclamations&#xD;
of surprise and alarm.&#xD;
Jobus had an idea of what had occasioned the appearance; but the young&#xD;
officer could not possibly know anything of the special cause-of such a sicken-&#xD;
ing effect. It was Captain Lorrinet, though, who first broke the freezing&#xD;
silence that had ensued.&#xD;
"Why, Jobus," he said. " Jobus !-what---what-----&#xD;
"Oh, dear !" said Jobus.&#xD;
"What is the meaning of this, my friend? It is blood !"&#xD;
" I-I-think it is."&#xD;
"I know it is. What fearful deed has been done here that could give rise&#xD;
to such a spectacle? Jobus, I say, there are secrets in this house that neither&#xD;
you nor I ought to deal with. Tb proper authorities alone are the people to&#xD;
come to this man, and.--."&#xD;
"Dora," said Johns in a whisper'close to the-ear of Captain Lorrinet.&#xD;
The young officer started.&#xD;
"Dora," said Jobus, and he took up the light and held it in his trembling&#xD;
hands. "One thing at a time if you please, captain. It may be true-oh dear&#xD;
yes, although perhaps it is a great presumption upon the part of a worm to say&#xD;
so much, that there are things in this house only to be dealt with by thepro-&#xD;
per authorities; ebut just now we have something else to do."&#xD;
p " But, my good friend, admitting-all that, and my feeling the magic of the&#xD;
appeal you make to me in the nameof Dora-a most dear and sacred name to&#xD;
me-yet some one may be in such danger and such trouble here, that- "&#xD;
" Stop," said Jobus. "I beg to state that no one is in trouble here in con-&#xD;
nexion with that ensanguined stream that has so affected you, and which you&#xD;
recoil from with a loathing horror.' But I may say that somebody's troubles&#xD;
are over."&#xD;
"Over ?"&#xD;
"To be sure. Who do you think could bestow so much of life's current&#xD;
upon these old attic stairs and live ?"&#xD;
"That is true."&#xD;
"Of course it is ; and so the time, you see, runs on, and she whom you came&#xD;
to rescue suffers in each passing moment an hour of misery and doubt. Young&#xD;
man, come with me. There are secrets in this house-secrets that I will pro-&#xD;
claim trumpet-tongued ; but it is not yet time-not yet time !"&#xD;
It is always time to proclaim the truth, and to confound villany and&#xD;
murder !"&#xD;
"No. The innocent must first'be rescued from the insatiate rage of the&#xD;
defeated villain. Let him feel that there is no innocent heart upon which he&#xD;
can, in the first moments of his wild passion at the failure of his great wicked-&#xD;
ness, work his brutal vengeance."&#xD;
"I understand you, Jobus ; you are my better angel."&#xD;
"Oh dear, no. An earth worm-a here earth worm, that happens to be&#xD;
gifted with the power of speech. Follow me-follow me."&#xD;
"I will, Jobus."&#xD;
No one could doubt the courage of Captain Lorrinet; but that thick and&#xD;
slimy stream of blood, that like some hideous snake was winding its way down&#xD;
the attic stairs, made him shudder again, and had for-a time robbed his cheek&#xD;
of its color. He followed Jobus to the foot of the attic stairs without a word;&#xD;
and then Jobus turned and looked at him, and said with a sigh-&#xD;
"You tremble yet."&#xD;
g I do, Jobus. It is-that !"&#xD;

The young officer pointed to the stairs.&#xD;
To be sure it is," said Johus.  I know what it is well enough; but it'&#xD;
will not be wise to say anything to Dora of it."&#xD;
'.Ohs no-no !"&#xD;
fIt is not well to drag such a'delicate rose bud through a slaughter house&#xD;
of horrors.".&#xD;
" Peace-peace ! Tell me, man, where I may find her-tell me only where&#xD;
she is. and I will essay what eloquence I am master of to get her from this&#xD;
place."~&#xD;
Johns pointed to a door, and placed .the light in the captain's hands.&#xD;
"Behold," he said, "that is the door of the young maid's chamber. Remem-&#xD;
ber that she is Abel Morton's sister."&#xD;
"Where are you going, Jobus ?"&#xD;
"About afihirs of my on. You will meet me on the staircase ; but should&#xD;

that he will-but should he do so, I shall rely upon you, for I feel that a worm&#xD;
will not be able to cope with such as he isa"&#xD;
'-Come here in an instant if you have any idea that lk is in the house,"&#xD;
said Lorrinet, "and I will protect you."&#xD;
"Good. ' Now, young man, I think that w'hen you tell Dora that she is&#xD;
who she is, there will be no hesitation upon her part in leaving this house.&#xD;
Try it."&#xD;
"I wJobus disappeared down the stairs in the darkness in a moment, leaving&#xD;
the young officer in what he, each moment, felt to be one of the most awk-&#xD;
ward of situations.&#xD;
How should he begin his address to Dora?' How, in the first instance,&#xD;
should he win her confidence sufficiently to induce her to believe that his&#xD;
appearance in that house, at such an hour, was for a good and innocent pur-&#xD;
pose?&#xD;
Captain Lorrinet did not quite know what an advocate he would have in the&#xD;
breast of the young girl herself, and how readily one so pure and innocent as&#xD;
she, would give credence to the loved object. ie did not know, although it&#xD;
was a dear and blessed hope to him, at tunes, t~o think that such might be the&#xD;
case, that to Dora he was the one blessed object that she clothed in all the&#xD;
glowing colors of a youthful f icy, and believed to he something, in purity, and&#xD;
in goodness more than all oth  She loved him!'h he had be   told was&#xD;

A clock struck !&#xD;
It was in the hall of the house that the ock was placed ; but the clear bell-&#xD;
like tone amid the silence of the night, en eup the staircase to the startled&#xD;
ears of Captain Lorrinet.&#xD;
It was as if some voice had whispered to  -    -  ,&#xD;
"Lorrinet, time flies, and you linger here doi g nothian.t edgentlyop&#xD;
With a start he stepped forward close to the  or,and ppegey&#xD;
the panel.&#xD;
A faint cry from within replied to the summons.&#xD;
Lorrinet tapped again, and then ho heard a move nt i the room, nd&#xD;
placing his lips close to thekeyhole l:e said- n&#xD;
"Dora ! Dora! fear nothing.  ,t is a friend-one who  mild be to you&#xD;
the dearest of all friends-who speaks to you."mudden&#xD;
"   He thought that there was some faint reply made to him; . but a sude&#xD;
crashing noise in the floor below drowned at that moment all other sounds.&#xD;
" Dora! Speak again! Oh, speak again! It is --Lorrinet. Oh, doy&#xD;
not know my voice ?"&#xD;
"It's only the worm," said a hollow voice from the landing below. "Don't&#xD;
be alarmed."&#xD;

&#xD;
captain Lorrinet was aware that Jobus was apprehensive he had construed&#xD;
the sound that had echoed through the house into an alarm, and so had come-&#xD;
to assure him that all was tight. He ought to have been grateful to poor&#xD;
Jobus ; but at that moment he was not, for he thought that the sound of&#xD;
Jobs' voice again drowned some-few words that were spoken from within&#xD;
the room by Dora.atwr                             pknfowiiv&#xD;
"1 hear you," said Lorrinet.. "All's right."&#xD;
-Oh !" said Jobus, and then all was still below,&#xD;
' Dora-Dora !" said Lorrinet, "I come to rescue you from danger-from&#xD;
erha s dea th itself, or from perhaps worse than death. Do you hear me,&#xD;
The door was suddenly opened, and pale and agitated, Dora appeared fully&#xD;
dressed upon the threshold of it.&#xD;
"I do know your voice," she said, "and I have but to implore of you if you&#xD;
bme Ise, to kill me, for it is only in death that I can know peace. Oh, kill&#xD;
"Kill you?"&#xD;
"Yes ; you have told me that you love me, and yet I find you here the guest&#xD;
of a man who loves no one who loves not virtue, but who takes to his bosom&#xD;
hate and crime as dear companions. Oh, why are you here?  Why, of all&#xD;
men are youi here ?"&#xD;
"To rescue you. Dora. You cannot suppose for one moment that I could&#xD;
have another object in coming to this house?  Oh, do not wrong me so far as&#xD;
to fancy that 1 am the guest of Colonel Elk. No, Dora, I am here in his&#xD;
absence-.-I have made my way here to rescue you from him and from there&#xD;
vile machinations of his odious plans. Dora, I ask you to trust me and to fly&#xD;
with me,"&#xD;
" ,Heaven ! I dare not 1'"&#xD;
es  Let    explain all. I will take you at once to the home of my aunt,&#xD;
who is a lady of respectable reputation, and who will for my sake now, and&#xD;
for your own when she comes to look upon you and to know you, afford you&#xD;
an asylum Oh, do not hesitate ! Moments are precious-I know not what&#xD;
obstruction in the way of your escape, Colonel Elk, were he to return, might&#xD;
-not place against me."&#xD;
"Oh, God, direct me now !'"&#xD;
"Come, dear one, come with me. Trust to the heart that beats only for&#xD;
you. It seems providential that in the dead hour of the night, I should have&#xD;
found you up."&#xD;
"I have not dared to retire to rest in this house since-since  "&#xD;
She burst into tears at the recollection of the brutal insult from Lord Car.&#xD;
lin to which she had been subjected.&#xD;
"You shall tell me all that at another and a more fitting time," said Cap-&#xD;
tain Lorrinet. "I believe, now, that Jobus waits for us."&#xD;
"The worm does !" said a voice from the landing below. "He-he! Oh,&#xD;
did a worm really laugh ? Come-come !"&#xD;
"Oh, Dora, do not say aught to danger this plan of escape. Feeling now&#xD;
that you have nothing in the shape of relationship to tie you to this must&#xD;
boldly criminal man-"&#xD;
"Re is my uncle."&#xD;
" No?  How say you that ?"&#xD;
Captain Lorrinet pressed his hand upon his head, as he said-&#xD;
Oh, how foolish of me. In my confusion I have omitted to tell yQu Dorm,&#xD;
who and what you really are."'&#xD;
"Who and what I really am? Explain the mystery."&#xD;
Let the worm!" said Jobus from below, and then advancing about half a&#xD;
dozen steps up to the second floor, he said-" Dora is not Dora, Louisa Mor-&#xD;
ton is her name. She is the daughter of Sir John Mortoni a worthy worm&#xD;

-I mean gentleman. Oh, dear me ! The colonel, with the aid of two mst&#xD;
abandoned characters, stole her when a child from the arms of her fond, doting&#xD;
father. She has no tie to Colonel Elk."&#xD;
Dora uttered a cry of joy, and advanced two steps towards Lorrinet; but&#xD;
when she found that he caught her in his arms, she shrunk back from him&#xD;
again, and tremblingly clung to the balustrade of the staircase, as she said in&#xD;
a faint voice-&#xD;
"I am told a different story. Oh, where is the proof-the proof?"&#xD;
'The confession," said Jobus, "of one of the abandoned characters."&#xD;
"Ah ! who is he!"&#xD;
"Here he is, Miss Dora-I mean Louisa. I am that man. You can give me&#xD;
to a policeman as soon as you like."&#xD;
' Oh, listen to me, I implore you." said Lorrinet. "I have inquired into&#xD;
all the particulars of the story, and I find this true. You are the daughter of&#xD;
Sir John Morton, who for so many years as he has lost you, has but lingered&#xD;
out a nearly broken-hearted existence. Believe it---oh, believe it, for if there&#xD;
be truth in Heaven it is true !"&#xD;
"The air and tone of sincerity in which Captain Lorrinet spoke, was not&#xD;
to be questioned. It was quite out of question, too, that, feeling with regard&#xD;
to him as she, Dora, felt, she could longer doubt him. She turned to-&#xD;
wards him with so soft and sweet a smile, that it was to him enchantment&#xD;
to look at her ; and while the silent tears still coursed each other down her&#xD;
cheeks, she said-&#xD;
"I do believe all that you have told me-indeed, I do, and am very, very&#xD;
happy.&#xD;
She did not now resist the young officer as he folded her in his arms, and&#xD;
gently kissed her cheek, and whispered to her-&#xD;
-"By this kiss I ask you to be mine, dear Dora.&#xD;
"Yours, and yours only !"&#xD;
"Oh, joy ."&#xD;
' Hem !" said Jobus.1&#xD;
Lorrinet started.&#xD;
"Oh, we waste precious moments, dear Loo-for that shall be the name,&#xD;
now, by which I will call you. It is time that we should fly from the house&#xD;
at once."&#xD;
"But what power can such a man as Elk now have over me or you. Why&#xD;
should we fear him ?"&#xD;
' Thus spoke the courageous spirit of innocence," said Captain Lorrinet.&#xD;
"But Abel Morton is your brother, and my dearest friend, and it is necessary&#xD;
that, as yet, truth and innocence should do things secretly, even as falshood&#xD;
and guilt would do them, to save him."&#xD;
" Ah, I-understand. I will go."     ,&#xD;
"At once-at once, dear one-at once. Lean upon my arm. Ah ! now you&#xD;
tremble. Do not so ! You are safe-oh, so safe with me. Think you that&#xD;
it is possible that all the world could injure you while you are by my side?&#xD;
Ah, no ! My own, my beautiful, I feel a giant's strength with you to defend.&#xD;
Come--come, my Loo, do not tremble."&#xD;
"Quick !-oh, quick !" said Jobus. Follow me."&#xD;
Trembling, despite all the assurances of safety that her lover could breathe&#xD;
into her ear, and despite the conviction at her own heart that they were all&#xD;
true, poor Loo-for we now feel that that is the name we ought to give&#xD;
her-was led by Lorrinet to the landing-place of the floor below.&#xD;
Jobus was there.&#xD;
-"Well, Miss Loo," he said, "this is an escape. I have a long story to tell&#xD;
you, but there will be a better time to-Ah ".&#xD;
The cry that Johus uttered was such as might have come from him if&#xD;
some one had suddenly planted a dagger in his heart.&#xD;
'What is it ?" eagerly inquired Lorrinet.&#xD;
"Oh. God! what has happened ?" said Loo.&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.&#xD;
&#xD;
179&#xD;
&#xD;
H ish! hush ! hish !" said Jobus, as he crept up the staircase backwards&#xD;
again, and his very hair seemed to bristle upon his head with fright. "lHe,&#xD;
he is coming. I thought that it would have been better to end all to-mor-&#xD;
row, but fate says no, no. It must be now-now."       *&#xD;
"What mean you ?"&#xD;
"Silence !".&#xD;
They did listen, and they heard the rattle of a key in the lock of the street&#xD;
door, and then they knew what Jobus meant.&#xD;
Colonel Elk had come home !&#xD;
"Loo," said Captain Lorrinet, quite calmly, "leave all to me. Go into the&#xD;
room, dear one. I will be with you in a moment--Jobus ?"&#xD;
"Y-e-es ?"&#xD;
"We must confront Colonel Elk."&#xD;
" Oh---oh ! He don't think I am here. He thinks I am up stairs, and that&#xD;
it is my blood-Stop;--an idea ! Hush ! Go into that room both of you.&#xD;
Go at once, I say-oh, go. Now-now--take the light with you-no, blow&#xD;
it out-that will do.'&#xD;
Bang went the street door shut, and a footstep was heard in the passage.&#xD;
" He comes," added Jobus in a whisper. "He has only paused to light a&#xD;
match. Ah,'he has a night-light with him. Hish ! hish ! He-he comes."&#xD;
Captain Lorrinet clasped Loo round the waist, and carried her into the draw-&#xD;
ing room, but he placed her in the first chair he came to'that was out of the&#xD;
way of the door, and then with a pistol in his hand he stood half on the land-&#xD;
ing, with the object of supporting Jobus in what he was about to do, and of&#xD;
protecting him from Elk if he should fail.&#xD;
The young officer had gathered from the disjointed expressions of Jobus,&#xD;
pretty well what was his meaning in wishing to face Colonel Elk upon that&#xD;
occasion alone.&#xD;
CHAPTER       XLVIII.&#xD;
Tnrs return of Elk to his house at such an hour was a very uncommon&#xD;
thing; but the fact was, that his mind was in a state of great distraction, and&#xD;
the thought of what the morrow might produce, although all seemed to be&#xD;
going well with his plans, much disturbed him.&#xD;
The possibility of something very much amiss taking place had come over&#xD;
him so strongly, that he had thought it 'advisable to repair to his house, and&#xD;
there make such disposition as to enable him to meet every inquiry.' He was&#xD;
anxious and terrified, he knew not why.&#xD;
There was one thin too, that he felt ought to be done in case of accident,&#xD;
and that was, to get r of the dead body of Johns, which he supposed to be&#xD;
lying in its gore in the attic where the guilty Lord Carlin had paid the penalty&#xD;
of his social offences.&#xD;
It had been the intention of Elk to get a large sum from the Mortons and&#xD;
then leave England at once, taking Loo with him;- but if anything should hap-&#xD;
pen to cause him to remain in England, it was but a matter of ordinary security&#xD;
to him that he should put his house in order.&#xD;
Such reasons and such anxieties had brought Colonel Elk home upon that&#xD;
eventful night, so -contrary to his habit ; for when he left as he had done that&#xD;
-evening, it was seldom that he crossed his own threshold again till the dawn&#xD;
of morning.&#xD;
One may imagine now, the state of agitation and alarm that poor Dora was&#xD;
'n as she felt that in some shape or way there must now ensue a collision'&#xD;
between her friends and that man whom she had so much reason to hold in&#xD;
detestation.&#xD;
The colonel slowly ascended the stairs,&#xD;
Jobus stood upon the very verge of the topmost stair, with his arms out-&#xD;
stretched before him, and his face pale from excitement and terror, lest that&#xD;

HEADS AND HEARTS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
which he was striving to do might not have all the effect upon Elk that he&#xD;
wished ; so that he presented an appearance such as the most consummate actor&#xD;
could not have put on, with all the wish to do so.&#xD;
The night-light that Colonel Elk carried was one that was by his orders&#xD;
always placed upon a marble slab in the hall, so that he could have no diffi-&#xD;
culty, let him come in when he would, in lighting it by the aid of the box of&#xD;
matches by its side. As yet the little lamp had not had time fully to send&#xD;
forth its utmost power of' illumination ; moreover, the draught of cold air upon&#xD;
the staircase diminished the flame somewhat, and it was only in a dreamy sort&#xD;
of twilight that the colonel slowly ascended, with his mind full of dark resolves&#xD;
and bantering fears.&#xD;
Jobus did not move nor speak, but still as death itself, he preserved that&#xD;
fixed attitude at the head of the stairs.&#xD;
On. on, came the colonel!  -&#xD;
"Oh, Lorrinet," whispered Dora, "what will happen ?"&#xD;
"Nothing to harm thee, darling."&#xD;
" But-but---'"&#xD;
"Hush, I implore you. All is well."&#xD;
Dora covered her fair face with her hands, and waited in agonised expecta-&#xD;
tion of some dreadful scene.,&#xD;
Every nerve in the body of young Lorrinet was, in a manner of speaking,&#xD;
screwed up to its utmost state of tension, and he was prepared at a moment's&#xD;
notice, to rush out upon Colonel Elk to the rescue of Jobus.&#xD;
On came the colonel !&#xD;
There was a something in the air, or some slight wavy alteration in the&#xD;
light, contingent upon the presence of Johns; but the colonel, who all the&#xD;
way up to within two steps of where Jobus stood had kept his eyes fixed&#xD;
upon the floor, suddenly raised them, and encountered the fixed and terrified&#xD;
gaze of the man whom he had so much reason to suppose a corpse in the attic&#xD;
above, and whose dead body was then, in its cumbrous troublesomeness to&#xD;
get rid of, occupying his thoughts._&#xD;
The look of the colonel for the space of time during which you might have&#xD;
counted slowly five or six, was truly dreadful ; and not more strange and&#xD;
terrifying was the gaze of Johns, for fear-fear of that man who had for&#xD;
years held his very soul in thraldom--had taken possession of the poor shrink-&#xD;
ing spirit.&#xD;
Elk was not superstitious ; but such a sight as that, and at such an hour,&#xD;
too, when he was not looking for anything so terrible to startle his imagina-'&#xD;
tion from real, tangible troubles, appalled him.&#xD;
The colonel uttered a shriek, and fell backwards with the light, and rolled&#xD;
to the foot of the stairs, where he lay upon his face perfectly insensible, partly&#xD;
from the mental shock he had sustained, and partly from the effects of that&#xD;
fearful fall.&#xD;
Jobus still preserved the same attitude which he had assumed almost&#xD;
unconsciously, and which had so much aided him in - terrifying the colonel.&#xD;
When Dora heard the shriek, she echoed it, and dropped upon her knees,&#xD;
clasping her hands in prayer; but Lorrinet sprang to the landing, crying-&#xD;
"Jobus !-Jobus ! How is it with you?  Speak Jobs !"&#xD;
Jobs was silent.       t&#xD;
"A light-a light ! Oh, what would I not give for a light !" .&#xD;
Jobus uttered a groan.&#xD;
There came a faint illumination from the hall, and young Lorrinet ran&#xD;
down the staircase, and, without meaning to do so, trod upon the colonel's&#xD;
back. By some accident the little lamp that. Elk had carried, although the&#xD;
glass of it was shivered to atoms, and although it lay upon its side, had not&#xD;
gone out.-&#xD;
Lorrinet seized it in a moment,- and ascended the stairs again, calling out-&#xD;
"Loo-Loo, my darling, all is well ! There is no danger. Why-why,&#xD;
Tobus-J obus, I say !"    -&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.&#xD;
&#xD;
181&#xD;
&#xD;
There was Jobus on the top stair, with his arms still stretched out, as they&#xD;
had been when the colonel ascended.&#xD;
" Jobus !" again cried Lorrinet, "do you not know me, or are you too much&#xD;
terrified to move? My good friend, speak to me. Loo !-Loo, dear ! Come&#xD;
here !"&#xD;
"Yes, Arthur."&#xD;
That was the first time she had called him by his christian name of Arthur.&#xD;
How the sound from her lips thrilled through the heart of the young lover !&#xD;
"I am here, Arthur."&#xD;
"Look at Jobus ! Oh, speak to him. He is transfixed with terror ! Look&#xD;
at him, Loo, dear !"&#xD;
 Loo approached Jobus, and touched him upon the breast, as she spoke to&#xD;
him-&#xD;
" Jobus, my dear friend!"&#xD;
With a deep sigh, Jobus dropped his arms, and then there came a gush of&#xD;
tears from his eyes, and tottering back, he sank upon a seat that was there.&#xD;
upon the landing of the stairs.&#xD;
"Why, what is this ?" said Loo, as she placed her hand upon his arm, and&#xD;
looked in his face. "What is it that has so much affected you? We'are&#xD;
safe now. You have saved me, and we are safe. Cheer up, old friend, to&#xD;
whom I owe so much."&#xD;
"Oh, Heaven'!" said Jobus-" oh, Heaven ! lie is coming !-he is com-&#xD;
ing1"&#xD;
"No," said Lorrinet, "you have terrified him, and he lies at the foot of the&#xD;
staircase in a trance. Let us leave this house now at once. It is an ill-&#xD;
omened one for all of us. Come, Jobus-come."&#xD;
"Yes-yes, I-oh, dear-I will come. But if there is any dark place that&#xD;
a worm might- creep into-oh, dear !-I had better go. Hish !-hush! I&#xD;
thought I heard him again !    r       ng&#xD;
"No-no; that is but your disordered fancy, Jobus. Come along with&#xD;
me ; I will find you an asylum, be assured ; and all will yet be well.. Our&#xD;
object is achieved, and Loo is saved."&#xD;
"Our object ?" said Jobus.  "One of our objects-one! We had two&#xD;
objects. Oh, yes !-God, no i-yes-yes!    He !-he!   It is-it is-he!&#xD;
No, the worm did not laugh. But our object is achieved-he !"&#xD;
Jobus had thrust his hand into a breast-pocket of his apparel; and then&#xD;
he clutched something that seemed at once to convince him that all was well,&#xD;
for his countenance brightened, and he looked much as he had looked of late&#xD;
when most hopeful.&#xD;
"You are ready, then, Jobus ?"&#xD;
"Oh-he !-yes, I am."&#xD;
"Come, then, after me at once."&#xD;
Lorrinet took the arm of the gentle and confiding girl, and placed it within&#xD;
his own, and descended the staircase with her. Jobusfollowed, saying, "lie&#xD;
-he !" at intervals, and then answering nobody, for Lorrinet paid no atten-&#xD;
tion to him, as he was looking into the sweet eyes of his Loo, thatphe had-not&#xD;
laughed.&#xD;
In this way they reached the hall, and the young captain and Loo stepped&#xD;
over the prostrate form of the colonel ; but when Johns came to it, owing to.&#xD;
being in the shadow, he did not see it, but trod right upon his old:master's&#xD;
back, and feeling a sudden alarm at what it could possibly be that was under&#xD;
his feet, he stumbled, and rolled over him in the hall in a very ludicrous man-&#xD;
ner.&#xD;
"Murder !" said Jobus, "oh, murder ! I knew we should never get out&#xD;
of the house so quietly as this. Oh, dear !"&#xD;
"Why, Jobus, I could never have believed that you were so timid."&#xD;
"Timid? Oh-oh, worms are naturally. Oh, dear, what's that?  What's&#xD;
that lying on the mat at the foot of the stairs."&#xD;

"Why, that," repeated Lorrinet, "is your late master, and the devil's ser-&#xD;
vant. I think."&#xD;
"Eh?   The colonel ?"&#xD;
"The same."&#xD;
"Oh, gracious! lie's only pretending to be dead. You can't kill him. Oh&#xD;
-oh--oh !"&#xD;
Johns made a wild rush along the passage and opened the street door in a&#xD;
moment, and ran out into the street before Lorrinet could interfere to stop&#xD;
him. To be sure, the young captain was not veryslow in following the exam-.&#xD;
ple of Jobus, and he was right glad when the fresh breath of the early morn-&#xD;
ing air fanned the cheek of his darling Loo. They closed the outer door of&#xD;
Colonel Elk's house, and then they stood looking up and down the street for&#xD;
Jobus, but no Jobus could they see.&#xD;
"He is gone," said Loo, gently.&#xD;
"Yes, dear one."&#xD;
"And left me to--to-"&#xD;
"To me. But then you trust me ?&#xD;
" Ah, yes, I do !"&#xD;
"With all your heart ?"&#xD;
"' With all my heart, Arthur. With all my heart, I-"&#xD;
She sobbed and clung to him. There was more eloquence in the action&#xD;
than there could have been in any words. He felt that that young, and beau-&#xD;
tiful, and innocent creature relied upon him for her happiness in this world ;&#xD;
and at that moment, with the canopy of Heaven over him, and the soft morn-&#xD;
ing light just peeping through the shadows of the night, he vowed that no ill&#xD;
should approach her that was possible for him to ward off from her heart.&#xD;
"Dear-dear, Loo," he said, and his voice shook as he spoke to her, "I&#xD;
will now take you at once to my aunt's house in Burlington street. We will&#xD;
walk that little distance, and the fresh air will revive you. That lady already&#xD;
knows from me who and what you are, so far as I can tell her ; but it was&#xD;
not possible that I should find words in which to tell her all."&#xD;
"Not all?  Arthur, Arthur, you should have told her all."&#xD;
"Nay, my darling, how could I find words in which to tell her how dear&#xD;
and good and beautiful you are&#xD;
" Ah, Arthur, is that what you left untold? I fear you flatter the poor&#xD;
heart that you would make so proud with your love."&#xD;
"No, oh, no. It is so rich a treasure that I cannot flatter it. Flattery&#xD;
only lives but by comparison, and to what can I compare you, my Loo ?"&#xD;
It came like a flash now across the sky, that faint hue of early morning&#xD;
light; and as Loo looked up, it fell upon her face, and it fell, too, upon the&#xD;
young officer who was with her. They were both cast in as fine a mould as&#xD;
nature could create for her children ; and when their gaze now met, the smile&#xD;
that they exchanged was really beautiful. She crept a little closer to him,&#xD;
and he placed his arm around her trembling form.&#xD;
"Henceforth, dearest and best, we live but for each other."&#xD;
"But for each other," she responded. faintly. "But for each other, my&#xD;
Arthur. I never yet-"&#xD;
"Yet what, dear Loo ?"&#xD;
"Felt half so happy."&#xD;
"And I, my heart's treasure, I, too-"&#xD;
"Move on !" cried a watchman, "will you?  Move on !"&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XLIX.&#xD;
IT is half-past eleven o'clock, and we introduce the reader to that large and&#xD;
handsome apartment in the Albany, which to poor benighted Abel Morton has&#xD;
been the scene of many delirious excitements and so much misery, but of not"&#xD;
one pure pleasure that he could look back upon and say-&#xD;
"That-was sinless, and worth the remembering."&#xD;
But of all the terrors-of all the frightful feelings of remorse that had from&#xD;
time to time visited the brain of poor Abel, his present feelings were the most&#xD;
agonising, and the most acute..&#xD;
While he was pursuing that sad and fatal career, which separated him in&#xD;
affection and in confidence from all those towards whom he ought to have felt&#xD;
the warmest attachment, he had tried to calm some'-of the transports of his&#xD;
grief by telling himself that they would cast him off and cease to love him; but&#xD;
now when he had found father-mother-loving and gentle Emma-friends&#xD;
-ay, all clinging to him in the wreck of his fortunes, uttering no word of&#xD;
reproach to him--cheering his drooping spirits, when it was.theirs that wanted&#xD;
most cheering-consulting with him upon the best route out of the sea of'&#xD;
troubles that encompassed him, and into which they had plunged but to keep&#xD;
him gracious company, as though no voluntary acts of his had entailed upon&#xD;
him and them ad much misery; when he saw and felt that, Abel sunk indeed,&#xD;
and felt how unworthy he was of the rich gifts of affection which only a little&#xD;
time before then he had thrust aside for the meretricious ornaments of false.&#xD;
friendship, false love, and feverish delight..&#xD;
It was half-past eleven.&#xD;
A carriage arrives at the entrance of the Albany, and from it alights Sir&#xD;
John. Morton, how pale and agitated l-Lady Morton, too, she has come to&#xD;
town to see her darling boy. poor soul !-Emma, the much loved and heroic&#xD;
who in hours of sunshine and happiness would not tell her love, but&#xD;
boldly avowed it when the storm-clouda were upon the loved one's destiny--&#xD;
qMrs. ennet who seemed, by the odd snuffling she kept up, to have the worst&#xD;
of all bad colds in her head.&#xD;
And lastly, there came Abel Morton. What a shadow Abel looked' We must&#xD;
pity him--we cannot choose but pity him now, because after all, Abel was not&#xD;
intentionally and with malice aforethought, wicked.&#xD;
These then were the parties that made their way to the outer door of Abel's&#xD;
chamber ; and the old man tried to smile as he took the arm of his son, and&#xD;
said--&#xD;
"My dear. I see we are in good time."&#xD;
There was no need to knock for admittance, for Rowley was standing at the&#xD;
door gazing out; and when he sat Sir John and the ladies, he gave utterance&#xD;
to his agitated feelings in his own true vernacular, for he said-&#xD;
"Oh, my eye !"&#xD;
We must not conclude from this that there was anything the matter with&#xD;
Rowley's eye; but simply that he felt constrained to give utterance to some&#xD;
exclamatory sentence, and that that was the mildest expletive, if we may call&#xD;
it such, in his vocabulary.&#xD;
Nobody took any notice of the ejaculation.&#xD;
Rowley held the outer door wide open; and the visitors, together withAbel,&#xD;
all passed into the chamber, and took their seats in that fine room, the gaudy&#xD;
decorations of which had given such supreme delight to the imagination of&#xD;
Abel, when first he called them his own. How faded and stage-like he thought&#xD;
they looked now !&#xD;
And now Abel would make his mother sit in his arm-chair, and upon the&#xD;
grand dressing-gown, which lay there nicely folded up by Rowley ; and Lady&#xD;
Morton held her son's hand in hers, and strove to look cheerful and' happy,&#xD;
while her heart was all but broken. Poor lady !&#xD;

&#xD;
HEADS AND HEARTS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
It was a strange. and yet a heart-rending sight to see the looksof that family&#xD;
-to see how they all, with the exception of poor Abel, tried to smile. What&#xD;
a watery kind of sunshine those smiles were !&#xD;
"Father," said Abel, "you are not so well."&#xD;
"Oh yes, my boy, I am quite well."&#xD;
"Quite," said his mother. "We-we all feel so well; don't we, Emma ?"&#xD;
"To be sure, dear aunt ; and if Abel would only look cheerful and happy, I&#xD;
am sure we would all be-be--very--"-&#xD;
A choking sensation prevented her from completing the sentence ; but Lady&#xD;
Morton held up her finger in a warning attitude to her, and she controlled the&#xD;
burst of feeling that was upon the point of putting to flight all her previous&#xD;
tolerably well acted equanimity.&#xD;
Abel saw this, and it nearly killed him. Perhaps his father observed the&#xD;
blank, despairing look upon his face, for he said-&#xD;
"Abel, my boy, we are allfrightening ourselves about a shadow, and there&#xD;
is one very foolish thing that we are all doing, besides."&#xD;
"What is that, father?  Alas ! I thought that I only did both the foolish&#xD;
and the wicked things."&#xD;
" Hush-hush ! Not wicked. But I was going to say that we were all a&#xD;
set of cowards, for here we are, with our minds full of one subject, and yet we&#xD;
dread to mention it. Let us take courage. We came here by the force of&#xD;
circumstances to make such terms as we can with a scoundrel, that is all;&#xD;
and when the interview is over, we will all return with-light hearts to Hamp-&#xD;
stead."&#xD;
"Oh, father-father, I--&#xD;
A sharp knock at the outer door prevented Abel from finishing what he was&#xD;
about to say and Mr. Carnac was announced.&#xD;
The attorney entered, looking calm and confident, and bowed to all present.&#xD;
"In good time," he said. "Our man will be punctual, I dare say ; but it's&#xD;
ten minutes to twelve yet."&#xD;
"We are glad to see you, old friend," said Sir John. "Do you still think&#xD;
that-that-"&#xD;
" Thit what, Sir John ?"&#xD;
"We shall be able to make terms with Elk ?"&#xD;
"Of course," said the attorney, as he drew off his glove. "Of course, I hope v&#xD;
none of you are vexing yourselves with the idea that anything will turn out&#xD;
amiss?  Pho-pho ! It will be all right."&#xD;
What a thrill of joy crept over their hearts as they heard this ! Lady Mor-&#xD;
ton almost screamed with delight, and Emma had, to go and pretend to look&#xD;
out at the window at nothing, to conceal her emotion.&#xD;
Dab !&#xD;
Yes-that was a knock at the door. There was an arrival of some sort; but&#xD;
it surely could not be Elk coming in such humble guise?  They all waited&#xD;
with some anxiety to know who this could be, and at length Rowley opened&#xD;
the room door, and said-&#xD;
"Please, sir, he won't say who he is, but he wants you, sir."&#xD;
A head and face appeared thrust forward under Rowley's arm, and the voice&#xD;
of Jobus said-&#xD;
"It's only the worm, ladies and gentlemen. Pray excuse such a reptile for&#xD;
wriggling into good company, but-he-he !-oh !-dear, if we come to con-&#xD;
sider, we are all worms, all-all. Oh; dear, what am I saying ?"&#xD;
"Come in, Jobus," said Mr. Carnac. "We are all glad to see you-very&#xD;
glad to see you."&#xD;
"Thank you. All well?   Dear me, what a-world this is to be sure. Oh&#xD;
dear-oh, dear. Nobody need wish to---"&#xD;
"Why, Mr. Jobus, where on earth are you getting to?  Come out of there,&#xD;
do, I beg of you."&#xD;
"Eh 1" said Jobus, who had taken but two steps from the door, and then&#xD;
suddenly popped under the table, the rich tapestry covering of which swept&#xD;
&#xD;
the flooi with its bullion fringe. "Eh l Oh, excuse me, Pd rather be here,&#xD;
indeed I would. It's a nice shady sort of place, and if you will all be so good&#xD;
as to say nothing to the colonel about such a worm as I am being here at all,&#xD;
but leave me to take my own course in this business, why-oh 'dear me, it&#xD;
will be much better."&#xD;
" Well, but-"&#xD;
"Nay, Mr. Lawyer, let me be the judge in this case. Elk will say things,&#xD;
not knowing that I am here, that he would not say if he saw me."&#xD;
"There is something in that."&#xD;
"Murder !" said Mrs. Bennet, "somebody has got hold of my ankle."&#xD;
"It's only me, mum." said Jobus. "I thought it was the leg of the table."&#xD;
"Drat the man, what a hymna he is, to be sure."&#xD;
"Captain Lorrinet !" announced Rowley ; and the young officer made his&#xD;
appearance in the room, and going directly up to Sir John, shook him by both&#xD;
hands, saying-&#xD;
"My dear sir, let me hope you are well and hopeful."&#xD;
"I am-I am. My dear," (to Lady Morton,) "this is Captain Lorrinet,&#xD;
whom next to my own son, Abel, I hold dear. Emma, you will be great friend&#xD;
with Captain Lorrinet, and Abel will not be jealous."&#xD;
"Not a whit," said Abel.&#xD;
"This is very kind of you all," said Lorrinet, "very kind and good ; but tell&#xD;
me, has that strange mixture of goodness and weakness-of courage and tim-&#xD;
idity-poor Jobus, appeared yet ?"&#xD;
"The worm," said Jobus, "will come to the surface when he is wanted."&#xD;

HEADS AND HEARTS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh !"&#xD;
Bang, bang, bang !-Rat, tat, tat, tat !-Bang!"&#xD;
They all started as this tremendous knock came at the outer door of the&#xD;
chambers; but Mr. Carnac held up his hand, saying-&#xD;
" Calm-calm ! Be calm, I pray you all. This is no doubt the enemy. Be&#xD;
calm. Leave hin to me."&#xD;
"Colonel Elk !" announced Rowley, "and Mr. Mouldy."&#xD;
"Mr. who ?" said Lorrinet.&#xD;
"A Bow street office" whispered Mr. Carnac, to the young captain. " He&#xD;
thinks to frighten us with his presence."&#xD;
"You can walk to and fro in the Albany, Mouldy," said Elk, in a calm,&#xD;
assured voice. "If I want you I will call for you. You understand me&#xD;
"Yes, sir," said the man, as ifhis head were in a quart pot.&#xD;
"Very good. Well, Rowley, how are you by this time?   Fine morning,&#xD;
but a little chilly or so. Are our friends here? Is Abel at home, you dog, eh&#xD;
-eh?    Oh, he is here, all's right. Ladies and gentlemen, I have the honor&#xD;
to bid you good morning. Pray be seated-I hate all ceremony. Ah, a snug,&#xD;
charming set of chambers, these. I suppose they will be to let ?"&#xD;
The colonel was attired in the very height of fashion ; but there was a piece&#xD;
of sticking-plaster across his nose, and extending to one cheek, which showed&#xD;
that his fall down stairs some hours before had not taken place entirely with-&#xD;
out doing him some injury. The cool insolence of the ruffian was such that,&#xD;
for a few moments, even Mr. Carnac, who was profoundly cool and collected,&#xD;
could not find words in which to address him.&#xD;
Abel stepped forward, and confronted Elk, who stared him steadily in the&#xD;
face ; and taking out his gold snuff box, regaled himself with a pinch of the&#xD;
contents, and then, with matchless effrontery, said-&#xD;
"I believe you don't do anything this way, Abel ?"&#xD;
"cFiend !"&#xD;
"Hold !" said Mr. Carnac. "This is not right. Mr. Abel Morton, you will&#xD;
oblige me by taking a seat, and being silent. Colonel Elk, I believe we meet&#xD;
here upon business,?"&#xD;
"Very good, sir."&#xD;
"Then, sir, any levity or any irrational affectation of calmness, however well&#xD;
acted, is out of place." -&#xD;
"Indeed ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir. Having thus made that remark, allow me at once to proceed to&#xD;
business. You have a bill of exchange, accepted by Sir John Morton, and for&#xD;
the sum of one thousand pounds. Produce it, and we will pay it with in-&#xD;
terest."&#xD;
"Very good. That is the fact ; I have such a bill of exchange, purporting&#xD;
to be accepted by Sir John Morton, but in reality forged by Abel Morton. It&#xD;
is here."&#xD;
Thercolonel struck his breasts he spoke.&#xD;
"It is here, and I am well armed, and an officer of Bow street is within my&#xD;
call. You understand all that, sir? Well, the bill is for one thousand pounds,&#xD;
this is a clear sum. The only quarrel is about the interest. I charge for that,&#xD;
twenty-nine thousand pounds more. Give me a cheque for thirty thousand&#xD;
pounds, and the bill is yours."                     ;&#xD;
"Impossible !"&#xD;
"Not at all, except the will to do, it is wanting."&#xD;
"We refuse."&#xD;
"Very well, I care not. I came here to oblige you all ; but upon your&#xD;
refusal, then, to treat with. me, I will give Abel Morton in charge for the&#xD;
felony."&#xD;
"While you are rendering yourself liable to criminal proceedings, Colonel&#xD;
Elk, by trying to compromise for the sum you have named ?" said Mr.&#xD;
Carnac-&#xD;
"Exactly so, my dear sir. I compliment you upon your judgment, But--&#xD;

but, you see, let me have compromised ever so much, that don't save Abel !&#xD;
Ha ! ha ! What says sir John ?"&#xD;
Sir John Morton stepped foward, and looked at Elk for a few moments in&#xD;
silence, and then he said-&#xD;
"Sir, if I were to give you the sum you mention,.it would leave me and&#xD;
mine destitute ; but you-you cannot-you do not mean to say that----"&#xD;
"Go on, sir."&#xD;
"7 mean, that you really cannot be such a devil as to wish to take all from&#xD;
me? Reduce your demand to some reasonable compass, and with the hope&#xD;
of never looking upon your face again, you-shall have it."&#xD;
"No. Abel, my old friend, didn't you say the old man had thirty&#xD;
thousand pounds in the three per cents?&#xD;
"'Peace, Abel, peace !" said his father, as Abel sprang to his feet, and in&#xD;
another moment, but that he had been stayed, would have- grappled with&#xD;
Elk, and held him by the throat. "Peace, boy ! I must settle with this&#xD;
man."&#xD;
"Very good, Sir John. I give you credit for a desire to settle. You have&#xD;
heard the terms, all of you. Now listen to me. If Abel be but once given&#xD;
into custody his death is certain. His death I say-."&#xD;
"Oh, God, no !" shrieked Emma, as she sprang forward and knelt at the&#xD;
feet of Elk. "Spare him ! spare him !"&#xD;
" Emma," cried Abel, as he rushed forward and raised her, "kneel not to&#xD;
that fiend in hurhan shape. Disgrace not yourself and all of us. Disgrace&#xD;
not the majesty of woman by supplicating, him P"&#xD;
"Listen all !" said Mr. Carnac.  " Listen ! This is-absurd, as Colonel Elk&#xD;
well knows. The sum he has named is monstrous. I was justified in&#xD;
offering him on behalf of Sir John Morton the sum of three thousand pounds,&#xD;
and that is the extent we will give for the bill."&#xD;
" Ha! ha !" laughed Elk, as he indulged himself with another pinch of&#xD;
snuff from his gold snuff -box and leant back against the table. " Ha ! ha!'&#xD;
Three thousand pounds ! A mere bagatelle. My dear sir, you must think&#xD;
me crazed to dream of accepting such a sum for the neck of the scion of the&#xD;
house of Morton. Why, you only put a tenth part of the value upon our&#xD;
friend Morten that I do. Ha-! ha ! This must trouble him dreadfully."&#xD;
"Father !" cried Abel, "let me put an end to all this by, at once and for&#xD;
all, declaring that I will not allow you to yield to this base wretch's demands.&#xD;
I will not, cannot stand by and hear him speak to you in such a strain. By&#xD;
my own acts I must now stand or fall. Those whom I love and reverence&#xD;
more than ever I did shall not be sacrificed for me. The disgrace of the&#xD;
death that this villain, who God knows is more guilty than I. inasmuch as he&#xD;
played the part of my evil genius and tempter, shall not fall upon me or upon&#xD;
you. I can by my death, expiate the past; but it is in the power of all who&#xD;
live to throw themselves upon the memory of this circumstance in their own&#xD;
way.&#xD;
".Abel ! Abel !" shrieked his mother.&#xD;
"Oh, hush! mother, do not speak to me ; I am very unworthy, I know&#xD;
and feel that I am so, and that in all this affair I play a selfish part. Ti I,&#xD;
and I alone who peril 1l you possess, father. ILam the sole obstacle to the&#xD;
continuance of that life of gentlemanly ease,. the right to the enjoyment of&#xD;
* which you have nobly won of your country. Elk, I defy you!"&#xD;
, "No, Abel, no !" cried Sir John.&#xD;
"Yes father, I will to his face defy this man, and dare him to do his&#xD;
worst. It is possible-I do not know yet but that it is possible-he may&#xD;
destroy me; he may kill me, for let the end be what it may, this man is my&#xD;
actual murderer; but I do know that I will pull him down with me."&#xD;
"Ha! ha !" said Elk.&#xD;
"No, wretch, you shall not escape !"&#xD;
"Indeed! Ha! Well done, Abel; upon my life you haye quite mistaken&#xD;
your vocation, Abel. It was not the law that you ought to have come from&#xD;

"Colonel Elk," said Mr. Carnac."&#xD;
"Sir, I attend to you. You are the most sane person, I do think, here&#xD;
present."&#xD;
CHAPTER        L.&#xD;
Ir Colonel Elk's compliment, or implied compliment, to the sanity of Mr.&#xD;
Carnac, depended upon that gentleman preserving a coolness, which he strug-&#xD;
gled hard to preserve, but failed in so doing, it was a hollow enough piece of&#xD;
flattery, for the agitation of mind that the attorney was in now, exhibited&#xD;
itself in his countenance tolerably plainly.&#xD;
Mr. Carnac, though. managed to say what he wished to say with some&#xD;
degree of calmness and precision.&#xD;
"Colonel Elk," he said, "no doubt, the family of the Mortons would do&#xD;
much for the purpose of avoiding the public scandal of judicial proceedings in&#xD;
this matter ; and therefore they will pay you handsomely."&#xD;
"Justo           -&#xD;
"Hear me out, sir. I say, they will pay you handsomely, but not&#xD;
ruinously ; and therefore you are wrong in your calculations, if you imagine,&#xD;
for one moment, that the terms you have this day dictated can be agreed to.&#xD;
We will take our chance, sir."&#xD;
"Very good. Rowley."&#xD;
"Stop, sir; you have pretty intelligibly told us what you mean to do.&#xD;
Now, we will tell you what our intentions are."&#xD;
"Thank you; this candor is delicious."&#xD;
"We will have you indicted as a party concerned in the forgery ; and, upon&#xD;
the evidence of the Jew money-lender who discounted the bill for you, I&#xD;
think we can prove pretty well that you had quite as much to do with the&#xD;
forging, if not a great deal more, than Abel Morton. At all events, you will&#xD;
be committed as well as he, and probably the royal clemency may be excited&#xD;
in his favor and not in yours."&#xD;
"Oh, indeed !""&#xD;
"Yes, colonel, I have taken the advice of counsel, who is of opinion that&#xD;
such will be the best mode of proceeding."&#xD;
"Oh, indeed ! But it won't do. My dear, sir, I have provided against all&#xD;
that. But it is quite needless, at this stage of the proceedings, to tell you how&#xD;
I have done so; suffice it that I have."&#xD;
"What is your ultimatum, then ?"&#xD;
"Thirty thousand pounds."&#xD;
Lady Morton advanced with a tottering step towards the colonel, in spite&#xD;
of Mr. Carnac's efforts to keep her back.&#xD;
Sir," she said, "it is my son-my only son-indeed, my only child, who&#xD;
is in peril; I, his mother, implore you to be merciful."&#xD;
"Madam, I am your most humble and very obedient servant."&#xD;
"You-you will-be--lenient ?"&#xD;
"Very, madam. I consent actually to sell my conscience, for I feel that I&#xD;
ought to give dear Abel into custody at once ; but I consent, solely on your&#xD;
account, madam, to sell my conscience, as I say, and to actually barter my&#xD;
sense of public justice for the really insignificant-in comparison with the&#xD;
sacrifice-sum of thirty thousand pounds !"&#xD;
Lady Morton tottered back with a deep sigh.&#xD;
"Colonel Elk," said Captain Lorrinet, stepping forward.&#xD;
"Ah, Lorrinet, my boy, how are you ?"&#xD;
"Forbear, sir. Do not provoke me to chastise you on the spot for your&#xD;

insolent familiarity. I am no acquaintance of yours, sir. Do not presume&#xD;
too far upon my temper, Colonel Elk."&#xD;
There was that in the tone and in the expression of the young officer's face&#xD;
that made even Colonel Elk feel that it would not do to provoke an adversary&#xD;
with whom, in a personal struggle, he would have but a poor chance; so he&#xD;
merely bowed.&#xD;
"You seek another gratification than that which the mere acquisition of&#xD;
money will give you in this affair,"'added Lorrinet. "Now, Elk, I warn you.&#xD;
You stand upon a precipice."&#xD;
"Do I?"&#xD;
"You do. Safe and sure as you fancy yourself, and fenced in as you think&#xD;
you are by the devilish cunning of hideous crimes; I tell you you stand upon&#xD;
a mine. Beware ! It is possible that much that has been said to you this&#xD;
day, has been said for the purpose of allowing you-to escape-of avoiding the&#xD;
public scandal that would ensue from yo*r prosecution. I think, by your&#xD;
changing color, that you understand me."&#xD;
"You threaten, then&#xD;
"I do, Colonel Elk. I, of all here present, rise to threaten, and you will&#xD;
find that Lean keep my word."&#xD;
" Rap ! rap came upon the outer door of the chambers,.and then a kind&#xD;
of scuffle was heard, and who should rush into the room, making his way be-&#xD;
tween the legs df Rowley, who in vain tried to stop him, but the Dandoloski's&#xD;
tiger, in the very tops and smalls that had excited Rowley's admiration on&#xD;
the former visit of that precocious individual to the chambers.&#xD;
Placing his hand by the side of his mouth, and standing upon tiptoes, to&#xD;
give greater vehemence to his voice, the tiger'shouted-&#xD;
"Madame la Fiorenalla de Dandoloski."&#xD;
"Who ?" said Mr. Carnac.&#xD;
"The devil !" said the colonel.&#xD;
"No, no," said Abel, as he glanced at his mother and at Emma, "not hera&#xD;
Tell her that--"&#xD;
" Ah, mon cher Abel," said the Dandoloski, as she appeared at the door&#xD;
of the room. How was you to do, eh ?"&#xD;
"I implore you," said Abel, in English ; and then he said rapidly in French,.&#xD;
"Madame, si vous me regardez-"&#xD;
"Stop," said the Dandoloski, in good English. "I do not come here, Mr.&#xD;
Abel Morton, to fret or to annoy you. It is to expose the villany of that&#xD;
man !"&#xD;
She pointed to Elk.&#xD;
"Yes, I learned from his accidental expressions that he was about to come&#xD;
here this morning to destroy you, Abel. From time to time he has, in his&#xD;
moments of incaution and exultation at the success, as he thought, of his&#xD;
villanous schemes, let out sufficient of the plot by which he was compassing&#xD;
your destruction to enable me to understand it."&#xD;
"Peace, Helen !" cried Elk.&#xD;
"No, John Elk, I will not obey you ; but I have come freely to proffer my&#xD;
advice to those persons whom you would destroy-and to tell them that you&#xD;
admitted to me that--"&#xD;
"I will have your life 1"&#xD;
"No," said Lorrinet, stepping between Elk and the Dandoloski. "Touch&#xD;
her if you dare, Elk '"&#xD;
"That," continued Dandoloski, "you yourself concocted a forgery that you&#xD;
tempted young Abel Morton into the commission of, in order that you might&#xD;
destroy him and his."&#xD;
" False !" cried Elk. '"Who will believe the assertions of such a thing as&#xD;
thou art-an abandoned strumpet 7"&#xD;
"What I am, John Elk; you made me. God forgive me, I am wicked; I&#xD;
have been very,.very wicked; but I am not quite-dead to 'all feeling as youare.&#xD;
Henceforth, we never meet again ; and as for the innocent persons here, and.&#xD;

this boy whom you would have murdered, they can easily find me when they&#xD;
want me ; and despite all your threats and all you can do, I will appear, and&#xD;
upon my oath confirm what I have now said."&#xD;
" Ha-ha !" laughed Elk. "Quite dramatic !"&#xD;
"You are English, then?".said Lorrinet.&#xD;
The Dandoloski made him a low bow, as she replied-&#xD;
"I am. My name is Helen Bros'n. But do you think they would listen&#xD;
to any one who bore such a name, and spoke in their own tongue, at the Opera?&#xD;
Oh, no. lam there the Dandoloski. Keep my secret, sir; for though I should&#xD;
sing like a nightingale, or act like an angel, if it was not foreign, they would&#xD;
say I was getting money under false pretences, I assure you."&#xD;
"I believe it. Mr. Carnac, what effect will this lady's evidence have in the&#xD;
case ?"&#xD;
"It helps to materially damage that gentleman," pointing to Elk.&#xD;
"That gentleman does not think so," said Elk.&#xD;
" Chipps !" said the Dandoloski.&#xD;
"Here again," said the tiger.&#xD;
"To the carriage. En avant !"&#xD;
"I is a-going !"&#xD;
The Dandoloski left the room; but, oh ! what an awful glance that was&#xD;
that Elk bent upon her as she did leave it. It spoke of murder ! They all&#xD;
saw it.&#xD;
"Now, sir," said Mr. Carnac to the villain. "Now, I presume you feel the&#xD;
propriety of altering your terms a little ?"&#xD;
"No, sir.".&#xD;
"Indeed! Can you be so obstinate ?"&#xD;
"I can. I repeat again and again: damage me how you may, and to the&#xD;
utmost extent of your professional ability, yet the case as against our friend&#xD;
Abel remains in all its cold integrity. He did forge the bill ! Neither in law&#xD;
nor in morals, Mr. Carnac, do two blacks make a white, I presume. The gov-&#xD;
ernment will prosecute. My evidence is nothing. It is Sir John Morton who&#xD;
would commit Abel."&#xD;
"No-no !" cried Sir John Morton.&#xD;
"Very good, sir. We shall see."&#xD;
"Yes," said Lorrinet. "we shall see. Once more, Colonel Elk, I tell you that&#xD;
we would much rather compromise this affair and get rid of you, than have to&#xD;
prosecute you. If you will leave this country within twenty four hours, making&#xD;
your escape from the hands of justice, you shall have the means to do so."&#xD;
"Thank you. Capital !"&#xD;
"It is a fair offer."S&#xD;
"Oh, very, very fair indeed. Ha ! ha! But while I have the bill-the forged&#xD;
bill, I do not see why I need be in quite such a hurry to bid farewell to Eng-&#xD;
land. You all talk of damaging me ; but in that you may fail, while my power&#xD;
to damage you is clear and undoubted. I make my claim. It is now half-&#xD;
past twelve o'clock. I give you ten minutes longer to accept. or reject my&#xD;
offer."&#xD;
"Take ten thousand pounds, and go ?" said Sir John.&#xD;
"Take fifteen thousand pounds? That is the one half of all that I am worth.&#xD;
I share with you the proceeds of a life of toil; and I only do so in order that&#xD;
the name even of Morton shall be held sacred from public gossip or reproach."&#xD;
Sir John sank back in his chair.&#xD;
"Take all-all! My boy-my Abel! we will live and die together ! Your&#xD;
poor old father will yet work for you ; but he will have the joy of holding you&#xD;
to his heart, and of knowing that you are safe !"&#xD;
"No-no !" cried Abel in a voice of agony. "Away with scruples ! I have&#xD;
a duty to perform, and I will do it."&#xD;
Abel sprang forward to the window. and threw it up.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Hilloa !" he cried. "officer !"&#xD;
"Hold !" cried Mr. Carnac; "not yet."&#xD;
"You are mad, Abel," said Lorrinet ; "this must not be."&#xD;
"Well," said Elk, "it does look like suicide ; but I will call Mr. Mouldy, if&#xD;
you really want him. Perhaps, after all, it will be the best way. We can&#xD;
all adjourn to the police-office, and there settle the remainder of this morning's&#xD;
work."&#xD;
These words so alarmed Lady Morton and Emma, that they both sprang for-&#xD;
ward and- laid hold of Abel, as if by so doing they could save him from the&#xD;
consequences of the act of criminality he had committed, and which was the&#xD;
subject of all the misery that had been produced.&#xD;
"My son-my son !" cried Lady Morton, "my own dear Abel ! Oh fly-&#xD;
fly from this place ! Surely there is yet time for fight !"&#xD;
"Mother !" said Abel, "I-oh God, if I were but dead !"&#xD;
"No-no !"&#xD;
Emma sobbed bitterly.&#xD;
"Ladies," said the colonel, "we had much better call in Mr. Mouldy. I&#xD;
assure you he is a very experienced man in his particular line of business, and&#xD;
no doubt will manage matters in the most scientific manner possible. There is&#xD;
no occasion to make a noise by calling out at the open window. The thing&#xD;
can be done more quietly. Rowley-Rowley !"&#xD;
"Here !"&#xD;
"You will see a gentleman with one eye, outside, of the name of Mouldy.&#xD;
Tell him to walk in, if you please."&#xD;
"Yes," said Captain Lorrinet, quite calmly. "Tell him to walk in, as Iin-&#xD;
tend bo give this man Elk into his custody for murder !"&#xD;
Elk started.&#xD;
"Indeed, captain? Ha ! That is a good jest."&#xD;
"To me it is not the worst of all pleasantries, but to your victim it was no&#xD;
jest. Go, Rowley !"&#xD;
"No ! Stop ! Listen to me, all of you. You need not mind, Rowley. It&#xD;
is quite clear to me that we do not quite understand each other yet, and it is&#xD;
time that we should do so. You all think that I want the life of Abel ; but&#xD;
such.is. not the case. You think, too, that failing that, I want to leave you in&#xD;
such poverty as will embitter your existence, but that is a mistake altogether."&#xD;
"In the name of Heaven, then, what is it," cried Sir John, " that you do&#xD;
wish ?"&#xD;
"I will take twenty thousand pounds and go."&#xD;
"You will ?"&#xD;
"I will upon my honor, and give you up the bill. It is here."&#xD;
Colonel Elk took a large black pocket book from his breast-coat-pocket, and&#xD;
struck it with the flat of his hand.&#xD;
"You shall have the money."&#xD;
"No-no !" cried Abel.&#xD;
"My dear Abel," said the colonel, as he replaced his pocket book and took&#xD;
out his snuff-box, "you don't know what you say, really. Come, my old&#xD;
friend, take a pinch, only one, for old acquaintance sake."&#xD;
"Ha-ha ! certainly," said a voice behind the colonel, and Jobus, who had&#xD;
crawled from under the table on the opposite side, and got on the top of it,&#xD;
suddenly dived his finger and thumb into the gold snuff-box, and indulged&#xD;
himself with a copious pinch !&#xD;
Colonel Elk turned sharply, and-met Johns face to face !&#xD;

HEADS AND HEARTS; OR,&#xD;
CHAPTER LI.&#xD;
&#xD;
No language could possibly describe the look of Colonel Elk, as, with his&#xD;
head turned round, he gazed in the face of Jobus. That Jobus, whom he&#xD;
thought dead-that Jobus, whom he considered to be only lying in his blood&#xD;
at the house which had been the scene of his murder-that Jobus, whom he&#xD;
had found to be for so long a very slave, but whom he at last suspected to be&#xD;
a lion in his path. There he was, face to face with him!&#xD;
"Oh, dear," said Jobus, "he seems surprised."&#xD;
The sound of. Jobus's voice broke the spell that was upon the faculties of&#xD;
Colonel Elk, and, wth a start, he turned round and grappled with Jobus.&#xD;
"Fiend !-monster !" he shoutel. "You live! I will not be the slave of&#xD;
any more horrible suppositions ! You live ; but now I will have my revenge !&#xD;
Now-ha! ha !-now !"&#xD;
Poor Jobus would, no doubt, there and then have ended his career had&#xD;
there not been so many present who were both able and willing to take his&#xD;
part. Young Lorrinet sprang forward and clutched the colonel with such an&#xD;
iron grip, that he was compelled to let Jobus go, who then fell upon the&#xD;
floor, looking of a dull blue color in the face.&#xD;
"Would you murder the man before our faces " said Lorrinet, as he flung&#xD;
the colonel from him to the farther end of the apartment, where he only saved&#xD;
himself from falling by catching at the back of a large arm-chair.&#xD;
"He is killed !" said Sir John Morton.&#xD;
"No-oh, no," said Lorrinet, as he raised Jobus, and placed him in a seat.&#xD;
"Oh, no. All is well. The colonel has given him a good clutch by the&#xD;
throat; but the effects of that will pass away."&#xD;
"How are you, Jobus ?" said Mr. Carnac.&#xD;
"The-the-worm-breathes again in a small way.       Oh, dear 1-oh I&#xD;
Where is-the colonel ?"&#xD;
"There !"&#xD;
"Elk?   Oh, dear, no. Worms and colonels don't agree. A little drop of&#xD;
water, I think. Ah !"&#xD;
Jobus's countenance began to assume its ordinary color ; and Emmabrought&#xD;
him a glass of water from some that was upon a side-table, which he drank&#xD;
with great eagerness ; and then looking towards the colonel, he raised his&#xD;
right hand and pointed at him, saying as he did so-&#xD;
" Man, your time has come ! The long and wicked career that you have&#xD;
gone through is at an end, and the curtain that separates this world from&#xD;
eternity will soon drop upon you and your doings. I am he whom you&#xD;
meant to murder, but who has been preserved by that Providence yo9. ever&#xD;
slighted, and am destined to be your accuser ! I say, your accuser ! They say&#xD;
that stones will rise against a murderer, b  it is quite clear that worms&#xD;
can."    E&#xD;
Colonel Elk stamped upon the floor, as though to steady his nerves, and&#xD;
then he cried out-&#xD;
"I don't understand all this. What does it mean?  If Abel Morton is to&#xD;
be cleared from the commission of a great crime because this man is a thief&#xD;
and a murderer, then justice has departed from the land."&#xD;
"I am no murderer !" said Jobus, "I was a-a----"&#xD;
"Hush !" said Mr. Carnac, "all that is arranged. Colonel Elk, I say, as&#xD;
I said to you before, we are all prepared to proceed with you before a magis-&#xD;
trate."&#xD;
The colonel was staggered. He had thought that his hasty accusation of&#xD;
poor Jobus would, at least, be as good a tale as Jobus's accusation of him&#xD;
and he had in reality jumped to the conclusion that it was Lord Carlin who&#xD;
lay dead in the attic from various little circumstances that had occurred since&#xD;
the event ; and from one in particular, which was, that Carlin's valet had called&#xD;
and confessed that it had been his master's intent to secrete himself in Elk's&#xD;
&#xD;
MY OTHER, THE COLONEL. ~9°&#xD;
house. The truth had flashed upon Elk at once, then, that he had plunged&#xD;
the dagger into the heart of Carlin instead of that of Jobus. But still there&#xD;
was the lingering idea that he might accuse Jobus of that deed, if the worst&#xD;
came to the worst, and that just held him up a little.&#xD;
By such an effort as few men in his position would have been able to make&#xD;
Colonel Elk now roused himself, and confronting the party, among whom he&#xD;
had not one frieud, he said, with all the calmness he-could command'-&#xD;
" I defy you all yet. The proofs of the crime that Abel Morton has com-&#xD;
nutted are here !" He struck the pocket that contained the black pocket-book&#xD;
as he spoke. "Take your own course, one and all of you, and I will take&#xD;
mine. You spoke of going before a magistrate, Mr. Qarnac. I am ready;&#xD;
and the first act I shall do there will be to give Abel Morton in charge fog&#xD;
forgery, and to state the reason that induced me to think Jobus guilty of mur-&#xD;
ker. His previous bad character will aid the accusation.&#xD;
Tap ! tap ! came at the outer door of the chamber.&#xD;
Colonel Elk moved a little nearer to the window, and the whole party&#xD;
started ; but Mr. Carnac called out-&#xD;
"Rowley, admit the gentlemen."&#xD;
Two gentlemen entered the apartment, followed by a man in a rough great,-&#xD;
coat. One of the gentlemen stepped forward. and said-&#xD;
"Mr. Carnac, we have searched within the last half hour the house of Colo-&#xD;
nel Elk, and taken into custody everybody whom we found there."&#xD;
" That is right."&#xD;
"In the attic was a dead body, and upon the wall close to the bed on which&#xD;
it lay,.the dying man had traced with his finger dipped in his own blood, the&#xD;
words-&#xD;
"'aElk has murdered me!'&#xD;
"A little bit of evidence to corroborate the worm," said Jobus, rubbing his&#xD;
hands slowly together.&#xD;
Mr. Carnac turned towards the colonel, and said in a low, solemn voice-&#xD;
"There stands the murderer!"&#xD;
"Hold !" said Elk, as he dexterously twisted a table round, so that-it was&#xD;
between him and his enemies. " Hold ! I say. You are all mad. Sir John&#xD;
Morton yon have been trying to disarm me by bringing me into danger ; but&#xD;
that will not do. I am a man, who don't mind paying a price for his revenge,&#xD;
even, although that price be my own life. I tell you to beware of what you&#xD;
are about. I hold the peace and happiness of your future life in my hands."&#xD;
"Villain h'&#xD;
"Oh, hear him," said Mr. Carnac, "I beg that you will hear him. Sir&#xD;
John. It is quite as well that you should do so. Do doubt:he has some&#xD;
other revelation to make to you. It is quite as well we should know all that&#xD;
he now has to say. Go on, Colonel Elk-go on "&#xD;
"I have-ha ! ha !-I have !" cried Elk, growing red and boisterous with&#xD;
passion. I have more to say yet, and I will say it. There he is-that son&#xD;
whom you fondly looked upon as the successor to your name and honor, the&#xD;
heir of your baronetcy of your wealth, and of the soldierly repute of his fath-&#xD;
er. Well, Sir John Morton-ha ! ha !-that son, brought up, as he now is,&#xD;
to man's estate, through all the troubles and the turmoils of early life, that&#xD;
son will die a convicted felon !-ha l-ha l-a convicted felon, even if I fall !"&#xD;
"I do not see," said Mr. Cariac, "that this has anything to do with the&#xD;
matter in hand, sir. I thought that you were about to throw some new&#xD;
light upon your nefarious transactions."&#xD;
"I am !"&#xD;
"Then we listen to you."&#xD;
'Ha! ha ! You may listen, and I will speak-ha ! It is good sport this.&#xD;
Sir John Morton, your hair is white: it is not with age. There are deep fur-&#xD;
rows on your cheeks ; and when men see you, they say, 'There is a break-&#xD;
ing heart. There are the marks of premature old age. induced by sorrow.&#xD;
Look at that man,' they will say. 'There lies at the bottom of his heart&#xD;

some secret cause for woe, that he never forgets.' Ha! ha! Never ! sleep-&#xD;
mg or waking. Am I right, Sir John Morton-am I right, sir ?"&#xD;
"You are. My-my long-lost daughter !"&#xD;
"Oh'!" said Jobus.&#xD;
"Yes, Sir John Morton, it is of your long-lost daughter, Louisa, of whom I&#xD;
speak."&#xD;
"Man or devil ! if you can tell me aught of her I will let you have my heart's&#xD;
blood, if you desire it, as a fee. If but for one brief minute you can let me&#xD;
know that she lives-let me clasp her to my arrhs-let me hold her to my&#xD;
heart, I'd think the joy so cheap if it cost me all the gold the world ever saw,&#xD;
that I would add my life to make up the price ! But no-no, that is too much&#xD;
to expect. She is dead-dead !"&#xD;
Elk drew himself up with a triumphant look, and scowled upon those who&#xD;
were around him.&#xD;
"Ha-ha! Sojve understand each other better now, Sir John ?"&#xD;
"For a little while," said Jobus. "Oh dear !"&#xD;
"  Peace." ,&#xD;
"Mr. Abel, and you Mr. Soldier Lorrinet-oh dear ! be so good as to stand&#xD;
between me and the Elk while I make a little-ah !-oh !-just a little state-&#xD;
ment. Oh! don't look so, colonel, I beg !"&#xD;
"Wretch !"&#xD;
"Yes I am, and a worm too; but as I have come to the surface of the&#xD;
world it is highly proper I should say why. Sir John Morton your daughter&#xD;
lives'!"&#xD;
"Lives! Oh,  od !"&#xD;
"Yes. He kno s much."&#xD;
"I do," said El     t I say she lives upon my fiat only. A word-a look&#xD;
from me in the p      quarter, and she dies ! Come, Sir John, I hold my&#xD;
bargain with you; o you hold yours with me. The fate of both your chil-&#xD;
dren is in my hands. One will die by the knife of the assassin, the other&#xD;
by the cord of the hangman, if it be my pleasure. Will you redeem them&#xD;
both ?"&#xD;
"I will ! oh, Heaven, Itwill ! I ask you.all-you who look upon me with&#xD;
such strange faces. I ask you, which of you would barter your dear children&#xD;
for gold?  Would mountains of the rich ore pay you for the loss of one smile&#xD;
-one blessing?   Why, no ! I shall be poor-they will be poor ; but I can&#xD;
work for them. Already the warm blood courses through my veins, even as&#xD;
it was wont to do in early life, and I feel that for this lam still capable. Be-&#xD;
sides, a grateful country, whose battles I have fought, still owes me something,&#xD;
and it will not see an old soldier, who can show his honorable scars, cast&#xD;
adrift upon the world. Oh, no ! Look up, Abel my son-my darling, I ran-&#xD;
som you from this'enemy, and all will yet be well, for he will give me back&#xD;
my daughter."&#xD;
"Then," said Elk, "perhaps after all we shall not want Mr. Mouldy, and&#xD;
this little affair will end as amicably as a wedding party."&#xD;
"'Yes, oh yes ! My daughter-my child-my Loo-my own dear little child&#xD;
--oh, give her to me !&#xD;
"Your cheque for thirty thousand pounds, Sir John Morton, and time to&#xD;
send a messenger for the gold-I will have it all in gold, which will be the&#xD;
only delay-and then you shall have your daughter, and I will place in Abel's&#xD;
hand the bill !"&#xD;
"Stop !" said Jobus. "Oh dear, it's rather a large sum. Couldn't you say&#xD;
a trifle less, colonel?"&#xD;
"Peace, hound !"&#xD;
"lie, h, he! Oh dear, I did laugh then. Mr. Carnac-he, he !-don't you,&#xD;
sir, in your professional experience, think that is dear? Oh dear, a very high&#xD;
price that Sir John is paying ?"&#xD;
"~Colonel Elk," said Mr. Carnac, with admirable gravity, «I think that&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.&#xD;
&#xD;
before my client, Sir John, parts with so much money, there ought to be some&#xD;
greater assurance upon our parts that you can keep your word."&#xD;
S"As how, sir ?&#xD;
"As regards the young lady, Miss Louisa Morton.&#xD;
"Well, sir, you shall have one witness. Open the outer door of the cham-&#xD;

"As the forged bill. I don't believe it. It is a delusion-a dream-a mere&#xD;
ignis fatuus--there is nodsuch thing."&#xD;
"Then I am mad! mad "&#xD;
Well, that is like enough."&#xD;
"Is it likeaenough?  Ha! ha! not so like as the stern reality-not like as&#xD;
the damning fact. It is here-here "' The colonel, with violent gestures, tore&#xD;
the large black pocket book from his breast pocket. "It is here ! Here is thu&#xD;
dream! the ignis-fatius that will destroy you all ! Here is the delusion !&#xD;
So tangible-ha! ha !-so much to the purpose that, that judge and jury will&#xD;
be deluded by it, and the hangman will be the last ignisfatuus that flashes&#xD;
on the sight of Abel Morton ! It is here-ha! ha !-here! here !"&#xD;
The colonel took a slip of paper from his pocket book. It was folded twice&#xD;
and he carefully unfolded it, and then as he held it before his eyes he glanced&#xD;
at it as though it had been a basilisk. Jobus crept behind him and looked&#xD;
over his arm at it.'&#xD;
"Good gracious !" said Jobus. "I'm afraid that looks like a plain piece of&#xD;
paper, with no writing at all upon it,'and not even a stamp ! He! he! I did&#xD;
laugh I own it. A worm laughed:"&#xD;
Elk staggered to the window-sill, and the paper dropped from his hands, as&#xD;
he glared about him with an awful.look.&#xD;
"What is this'?" he §aid. "What-what does all this mean'? Juggled?&#xD;
-tricked at last ! No-no! A dream! Whatelse-! The bill! It was here&#xD;
safe-in the iron box! The key-the key! All safe-that is here. Some&#xD;
wretch-It is-it is"-surely here."  He ransacked the pocket-book and then&#xD;
dropped it at his feet. "No-no ! Gone-gone! There is no such thing-&#xD;
no such thing !"&#xD;
"But there was," said Jobus. "Oh, dear, there was. I will produce the&#xD;
bill."&#xD;
"No !" said Mr. Carnac. "No -"&#xD;
"Oh, yes. It is quite harmless. I will now return it to the colonel."&#xD;
Jobus took from his waistcoat-pocket a small pill-box, and carefully opened&#xD;
the lid, and then with a puff of breath, he blew from the interior about the&#xD;
magnitude that would make up a pinch of snuff of white ash from burnt paper.&#xD;
"There," added Jobus. "There is Abel Morton's ransom . Colonel, the&#xD;
worm paid you a visit last night, and this is the rest. That is to say, this is&#xD;
one of the results, you see. Oh dear, that is the other."&#xD;
Jobus pointed to Loo Morton.&#xD;
Elk drew a long breath as he gasped out-&#xD;
"I saw him and thought it was a vision ! Yes, I saw him t"&#xD;
"Yes," said Jobus, "and you fell down stairs, and I, and the bill, and the&#xD;
young captain, and MissLoo Morton-who will soon be Mrs. Captain Lorrinet,&#xD;
if I don't very much mistake-had the pleasure of walking over your illustri-&#xD;
ous back, as you lay in the hall of your own house. Oh dear, that a worm&#xD;
should have to say such, things !"&#xD;
"Abel. you are saved !" cried his mother.&#xD;
"My boy is saved !" sobbed Sir John.&#xD;
"Brother-brother !" wept Loo, as she still clung to him.&#xD;
Some few spots of blood trickled down the chin of Colonel Elk, for he had&#xD;
bitten his lower lip in his agitation and anger ; but with an air of sarcastic&#xD;
politeness, he now bowed to them all as he said-&#xD;
"I suppose I am foiled. Ah !-Well! Where there is a victory, there must&#xD;
be a defeat somewhere. Treachery has sapped my plans, and I am beaten. I&#xD;
wish you all joy of your victory ; much joy. I--I-go now."&#xD;
"Stop !" said Jobus. "Sir John Morton, have you no recollection of this&#xD;
man 7"&#xD;
"There have been moments," said Sir John, "when his tones and his expres-&#xD;
sions were both familiar to me; but I know not where."&#xD;
"He was an officer under your command in India. He committed a mur-&#xD;
der-he-robbed the military chest and then trafficked with the enemy."&#xD;
&#xD;
e&#xD;
&#xD;
"Ah'! I know him !"&#xD;
"Y"; and in India you disgraced him, and had the epaulets torn from his&#xD;
shoulders. You saved him from the death he merited, and for that mercy you&#xD;
have endured much. He is now again defeated. He is a murderer and must&#xD;
not be let loose upop society more."&#xD;
"Seize him ! cried Lorrinet.&#xD;
"Mouldy-Mouldy !" shouted Jobus at the door of the chambers. But the&#xD;
ough-looking man who had already arrived, stepped forward, saying-&#xD;
"I'll take him."&#xD;
"Oh, will you?" said Elk. "I bid you beware. sii'."&#xD;
-All right. It's all in the way of business. You are wanted, sir; you had&#xD;
better let this table be got out of the way, and so give up quietly."&#xD;
"One word first. I am, as you see, one man to many. Well, of course,&#xD;
my capture is easy. Try it !"'                                   -:&#xD;
With a bound Elk dashed through the window into the Albany, and strik-&#xD;
ing insensible an officer, who tried to stop him, he disappeared from before&#xD;
their astonished gaze.&#xD;
 CHAPTER      LIII.&#xD;
THE sudden and 'unlooked for manner in which Colonel Elk had made his&#xD;
escape from the chambers of Abel Morton in the Albany so petrified everybody&#xD;
that he had really got the start of all pursuit so far that it seemed a doubtful&#xD;
matter if he could be caught at all,&#xD;
With the wonderful audacity and resources of such a man, a chance of&#xD;
escape was almost converted into a certainty, and poor Jobus, as he clasped&#xD;
his hands in despair, cried out---.&#xD;
" Gone-gone ! He is gone, and our lives are not worth twenty-four hours&#xD;
purchase. He will have his revenge yet."&#xD;
"Stop a bit," said Mr. Carnac, "this won't do. We must follow him. This&#xD;
way. As I stood I saw which way he turned after he got out of the window.&#xD;
He went to the left."&#xD;
"Then le has gone home," said Lorrinet. "Come on then who can and&#xD;
who will. We will unearth this monster."&#xD;
They made a rush from the chamber--that is to say, the police-officers,&#xD;
Captain Lorrinet, Mr. Carnac, Jobus, and Frogs, and young Morton, for he felt&#xD;
that if it were interesting and important to any one to catch the fugitiveit&#xD;
was especially so to him.t&#xD;
Just as they got within sight of the entrance to tlge Albany, they saw Col-&#xD;
onel Elk's cab dash off at a terrible rate.&#xD;
"There he goes," said Jobus. "There he goes-oh, there he goes ! The&#xD;
cab-the cab."&#xD;
It was out of the questi nat they could keep the vehicle in sight, but&#xD;
by bounding on as quickly as he could, Jobus saw that-upon reaching Bond&#xD;
street the cab turned to the left, and that convinced him that the colonel was&#xD;
not going home.&#xD;
"Lost-lost !" he cried. "We shall miss him now."&#xD;
"Which way has he gone ?" asked everybody.&#xD;
"To the left."&#xD;
"Then it is to his brother Josiah's," said Frogs. with a wink at Jobus;&#xD;
"Ah !" cried Jobus, clapping his hands together, "it is so, my good friend.&#xD;
He ! he ! The worm recovers its equanimity sufficiently to smile again, and&#xD;
to state to its friends and connexions that there is no hurry."&#xD;
"No hurry !" cried Captaiin Lorrinet. "Excuse me, but there is much&#xD;
hurry, old friend."&#xD;
"Oh dear, no-not at all. He ! Oh, well, it's better not tp laugh just yet,&#xD;
so I won't; but if you will all come to the house of Mr. Josiah Elk, we shall,&#xD;
perhaps, get some news from him of his brother, the colonel."&#xD;

"Come on, then," said Lorrinet. "I will not lose a moment. Come on;&#xD;
the house is close at hand."&#xD;
They all made speed now to Josiah Elk's house, and when they bus stop-&#xD;
every thing looked quiet and orderly. No cab was to be seen; but Jo p&#xD;
ped i woman who was vending lavender, and said-     door and then go&#xD;
" My good female, did you see a cab come  yonder    , andthenngo&#xD;
away again ?".h                               o   etmuqiosad&#xD;
"Oh, yes ; and a gentleman got out with a pair of great musquitendled&#xD;
then the cab went away againlike I don't know what-only a penny a gentle-&#xD;
"Elh ?-oh, the lavender? , 'There is sixpence. Elhank ysall fin gemat&#xD;
men." said Jobus, " let us call upqn Mr. Josiah Elk.&#xD;
home. Oh dear yes, we shall find him at home."&#xD;
Captain Lorrinet knocked and rang, and the quiet footman of Josiah Elk&#xD;
opened the door.&#xD;
"Is your master at home ?",,&#xD;
"No sir; he is out of town for a few days."&#xD;
"Oh, indeed. Has Mr. Elk's brother been here lately ?"&#xD;
"The colonel is here now, sir, and in master's dressing-room-&#xD;
" Oh, very well, we will see the colonel."&#xD;
"Yes sir, walk in, sir. Oh dear !"&#xD;
The rest of the party had kept back, so that the footman was rathercsur-&#xD;
prised at the strong force that took possession of the haol; but before he could&#xD;
say a word, there cane the sharp tingle of a bell in the house, and the foot&#xD;
man, after looking surprised for a moment, said-&#xD;
"Oh, it's the drawing-room bell. It's the colonel, I suppose."&#xD;
"But the colonel is not your master," saids t when his brother the col-&#xD;
onel, comes here, he is to be treated as though he were our master."&#xD;
"Oh, yes.",&#xD;
"Very much yes," said Jobus.&#xD;
"Ha! ha !" laughed Frogs, " I  .      ,&#xD;
"hold your row," said Jobus, "will you ?"     in the ribs in that way,&#xD;
"Oh well, that will do. You needn't poke a fellow&#xD;
old chap. Be quiet.".&#xD;
" You will say to the colonel," said Lorrinet, "that some gentlemen wish to&#xD;
speak with him."&#xD;
"Stop a bit," said the officer. "I will say so to him myself. In the draw-&#xD;
ing-room do you say he is ?"&#xD;
"Yes sir, I suppose so-it was the drawing-room bell."&#xD;
pedThe officer had gone about three steps u  h stairs, when aome neoa-&#xD;
pered at the top of them, and a bald head immensely whitened by hair pow-&#xD;
der, was put over the balustrades, while a weak voice said-&#xD;
" What is the matter, Thomas? My good Thomas, what is it ?"&#xD;
" ''hy-why," said the footman, "there's master !"&#xD;
"He! he !" said Jobus ";oh !'&#xD;
The officer paused, and looked back at the gentlemen who were with him,&#xD;
doubtfully.&#xD;
"Whatis it ?" said Mr. Josiah Elk, appearing a little further in sight. "Is&#xD;
it the kitchen flue again, Thomas ?"&#xD;
" Lor no, sir ; but-I thought-we all thought, sir, if you please, that you&#xD;
were out of town."'I&#xD;
"Yes Thomas, but I let myself in about half an hour ago with my key. I&#xD;
knew it was your dinner hour in the kitchen, you see, Thomas, and I would&#xD;
not disturb you. I am very ill indeed. Do these gentlemen want me&#xD;
"Yes sir, if you please."&#xD;
"Show them up, Thomas."&#xD;
Mr. Josiah Elk disappeared slowly and deliberately.&#xD;
"It's a pity to trouble him," said Abel, "but the colonel must be in the&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BROTHER, THE COLONEL.&#xD;
house, and even the consideration we may feel for his brother must not pre-&#xD;
vent us from securing that man."&#xD;
"Certainly not," said Lorrinet.&#xD;
"We are worms all,'' said Jobus. "Come on, gentlemen."&#xD;
They all followed Thomas, the footman, to the drawing-room which was&#xD;
much darkened, and there sat Mr. Josiah Elk in a dressing-gown, and his feet&#xD;
in list slippers, and his bald, respectable-looking head, and very white well-kept&#xD;
face, looking the very pattern of gentlemanly propriety.&#xD;
"Pi'ay. gentlemen," he said "pardon me if I appear unpolite to you; but I&#xD;
have just had such a shock. My brother the colonel--"&#xD;
"It is of him, sir," said Lorrinet, "we come to speak."&#xD;
"Oh, you don't say so ? He has just been here like a madman. Ho rushed&#xD;
in and demanded of me a hundred pounds--I gave him my purse; and then&#xD;
cryig out, 'Josiah, look out of the window if you want to see the last of me,&#xD;
for     6 am off!' he dashed out of the room again, and left the house. The shock&#xD;
has nearly killed me, for Igrieve to say it of my own brother, that I am afraid&#xD;
he has not been carrying on either a prudent or a virtuous career. Pray be&#xD;
seated, gentlemen, if you please."&#xD;
The party looked at each other with doubt and perplexity, and then the&#xD;
officer said-&#xD;
"Sir, I am, a police-officer."&#xD;
"Are you, sir?  I respect your calling."&#xD;
"Perhaps then, sir, you will not feel offended if, in the discharge of my duty,&#xD;
I search the house."&#xD;
"Not in the least. I will give orders to my servants to show you every&#xD;
accommodation and facility ; and perhaps you gentlemen will take a glass of&#xD;
wine and tell me particularly what this bold. and I must add bad, brother of&#xD;
mine, his done."9&#xD;
Mr. Elk with difficulty walked to the bell-pull and rang it, and as he did&#xD;
so, Frogs stole behind him and clasped him round the waist, crying out in a&#xD;
loud, yelling voice as he did so-  .&#xD;
"I have him--I have him ! This is the colonel ! There is but one of them&#xD;
There is no Josiah Elk ! This is the colonel, I tell you! He wears a wig and&#xD;
false mustaches, and colors his face when he plays the colonel; but this is our&#xD;
man ! Ha, ha ! I know him !'Jobus knows all about it !'This is our man !"&#xD;
Elk--and it was the veritable Elk, the same Elk who played the parts of&#xD;
both-colonel and Josiah-drew his right hand quickly from his pocket, and&#xD;
placing the muzzle of a pistol against the head-of Frogs, he pulled the trigger.&#xD;
There was a terrific explosion, and the brains of Frogs were spattered over&#xD;
the superb mirror that-was by the chimney-piece. The room was full of smoke,&#xD;
and in the confusion Colonel Elk rushed from it, and up the staircase to the&#xD;
upper part. of the house.&#xD;
The officer, and Captain Lorrinet, and Abel Morton were after him in a&#xD;
moment. They heard doors opened and dashed shut; and at length they&#xD;
reached an attic, and just over a bed that was in it they saw a trap-door&#xD;
which Elk was closing.&#xD;
"There he goes," said the officer. "I'll have him, gentlemen. One ofyou&#xD;
go down info the street, and get a constable to watch him. I'll have him.&#xD;
Easy does it, gents. Easy does it."&#xD;
Abel went down stairs to give'the alarm; and the constable and Lorrinet&#xD;
followed Colonel Elk on to the roof of the house. There was a mews at the&#xD;
back of the whole row of houses in one of which the very respectable Josiah&#xD;
Elk had resided ; and it seemed to be the object of Colonel Elk to get to that&#xD;
place, where it was possible enough he had some sort of confederate who might&#xD;
have succored him in that extremity of his fortunes. It was quite clear that&#xD;
he had provided for such an emergency as now occurred ; for round a chim-&#xD;
ney-pot there was twined some forty or fifty feet of rope, which with great&#xD;
dexterity Elk unwound ; and before the officer could reach him down the&#xD;
sloping roof, he had clung to it and was commencing his descent.&#xD;
&#xD;
P                                                                                                   -&#xD;

"Stop him !" shouted the officer.&#xD;
"Ha-ha !" cried Elk, "not caught yet. Oh, God'! Gone !"&#xD;
The chimney pot creaked, and then fell over with Elk's weight. He saw it&#xD;
coming, and made a desperate effort to cling to some stakes and save himself;&#xD;
but it was in vain: down he went, a height of about forty feet. They heard&#xD;
the dull crash with whichhe fell upon the jagged stones in the mews !&#xD;
*             a   *      *      *     '   a      *      *&#xD;
With the death of Elk our tale concludes.&#xD;
It will be recollected how Josiah and the colonel never appeared together&#xD;
upon any scene of action, and how many little circumstances might have led to&#xD;
the belief that they were one and the same person, as indeed they were. In&#xD;
Josiah's house were found the wig, the false mustache, and the clothing which&#xD;
the villain had just had time to throw off' before the arrival of his foes. We&#xD;
need say nothing further of Elk. All that remained of him was a crushed&#xD;
and mangled body lying in a pool of blood !&#xD;
Abel was married to his dear cousin the following week. Need we say that&#xD;
they were very, very happy?&#xD;
The joy that she saw now in her happy home weaned Lady Morton from&#xD;
that seclusion of the soul which had so long oppressed her, and she looked in&#xD;
a short time quite a different being. Sir John too, shook off the appearance&#xD;
of premature old age that had come over him, and smiled as of old.&#xD;
Captain Lorrinet was married to Loo on the same day that united Abel to&#xD;
his cousin. Oh, what a throng there was at St. James's Church to see the&#xD;
two handsome couples !&#xD;
-Jobus was taken into the service of Sir John Morton, and.remained in the&#xD;
family many years in peace and contentment. He scarcely ever called himself&#xD;
a worm; ,.but his great joy was to amuse Abel's children, and to follow them&#xD;
about on the old heath at Hampstead, with a potent joy in the fact that he&#xD;
was trusted with them. Poor Jobus !&#xD;
Rowley found service with a fast young nobleman, who just suited him.&#xD;
The Dandoloski discharged the little tiger, notwithstanding it was found&#xD;
that he grew no bigger; but a showman took him in hand and exhibited him&#xD;
as Tom Thumb, and more fools=and their money-were parted to go to see him&#xD;
than we really like to credit.&#xD;
Lord Rokeley broke his neck riding a steeple chase.&#xD;
And now having disposed of all our dramatis persona, as far as we have&#xD;
been able to discover their fate, we conclude by inviting the reader to think&#xD;
how a man's heart may be very right, and his head very wrong; for, after&#xD;
all, Abel Morton had a good heart, but rather a weak head-that is to say,&#xD;
he wanted the courage which all young people should study to attain, to&#xD;
say no in the right place and under the right circumstances. It is that duc-&#xD;
tility of disposition in the young which prevents them from negativing the&#xD;
suggestions of others, while they know and feel those suggestions to be wrong&#xD;
that entertain the triumph of heads over Hearts.&#xD;
Let the heart, then, control its impulses by the quieter suggestions of the&#xD;
head. Think as well as feel. If Abel had done so, he would have spared&#xD;
himself, and those who loved him, much misery ; for, after all, his rescue from&#xD;
the meshes of the net that Elk had drawn around him, was more accidental&#xD;
than otherwise. He might have been destroyed, and how many hearts would&#xD;
have fallen with him!&#xD;
