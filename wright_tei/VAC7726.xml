            <head>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</head>
            <p>THE writer of this tale has made an humble effort to add something to the scanty
               stock of native American literature. Any attempt to conciliate favour by apologies
               would be unavailing and absurd. In this free country, no person is under any
               obligation to write; and the public (unfortunately) is under no obligation to read.
               It is certainly desirable to possess some sketches of the character and manners of
               our own country, and if this has been done with any degree of success, it would be
               wrong to doubt that it will find a reception sufficiently favourable.</p>
            <p>The original design of the author was, if possible, even more limited and less
               ambitious than what has been accomplished. It was simply to produce a very<pb
                  n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7726-00000005"/> short and simple moral tale of the most
               humble description; and if in the course of its production it has acquired any thing
               of a peculiar or local cast, this should be chiefly attributed to the habits of the
               writer's education, and that kind of accident which seems to control the efforts of
               those who have not been the subjects of strict intellectual discipline, and have not
               sufficiently premeditated their own designs.</p>
            <p>It can scarcely be necessary to assure the reader, that no personal allusions,
               however remote, were intended to be made to any individual, unless it be an exception
               to this remark, that the writer has attempted a sketch of a real character under the
               fictitious appellation of "Crazy Bet."</p>

            <head>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</head>
            <p>THERE are few subjects upon which men are so apt to mistake, as their motives, and
               the character of their own actions. This tale was written under a sincere conviction
               of its beneficial tendency. If this be a delusion, it is one which still influences
               the mind of the writer, who cannot but believe that it is this circumstance which has
               chiefly contributed to the satisfaction derived from the indulgent and liberal
               reception with which this humble effort has been so kindly greeted.</p>
            <p>The objections which have been made to the moral and religious character of this
               book, the writer cannot comprehend, and therefore will not undertake to refute.
               Religious cant and sanctimonious pretence have existed in most ages of the world, and
               have ever been deemed legitimate objects of satire; and the writer of the New England
               Tale, would rather court than avoid<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7726-00000006"/> an
               imputation (if it be such), which must be equally shared with Butler, Cowper, and
               Crabbe, and could only wish that there had been a similar participation of talent and
               genius.</p>
            <p>If the writer could suppose that any reader of intelligence and candour could
               consider this tale as a designed attack upon the character of any class of
               Christians, such an object would be distinctly disavowed; and, it is confidently
               believed, might be clearly refuted from the tale itself. To exhibit our religion in
               its uncorrupted state, and in such a form as to interest the affections and influence
               the conduct, is a right and a duty which the writer has attempted to exercise and
               perform; and if any degree of success has attended that effort, it must bring with it
               its own reward. In the mode of doing this, mistakes may have been committed, and, if
               so, will be matter of sincere regret.</p>
            <p>Every person of generous sentiments who has been led to treat of morals or religion,
               must have felt with peculiar force the sentiment so beautifully expressed in the
               often quoted lines of the master-poet of our language: <q>
                  <lg type="quotation">
                     <l>"Oh then that we could come by Cæsar's spirit,</l>
                     <l>And not dismember Cæsar!"</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But, from the constitution of human nature, it is, and ever will be, impossible to
               make any attack upon folly, vice, or error, which shall not be susceptible of an
               application to classes of men, and even to individuals; and if any one shall insist
               upon making such an application of any thing in this book, the writer must reply to
               the supposed antagonist in the words of the same poet—that he <q>
                  <lg type="quotation">
                     <l>———"but therein suits</l>
                     <l>His folly to the metal of my speech.</l>
                     <l>———Let me see wherein</l>
                     <l>My tongue has wronged him; if it do him right,</l>
                     <l>Then hath he wronged himself; if he be free,</l>
                     <l>Why then my censure like a wild goose flies,</l>
                     <l>Unclaimed of any man."</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But there is a charge of a graver cast which may be fairly made against this book,
               and to which the writer seizes with avidity the first opportunity to plead guilty.
               If, as its title must seem to denote, the book be considered as a representation of
               the general character of the people of New England, it is not sufficiently
               favourable. In that character no one feels a deeper interest or a higher pride than
               the writer, who thinks that there is to be found in it, if not so much to adorn human
               life, yet perhaps even more than is fitted to subserve the great interests of
               mankind, than in any other portion of the world. If this sentiment be deemed narrow
               or prejudiced, it must be put to the account<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7726-00000007"/>
               of early education, and that ground will meet with indulgence. With such an opinion,
               however, can it be supposed that the writer could consent to publish a libel upon the
               whole people?</p>
            <p>As a mistake has been committed, the best correction may perhaps be found in an
               honest avowal of its cause.</p>
            <p>It is stated in the preface to the first edition, that the book was written without
               any definite plan—and an intelligent reader would probably have made the same
               observation without the suggestion of the author. There certainly was no design
               either in the plan or execution of the work, of furnishing an estimate of the
               intellectual, moral, or religious character of the people of New-England, and when
               finished, its title was rather inconsiderately adopted at the suggestion of a
               friend.</p>
            <p>It is not known whether there be any precedent for changing the title of a book, yet
               the author has thought proper, in this edition, to retrench a part of it, which is at
               least superfluous.</p>

            <p>THE prefaces to the former editions of the New-England Tale are retained in this, as
               there may yet be those to whom their explanations will be satisfactory. The reason
               alleged in the first for the publication of the book is now rendered void by the
               immense and rapidly increasing mass of "native American literature."</p>
            <p>This Tale might be left to its natural death, or obscurity, overshadowed by fresher
               and superior productions of the same species, but that it derives some claim to
               sufferance from its priority in time.</p>
            <p>Our social has kept pace with our physical development in the last few years. Society
               has been moulded and remoulded, cast and recast, so that the portraiture of thirty
               years since, though bearing no veri-similitude to the present times, has a certain
               value, like that of a picture, however unskilfully wrought, that preserves with truth
               the features and costume of a past period.</p>
            <p>New sects have sprung up, old ones are abated or softened, and a pharisaical, canting
               bigot, of the old orthodoxy of New-England, like the Dame Wilson of our story, would
               talk an unknown tongue to a sister in the communion of the new school, albeit
               evangelical.</p>
            <p>The progress of civilization, and the facilities of communication, have levelled all
               distinctions. There is no village so secluded now as to be surprised by the fashions
               of the town, and scarcely a country-bred lady to be detected by her rusticity. The
               progress in the luxury of dress makes the invective of our Mrs. Convers against the
               extravagance of the 'now-a-days girl' simply ludicrous. The country '<hi rend="i"
               />store,' which perhaps<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7726-00000008"/> received its
               designation from the variety of its commodities, ranging from brooms to ribbons, has
               become the '<hi rend="i"/>shop,' filled, in some cases, by direct importations from
               England and France. No crusade could now be successfully pursued against dancing.
               Even the rustic phrases that characterized the position of our dramatis personæ have
               passed away and are forgotten.—Thus if the coin we offer be neither gold nor silver,
               if it have no intrinsic value, we hope its impress will be an apology for its new
               issue, with those who have a fond or foolish love for the past.</p>
            <p>The additional tales in the volume will at least have the attraction of novelty to
               most of our readers, as they are now, for the first time, resuscitated, after a
               decent interment in the magazines.</p>

                  <p>MR. ELTON was formerly a flourishing trader, or, in rustic phrase, a merchant,
                     in the village of ——. In the early part of his life he had been successful in
                     business; and having a due portion of that mean pride which is gratified by
                     pecuniary superiority, he was careful to appear quite as rich as he was. When
                     he was at the top of fortune's wheel, some of his prying neighbors shrewdly
                     suspected, that the show of his wealth was quite out of proportion to the
                     reality; and their side-glances and prophetic whispers betrayed their contempt
                     of the offensive airs of the purse-proud man.</p>
                  <p>The people in the village of —— were simple in their habits, and economical in
                     their modes of life; and Mr. Elton's occasional indulgence in a showy piece of
                     furniture, or an expensive article of dress for himself or for his wife,<pb
                        n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7726-00000009"/> attracted notice, and, we fear,
                     sometimes provoked envy, even from those who were wiser and much better than he
                     was. So inconsistent are men—and women too—that they often envy a display of
                     which they really despise, and loudly condemn the motive.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Elton neither deserved nor shared the dislike her husband received in full
                     measure. On the contrary, she had the good-will of her neighbors. She never
                     seemed elated by prosperity; and though she occasionally appeared in an
                     expensive Leghorn hat, a merino shawl, or a fine lace, the gentleness and
                     humility of her manners, and the uniform benevolence of her conduct, averted
                     the censure that would otherwise have fallen on her. She had married Mr. Elton
                     when very young, without much consideration, and after a short acquaintance.
                     She had to learn, in the bitter way of experience, that there was no sympathy
                     between them; their hands were indissolubly joined, but their hearts were not
                     related; he was "of the earth, earthy"—she "of the heavens, heavenly." She had
                     that passiveness which, we believe, is exclusively a feminine virtue (if virtue
                     it may be called), and she acquiesced silently and patiently in her unhappy
                     fate, though there was a certain abstractedness in her manner, a secret feeling
                     of indifference and separation from the world, of which she, perhaps, never
                     investigated, certainly never exposed the cause.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Elton's success in business had been rather owing to accidental
                     circumstances, than to his skill or prudence; but his vanity appropriated to
                     himself all the merit of it. He adventured rashly in one speculation after
                     another, and failing in them all, his losses were more rapid than his
                     acquisitions had been. Few persons have virtue enough to retrench their
                     expenses, as their income diminishes; and no virtue, of difficult growth, could
                     be expected from a character where no good seed had ever taken root.</p>
                  <p>The <foreign xml:lang="FRA">morale,</foreign> like the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >physique,</foreign> needs use and exercise to give it strength. Mrs.
                     Elton's had never been thus invigorated. She could not oppose a strong current.
                     She had not energy to avert an evil, though she would have borne patiently any
                     that could have been laid on her. She knew her husband's affairs were
                     embarrassed; she saw him constantly incurring debts, which she knew they had no
                     means of paying; she perceived he was gradually sinking into a vice, which,
                     while it lulls the sense of misery, annihilates the capacity of escaping from
                     it—and yet she silently, and without an effort, acquiesced in his faults. They
                     lived on, as they had lived, keeping an expensive table, and three or four
                     servants, and dressing as usual.</p>
                  <p>This conduct in Mrs. Elton, was the result of habitual passiveness; in Mr.
                     Elton, it was prompted by a vain hope of concealing from his neighbors a truth,
                     that, in spite of his bustling, ostentatious ways, they had known for many
                     months. This is a common delusion. We all know that from the habits of our
                     people in a country town, it is utterly impossible for the most watchful and
                     skilful manœuverer, to keep his pecuniary affairs secret from the keen and
                     quick observation of his neighbors. The expedients practised for concealment
                     are much like that of a little child, who shuts his own eyes, and fancies he
                     has closed those of the spectators; or in their effect upon existing
                     circumstances, may be compared to the action of a frightened woman, who turns
                     her back in a carriage when the horses are leaping over a precipice.</p>
                  <p>It may seem strange, perhaps incredible, that Mrs. Elton, possessing the
                     virtues we have attributed to her, and being a religious woman, should be
                     accessory to such deception, and<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7726-00000010"/> (for
                     we will call "things by their right names") dishonesty. But the wonder will
                     cease if we look around upon the circle of our acquaintance, and observe how
                     few there are among those whom we believe to be Christians, who govern their
                     daily conduct by Christian principles, and regulate their temporal duties by
                     the strict Christian rule. Truly, narrow is the way of perfect integrity, and
                     few there are that walk therein.</p>
                  <p>There are too many who forget that our religion is not like that of the
                     ancients, something set apart from the ordinary concerns of life; the
                     consecrated, not the "daily bread;" a service for the temple and the grove,
                     having its separate class of duties and pleasures; but is "the leaven that
                     leaveneth the whole lump," a spirit to be infused into the common affairs of
                     life. We fear Mrs. Elton was not quite guiltless of this fault. She believed
                     all the Bible teaches. She had long been a member of the church in the town
                     where she lived. She daily read the Scriptures, and daily offered sincere
                     prayers. Certainly the waters of the fountain from whence she drank, had a
                     salutary influence, though they failed to heal all her diseases. She was kind,
                     gentle, and uncomplaining; and sustained, with admirable patience, the growing
                     infirmities and irritating faults of her husband. To her child, she performed
                     her duties wisely, and with an anxious zeal; the result, in part, of uncommon
                     maternal tenderness, and in part, of a painful consciousness of the faults of
                     her own character, and perhaps, of a secret feeling she had left much undone
                     that she ought to do.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Elton, after his pecuniary embarrassments were beyond the hope of
                     extrication, maintained by stratagem the appearance of prosperity for some
                     months, when a violent fever ended his struggle with the tide of fortune that
                     had set against him, and consigned him to that place where there is "no more
                     work nor device." His wife was left quite destitute with her child, then an
                     interesting little girl, a little more than twelve years old. A more energetic
                     mind than Mrs. Elton's might have been discouraged by the troubles which were
                     now set before her in all their extent, and with tenfold aggravation; and she,
                     irresolute, spiritless, and despondent, sunk under them. She had, from nature,
                     a slender constitution; her health declined, and after lingering for some
                     months, she died with resignation, but not without a heart-rending pang at the
                     thought of leaving her child, poor, helpless, and friendless.</p>
                  <p>Little Jane had nursed her mother with fidelity and tenderness, and performed
                     services for her, to which her years seemed hardly adequate, with an efficiency
                     and exactness that surprised all who were prepared to find her a delicately
                     bred and indulged child. She seemed to have inherited nothing from her father
                     but his active mind: from her mother she had derived a pure and gentle spirit;
                     but this would have been quite insufficient to produce the result of such a
                     character as hers, without the aid of her mother's vigilant, and, for the most
                     part, judicious training. In the formation of her child's character, she had
                     been essentially aided by a faithful domestic, who had lived with her for many
                     years, and nursed Jane in her infancy.</p>
                  <p>We know it is common to rail at our domestics. Their independence is certainly
                     often inconvenient to their employers; but, as it is the result of the
                     prosperous condition of all classes in our happy country, it is not right nor
                     wise to complain of it. We believe there are many instances of intelligent and
                     affectionate service, that are rarely equalled, where ignorance and servility
                     mark the lower classes. Mary Hull<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7726-00000011"/> was
                     endowed with a mind of uncommon strength, and an affectionate heart. These were
                     her jewels. She had been <emph>brought up</emph> by a pious mother, and early
                     and zealously embraced the faith of the Methodists. She had the virtues of her
                     station in an eminent degree: practical good sense, industrious, efficient
                     habits, and <emph>handy ways.</emph> She never presumed formally to offer her
                     advice to Mrs. Elton; her instincts seemed to define the line of propriety to
                     her; but she had a way of suggesting hints, of which Mrs. Elton learnt the
                     value by experience. This good woman had been called to a distant place, to
                     attend her dying mother, just before the death of Mrs. Elton; and thus Jane was
                     deprived of an able assistant, and most tender friend, and left to pass through
                     the dismal scene of death, without any other than occasional assistance from
                     her compassionate neighbors.</p>
                  <p>On the day of Mrs. Elton's interment, a concourse of people assembled to listen
                     to the funeral sermon, and to follow to the grave one who had been the object
                     of the envy of some, and of the respect and love of many. Three sisters of Mr.
                     Elton were assembled with their families.—Mrs. Elton had come from a distant
                     part of the country, and had no relatives in ——.</p>
                  <p>Jane's relations wore the decent gravity that became the occasion; but they
                     were of a hard race, and neither the wreck their brother had made, nor the deep
                     grief of the solitary little creature, awakened their pity. They even seemed to
                     shun manifesting towards her the kindness of common sympathy, lest it should be
                     construed into an intention of taking charge of the orphan.</p>
                  <p>Jane lost in the depths of her sufferings, seemed insensible to all external
                     things. Her countenance was of a deathlike paleness, and her features
                     immovable. In the course of the sermon, agreeably to the usage established in
                     such cases, the clergyman made a personal address to her, as the nearest
                     relative and chief mourner. She was utterly unable to rise, as she should have
                     done in compliance with custom; and one of her aunts shocked at the omission of
                     what she considered an essential decorum, took her by the arm, and almost
                     lifted her from her seat. She stood like a statue, her senses seeming to take
                     no cognizance of anything. Not a tear escaped, nor a sigh burst from her
                     breaking heart. The sorrow of childhood is usually noisy, and this mute and
                     motionless grief, in a creature so young, and one that had been so happy,
                     touched every heart.</p>
                  <p>When the services were over, the clergyman supported the trembling frame of the
                     poor child to the place of interment. The coffin was slowly let down into the
                     house appointed for all. Every one who has followed a dear friend to the grave,
                     remembers with shuddering the hollow sound of the first clods that are thrown
                     on the coffin. As they fell heavily, poor Jane shrieked, "oh, mother!" and
                     springing forward, bent over the grave, which, to her, seemed to contain all
                     the world. The sexton, used as he was to pursue his trade amidst the wailings
                     of mourners, saw something peculiar in the misery of the lone child. He dropped
                     the spade, and hastily brushing away the tears that blinded him with the sleeve
                     of his coat, "Why does not some one," he said, "take away the child? it beats
                     all!—her heart's broke!" There was a general bustle in the crowd, and two young
                     ladies, more considerate, or perhaps more tender-hearted, than the rest, kindly
                     passed their arms around her, and led her to her home</p>
                  <p>The clergyman of ——— was one of those who are more zealous for sound doctrine,
                     than benevolent practice: he had chosen on that occasion for his text, "The
                     wages of sin is<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7726-00000012"/> death," and had
                     preached a long sermon in the vain endeavour of elucidating the doctrine of
                     original sin. Clergymen who lose such opportunities of instructing their people
                     in the operations of Providence, and the claims of humanity, ought not to
                     wonder if they grow languid, and selfish, and careless of their most obvious
                     duties. Had this gentleman improved this occasion of illustrating the duty of
                     sympathy, by dwelling on the tenderness of our blessed Lord, when he wept with
                     the bereaved sisters at the grave of Lazarus: had he distilled the essence of
                     those texts, and diffused their gracious influence into his sermon——"Bear ye
                     one another's burthens;" "Weep with those who weep;" "Inasmuch as ye have done
                     it unto one of these, ye have done it unto me:" had this preaching usually been
                     in conformity to the teaching of our Saviour, could the scene have followed,
                     which, as a part of Jane Elton's story must be told.</p>
                  <p>We fear there are many who think there is merit in believing certain doctrines;
                     who, mistaking the true import of that text, "by grace are ye saved," quiet
                     themselves with having, once in their lives, passed through what they deemed
                     conviction and conversion, and from thence believe their salvation is
                     secure.</p>
                  <p>The house, furniture, and other property of Mr. Elton had lain under an
                     attachment for some time previous to Mrs. Elton's death; but the sale had been
                     delayed in consideration of her approaching dissolution. It was now appointed
                     for the next week; and it therefore became necessary that some arrangement
                     should be made for the destitute orphan.</p>
                  <p>The day after the funeral, Jane was sitting in her mother's room, which, in her
                     eyes, was consecrated by her sickness and death; the three aunts met at Mr.
                     Elton's house; she heard the ladies approaching through the adjoining
                     apartment, and hastily taking up her Bible, which she had been trying to read,
                     she drew her little bench behind the curtain of her mother's bed. There is an
                     instinct in childhood, that discerns affection wherever it exists, and shrinks
                     from the coldness of calculating selfishness. In all their adversity, neither
                     Jane, nor her mother, had ever been cheered by a glimmering of kindness from
                     these relatives. Mrs. Elton had founded no expectations on them for her child;
                     but with her usual irresolution, she had shrunk from preparing Jane's mind for
                     the shocks that awaited her.</p>
                  <p>The three sisters were led in by a young woman who had offered to stay with
                     Jane till some arrangement was made for her. In reply to their asking where she
                     was, the girl pointed to the bed. "There," she said, "taking on
                        <emph>despertly.</emph>——A body would think," added she, "that she had lost
                     her uncles and aunts, as well as her father and mother. And she might as well,"
                     (she continued, in a tone low enough not to be heard,) "for any good they will
                     do her."</p>
                  <p>The eldest sister began the conference by saying, "That she trusted it was not
                     expected she should take Jane upon her hands—that she was not so well off as
                     either of her sisters—that to be sure she had no children; but then Mr. Daggett
                     and herself <emph>calculated</emph> to do a great deal for the Foreign
                     Missionary Society; that no longer ago than that morning, Mr. D. and she had
                     agreed to pay the expense of one of the young Cherokees at the school at ——
                     that there was a great work going on in the world, and as long as they had the
                     heart given them to help it, they could not feel it their duty to withdraw any
                     aid for a mere worldly purpose!"</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Convers (the second sister) said that she had not any religion, and she
                     did not mean to pretend to any; that she had ways enough to spend her money
                     without sending it to<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7726-00000013"/> Owyhee, or the
                     Foreign School; that she and her husband had worked hard, and saved all for
                     their children; and now they meant they should make as good a figure as
                     anybody's children in the country. It took a great deal of money, she said, to
                     pay the dancing-master, and the drawing-master, and the music-master; it was
                     quite impossible for her sisters to think how much it took to dress a family of
                     girls genteely. It was not now, as it used to be when we were girls;
                     now-a-days, girls must have merino shawls, and their winter hats, and summer
                     hats, and prunella shoes, and silk stockings;—it was quite impossible to be
                     decent without them. Besides, she added, as she did not live in the same place
                     with Jane, it was not natural she should feel for her. It was her decided
                     opinion, that Jane had better be put out at once, at some place where she could
                     do light work till she was a little used to it; and she would advise, too, to
                     her changing her name; the child was so young she could not care about a name,
                     and she should be much mortified to have it known, in the town of —— that her
                     daughters had a cousin that was a <emph>hired girl.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was something in this harsh counsel which touched Mrs. Wilson's (the
                     younger sister's) pride, though it failed to awaken a sentiment of humanity.
                     She said she desired to be thankful that she had been kept from any such sinful
                     courses as sending her children to a dancing-school; nobody could say she had
                     not done her duty by them; the minister's family was not kept more strict than
                     hers.</p>
                  <p>"No," said Mrs. Convers, "and by all accounts is not more disorderly."</p>
                  <p>"Well, that is not our fault, Mrs. Convers, if we plant and water, we cannot
                     give the increase."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson should have remembered that God does give the increase to those
                     that rightly plant, and faithfully water. But Mrs. Wilson's tongue was familiar
                     with many texts that had never entered her understanding, or <choice>
                        <sic>influanced</sic>
                        <corr>influenced</corr>
                     </choice> her heart.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson continued—"Sister Convers, I feel it to be my duty to warn you—you,
                     the daughter and grand-daughter of worthy divines who abhorred all such sinful
                     practices, that you should own that you send your children to dancing school,
                     astonishes and grieves my spirit. Do you know that Mr. C——, in reporting the
                     awakening in his parish, mentions that not one of the girls that attended
                     dancing school were among the converts, whereas two, who had engaged to attend
                     it, but had received a remarkable warning in a dream, were among the first and
                     brightest?"</p>
                  <p>"I would as soon," she continued, "follow one of my children to the grave, as
                     to see her in that broad road to destruction, which leads through a
                     ball-room."</p>
                  <p>"It is easy enough," replied Mrs. Convers, (adjusting her smart mourning cap at
                     the glass,) "to run down sins we have no fancy for."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson's ready answer was prevented by the entrance of Jane's humble
                     friend, who asked, if the ladies had determined what was to be done with the
                     little girl.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson in her vehemence had quite forgotten the object of their meeting,
                     but now brought back to it, and instigated by a feeling of superiority to Mrs.
                     Convers, and a little nettled by the excuses of Mrs. Daggett, which she thought
                     were meant as a boast of superior piety, she said, that as she had no
                     dancing-masters to pay, and had not "<emph>that</emph> morning agreed" to adopt
                     a Cherokee—she could afford to take Jane for a little while. The child, she
                     said, must not think of depending upon her for life; for though she was a
                     widow, and could do what she was a mind to her with her<pb n="28-29"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000014"/> own, she could not justify herself in taking the
                     children's meat—and she would have added—"to throw it to the dogs,"—but she was
                     interrupted by a person, who, unregarded by the ladies, had taken her seat
                     among them.</p>
                  <p>This was a middle aged woman, whose mind had been unsettled in her youth by
                     misfortunes. Having no mischievous propensities, she was allowed to indulge her
                     vagrant inclinations, in wandering from house to house, and town to town; her
                     stimulated imagination furnishing continual amusement to the curious by her
                     sagacious observations, and unfailing mirth to the young and vulgar, by the
                     fanciful medley in which she arrayed her person. There were some who noticed in
                     her a quickness of feeling that indicated original sensibility, which, perhaps,
                     had been the cause of her sufferings. The dogs of a surly master would
                     sometimes bark at her, because her dress resembled the obnoxious livery of the
                     beggar—a class they had been taught to chase with pharisaical antipathy. But
                     except when her timid nature was alarmed by the onset of dogs, which she always
                     called the devil's servants, crazy Bet found a welcome wherever she went.</p>
                  <p>It is common for persons in her unfortunate circumstances to seek every scene
                     of excitement. The sober, sedate manners of the New England people, and the
                     even tenor of their lives, afford but few of these, and these few are, for the
                     most part, of a serious if not a gloomy character. Wherever there was an
                     awakening, or a camp meeting, crazy Bet was sure to be found. She was often
                     seen by moonlight, wandering in the church-yard, plucking the nettles from the
                     graves, and wreathing the monuments with ground-pine. She would watch for whole
                     nights by the side of a grave in her native village, where twenty years before
                     were deposited the remains of her lover, who was drowned on the day before they
                     were to have been married. She would range the woods, and climb to the very
                     mountain's-top, to get sweet flowers, to scatter over the mound of earth that
                     marked his grave. She would plant rose bushes and lilies there, and when they
                     bloomed, pluck them up, because she said their purity and brightness mocked the
                     decay below.</p>
                  <p>She has been seen, when the sun came over the eastern mountain's brow, and shot
                     its first ray on the grave, to clap her hands, and heard to shout, "I see an
                     angel in the sun, and he saith, 'Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the
                     first resurrection: on such, the second death hath no power; but they shall be
                     priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.'"</p>
                  <p>Poor Bet was sure to follow in every funeral procession, and sometimes she
                     would thrust herself amidst the mourners, and say, "the dead could not rest in
                     their graves, if they were not followed there by one true mourner." She has
                     been seen to spring forward when the men were carelessly placing the coffin in
                     the grave, with the head to the east, and exclaim, "are ye heathens, that ye
                     serve the dead thus? Know ye not, the 'Lord cometh in the east.'" She always
                     lingered behind after the crowd had dispersed, and busily moved and removed the
                     sods; and many a time has she fallen asleep, with her head resting on the
                     new-made grave, for, she said, there was no sleep so quiet as 'where the wicked
                     did not trouble.'</p>
                  <p>The quick eye of crazy Bet detected, through their thin guise, the pride and
                     hypocrisy and selfishness of the sisters. She interrupted Mrs. Wilson as she
                     was concluding her most inappropriate quotation, 'Throw it to the dogs;' said
                     she, 'It is more like taking the prey from the wolf.' She then rose, singing in
                     an under voice,<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7726-00000015"/>
                     <q>

                           <l>Each angry passion far removed,</l>

                  <p>She approached the bed, and withdrawing the curtain, exposed the little
                     sufferer to view. She had laid the open Bible on the pillow, where she had
                     often rested beside her mother, and laying her cheek on it, had fallen asleep.
                     It was open at the 5th chapter of John, which she had so often read to her
                     mother, that she had turned instinctively to it. The page was blistered with
                     her tears.</p>
                  <p>Careless of the future, which to her seemed to admit no light, her exhausted
                     nature had found relief in sleep, at the very moment her aunts were so
                     unfeelingly deciding her fate. Her pale cheek, still wet with her tears, and
                     the deep sadness of a face of uncommon sweetness, would have warmed with
                     compassion any breast that had not been steeled by selfishness.</p>
                  <p>"Shame, shame, upon you!" said the maniac; "has pride turned your hearts to
                     stone, that ye cannot shelter this poor little ewe-lamb in your fold? Ah! ye
                     may spread your branches, like the green bay tree, but the tempest will come,
                     and those who look for you shall not find you; but this little frost-bitten bud
                     shall bloom in the paradise of God for ever and ever."</p>
                  <p>Untying a piece of crape which she had wound around her throat, (for she was
                     never without some badge of mourning,) she stooped and gently wiped the tears
                     from Jane's cheek, saying, in a low tone, "Bottles full of odours, which are
                     the tears of saints; then rising, she carefully closed the curtains, and busied
                     herself for some minutes in pinning them together. She then softly, and on
                     tiptoe, returned to her seat; and taking ing some ivy from her broken
                     straw-bonnet, began twisting it with the crape. "This," said she, "is a weed
                     for Elder Carrol's hat; he lost his wife yesterday, and I have been to the very
                     top of Taghconnick to get him a weed, that shall last fresh as long as his
                     grief. See," added she, and she held it up, laughing, "it has begun to wilt
                     already; it is a true token."</p>
                  <p>She then rose from her seat, and with a quick step, between running and
                     walking, left the room; but returning as suddenly, she said slowly and
                     emphatically, "Offend not this little one; for her angel does stand before my
                     Father. It were better that a mill-stone were hanged about your neck." Then,
                     courtseying to the ground, she left them.</p>
                  <p>Bet's solemn and slow manner of pronouncing this warning, was so different from
                     her usually hurried utterance, that it struck a momentary chill to the hearts
                     of the sisters. Mrs. Daggett was the first to break the silence.</p>
                  <p>"What does she mean?" said she. "Has Jane experienced religion?"</p>
                  <p>"Experienced religion!—no," replied Mrs. Wilson. "How should she? She has not
                     been to a meeting since her mother was first taken sick; and no longer ago than
                     the day after her mother's death, when I talked to her of her corrupt state by
                     nature, and the opposition of her heart, (for I felt it to be my duty, at this
                     peculiar season, to open to her the great truths of religion, and I was
                     faithful to her soul, and did not scruple to declare the whole counsel,) she
                     looked at me as if she was in a dumb stupor. I told her the judgments of an
                     offended God were made manifest towards her in a remarkable manner; and then I
                     put it to her conscience, whether if she was sure her mother had gone where the
                     worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched, she should be reconciled<pb
                        n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7726-00000016"/> ciled to the character of God, and be
                     willing herself to promote his glory, by suffering the like condemnation? She
                     did not reply one word, or give the least symptom of a gracious understanding.
                     But when Mrs. Harvey entered, just as I was concluding, and passed her arm
                     around Jane, and said to her, 'My child, God does not willingly grieve or
                     afflict you, the child sobbed out, 'Oh no! Mrs. Harvey, so my mother told me,
                     and I am sure of it."</p>
                  <p>"No, no," she added, after a moment's hesitation; "this does not look as if
                     Jane had a hope. But, sister Daggett, I wonder you should mind any thing crazy
                     Bet says. She is possessed with as many devils as were sent out of Mary
                     Magdalen."</p>
                  <p>"I don't mind her, Mrs. Wilson; but I know some very good people who say, that
                     many a thing she has foretold has come to pass; and especially in seasons of
                     affliction, they say, she is very busy with the devil."</p>
                  <p>"I don't know how that may be," replied Mrs. Wilson; "but as I mean to do my
                     duty by this child, I don't feel myself touched by Bet's crazy ranting."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Daggett, nettled by her sister's hint, rose, and said, that, as she was
                     going in the afternoon to attend a meeting in a distant part of the town,
                     ("for," said she, "no one can say that distance or weather ever keeps me from
                     my duties,") she had no more time to waste.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Convers' husband drove to the door in a smart gig, and she took leave of
                     her sisters, observing, she was glad the child was going to be so well provided
                     for. As she drove away, crazy Bet, who was standing by the gate, apparently
                     intently reading the destiny of a young girl, in the palm of her hand, fixed
                     her eyes for a moment on Mrs. Convers, and whispered to the girl, "All the good
                     seed that fell on that ground was choked by thorns long ago."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson told Jane's attendant, Sally, to inform her, she might come to her
                     house the next day, and stay there for the present.</p>

                  <p>JANE received the intelligence of her destination without the slightest
                     emotion. The world was "all before her," and she cared not whither led her
                     "mournful way."</p>
                  <p>Happily for her, the humble friend, mentioned in the beginning of her history,
                     Mary Hull, returned on that day, after having performed the last act of filial
                     duty. Jane poured all her sorrows into Mary's bosom, and felt already a degree
                     of relief that she had not believed her condition admitted.</p>
                  <p>Such is the elastic nature of childhood; its moral, like its physical
                     constitution, is subject to the most sudden changes.</p>
                  <p>Mary having assuaged the wounds of her youthful friend with the balm of tender
                     sympathy and just consolation, undertook the painful, but necessary, task of
                     exposing to Jane the evils before her, that she might fortify her against them;
                     that, as she said, being "fore-warned, she might be forearmed."</p>
                  <p>She did not soften the trials of dependence upon a sordid and harsh nature. She
                     told her what demands would be made on her integrity, her patience, and her
                     humility.</p>
                  <p>"But, my child," cried she, "do not be downhearted. There has One 'taken you up
                     who will not leave you, nor forsake you.' 'The fires may be about you, but they
                     will not kindle on you.' Make the Bible your counsellor; you will always find
                     some good word there, that will be a light to you in the darkest night: and do
                     not forget the daily sacrifice of prayer; for, as the priests under the old
                     covenant were nourished by a part of that which they offered, so, when the
                     sacrifice of praise is sent upward by the broken and contrite heart, there is a
                     strength cometh back upon our own souls: blessed be His name, it is what the
                     world cannot give."</p>
                  <p>Mary's advice fell upon a good and honest heart, and we shall see that it
                     brought forth much fruit.</p>
                  <p>The evening was spent in packing Jane's wardrobe, which had been well stocked
                     by her profuse and indulgent parents. Mary had been told too, that the
                     creditors of Mr. Elton would not touch the wearing apparel of his wife. This
                     was, therefore, carefully packed and prepared for removal; and Mary, who with
                     her stock of heavenly wisdom had some worldly prudence, hinted to Jane, that
                     she had better keep her things out of the sight of her craving cousins.</p>
                  <p>Jane took up her mother's Bible, and asked Mary, with a trembling voice, if she
                     thought she might be permitted to take that.</p>
                  <p>"Certainly," replied Mary, "no one will dispute your right to it; it is not
                     like worldly goods, we will not touch the spoils, though we were tempted by
                     more than the 'goodly Babylonish garment, the two hundred shekels of silver,
                     and the wedge of gold' that made Achan to sin."</p>
                  <p>In obedience to the strictest dictates of honesty, Mary forbore from permitting
                     her zeal for Jane's interests to violate the letter of the law. She was so
                     scrupulous, that she<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7726-00000018"/> would not use a
                     family trunk, but took a large cedar chest of her own to pack the clothes
                     in.</p>
                  <p>While they were busily occupied with these preparations, Jane received a note
                     from her aunt, saying, that she advised her to secure some small articles which
                     would never be missed: some of "the spoons, table-linen, her mother's ivory
                     work-box," &amp;c., &amp;c. The note concluded—"As I have undertaken the charge
                     of you for the present, it is but right you should take my advice. There is no
                     doubt my brother's creditors have cheated him a hundred-fold the amount of
                     these things; for, poor man! with all his faults, he was so generous, any body
                     could take him in; besides, though these things might help to pay the expense I
                     must be at in keeping you, they will be a mere nothing divided among so many
                     creditors. I should be the last, child, to advise to any thing unlawful."</p>
                  <p>"Poor woman!" said Mary, to whom Jane had handed the note, and then checking
                     the expression of her disgust at what to her upright mind seemed plain
                     dishonesty—she merely added, "we'll keep on the sure side, Jane; clean hands
                     make light hearts."</p>
                  <p>The next morning arrived, and Mary arose before the dawn, in order to remove
                     Jane early, and save her the pain of witnessing the preparations for the
                     vendue. Jane understood her kind friend's design, and silently acquiesced in
                     it, for she had too much good sense to expose herself to any unnecessary
                     suffering. But when every thing was in readiness, and the moment of departure
                     arrived, she shrunk back from Mary's offered arm, and sinking into a chair,
                     yielded involuntarily to the torrent of her feelings. She looked around upon
                     the room and its furniture as if they were her friends.</p>
                  <p>It has been said by one, who well understands the mysteries ries of feeling,
                     that objects which are silent every where else, have a voice in the home of our
                     childhood. Jane looked for the last time at the bed, where she had often
                     sported about her mother, and rejoiced in her tender caresses—at the curtains,
                     stamped with illustrations of the Jewish history, which had often employed and
                     wearied her ingenuity in comprehending their similitudes—at the footstool on
                     which she had sat beside her mother—and the old family clock, <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"Whose stroke 'twas heaven to hear,</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>Her eye turned to the glass, which now sent back her woe-begone image, and she
                     thought of the time, but a little while past, when elated with that "promised
                     pleasure near," she had there surveyed her form arrayed in her prettiest
                     dress,—now, the rainbow tints had faded into the dark cloud.</p>
                  <p>She rose and walked to the open window, about which she had trained a beautiful
                     honey-suckle. The sun had just risen, and the dew-drops on its leaves sparkled
                     in his rays.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Mary!" said she, "even my honey-suckle seems to weep for me."</p>
                  <p>A robin had built its nest on the vine; and often as she sat watching her
                     sleeping mother, she had been cheered with its sprightly note, and maternal
                     care of its young. She looked to the nest—the birds had flown;—"They too," she
                     exclaimed, "have gone from our home."</p>
                  <p>"No, Jane," replied Mary; "they have been provided with another home; and He
                     who careth for them, will care much more for you."</p>
                  <p>Mary might have quoted (but she was not addicted to any profane works) the
                     beautiful language of a native poet—<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7726-00000019"/>
                     <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"He who from zone to zone</l>

                  <p>"We shall not," she said, "be at your aunt's in time for breakfast; here, tie
                     on your hat, you will need all your strength and courage, and you must not
                     waste any on flowers and birds."</p>
                  <p>Jane obeyed the wise admonition of her friend; and with faltering steps, and
                     without allowing herself time to look again at any thing, hastily passed
                     through the little courtyard in front of their house.</p>
                  <p>The morning was clear and bright; and stimulated by the pure air, and nerved by
                     the counsels Mary suggested as they walked along, Jane entered her new home
                     with a manner that indicated the struggle of her self-respect with her
                     timidity.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps her timidity, appealing to Mrs. Wilson's love of authority, produced a
                     softer feeling than she had before shown to Jane; or perhaps (for scarcely any
                     nature is quite hardened), the forlornness of the child awakened a transient
                     sentiment of compassion,—she took her hand, and told her she was welcome. The
                     children stared at her, as if they had never seen her before, but Jane's
                     down-cast eye, a little clouded by the gathering tears, saved her from feeling
                     the gaze of their vulgar curiosity.</p>
                  <p>Jane, in entering the family of Mrs. Wilson, was introduced to as new a scene
                     as if she had been transported to a foreign country.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson's character might have been originally cast in the same mould with
                     Mr. Elton's, but circumstances had given it a different modification. She had
                     married early in life a man, who, not having energy enough for the exercise of
                     authority, was weak and vain, tenacious of the semblance, and easily cozened by
                     the shadow, while his wife retained the substance. Mrs. Wilson, without having
                     the pride of her nature at all subdued, became artful and trickish; she was
                     sordid and ostentatious; a careful fellow-worker with her husband in the
                     acquisition of their property, she secured to herself all the power and
                     reputation of its outlay. Whenever a contribution was levied for an Education
                     or Tract Society, for Foreign Missions, the Cherokees, or Osages,—Mrs. Wilson
                     accompanied her donation, which on the whole was quite handsome, with a remark,
                     that what she did give, she gave with a willing heart; that women could not
                     command much money, for it was the duty of wives to submit themselves to their
                     husbands. After Mrs. Wilson became sole mistress of her estate, the simple and
                     credulous, who remembered her professions, wondered her gifts were not enlarged
                     with her liberty. But Mrs. Wilson would say that the widow was the prey of the
                     wicked and that her duty to her children prevented her indulging her generous
                     feelings towards those pious objects which lay nearest her heart.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson had fancied herself one of the subjects of an awakening at an early
                     period of her life; had passed through the ordeal of a church-examination with
                     great credit, having depicted in glowing colors the opposition of her natural
                     heart to the decrees, and her subsequent joy in the doctrine of election. She
                     thus assumed the form of godliness without feeling its power. We fear that in
                     those times of excitement, during which many pass from indifference to
                     holiness, and many are converted from sin to righteousness, there are also many
                     who, like Mrs. Wilson, delude themselves and others with vain forms of words,
                     and professions of faith.</p>
                  <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7726-00000020"/>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson was often heard to denounce those who insisted on the necessity of
                     good works, as Pharisees;—she was thankful, she said, that she should not
                     presume to appear before her Judge with any of the "filthy rags of her own
                     righteousness;"—it would be easy getting to heaven if the work in any way
                     depended on ourselves;—any body could "deal justly, love mercy, and walk
                     humbly." How easy it is, we leave to those to determine who have sought to
                     adjust their lives by this divine rule.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson rejected the name of the Pharisee; but the proud, oppressive,
                     bitter spirit of the Jewish bigot was manifest in the complacency with which
                     she regarded her own faith, and the illiberality she cherished towards every
                     person, of every denomination, who did not believe what she believed, and act
                     according to her rule of right. As might be expected, her family was regulated
                     according to "the letter," but the "spirit that giveth life," was not there.
                     Religion was the ostensible object of every domestic arrangement; but you might
                     look in vain for the peace and good will which a voice from heaven proclaimed
                     to be the objects of the mission of our Lord.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson's children produced such fruits as might be expected from her
                     culture. The timid among them had recourse to constant evasion, and to the
                     meanest artifices to hide the violation of laws which they hated; and the
                     bolder were engaged in a continual conflict with the mother, in which rebellion
                     often trampled on authority.</p>
                  <p>Jane had been gently led in the bands of love. She had been taught even more by
                     the example than the precepts of her mother.</p>
                  <p>She had seen her mother bear with meekness the asperity and unreasonableness of
                     her father's temper, and often turn away his wrath with a soft answer.</p>
                  <p>The law of imitation is deeply impressed on our nature. Jane had insensibly
                     fallen into her mother's ways, and had, thus early, acquired a habit of
                     self-command. Mrs. Elton, though, alas, negligent of some of her duties,
                     watched over the expanding character of her child with Christian fidelity.
                     "There she had garnered up her heart." She knew that amiable dispositions were
                     not to be trusted, and she sought to fortify her child's mind with Christian
                     principles. She sowed the seed, and looked with undoubting faith for the
                     promised blessing.</p>
                  <p>"I must soon sleep," she would say to Mary, "but the seed is already springing
                     up. I am sure it will not lack the dews of Heaven; and you, Mary, may live to
                     see, though I shall not, 'first the blade, then the ear, and after that the
                     full corn in the ear.'"</p>
                  <p>Mary had seconded Mrs. Elton's efforts. She looked upon herself as an humble
                     instrument; but she was a most efficient one. She had a rare and remarkable
                     knack at applying rules, so that her life might be called a commentary on the
                     precepts of the Gospel. Mary's practical religion had, sometimes, conveyed a
                     reproach (the only reproach a Christian may indulge in) to Mrs. Wilson, who
                     revenged herself by remarking, that "Mary was indulging in that soul-destroying
                     doctrine of the Methodists—<emph>perfection;</emph>" and then she would add
                     (jogging her foot, a motion that, with her, always indicated a mental parallel,
                     the result of which was, 'I am holier than thou'), "there is no error so fatal,
                     as resting in the duties of the second table." Mrs. Wilson had not learned that
                     the duties of the second table cannot be done, if the others are left undone;
                     the branches must be sustained by<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7726-00000021"/> the
                     trunk; for He, from whose wisdom there is no appeal, has said, "If ye love me,
                     ye will keep my commandments."</p>
                  <p>Happily for our little friend, Mary was not to be removed far from her; an
                     agreeable situation was, unexpectedly, offered to her grateful acceptance.</p>

                  <p>A FEW weeks before the death of Mrs. Elton, a Mr. Lloyd, a Quaker, who was
                     travelling with his wife and infant child, for the benefit of Mrs. Lloyd's
                     health, had stopped at the inn in ——. Mrs. Lloyd was rapidly declining with
                     consumption. On this day she had, as is not unfrequent in the fluctuation of
                     this disease, felt unusually well. Her cough was lulled by the motion of the
                     carriage, and she had requested her husband to permit her to ride further than
                     his prudence would have dictated.</p>
                  <p>The heat and unusual exertion proved too much for her. In the evening she was
                     seized with a hemorrhage, which reduced her so much as to render it unsafe to
                     move her. She faded away quietly, and fell into the arms of death as gently as
                     a leaf falleth from its stem, resigning her spirit in faith to Him who gave
                     it.</p>
                  <p>An extraordinary attachment subsisted between Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd, which had its
                     foundation in the similarity of<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7726-00000022"/> their
                     characters, education, views, and pursuits; and had been nourished by the
                     circumstances that had drawn and kept them together.</p>
                  <p>Three years after their marriage, Mrs. Lloyd gave birth to a girl. This event
                     filled up the measure of their joy. A few weeks after its birth, as Mr. Lloyd
                     took the infant from its mother's bosom, and pressed it fondly to his own, he
                     said, "Rebecca, the promise is to us and our children; the Lord grant that we
                     may train His gift in His nurture and admonition."</p>
                  <p>"Thou mayest, dear Robert; God grant it," Rebecca mournfully replied; "but the
                     way is closed up to me. Do not shudder thus, but prepare thy mind for the 'will
                     of the Lord.' I could have wished to have lived, for thy sake and my little
                     one; but I will not rebel, for I know all is right."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Lloyd hoped his wife was needlessly alarmed; but he found from her
                     physician, that immediately after the birth of the child, some alarming
                     symptoms had appeared, which indicated a hectic. Mrs. Lloyd had begged they
                     might be concealed from her husband, from the generous purpose of saving him,
                     as long as possible, useless anxiety. The disease, however, had taken certain
                     hold, and that morning, after a conversation with her physician, during which
                     her courage had surprised him, she resolved to begin the difficult task of
                     fortifying her husband for the approaching calamity.</p>
                  <p>Spring came on, and its sweet influences penetrated to the sick room of
                     Rebecca. Her health seemed amended, and her spirits refreshed; and when Mr.
                     Lloyd proposed that they should travel, she cheerfully consented. But she
                     cautioned her husband not to be flattered by an apparent amendment, for, said
                     she, "though my wayward disease may be coaxed into a little clemency, it will
                     not spare me."</p>
                  <p>As she prophesied, her sufferings were mitigated; but it was but too manifest
                     that no permanent amendment was to be expected. The disease made very slow
                     progress; one would have thought it shrunk from marring so young and so fair a
                     work. Her spirit, too, enjoyed the freedom and beauty of the country. As they
                     passed up the fertile shores of the Connecticut, Rebecca's benevolent heart
                     glowed with gratitude to the Father of all, at the spectacle of so many of her
                     fellow-creatures enjoying the rich treasures of Providence; cast into a state
                     of society the happiest for their moral improvement, where they had neither the
                     miseries of poverty, nor the temptations of riches. She would raise her eyes to
                     the clear heaven, would look on the "misty mountain's top," and then on the
                     rich meadows through which they were passing, and which were now teeming with
                     the summer's fulness, and would say, "Dear Robert, is there any heart so cold,
                     that it does not melt in this vision of the power and the bounty of the Lord of
                     heaven and earth? Do not sorrow for me, when I am going to a more perfect
                     communion with Him, for I shall see him as he is."</p>
                  <p>From the Connecticut they passed by the romantic road that leads through the
                     plains of West Springfield, Westfield, &amp;c. There is no part of our country,
                     abundant as it is in the charms of nature, more lavishly adorned with romantic
                     scenery. The carriage slowly traced its way on the side of a mountain, from
                     which the imprisoned road had with difficulty been won; a noisy stream dashed
                     impetuously along at their left, and as they ascended the mountain, they still
                     heard it before them, leaping from rock to rock, now almost losing itself in
                     the deep pathway it had made, and then rushing with increased violence over its
                     stony bed.</p>
                  <p>"This young stream," said Mr. Lloyd, "reminds one of<pb n="46-47"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000023"/> the turbulence of headstrong childhood: I can
                     hardly believe it to be the same we admired, so leisurely winding its peaceful
                     way into the bosom of the Connecticut."</p>
                  <p>"Thou likest the sobriety of maturity," replied Rebecca; "but I confess that
                     there is something delightful to my imagination in the elastic bound of this
                     infant stream; it reminds me of the joy of untamed spirits, and undiminished
                     strength."</p>
                  <p>The travellers' attention was withdrawn from the wild scene before them to the
                     appearance of the heavens, by their coachman, who observed that "never in his
                     days had he seen clouds make so fast; it was not," he said, "five minutes since
                     the first speck rose above the hill before them, and now there was not enough
                     blue sky for a man to swear by:—but," added he, looking with a lengthening
                     visage to what he thought an interminable hill before them, "the lightning will
                     be saved the trouble of coming down to us, for if my poor beasts ever get us to
                     the top, we may reach up and take it."</p>
                  <p>Having reached the top of the next acclivity, they perceived by the roadside, a
                     log hut; over the door was a slab, with a rude and mysterious painting (which
                     had been meant for a foaming can and a plate of gingerbread), explained
                     underneath by "cake and beer for sale." This did not look very inviting, but it
                     promised a better shelter from the rain, for the invalid, than the carriage
                     could afford. Mr. Lloyd opened the door, and lifted his wife over a rivulet,
                     which actually ran between the sill of the house and the floor-planks that had
                     not originally been long enough for the dimensions of the apartment.</p>
                  <p>The mistress of the mansion, a fat middle-aged woman, who sat with a baby in
                     her arms at a round table, at which there were four other children eating from
                     a pewter dish placed in the middle, rose, and having ejected the eldest boy
                     from a chair by a very unceremonious slap, offered it to Mrs. Lloyd, and
                     resumed her seat, quietly finishing her meal. Her husband, a ruddy,
                     good-natured, hardy-looking mountaineer, had had the misfortune, by some
                     accident in his childhood, to lose the use of both his legs, which were now
                     ingeniously folded into the same chair on which he sat. He turned to the
                     coachman, who, having secured his horses, had just entered, and smiling at his
                     consternation, said, "Why, friend, you look scare't, pretty pokerish weather,
                     to be sure, but then we don't mind it up here;" then turning to the child next
                     him, who, in gazing at the strangers, had dropped half the food she was
                     conveying to her mouth, he said,—"<emph>Desdemony,</emph> don't scatter the
                     'tatoes so."—"But last week," he continued, resuming his address to the
                     coachman, "there was the most <emph>tedious</emph> spell of weather I have sen
                     the week before last thanksgiving, when my wife and I went down into the lower
                     part of Becket, to hear Deacon Hollisler's funeral <emph>sarmont</emph>—Don't
                     you remember, Tempy, that musical fellow that was there?—'I don't see,' says
                     he, 'the use of the minister preaching up so much about hell-fire,' says he,
                     'it is a very good doctrine,' says he, 'to preach down on Connecticut River,
                     but,' says he, 'I should not think it would frighten any body in such a cold
                     place as Becket.'"</p>
                  <p>A bright flash, that seemed to fire the heavens, succeeded by a tremendous clap
                     of thunder, which made the hovel tremble, terrified all the group, except the
                     fearless speaker.</p>
                  <p>"A pretty smart flash to be sure; but, as I was saying, it is nothing to that
                     storm we had last week.—<emph>Valorus,</emph> pull that hat out of the window,
                     so the gentleman can see.—There, sir," said he, "just look at that big maple
                     tree, that was blown down, if it had come one yard nearer my house, it would
                     have crushed it to atoms. Ah, this is a nice place<pb n="48-49"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000024"/> as you will find any where," he continued (for
                     he saw Mr. Lloyd was listening attentively to him), "to bring up boys; it makes
                     them hardy and spirited, to live here with the wind roaring about them, and the
                     thunder rattling right over their heads: why they don't mind it any more than
                     my woman's spinning-wheel, which, to be sure, makes a dumb noise
                     sometimes."</p>
                  <p>Our travellers were not a little amused with the humour of this man, who had a
                     natural philosophy that a stoic might have envied. "Friend," said Mr. Lloyd,
                     "you have a singular fancy about names; what may be the name of that chubby
                     little girl who is playing with my wife's fan?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir, I am a little notional about names; that girl, sir, I call <hi
                        rend="i"/>Octavy, and that lazy little dog that stands by her, is <hi
                        rend="i"/>Rodolphus."</p>
                  <p>"And this baby," said Mr. Lloyd, kindly giving the astonished little fellow his
                     watch chain to play with, "this must be Vespasian or Agricola."</p>
                  <p>"No, sir, no; I met with a disappointment about that boy's name—what you may
                     call a slip between the cup and the lip—when he was born, the women asked me
                     what I meant to call him? I told them I did not mean to be in any hurry; for
                     you must know, sir, the way I get my names, I buy a book of one of them pedlers
                     that are going over the mountain with tin-ware and brooms, and books and
                     pamphlets, and one notion and another; that is, I don't buy out and out, but we
                     make a swap; they take some of my wooden dishes, and let me have the
                        <emph>vally</emph> in books; for you must know I am a great reader, and mean
                     all my children shall have larning too, though it is pretty tough scratching
                     for it. Well, sir, as I was saying about this boy, I found a name just to hit
                     my fancy, for I can pretty generally suit myself; the name was Sophronius; but
                     just about that time, as the deuce would have it, my wife's father died, and
                     the gin'ral had been a very gin'rous man to us, and so to compliment the old
                     gentleman, I concluded to call him Solomon Wheeler."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Lloyd smiled, and throwing a dollar into the baby's lap, said, "There is
                     something, my little fellow, to make up for your loss." The sight and the gift
                     of a silver dollar produced a considerable sensation among the mountaineers.
                     The children gathered round the baby to examine the splendid favour. The mother
                     said, "The child was not old enough to make its manners to the gentleman, but
                     he was as much beholden to him as if he could." The father only seemed
                     insensible, and contented himself with remarking, with his usual happy
                     nonchalance, that he "guessed it was easier getting money down country, than it
                     was up on the hills."</p>
                  <p>"Very true, my friend," replied Mr. Lloyd, "and I should like to know how you
                     support your family here. You do not appear to have any farm."</p>
                  <p>"No, Sir." replied the man, laughing, "it would puzzle me, with my legs, to
                     take care of a farm; but then I always say, that as long as a man has his wits
                     he has something to work with. This is a pretty cold sappy soil up here, but we
                     make out to raise all our sauce,<ref rend="super" target="#note_001"
                        xml:id="return_001">*</ref>
                      and enough besides to fat a couple of pigs on; then, Sir, as you see,
                     my woman and I keep a stock of cake and beer, and tansy bitters—a nice trade
                     for a cold stomach; there is considerable travel on the road, and people get
                     considerable dry by the time they get up here, and we find it a good business;
                     and then I turn wooden bowls and dishes, and go out peddling once or twice
                     a-year; and there is not an old woman, or a young one either,
                     <note place="foot" xml:id="note_001">

                     <pb n="50-51"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000025"/> for the matter of that, but I can coax them to
                     buy a dish or two; I take my pay in provisions or clothing; all the cash I get
                     is by the beer and cake: and now Sir, though I say it, that may be should not
                     say it, there is not a more independent man in the town of Becket than I am,
                     though there is them that's more forehanded; but I pay my minister's tax and my
                     school-tax as reg'lar as any of them."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Lloyd admired the ingenuity and contentment of this man, his enjoyment of
                     the privilege, the "glorious privilege," of every New-England man, of "being
                     independent." But his pleasure was somewhat abated by an appearance of a want
                     of neatness and order, which would have contributed so much to the comfort of
                     the family, and which, being a Quaker, he deemed essential to it.</p>
                  <p>He looked at the little stream of water we have mentioned, and which the rain
                     had already swollen so much that it seemed to threaten an inundation of the
                     house; and observing that neither the complexion of the floor nor of the
                     children seemed to have been benefited by its proximity, he remarked to the man
                     that he "should think a person of his ingenuity would have contrived some mode
                     of turning the stream."</p>
                  <p>"Why, yes, Sir," said the man, "I suppose I might, for I have got a book that
                     treats upon hydrostatics and them things; but I'm calculating to build in the
                     fall, and so I think we may as well musquash along till then."</p>
                  <p>"To build! Do explain to me how that is to be done?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, Sir," said he, taking a box from the shelf behind him, which had a hole
                     in the centre of the top, through which the money was passed in, but afforded
                     no facility for withdrawing it, "my woman and I agreed to save all the cash we
                     could get for two years, and I should not be afraid to venture there is thirty
                     dollars there, Sir. The neighbors in these parts are very kind to a poor man;
                     one will draw the timber, and another will saw the boards, and they will all
                     come to raising, and bring their own spirits into the bargain. Oh, Sir, it must
                     be a poor shack that can't make a turn to get a house over his head."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Lloyd took ten dollars from his pocket-book, and slipping it into the gap,
                     said, "There is a small sum, my friend, and I wish it may be so expended as to
                     give to thy new dwelling such conveniences as will enable thy wife to keep it
                     neat. It will help on the trade, too; for depend upon it, there is nothing
                     makes a house look so inviting to a traveller as cleanliness and order."</p>
                  <p>Our mountaineer's indifference was vanquished by so valuable a donation. "You
                     are the most gin'rous man, Sir," said he, "that ever journeyed this way; and if
                     I don't remember your advice, you may say there is no such thing as gratitude
                     upon earth."</p>
                  <p>By this time the rain had subsided, the clouds were rolling over, the merry
                     notes of the birds sallying from their shelters, welcomed the returning rays of
                     the sun, and the deep, unclouded azure in the west promised a delightful
                     afternoon.</p>
                  <p>The travellers took a kind leave of the grateful cottagers, and as they drove
                     away—"Tempy," said the husband, "if the days of miracles weren't quite entirely
                     gone by, I should think we had 'entertained angels unawares.'"</p>
                  <p>"I think you might better say," replied the good woman, "that the angels have
                     entertained us; any how, that sick lady will be an angel before long; she looks
                     as good and as beautiful as one now."</p>
                  <p>It was on the evening of this day, that Mr. and Mrs.<pb n="52-53"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000026"/> Lloyd arrived at the inn in the village of ——,
                     which, as we have before stated, was the scene where her excellent and innocent
                     life closed. She expressed a desire that she might not be removed; she wished
                     not to have the peace of her mind interrupted by any unnecessary agitation.
                     Whenever she felt herself a little better, she would pass a part of the day in
                     riding. Never did any one in the full flush of health enjoy more than she, from
                     communion with her Heavenly Father, through the visible creation. She read with
                     understanding the revelations of his goodness, in the varied expressions of
                     nature's beautiful face.</p>
                  <p>"Do you know," said she to her husband, "that I prefer the narrow vales of the
                     Housatonic to the broader lands of the Connecticut? It certainly matters little
                     where our dust is laid, if it be consecrated by Him who is the 'resurrection
                     and the life;' but I derive a pleasure which I could not have conceived of,
                     from the expectation of having my body repose in this still valley, under the
                     shadow of that beautiful hill."</p>
                  <p>"I, too, prefer this scenery," said Mr. Lloyd, seeking to turn the
                     conversation, for he could not yet but contemplate with dread, what his
                     courageous wife spoke of with a tone of cheerfulness. "I prefer it, because it
                     has a more domestic aspect. There is, too, a more perfect and intimate union of
                     the sublime and beautiful. These mountains that surround us, and are so near to
                     us on every side, seem to me like natural barriers, by which the Father has
                     secured for His children the gardens He has planted for them by the river's
                     side."</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said Rebecca, "and methinks they inclose a sanctuary, a temple, from
                     which the brightness of His presence is never withdrawn. Look," said she, as
                     the carriage passed over a hill that rose above the valley, and was a crown of
                     beauty to it; "look, how gracefully and modestly that beautiful stream winds
                     along under the broad shadows of those trees and clustering vines, as if it
                     sought to hide the beauty that sparkles so brightly whenever a beam of light
                     touches it. Oh! my Rebecca," said she, turning fondly to her child, "I could
                     wish thy path led along these still waters, far from the stormy waves of the
                     rude world—far from its 'vanities and vexation of spirit.'"</p>
                  <p>"If that is thy wish, my love," said her husband, looking earnestly at her, "it
                     shall be a law to me."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Lloyd's tranquillity had been swept away for a moment, by the rush of
                     thought that was produced by casting her mind forward to the destiny of her
                     child; but it was only for a moment. Hers was the trust of a mind long and
                     thoroughly disciplined by Christian principles. Her face resumed its wonted
                     repose, as she said, "Dear Robert, I have no wish but to leave all to thy
                     discretion, under the guidance of the Lord."</p>
                  <p>It cannot be deemed strange that Mr. Lloyd should have felt a particular
                     interest in scenes for which his wife had expressed such a partiality. He
                     looked upon them with much the same feeling that the sight of a person awakens
                     who has been loved by a departed friend. They seemed to have a sympathy for
                     him; and he lingered at —— without forming any plan for the future, till he was
                     roused from his inactivity by hearing the sale of Mr. Elton's property spoken
                     of. He had passed the place with Rebecca, and they had together admired its
                     secluded and picturesque situation. The house stood at a little distance from
                     the road, more than half hid by two patriarchal elms. Behind the house, the
                     grounds descended gradually to the Housatonic, whose nourishing dews kept them
                     arrayed in beautiful verdure.<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7726-00000027"/> On the
                     opposite side of the river, and from its very margin, rose a precipitous
                     mountain, with its rich garniture of beach, maple, and linden; tree surmounting
                     tree, and the images of all sent back by the clear mirror below.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Lloyd had no family ties to Philadelphia. He preferred a country life; not
                     supinely to dream away existence, but he hoped there to cultivate and employ a
                     "talent for doing good;" that talent which a noble adventurer declared he most
                     valued, and which, though there is a field for its exercise wherever any
                     members of the human family are, he compassed sea and land to find new worlds
                     in which to expend it.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Lloyd purchased the place and furniture, precisely as it had been left on
                     the morning of the sale by Jane and her friend Mary.</p>

                  <p>THE excellent character of Mary Hull had been spoken of to Mr. Lloyd by his
                     landlady, and he was convinced that she was precisely the person to whom he
                     should be satisfied to commit the superintendence of his family. Accordingly,
                     on the evening of the sale, he sent a messenger to Mrs. Wilson's with the
                     following note:—</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>"Robert Lloyd, having purchased the place of the late Mr. Elton, would be
                        glad to engage Mary Hull to take charge of his family. Wages, and all other
                        matters, shall be arranged to her satisfaction. He takes the liberty to send
                        by the bearer, for Jane Elton, a work-box, dressing-glass, and a few other
                        small articles, for which he has no use, and which must have to her a value
                        from association with her late residence."</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson had no notion that any right could be prior to hers in her house.
                     She took the note from the servant,<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7726-00000028"/>
                     and, notwithstanding he ventured to say he believed it was not meant for her,
                     she read it first with no very satisfied air, and then turning to one of the
                     children, she told her to call Mary Hull to her. The servant placed the things
                     on the table, and left the room.</p>
                  <p>"So," said she to Jane, who was looking at her for some explanation of the
                     sudden apparition of the work-box, &amp;c.—"So, Miss, you have seen fit to
                     disobey the first order I took the trouble to give you. I should like to know
                     how you dared to leave these things after my positive orders."</p>
                  <p>"I did not understand your note, ma'am, to contain positive orders; and Mary
                     and I did not think it was quite right to take the things."</p>
                  <p>"Right! pretty judges of right to be sure. She a hired girl, and a Methodist
                     into the bargain. I don't know how she dares to judge over my head; and you,
                     miss, I tell you once for all, I allow no child in my house to judge of right
                     and wrong; children have no reason, and they ought to be very thankful, when
                     they fall into the hands of those that are capable of judging for them. Here,"
                     said she to Mary, who now entered in obedience to her summons; "here is a
                     proposal of a place for you, from that Quaker that buried his wife last week. I
                     suppose you call yourself your own mistress, and you can do as you like about
                     it; but as you are yet a young woman, Mary Hull, and this man is a young
                     widower, and nobody knows who, I should think it a great risk for you to live
                     with him; for, if nothing worse comes of it, you may be sure there is not a
                     person in this town that won't think you are trying to get him for a
                     husband."</p>
                  <p>Mary was highly gratified with the thought of returning to the place where she
                     had passed a large and happy portion of her life, and she did not hesitate to
                     say, that "she should not stand so much in her own light as to refuse so
                     excellent a place; that from all she had heard said of Mr. Lloyd, he was a
                     gentleman far above her condition in life; and therefore she thought no person
                     would be silly enough to suppose she took the place from so foolish a design as
                     Mrs. Wilson suggested; and she should take care that her conduct should give no
                     occasion for reproach."</p>
                  <p>"Well," said Mrs. Wilson, chagrined that her counsel was not compulsory, "it
                     does amaze me to see how some people strain at a gnat, and swallow a
                     camel."</p>
                  <p>Mary did not condescend to notice this remark, but proceeded quietly to remove
                     the articles Mr. Lloyd had sent, which she succeeded in doing, without any
                     farther remark from Mrs. Wilson, who prudently restrained the exercise of her
                     authority while there was one present independent enough to oppose its
                     current.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Mary," said Jane, when they were alone, "how glad I am you are going to
                     live with such a good man; how happy you must be! And I too, Mary;" and she
                     hastily brushed away a tear, "I am; at least I should be very happy when I have
                     such a kind friend as you are so near to me."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes, dear Jane, try to be happy; this foolish aunt of yours will try you
                     like the fire, but I look to see you come out of it as gold from the furnace:
                     keep up a good heart, my child, it is a long lane that never turns."</p>
                  <p>The friends separated, but not till Mary had, with her usual caution, carefully
                     packed away Jane's new treasures, saying, as she did it, "that it was best to
                     put temptation out of sight."</p>
                  <p>Mary's plain and neat appearance, and her ingenuous, sensible countenance,
                     commended her at once to Mr. Lloyd's<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7726-00000029"/>
                     favor, and she entered immediately upon the duties of her new and responsible
                     situation.</p>
                  <p>We must now introduce those who are willing to go farther with us in the
                     history of Jane Elton, to the family of Mrs. Wilson, where they will see she
                     had a school for the discipline of Christian character.</p>
                  <p>"Jane," said Mrs. Wilson to her on the morning after Mary's departure, "you
                     know, child, the trouble and expense of taking you upon my hands is very great;
                     but it did not seem suitable that, being my brother's daughter, you should be
                     put out at present: you must remember, child, that I am at liberty to send you
                     away at any time, whereas, as you will always be in debt to me, you can never
                     be at liberty to go when you choose. It is a great trial to me to take you, but
                     the consciousness of doing my duty, and more than my duty to you, supports me
                     under it. Now as to what I expect from you:—in the first place, my word must be
                     your law; you must not hesitate to do any thing that I require of you; never
                     think of asking a reason for what I command—it is very troublesome and
                     unreasonable to do so. Visiting, you must give up entirely; I allow my children
                     to waste none of their time in company: meetings I shall wish you to attend
                     when you have not work to do at home; for I do not wish you to neglect the
                     means of grace, though I am sensible that your heart must be changed before
                     they can do you any good. You must help Martha do the ironing, and assist
                     Elvira with the clear starching and other matters; Nancy will want your aid
                     about the beds; Sally is but young, and requires more care than I can give her,
                     for my time is at present chiefly spent in instructing the young converts; and
                     therefore I shall look to you to take the charge of Sally; and I expect you to
                     do the mending and making for David when he comes home; the other boys will
                     want now and then a stitch or two; and, in short, miss, (and she increased the
                     asperity of her tone, for she thought Jane's growing gravity indicated
                     incipient rebellion,) you will be ready to do every thing that is wanted of
                     you."</p>
                  <p>Jane was summoning resolution to reply, when both her and her aunt's attention
                     was called to a rustling at the window, and crazy Bet thrust her head in—</p>
                  <p>"Go on," said she, "and fill up the measure of your iniquities; load her with
                     burthens heavy and grievous to be borne, and do not touch them with one of your
                     fingers.—There, Jane," said she, throwing her a bunch of carnations, "I have
                     just come from the quarterly meeting, and I stopped as I came past your house,
                     and picked these, for I thought their bright colors would be a temptation to
                     the Quaker. And I thought too," said she, laughing, "there should be something
                     to send up a sweet smelling savour from the altar where there are no deeds of
                     mercy laid."</p>
                  <p>"Out of my yard instantly, you dirty beggar!" said Mrs. Wilson.</p>
                  <p>Bet turned, but not quickening her step, and went away, singing, "Glory, glory,
                     hallelujah."</p>
                  <p>"Aunt," said Jane, "do not mind the poor creature. She does not mean to offend
                     you. I believe she feels for me; for she has been sheltered many a time from
                     the cold and the storms in our house."</p>
                  <p>"Don't give yourself the least uneasiness, miss. I am not to be disturbed by a
                     crazy woman; but I do not see what occasion there is for her feeling for you.
                     You have not yet answered me."</p>
                  <p>"I have no answer to make, ma'am," replied Jane, meekly, "but that I shall do
                     my best to content you. I am very<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7726-00000030"/>
                     young, and not much used to work, and I may have been too kindly dealt with;
                     but that is all over now."</p>
                  <p>"Do you mean, miss, to say, that I shan't treat you kindly?"</p>
                  <p>"No, aunt, but I meant——excuse me, if I meant any thing wrong."</p>
                  <p>"I did expect, miss, to hear some thankfulness expressed."</p>
                  <p>"I do, ma'am, feel grateful, that I have a shelter over my head; what more I
                     have to be grateful for, time must determine."</p>
                  <p>There was a dignity in Jane's manner, that, with the spirit of the reply,
                     taught Mrs. Wilson that she had, in her niece, a very different subject to deal
                     with from her own wilful and trickish children. "Well, Miss Jane, I shall
                     expect no haughty airs in my house, and you will please now to tell the girls
                     to be ready to go with me to the afternoon conference,<ref rend="super"

                      and prepare yourself to go also. One more thing I have to say to you,
                     you must never look to me for any clothing; that cunning Mary has packed away
                     enough to last you fifty years. With all her Methodism, I will trust her to
                     feather your nest, and her own too."</p>

                  </note>
                  <p>"Alas!" thought Jane, as she went to execute her aunt's commission, "what good
                     does it do my poor aunt to go to conference?" Perhaps this question would not
                     have occurred to many girls of thirteen; but Jane had been accustomed to scan
                     the motives of her conduct, and to watch for the fruit. The aid extended to our
                     helpless orphan by her pharisaical aunt, reminds us of the "right of asylum"
                     afforded by the ancients to the offenders who were allowed to take shelter in
                     the temples of their gods, and suffered to perish there.</p>
                  <p>She found the girls very much indisposed to the afternoon meeting. Martha said
                     she "would not go to hear Deacon Barton's everlasting prayers; she had heard so
                     many of them, she knew them all by heart."</p>
                  <p>Elvira had just got possession, by stealth, of a new novel; that species of
                     reading being absolutely prohibited in Mrs. Wilson's house, she had crept up to
                     the garret, and was promising herself a long afternoon of stolen pleasure. "Oh,
                     Jane," said she, "why can't you go down and tell mother you can't find me. Just
                     tell her, you guess I have gone down to Miss Banker's, to inquire whether the
                     tracts have come; that's a good thought;" and she was resuming her book, when
                     seeing Jane did not move, she added, "I'll do as much for you any time."</p>
                  <p>"I shall never wish you to do as much for me, Elvira."</p>
                  <p>"I do not think it is so very much, just to go down stairs; besides, Jane," she
                     added, imperiously, "Mother says, you must do whatever we ask you to."</p>
                  <p>Elvira was so habituated to deceit, that it never occurred to her, that the
                     falsehood was the difficult part of the errand to Jane; and when Jane said,
                     "Cousin Elvira, I will do whatever is reasonable for you, and no more; any
                     thing that is true, I will tell your mother for you," Elvira laughed in
                     derision.</p>
                  <p>"Pooh, Jane, you have brought your strict notions to a poor market. It was easy
                     enough to get along with the truth with your mother, because she would let you
                     have your own way on all occasions; but I can tell you, disguises are the only
                     wear in our camp!"</p>
                  <p>"I shall not use them, Elvira. I should dread their being stripped off."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, not at all. Mother seldom takes the trouble to inquire into it; and if she
                     does, now and then, by accident,<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7726-00000031"/>
                     detect it, the storm soon blows over. She has caught me in many a white lie,
                     and black one too, and she has not been half so angry as when I have torn my
                     frock, or lost a glove. Why, child, if you are going to fight your battles with
                     mother with plain truth, you will find yourself without shield or buckler."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, Elvira!" replied Jane, smiling, <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"That's no battle, ev'ry body knows,</l>
                           <l>Where one side only gives the blows."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>"That's true enough, Jane. Well, if you will not help me off from the
                     conference, I must go. Sweet Vivaldi," said she, kissing her book, and
                     carefully hiding it in a dark corner of the garret, "must I part with
                     thee?"</p>
                  <p>"One would think," said Jane, "you were parting with your lover."</p>
                  <p>"I am, my dear. I always fancy, when I read a novel, that I am the heroine, and
                     the hero is one of my favourites; and then I realize it all, and it appears so
                     natural."</p>
                  <p>Elvira was not, at heart, an ill-natured girl; but having a weak understanding,
                     and rather a fearful, unresisting temper, she had been driven by her mother's
                     mode of treatment into the practice of deceit; and she being the weaker party,
                     used in her warfare as many arts as a savage practises towards a civilized
                     enemy. A small stock of original invention may be worked up into a vast deal of
                     cunning. Elvira had been sent one quarter to a distant boarding-school, where
                     her name had attracted a young lady, whose head had been turned by
                     love-stories. They had formed a league of eternal friendship, which might have
                     a six months' duration; and Elvira had returned to her home, at the age of
                     sixteen, with a farrago of romance superadded to her home-bred duplicity.</p>
                  <p>Martha was two years older than her sister, and more like her mother: violent
                     and self-willed, she openly resisted her mother's authority, whenever it
                     opposed her wishes. From such companions, Jane soon found she had nothing to
                     expect of improvement or pleasure; but, though it may seem quite incredible to
                     some, she was not unhappy. The very labour her aunt imposed on her was
                     converted into a blessing, for it occupied her mind, and saved her from
                     brooding on the happy past, or the unhappy present. She now found exercise for
                     the domestic talents Mary had so skilfully cultivated. Even the unrelenting
                     Mrs. Wilson was once heard to say, with some apparent pleasure, that "Jane was
                     gifted at all sorts of work." Her dexterous hand was often put in requisition
                     by her idle and slatternly cousins, and their favour was sometimes won by her
                     kind offices. But more than all, and above all, as a source of contentment and
                     cheerfulness—better far than ever was boasted of perennial springs, or "Amreeta
                     cups of immortality"—was Jane's unfailing habit of regulating her daily life by
                     the sacred rules of our blessed Lord. She would steal from her bed at the dawn
                     of day, when the songs of the birds were interpreting the stillness of nature,
                     and beauty and fragrance breathing incense to the Maker, and join her devotions
                     to the choral praise. At this hour she studied the word of truth and life, and
                     a holy beam of light fell from it on her path through the day. Her pleasures at
                     this social period of her life were almost all solitary, except when she was
                     indulged in a visit to Mary, whose eye was continually watching over her with
                     maternal kindness. The gayety of her childhood had been so sadly checked by the
                     change of her fortunes, that her countenance had taken rather a serious and
                     reserved cast. Mr. Lloyd's benevolent feelings were awakened by her appearance;
                     and Mary, whose<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7726-00000032"/> chief delight was in
                     expatiating on the character of her favourite, took care to confirm his
                     favourable impressions, by setting in the broadest light her former felicity,
                     her present trials, and her patience in tribulation.</p>
                  <p>Mary had orders to leave the furniture in a little room that had formerly been
                     assigned to Jane, precisely as she left it, and to tell Jane that it was still
                     called, and should be considered her room.</p>
                  <p>"And that beautiful honeysuckle, Jane," said Mr. Lloyd to her, "which thy
                     tasteful hand has so carefully trained about the window, is still thine."</p>
                  <p>These, and many other instances of delicate attention from Mr. Lloyd, saved her
                     from the feeling of forlornness that she might otherwise have suffered.</p>

                  <p>A FEW months after Jane entered her aunt's family, an unusual commotion had
                     been produced in the village of —— by an event of rare occurrence. This was no
                     less than the arrival of a dancing-master, and the issuing of proposals for a
                     dancing-school.</p>
                  <p>This was regarded by some very zealous persons as a <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >ruse de guerre</foreign> of the old Adversary, which, if not successfully
                     opposed, would end in the establishment of his kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The plan of the disciple of Vestris, was to establish a chain of
                     dancing-schools from one extremity of the country to the other; and this was
                     looked upon as a mine which would be sprung to the certain destruction of every
                     thing that was 'virtuous and of good report.' Some clergymen denounced the
                     impending sin from their pulpits. One said, that he had searched the Bible from
                     Genesis to Revelation, and as he could not find a text that expressly rebuked
                     that enormity, he was confirmed in a previous opinion that it was included in
                     all general denunciations of sin! he said that dancing was<pb n="66-67"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000033"/> one of the most offensive of all the rites of
                     those savage nations that were under the immediate and <emph>visible</emph>
                     government of the prince of this world; and finally, he referred them to the
                     church documents, those precious records of the piety, and wisdom, and
                     faithfulness of their ancestors; and they would there find a rule which
                     prohibited any church member from "frequenting, or being present at, a ball, or
                     dance, or frolic, or any such assembly of Satan," and they would moreover find
                     that such transgressions had been repeatedly punished by expulsion from the
                     church, and exclusion from all christian ordinances. Some of this gentleman's
                     brethren contented themselves by using their influence in private advice and
                     remonstrance; and a few said they could not see the sin nor the danger of the
                     young people's indulging, with moderation, in a healthful exercise and innocent
                     recreation adapted to their season of life; that what the moral and pious Locke
                     had strenuously advocated, and the excellent Watts approved, it did not become
                     them to frown upon; but they should use their efforts in restraining the young
                     people within the bounds of moderation.</p>
                  <p>The result was, that our dancing-master obtained a few schools and one in the
                     village which enjoyed the privilege of Mrs. Wilson's light. She, filled with
                     alarm, 'lifted up her voice and spared not.' Some of her warmest admirers
                     thought her clamor had more of valor in it than discretion.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding the violence of the opposition, and perhaps aided by it, the
                     dancing-school was at length fairly established, and some of the elderly
                     matrons of the village, who had considered dances as the orgies of Satan, were
                     heard to confess that, when properly regulated, they might furnish an amusement
                     not altogether unsuited to youth, and that they did not, in point of propriety,
                     suffer by a comparison with the romps, forfeits, and cushion-dances of
                        <emph>their</emph> younger days.</p>
                  <p>At Mrs. Wilson's instance, two new weekly meetings were appointed, on the same
                     evenings with the dancing-school; the one to be a conference in the presence of
                     the young people, and the other a catechetical lecture for them. These her
                     daughters were compelled to attend, in spite of the bold and turbulent
                     opposition of Martha, and the well-concerted artifices of Elvira.</p>
                  <p>Elvira expressed her surprise at Jane's patience under the new dispensation.
                     "To be sure, Jane," she said, "you have not the trial that I have, about the
                     dancing-school, for a poor girl can't expect such accomplishments.—I do so long
                     to dance! It was in the mazy dance Edward Montreville first fell in love with
                     Selina;—but then these odious—these hateful meetings! Oh, I have certainly a
                        <emph>natural</emph> antipathy to them; you do not always have to attend
                     them; mother is ready enough to let you off, when there is any hard job to be
                     done in the family;—well, much as I hate work, I had rather work than go to
                     meeting. Tell me honestly, Jane, would not you like to learn to dance, if you
                     were not obliged to wear deep mourning, and could afford to pay for it?"</p>
                  <p>Jane, all used as she was to the coarseness of her cousins, would sometimes
                     feel the colour come unbidden to her cheeks, and she felt them glow as she
                     replied, "I learned to dance, Elvira, during the year I spent at Mrs. Benson's
                     boarding-school."</p>
                  <p>"La, is it possible? I never heard you say a word about it."</p>
                  <p>"No," said Jane; "many things have happened to me that you never heard me say a
                     word about."</p>
                  <p>"Oh! I dare say, Miss Jane. Every body knows your<pb n="68-69"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000034"/> cold, reserved disposition. My sensibility would
                     destroy me, if I did not permit it to flow out into a sympathizing bosom."</p>
                  <p>"But now, Jane," said she, shutting the door, and lowering her voice, "I have
                     hit upon a capital plan to cheat mother. There is to be a little ball to-night,
                     after the school; and I have promised Edward Erskine to go with him to it. For
                     once, Jane, be generous, and lend me a helping-hand. In the first place, to get
                     rid of the meeting, I am going to put a flannel round my throat, to tell my
                     mother it is very sore, and I have a head-ache; and then I shall go to bed; but
                     as soon as she is well out of the house, I shall get up and dress me, and wind
                     that pretty wreath of yours, which I'm sure you will lend me, around my head,
                     and meet Erskine just at the pear-tree, at the end of the garden. Then, as to
                     the return, you know you told mother you could not go to meeting, because you
                     was going to stay with old Phillis, and I just heard the doctor say, he did not
                     believe she would live the night through. This is clear luck, what mother would
                     call providential. At any rate, you know, if she should not be any worse, you
                     can sit up till 12 o'clock, and I will just tap at Phillis's bed-room window,
                     and you won't refuse, Jane, to slip the bolt of the outside door for me."</p>
                  <p>Jane told her she could not take part in her projects; but Elvira, trusting to
                     the impulse of her cousin's good-nature, adhered to her plan.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson was not, on this occasion, so keen-eyed as usual. She had, that
                     very day, received proposals of marriage from a broken merchant; and though she
                     had no idea of hazarding her estates and liberty, she was a good deal fluttered
                     with what she would fain have believed to be a compliment to her personal
                     charms. Every thing succeeded to Elvira's most sanguine expectations. Her
                     mother went to the conference. Elvira, arrayed in all the finery her own
                     wardrobe supplied, and crowned with Jane's wreath, went off to meet her
                     expecting gallant, leaving Jane by the bedside of Phillis; and there the sweet
                     girl kindly watched alone, till after the return of the family from the
                     conference, till after the bell had summoned the household to the evening
                     prayer, and till after the last lingering sound of fastening doors, windows,
                     &amp;c., had died away.</p>
                  <p>The poor old invalid was really in the last extremity; her breathing grew
                     shorter and more interrupted; her eyes assumed a fearful stare and glassiness.
                     Jane's fortitude forsook her, and she ventured to call her aunt, who had but
                     just entered the room, when the poor creature expired.</p>
                  <p>In the last struggle she grasped Jane's hand; and as her fingers released their
                     hold, and the arm fell beside her, Jane raised it up, and gently laying it
                     across her body, and retaining the hand for a moment in her own, she said,
                     "Poor Phillis! how much hard work you have done with this hand, and how many
                     kindnesses for me. Your troubles are all over now."</p>
                  <p>"You take upon you to say a great deal, Jane," replied her aunt. "Phillis did
                     not give me satisfying evidence of a saving faith."</p>
                  <p>"But," said Jane, as if she did not quite comprehend the import of her aunt's
                     remark, "Phillis was very faithful over her little."</p>
                  <p>"That's nothing to the purpose, Jane," answered Mrs. Wilson.</p>
                  <p>Jane made no reply, unless the tear she dropped on her old friend might be
                     deemed one, and Mrs. Wilson added,</p>
                  <p>"Now, child, you must get the things together, to lay her out." Then saying,
                     that Phillis's sickness had been a bill of<pb n="70-71"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000035"/> cost to her, and quite overlooking her long life
                     of patient and profitable service, she gave the most sordid directions as to
                     the selection of provisions for the last wants of the poor menial. Jane went
                     out of the room to execute her orders.</p>
                  <p>She had scarcely gone, when Mrs. Wilson heard the window carefully raised, and
                     some one said, "Here I am, Jane; go softly and slip the bolt of the west door,
                     and don't for the world wake the old lady." By any brighter light than the dim
                     night lamp that was burning on the hearth, Elvira could not have mistaken her
                     dark harsh-visaged mother for her fair cousin. A single glance revealed the
                     truth to Mrs. Wilson. The moonbeams were playing on the wreath of flowers, and
                     Edward Erskine, who was known as the ringleader of the ball-faction, stood
                     beside Elvira. She smothered her rage for a few moments, and creeping softly to
                     the passage, opened the door, and admitted the rebel, who followed her to
                     Phillis's room, saying, "Oh, Jane, you are a dear good soul for once. I have
                     had an ecstatic time. Never try to persuade me not to play off a good trick on
                     mother." By this time they had arrived at Phillis's room, where Jane had just
                     entered with a candle in her hand.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson turned to her child, who stood confounded with the sudden
                     detection. "I have caught you," said she, almost bursting with rage; "caught
                     you both!" Then seizing the wreath of flowers, which she seemed to look upon as
                     the hoisted flag of successful rebellion, she threw it on the floor, and
                     crushing it with her foot, she grasped the terrified girl, and pushed her so
                     violently that she fell on the cold body of the lifeless woman: "and you,
                     viper!" continued the furious creature, turning to Jane, "is this my reward for
                     warming you in my bosom? You, with your smooth, hypocritical face, teaching my
                     child to deceive and abuse me. But you shall have your reward. You shall see
                     whether I am to be browbeaten by a dependent child in my own house."</p>
                  <p>Jane had often seen her aunt angry, but she had never witnessed such passion as
                     this, and she was for a moment confounded; but like a delicate plant that bends
                     to the ground before a sudden gust of wind, and then is as erect as ever, she
                     turned to Mrs. Wilson, and said, "Ma'am, I have never deceived, or aided others
                     to deceive you."</p>
                  <p>"I verily believe you lie!" replied her aunt, in a tone of undiminished
                     fury.</p>
                  <p>Jane looked to her cousin, who had recoiled from the cold body of Phillis, and
                     sat in sullen silence on a trunk at the foot of the bed,—"Elvira," said she,
                     "you will do me the justice to tell your mother I had no part in your
                     deception." But Elvira, well pleased to have any portion of the storm averted
                     from her own head, had not generosity enough to interpose the truth. She
                     therefore compromised with her conscience, and merely said, "Jane knew I was
                     going."</p>
                  <p>"I was sure of it,—I was sure of it; I always knew she was an artful jade;
                     'still waters run deep;' but she shall be exposed; the mask shall be stripped
                     from the hypocrite."</p>
                  <p>"Aunt," said Jane, in a voice so sweet, so composed, that it sounded like the
                     breath of music following the howlings of an enraged animal; "Aunt, we are in
                     the chamber of death; and in a little time you, and I, and all of us, shall be
                     as this poor creature; as you will then wish your soul to be lightened of all
                     injustice—spare the innocent now; you know I never deceived you; Elvira knows
                     it: I am willing to bear any thing it pleases God to lay upon me, but I cannot
                     have my good name taken, it is all that remains to me."</p>
                  <p>This appeal checked Mrs. Wilson for a moment; she would have replied, but she
                     was interrupted by two colored<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7726-00000036"/> women,
                     whom she had sent for, to perform the last offices for Phillis. She restrained
                     her passion, gave them the necessary directions, and withdrew to her own room,
                     where, we doubt not, she was followed by the rebukes of her conscience; for
                     however neglected and stifled, its 'still, small voice' will be heard in
                     darkness and solitude.</p>
                  <p>It may seem strange, that Mrs. Wilson should have manifested such anxiety to
                     throw the blame of this affair on Jane; but however a parent may seek, by every
                     flattering unction vanity can devise, to evade the truth, the misconduct of a
                     child will convey a reproach, and reflect dishonor on the author of its
                     existence.</p>
                  <p>Jane and Elvira crept to their beds without exchanging a single word. Elvira
                     felt some shame at her own meanness; but levity and selfishness always
                     prevailed in her mind, and she soon lost all consciousness of realities, and
                     visions of dances and music and moonlight floated in her brain; sometimes 'a
                     change came o'er the spirit of her dream,' and she shrunk from a violent grasp,
                     and felt the icy touch of death; and wherever she turned, a ray from her
                     cousin's mild blue eye fell upon her, and she could not escape from its silent
                     reproach. The mother and the daughter might both have envied the repose of the
                     solitary abused orphan, who possessed 'a peace they could not trouble.' She
                     soon lost all memory of her aunt's rage and her cousin's injustice, and sunk
                     into quiet slumbers. In her dream she saw her mother tenderly smiling on her;
                     and heard again and again the last words of the old woman: "the Lord bless you,
                     Miss Jane! the Lord will bless you, for your kindness to old Phillis."</p>
                  <p>If Mrs. Wilson had not been blinded by self-love, she might have learnt an
                     invaluable lesson from the melancholy results of her own mal-government; but
                     she preferred incurring ring every evil, to the relinquishment of one of the
                     prerogatives of power. Her children, denied the appropriate pleasures of youth,
                     were driven to sins of a much deeper dye than those which Mrs. Wilson sought to
                     avoid could have had, even in her eyes; for surely the very worst effects that
                     ever were attributed to dancing, or to romance-reading, cannot equal the secret
                     dislike of a parent's authority, the risings of the heart against a parent's
                     tyranny, and the falsehood and meanness that weakness always will employ in the
                     evasion of power; and than which nothing will more certainly taint every thing
                     that is pure in the character.</p>
                  <p>The cool reflection of the morning pointed out to Mrs. Wilson, as the most
                     discreet, the very line of conduct justice would have dictated. She knew she
                     could not accuse Jane, without exposing Elvira, and besides, she did not care
                     to have it known that her sagacity had been outwitted by these children.
                     Therefore, though she appeared at breakfast more sulky and unreasonable than
                     usual, she took no notice of the transactions of the preceding night, and they
                     remained secret to all but the actors in them; except that we have reason to
                     believe, from Mr. Lloyd's increased attention to Jane, shortly after, that they
                     had been faithfully transmitted to him by Mary Hull, the balm of whose sympathy
                     it cannot be deemed wonderful our little solitary should seek.</p>

                  <p>THERE is nothing in New England so eagerly sought for, or so highly prized by
                     all classes of people, as the advantages of education. A farmer and his wife
                     will deny themselves all other benefits that might result from the gains that
                     have accrued to them from a summer of self-denial and toil, to give their
                     children the <emph>privilege</emph> of a grammar-school during the winter. The
                     public, or as they are called, the <emph>town-schools,</emph> are open to the
                     child of the poorest laborer. As knowledge is one of the best helps and most
                     certain securities to virtue, we doubtless owe a great portion of the morality
                     of this blessed region, where there are no dark corners of ignorance, to these
                     wise institutions of our pious ancestors.</p>
                  <p>In the fall subsequent to the events we have recorded, a school had been opened
                     in the village of ——, of a higher and more expensive order, than is common in a
                     country town. Every mouth was filled with praises of the new teacher, and with
                     promises and expectations of the knowledge to be derived from this newly opened
                     fountain; all was bustle and preparation among the young companions of Martha
                     and Elvira for the school; for Martha, though beyond the usual school-going
                     age, was to complete her education at the new seminary.</p>
                  <p>The dancing-school had passed without a sigh of regret from Jane; but now she
                     felt severely her privation. Her watchful friend, Mary Hull, remarked the
                     melancholy look that was unheeded at her aunt's; and she inquired of Jane, "Why
                     she was so downcast?"</p>
                  <p>"Ah, Mary!" she replied, "it is a long time since I have felt the merry spirit
                     which the wise man says, is 'medicine to the heart.'"</p>
                  <p>"That's true, Jane; but then there's nobody, that is, there's nobody that has
                     so little reason for it as you have, that has a more cheerful look."</p>
                  <p>"I have great reason to be cheerful, Mary, in token of gratitude for my kind
                     friends here; and," added she, taking Mr. Lloyd's infant, who playfully
                     extended her arms to her, "you and I are too young, Rebecca, to be very sad."
                     The child felt the tear that dewed the cheek to which she was pressed, and
                     looking into Jane's face, with instinctive sympathy, burst into tears. Mr.
                     Lloyd entered at this moment, and Jane hastily replacing the child in Mary
                     Hull's lap, and tying on her hat, bade them farewell.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Lloyd asked for some explanation. Mary believed nothing particular had
                     happened. "But," she said, "the poor girl's spirit wearies with the life she
                     leads; it's a <emph>chore</emph> to live with Mrs. Wilson—a great change from a
                     home and mother, to such a work-house and such a task-woman."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Lloyd had often regretted, that it was so little in his power to benefit
                     Jane. The school occurred to him; and as nothing was more improbable than that
                     Mrs. Wilson would, herself, incur the expense of Jane's attendance, he
                     consulted with Mary as to the best mode of doing it himself, without<pb
                        n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7726-00000038"/> provoking Mrs. Wilson's opposition, or
                     offending her pride. A few days after, when the agent for the school presented
                     the subscription list to Mrs. Wilson for her signature, she saw there, to her
                     utter astonishment, Jane Elton's name. The agent handed her an explanatory note
                     from Mr. Lloyd, in which he said, "that as it had been customary to send one
                     person from the house he now occupied to the 'subscription school,' he had
                     taken the liberty to continue the custom. He hoped the measure would meet with
                     Mrs. Wilson's approbation, without which it could not go into effect."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson, at first, said it was impossible; she could not spare Jane; but
                     afterwards, she consented to take it into consideration. The moment the man had
                     shut the door, she turned to Jane, and misunderstanding the flush of pleasure
                     that brightened her usually pale face, she exclaimed, "And so, Miss, this is
                     one of your plans to slip your neck out of the yoke of duty."</p>
                  <p>Jane said she had nothing to do with the plan; but she trusted her aunt would
                     not oblige her to lose such a golden opportunity of advantage. Mrs. Wilson made
                     various objections, and Jane skilfully obviated them all. At last she said,
                     "There would be a piece of linen to make up for David, and that put it quite
                     out of the question, for," said she, "I shall not take the girls from their
                     studies; and even you, Miss Jane, will probably have the grace to think my time
                     more precious than yours."</p>
                  <p>"Well, aunt," said Jane, with a smile so sweet, that even Mrs. Wilson could not
                     entirely resist its influence, "if I will get the linen made by witch or fairy,
                     may I go?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, yes," replied her aunt; "as you cannot get it made without witches or
                     fairies, I may safely say you may."</p>
                  <p>Jane's reliance was on kindness more potent than magic; and that very evening,
                     with the light-bounding step of hope, she went to her friend Mary's, where,
                     after having made her acknowledgments to Mr. Lloyd with the grace of
                     earnestness and sincerity, she revealed to Mary the only obstacle that now
                     opposed her wishes. Mary at once, as Jane expected, offered to make the linen
                     for her; and Jane, affectionately thanking her, said, she was sure her aunt
                     would be satisfied, for she had often heard her say, "Mary Hull was the best
                     needlewoman in the county."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson had seen Jane so uniformly flexible and submissive to her wilful
                     administration, and in matters she deemed of vastly more consequence than six
                     months' schooling, that she was all astonishment to behold her now so
                     persevering in her resolution to accomplish her purpose. But Jane's and Mrs.
                     Wilson's estimate of the importance of any given object was very different. The
                     same fortitude that enabled Jane to bear, silently and patiently, the
                     "oppressor's wrong," nerved her courage in the attainment of a good end.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson had no longer any pretence to oppose Jane's wishes; and the
                     following day she took her place, with her cousins, at Mr. Evertson's school.
                     Her education had been very much advanced for her years; so that, though four
                     years younger than Martha Wilson, she was, after a very careful examination by
                     the teacher, classed with her. This was a severe mortification to Martha's
                     pride; she seemed to feel her cousin's equality an insult to herself, and when
                     she reported the circumstance to her mother, she said, she believed it was all
                     owing to Jane's soft answers and pretty face; or "may be the quaker, who takes
                     such a mighty fancy to Jane, has bribed Mr. Evertson."</p>
                  <p>"Very likely, very likely," answered her mother. "It seems as if every body
                     took that child's part against us."</p>
                  <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7726-00000039"/>
                  <p>Jane, once more placed on even ground with her companions, was like a spring
                     relieved from a pressure. She entered on her new pursuits with a vigor that
                     baffled the mean attempts of the family at home to impede or hinder her course.
                     She was not a genius, but she had that eager assiduity, that "patient
                     attention," to which the greatest of philosophers attributed the success which
                     has been the envy and admiration of the world. There was a perpetual sunshine
                     in her face, that delighted her patron. He had thought nothing could be more
                     interesting than Jane's pensive, dejected expression; but he now felt, that it
                     was beautiful as well as natural for the young plant to expand its leaves to
                     the bright rays of the sun, and to rejoice in its beams. Mary Hull was heard to
                     say, quite as often as the beauty of the expression would justify, "the Lord be
                     thanked, Jane once more wears the cheerfulness of countenance that betokens a
                     heart in prosperity."</p>
                  <p>Double duties were laid on Jane at home, but she won her way through them. The
                     strict rule of her aunt's house did not allow her to "watch with the
                     constellations," but she "made acquaintance with the gray dawn," and learnt by
                     "employing them well," (the mode recommended by Elizabeth Smith,) the value of
                     minutes as well as hours. The bad envied her progress, the stupid were amazed
                     at it, and the generous delighted with it. She went, rejoicing on her way, far
                     before her cousins, who, stung by her manifest superiority, made unwonted
                     exertions; and Martha might have fairly competed with her for the prizes that
                     were to be given, had she not often been confused and obstructed by the
                     perversities of her temper.</p>
                  <p>The winter and the spring winged their rapid flight. The end of the term, which
                     was to close with an exhibition, approached proached. The note of busy
                     preparation was heard in every dwelling in the village of ——. We doubt if the
                     expectation of the tournament at Ashby de la Zouche excited a greater sensation
                     among knights-templars, Norman lords, and Saxon 'churls,' than the anticipation
                     of the exhibition produced upon the young people of ——. Labor and skill were
                     employed and exhausted in preparations for the event. One day was allotted for
                     the examination of the scholars, and the distribution of prizes for the
                        <emph>exhibition,</emph> during which the young men and boys were to display
                     those powers that were developing for the pulpit, and the bar, and the
                     political harangue. The young ladies were with obvious and singular propriety
                     excluded from any part in the exhibition, except that on the first drawing
                        <emph>aside,</emph> (for they did not know enough of the scenic art to draw
                        <emph>up</emph> the curtain,) the prize composition was to be read by the
                     writer of it.</p>
                  <p>The old and the young seemed alike interested in promoting the glories of the
                     day. The part of a king, from one of Miss Moore's Sacred Dramas, was to be
                     enacted, and there was a general assembly of the girls of the village to fit
                     his royal trappings. A purple shawl was converted by a little girl of ready
                     invention into a royal robe of Tyrian dye. The crown blazed with jewelry, which
                     to too curious scrutiny appeared to be not diamonds, but paste; not gold, but
                     gold-leaf, and gold beads; of which fashionable New England necklace, as
                     tradition goes, there were not less than sixty strings, lent for the occasion
                     by the kind old ladies of the village. An antiquated belle who had once
                     flourished in the capital, completed the decoration of the crown by four
                     nodding ostrich plumes, whose 'bend did certainly awe the world' of ——. There
                     might have been some want of congruity in the regalia,<pb n="80-81"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000040"/> but this was not marked by the critics of ——, as
                     not one of the republican audience had ever seen a <emph>real crown.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>A meeting was called of the trustees of the school, and the meeting house (for
                     thus in the land of the Puritans the churches are still named,) was assigned as
                     the place of exhibition. In order not to invade the seriousness of the
                     sanctuary, the pieces to be spoken were all to be of a moral or religious
                     character. Instrumental music, notwithstanding the celebrations of Independence
                     in the same holy place were pleaded as a precedent, was rigorously forbidden.
                     The arrangements were made according to these decrees, from which there was no
                     appeal, and neither, as usually happens with inevitable evils, was there much
                     dissatisfaction. One of the boys remarked, that he wondered the deacons (three
                     of the trustees were deacons), did not stop the birds from singing, and the sun
                     from shining, and all such gay sounds and sights. Oh that those, who throw a
                     pall over the innocent pleasures of life, and give, in the eye of the young, to
                     religion a dark and gloomy aspect, would learn some lessons of theology from
                     the joyous light of the sun, and the merry carol of the birds!</p>
                  <p>A floor was laid over the tops of the pews, which was covered by a carpet lent
                     by the kind Mr. Lloyd. A chair, a present from Queen Anne to the first
                     missionary to the Housatonic Indians, and which, like some other royal gifts,
                     had cost more than it came to, in its journey from the coast to the mountainous
                     interior, furnished a very respectable throne, less mutable than some that have
                     been filled by real kings, for it remained a fixture in the middle of the
                     stage, while kings were deposed and kingdoms overthrown. Curtains, of divers
                     colors and figures, were drawn in a cunningly devised manner, from one end of
                     the church to the other.</p>
                  <p>The day of <emph>examination</emph> came, and our deserving young heroine was
                     crowned with honours, which she merited so well, and bore so meekly, that she
                     had the sympathy of the whole school—except that (for the truth must be told)
                     of her envious cousins. When the prizes for arithmetic, grammar, geography,
                     history, and philosophy were, one after another, in obedience to the award of
                     the examiners, delivered to Jane by her gratified master, Martha Wilson burst
                     into tears of spite and mortification, and Elvira whispered to the young lady
                     next her, "She may have her triumph now, but I will have one worth a hundred
                     prizes to-morrow, for I am sure that my composition will be preferred to
                     hers."</p>
                  <p>To add the zest of curiosity and surprise to the exhibition, it had been
                     determined that the writer of the successful piece should not be known till the
                     withdrawing of the curtain disclosed the secret. The long expected day arrived.
                     One would have thought, from the wagons and chaises that poured in from the
                     neighbouring towns, that a cattle show, or a hanging, or some such
                     "merry-making matter," was going on in the village of ——. The church was filled
                     at an early hour; and pews, aisles, and galleries crowded as we have seen a
                     less holy place at the first appearance of a foreign actor. The teacher and the
                     clergyman were in the pulpit; the scholars ranged on benches at the opposite
                     extremities of the stage; the crowd was hushed into reverent stillness while
                     the clergyman commenced the exercises of the day by an appropriate prayer. The
                     curtains were hardly closed, before they were again withdrawn, and the eager
                     eyes of the assembly fell on Elvira. A shadow of disappointment might have been
                     seen flitting across Mr. Lloyd's face at this moment, while Mary Hull, who sat
                     in a corner of the gallery, half rose from her seat, sat down again, tied and
                     untied her bonnet<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7726-00000041"/> net, and, in short,
                     manifested indubitable signs of disappointment and vexation; signs, that in
                     more charitable eyes than Mrs. Wilson's certainly would have gone against the
                     obnoxious doctrine of "perfection." Elvira was seated on the throne,
                     ambitiously arrayed in a bright scarlet Canton crape frock, and a white
                     sarcenet scarf fantastically thrown over her shoulders. Her hair, in imitation
                     of some favourite heroine, flowed in ringlets over her neck, excepting a single
                     braid, with which, as she fancied, "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">à la
                        Grecque,</foreign>" she had encompassed her brow; and, to add to this
                     confusion of the classical and the pastoral orders, instead of the crescent of
                     Diana in the model, she had bound her braid with blue glass beads.</p>
                  <p>"Who is that? who is that?" was whispered from one to another.</p>
                  <p>"The rich widow Wilson's daughter," the strangers were answered.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson, whose maternal pride was swollen by the consciousness of triumph
                     over Jane, nodded and whispered to all within her hearing, "My daughter, sir—my
                     daughter, ma'am; you see by the bill, the prize composition is to be spoken by
                     the writer of it."</p>
                  <p>Elvira, rose and advanced. She had requested that she might speak instead of
                     reading her piece, and she spouted it with all the airs and graces of a
                     self-elected heroine. When she dropped her courtesy, and returned to her
                     companions, her usually high colour was heightened by the pride of success, and
                     the pleasure of display. Some were heard to say, "She is a beauty;" while
                     others shook their heads, and observed, "The young lady must have great talents
                     to write such a piece, but she looked too bold to please them."</p>
                  <p>Before the busy hum of comment had died away, an old man, with a bald head, a
                     keen eye, and a very good-humoured face, rose and said, "he would make bold to
                     speak a word; bashfulness was suitable to youth, but was not necessary to gray
                     hairs: he was kind o' loath to spoil a young body's pleasure, but he must own
                     he did not like to see so much flourish in borrowed plumes; that, if he read
                     the notice right, the young woman was to speak a piece of her own framing; he
                     had no fault to find with the speaking; she spoke as smart as a lawyer; but he
                     knew them words as well as the catechism, and if the schoolmaster or the
                     minister would please to walk to his house, which was hard by, they might read
                     them out of an old Boston newspaper, that his woman, who had been dead ten
                     years come Independence, had pasted up by the side of his bed to keep off the
                     rheumatis."</p>
                  <p>The old man sat down; and Mr. Evertson, who had all along been a little
                     suspicious of foul play, begged the patience of the audience, while he himself
                     could make the necessary comparison. Mrs. Wilson, conscious of the possession
                     of a file of old Boston papers, and well knowing the plagiary was but too
                     probable, fidgeted from one side of the pew to the other; and the
                     conscience-stricken girl, on the pretence of being seized with a violent
                     toothache, left the church.</p>
                  <p>The teacher soon returned, and was very sorry to be obliged to say, that the
                     result of the investigation had been unfavourable to the young lady's
                     integrity, as the piece had, undoubtedly, been copied, verbatim, from the
                     original essay in the Boston paper.</p>
                  <p>"He hoped his school would suffer no discredit from the fault of an individual.
                     He should now, though the young lady had remonstrated against being brought
                     forward under such circumstances, insist on the composition being read which
                     had been pronounced next best to Miss Wilson's, and<pb n="84-85"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000042"/> which, he could assure the audience, was,
                     unquestionably, original."</p>
                  <p>The curtain was once more withdrawn, and discovered Jane seated on the throne,
                     looking like the "meek usurper," reluctant to receive the greatness that was
                     thrust upon her. She presented a striking contrast to the deposed sovereign.
                     She was dressed in a plain black silk frock, and a neatly plaited muslin
                     vandyke; her rich light brown hair was parted on her forehead, and confined by
                     a handsome comb, around which one of her young friends had twisted an "od'rous
                     chaplet of sweet summer buds." She advanced with so embarrassed an air, that
                     even Mary Hull thought her triumph cost more than it was worth. As she unrolled
                     the scroll she held in her hand, she ventured once to raise her eyes; she saw
                     but one face among all the multitude—the approving, encouraging smile of her
                     kind patron met her timid glance, and emboldened her to proceed, which she did,
                     in a low and faltering voice, that certainly lent no grace, but the grace of
                     modesty, to the composition. The subject was gratitude, and the remarks, made
                     on the virtue, were such as could only come from one whose heart was warmed by
                     its glow. Mr. Lloyd felt the delicate praise. Mrs. Wilson affected to
                     appropriate it to herself. She whispered to her next neighbour, "It is easy to
                     write about gratitude; but I am sure her conduct is unthankful enough."</p>
                  <p>As Jane returned to her seat, her face brightened with the relief of having got
                     through. Edward Erskine exclaimed to the young man next him, "By Jove, it is
                     the most elegant composition I ever heard from a girl. Jane Elton has certainly
                     grown very handsome."</p>
                  <p>"Yes," replied his friend; "I always thought her pretty, but you prefer her
                     cousin."</p>
                  <p>"I did prefer her cousin," answered Erskine; "but I never noticed Jane much
                     before; she is but a child, and she has always looked so pale and so sad since
                     the change in her family. You know I have no fancy for solemn looks. Elvira is
                     certainly handsome—very handsome; she is a cheating little devil; but, for all
                     that, she is gay, and spirited, and amusing. It is enough to make one give
                     one's self to little artifices and deceits to live with such a stern, churlish
                     woman as Mrs. Wilson. The girl has infinite ingenuity in cheating her mother,
                     and her pretty face covers a multitude of faults."</p>
                  <p>"So I should think," replied his friend, "from the character you have given
                     her. You will hardly applaud the deceits that have led to the disgrace of this
                     morning."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no!" answered Erskine; "but I am sorry for her mortification."</p>
                  <p>The exhibition proceeded; but as our heroine had no further concern with it,
                     neither have we; except to say, that it was equally honourable to the preceptor
                     and pupils. The paraphernalia of the king was exceedingly admired, and some
                     were heard to observe (very justly), that they did not believe Solomon, in all
                     his glory, was arrayed like him!</p>
                  <p>Jane's situation, at her aunt's, was rendered more painful than ever, from the
                     events of the school and the exhibition. Mrs. Wilson treated her with every
                     species of vexatious unkindness. In vain Jane tried, by her usefulness to her
                     aunt to win her favour, and by the most patient obedience to her unreasonable
                     commands, by silent uncomplaining submission, to soothe her into kindness. It
                     was all in vain; her aunt was more oppressive than ever, Martha more rude, and
                     Elvira more tormenting. It was not hearing her called "the just," that provoked
                     their hatred; but it was the keen and most disagreeable feeling of
                     self-reproach that stung them, when the light of her goodness fell upon their
                     evil deeds: it was the "daily beauty of her life that made them ugly."</p>

                  <p>JANE hoped for some favourable change in her condition, or some slight
                     alleviation of it, from the visit of David Wilson, who had just arrived from
                     college, to pass a six-weeks' vacation with his family. At first, he seemed to
                     admire his cousin; and partly to gratify a passing fancy, and partly from
                     opposition to his mother and sisters, he treated her with particular attention.
                     Jane was grateful, and returned his kindness with frankness and affection. But
                     she was soon obliged, by the freedom of his manners, to treat him with reserve.
                     His pride was wounded, and he joined the family league against her. He was a
                     headstrong youth of eighteen; his passions had been curbed by the authority of
                     his mother, but never tamed; and now that he was beyond her reach, he was
                     continually falling into some excess; almost always in disgrace at college, and
                     never in favour.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Lloyd was made acquainted with the embarrassments in Jane's condition, by
                     Mary Hull. He would have rejoiced to have offered Jane a home, but he had no
                     right to interfere; he was a stranger, and he weir knew that Mrs. Wilson would
                     not consent to any arrangement that would deprive her of Jane's ill-requited
                     services,—such services as money could not purchase.</p>
                  <p>It was, too, about this period, that Mr. Lloyd went, for the first time, to
                     visit Philadelphia. Jane had passed a day of unusual exertion, and just at the
                     close of it she obtained her aunt's reluctant leave to pay a visit to Mary
                     Hull. It was a soft summer evening: the valley reposed in deep shadow; the sun
                     was sinking behind the western mountains, tinging the light clouds with a
                     smiling farewell ray, and his last beams lingering on the summits of the
                     eastern mountain, as if "parting were sweet sorrow." Jane's spirits rose
                     elastic, as she breathed the open air; she felt like one who has just issued
                     from a close, pent-up, sick room, and inspires the fresh pure breath of
                     morning; she was gayly tripping along, sending an involuntary response to the
                     last notes of the birds that were loitering on "bush and brake," when Edward
                     Erskine joined her; she had often seen him at her aunt's, but, regarding him as
                     the companion of her cousins, she had scarcely noticed him, or had been noticed
                     by him. He joined her, saying, "It is almost too late to be abroad without a
                     companion."</p>
                  <p>"I am used," replied Jane, "to be without a companion, and I do not need
                     one."</p>
                  <p>"But, I hope you do not object to one? It would be one of the miseries of human
                     life, to see such a girl as Jane Elton walking alone, and not be permitted to
                     join her."</p>
                  <p>"Sir?" said Jane, confounded by Edward's unexpected gallantry.</p>
                  <p>Abashed by her simplicity, he replied, "that he was going to walk, and should
                     be very happy to attend her."</p>
                  <p>Jane felt kindness, though she knew not how to receive<pb n="88-89"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000044"/> gallantry. She thanked him, and they walked on
                     together. When Edward parted from her, he wondered he had never noticed before
                     how very interesting she was, "and what a sweet expression she has when she
                     smiles; and, oh!" added he, with a rapture quite excusable in a young man of
                     twenty, "her eye is in itself a soul."</p>
                  <p>"Jane," said Mary Hull to her, as she entered her room, you look as bright as a
                     May morning, and I have that to tell you, that will make you yet brighter. Mr.
                     Evertson has been here, inquiring for Mr. Lloyd. I had my surmises, that it was
                     something about you, and though Mr. Lloyd was gone, I was determined to find
                     out; and so I made bold to break the ice, and say something about the
                     exhibition, and how much Mr. Lloyd was pleased with the school, &amp;c.,
                     &amp;c.—and then he said, he was quite disappointed to find Mr. Lloyd gone; he
                     wanted to consult him about a master of great importance to himself and to you.
                     Mr. Lloyd was so kind, he said, and had shown such an interest in the school,
                     that he did not like to take any important step without consulting him; and
                     then he spoke very handsomely of those elegant globes that Mr. Lloyd presented
                     to the school. He said, his subscription was so much enlarged, that he must
                     engage an assistant; but, as he wished to purchase some maps, he must get one
                     who could furnish, at least, one hundred dollars. His sick wife and large
                     family, he said, consumed nearly all his profits; and last, and best of all,
                     Jane, he said, that you was the person he should prefer of all others for an
                     assistant."</p>
                  <p>"Me!" exclaimed Jane.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, my dear child, you. I told him you was not quite fifteen; but he said,
                     you knew more than most young women men of twenty, and almost all the school
                     loved and respected you."</p>
                  <p>"But, Mary, Mary," and the bright flush of pleasure died away as she spoke,
                     "where am I to get a hundred dollars?"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Lloyd," answered Mary, "I know would furnish it."</p>
                  <p>"No, Mary," replied Jane, after a few moments' consideration, "I never can
                     consent to that."</p>
                  <p>"But why?" said Mary. "Mr. Lloyd spends all his money in doing good."</p>
                  <p>Jane could not tell why, but she felt that it was not delicate to incur such an
                     obligation. She merely said, "Mr. Lloyd's means are well employed. If any man
                     does, he certainly will, hear those blessed words, 'I was hungry and ye fed me,
                     naked and ye clothed me, sick and in prison, and ye visited me.'"</p>
                  <p>"I do not eat the bread of idleness, Mary; I think I earn all my aunt gives me;
                     and I am not very unhappy there; indeed, I am seldom unhappy. I cannot tell how
                     it <choice>
                        <sic>it</sic>
                        <corr>is</corr>
                     </choice>, but I am used to their ways. I am always busy, and have not time to
                     dwell on their unkindness; it passes me like the tempest from which I am
                     sheltered; and when I feel my temper rising, I remember who it is that has
                     placed me in the fiery furnace, and I feel, Mary, strengthened and peaceful as
                     if an angel were really walking beside me."</p>
                  <p>"Surely," said Mary, as if but thinking aloud, "The kingdom is come in this
                     dear child's heart."</p>
                  <p>Both were silent for a few moments. Jane was making a strong mental effort to
                     Subdue that longing after liberty, that lurks in every heart. Habitual
                     discipline had rendered it comparatively easy for her to restrain her wishes.
                     After a short struggle, she said, with a smile, "I am sure of one thing,<pb
                        n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7726-00000045"/> my dear, kind Mary, I shall never lose
                     an opportunity of advantage, while I have such a watchful friend as you are, on
                     the look-out for me. Oh! how much have I to be grateful for! I had no reason to
                     expect such favor from Mr. Evertson. Every one, out of my aunt's family, is
                     kind tome; I have no right to repine at the trials I have there; they are, no
                     doubt, necessary to me. Mary, I sometimes feel the rising of a pride in my
                     heart, that I am sure needs all these lessons of humility; and sometimes I
                     feel, that I might be easily tempted to do wrong—to indulge an indolent
                     disposition, for which you often reproved me; but I am compelled to exertion,
                     by necessity as well as a sense of duty. It is good for me to bear this yoke in
                     my youth."</p>
                  <p>"No doubt, no doubt, my dear child; but then you know if there is a way of
                     escape opened to you, it would be but a tempting of Providence not to avail
                     yourself of it. It is right to endure necessary evils with patience, but I know
                     no rule that forbids your getting rid of them, if you can." Mary Hull was not a
                     woman to leave any stone unturned, when she had a certain benefit in view for
                     her favourite. "Now, dear Jane," said she, "I have one more plan to propose to
                     you, and though it will cost you some pain, I think you will finally see it in
                     the same light that I do. I always thought it was not for nothing Providence
                     moved the hearts of the creditors to spare you all your dear mother's clothes,
                     seeing she had a good many that could not be called necessary; nor was it a
                     blind chance that raised you up such a friend as Mr. Lloyd in a stranger. Now,
                     if you will consent to it, I will undertake to dispose of the articles Mr.
                     Lloyd sent to you, and your mother's lace and shawls, and all the little
                     nick-nacks she left; it shall go hard but I will raise a hundred dollars."</p>
                  <p>"But, Mary," said Jane, wishing, perhaps, to conceal from herself even the
                     involuntary reluctance she felt to the proposal, "Aunt Wilson will never
                     consent to it."</p>
                  <p>"The consent that is not asked," replied Mary, "cannot be refused. It is but
                     speaking to Mr. Evertson, and he will keep our counsel, for he is not a talking
                     body, and when all is ready, it will be time enough, not to ask Mrs. Wilson's
                     leave, but to tell her your plans; you owe her nothing, my child, unless it be
                     for keeping the furnace hot that purifies the gold. I would not make you
                     discontented with your situation, but I cannot bear to see your mind as well as
                     your body in slavery."</p>
                  <p>Mary's long harangue had given Jane a moment for reflection, and she now saw
                     the obvious benefits to result from the adoption of her judicious friend's
                     plan. The real sorrows that had shaded her short life, had taught her not to
                     waste her sensibility on trifles. She doubtless felt it to be very painful to
                     part with any memorials of her mother, but the moment she was convinced it was
                     right and best she should do so, she consented, and cheerfully, to the
                     arrangement. Mary entered immediately upon the execution of her plan.</p>
                  <p>Those who have been accustomed to use, and to waste, thousands, will smile with
                     contempt at the difficulty of raising a hundred dollars. But let those persons
                     be reduced to want so mean a sum, and they will cease to laugh at the obstacles
                     in the way of getting it. Certain it is, that Mary, anxious and assiduous,
                     spent four weeks in industrious application to those whom she thought most
                     likely to be purchasers in the confined market of ——. The necessity of secrecy
                     increased the difficulty of the transaction; but finally, zeal and perseverance
                     mastered every obstacle, and Mary, with sparkling eyes, and a face that smiled
                     all over in spite of its habitual sobriety, put Jane in possession of the
                     hundred dollars.<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7726-00000046"/> "This is indeed manna
                     in the wilderness," said Jane, as she received it, "but, dear Mary, I am not
                     the less thankful to you for your exertions for me."</p>
                  <p>"My child you are right," replied Mary; "thanks should first ascend to Heaven,
                     and then they are very apt to descend in heavenly grace upon the feeble
                     instrument. But something seems to trouble you."</p>
                  <p>"I am troubled," answered Jane; "I fear, Mary, this sum cannot all have come
                     from the articles you sold; you have added some of your earnings."</p>
                  <p>"No, my dear child; some, and all of my earnings, would I gladly give to you,
                     but you know my poor blind sister takes all I can earn; while God blesses me
                     with health, she shall never want. The town has offered to take her off my
                     hands, as they call it, but this would be a crying shame to me; and besides,"
                     she added smiling, "I can't spare her, for it is more pleasant working for her
                     than for myself. Thanks to Mr. Lloyd, she is now placed in a better situation
                     than I could afford for her. No, Jane, the money is all yours; I have told Mr.
                     Evertson, and you are to enter the school on Monday, and I have engaged a place
                     for you at Mrs. Harvey's, who will be as kind as a mother to you. Between now
                     and Monday you will have time to acquaint your aunt with the fortune you have
                     come to, and to shed all the tears that are necessary on this woful
                     occasion!"</p>
                  <p>Jane had now nothing to do but to communicate these arrangements; but so much
                     did she dread the tempest she knew the intelligence would produce, that she
                     suffered the day to wear away without opening her lips on the subject. The next
                     day arrived; the time of emancipation was so near, she felt her spirits rise
                     equal to the disagreeable task. The family were assembled in the 'dwelling
                     room;' Mrs. Wilson was engaged in casting up with her son David some of his
                     college accounts, a kind of business that never increased her good humour.
                     Martha and Elvira were seated at a window, in a warm altercation about the
                     piece of work on which they were sewing; the point of controversy seemed to
                     be—to which the mother had assigned the task of finishing it. The two younger
                     children were sitting on little chairs near their mother, learning a long
                     lesson in the 'Assembly's Catechism,' and every now and then crying out—"Please
                     to speak to David, ma'am, he is pinching me;"—"David pulled my hair, ma'am."
                     The complainants either received no notice, or an angry rebuke from the mother.
                     Jane was quietly sewing, and mentally resolving that she would speak on the
                     dreaded subject the moment her aunt had finished the business at which she was
                     engaged. Mrs. Wilson's temper became so much ruffled that she could not
                     understand the accounts; so shuffling the papers altogether into her desk, and
                     turning the key, she said angrily to her son, 'her eldest hope,' "You will
                     please to bear in mind, sir, that all these extravagant bills are charged to
                     you, and shall come out of your portion—not a cent of them will I ever
                     pay."</p>
                  <p>This did not seem to be a very propitious moment for Jane's communication, but
                     she dreaded it so much, that she felt impatient to have it off her mind, and
                     laying down her work, she was fearfully beginning, when she was interrupted by
                     a gentle tap at the door. A mean-looking woman entered, who bore the marks of
                     poverty, and sorrow, and sickness. She had a pale, half-starved infant in her
                     arms, and two other little ragged children with her, that she had very
                     considerately left at the outer door. She curtsied very humbly to the lady of
                     the house—'hoped no offence'—she had a little business with <emph>Miss</emph>
                     Wilson—she believed <emph>Miss</emph> Wilson had<pb n="94-95"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000047"/> forgotten her, it was no wonder—she did not
                     blame her, sickness and trouble made great changes. Mrs. Wilson either did not,
                     or affected not to recognize her. She was aware that old acquaintance might
                     create a claim upon her charity, and she did not seem well pleased when Jane,
                     who sat near, pushed a chair forward for the poor woman, into which she sunk,
                     as it appeared, from utter inability to stand.</p>
                  <p>"Who do you say you are?" said Mrs. Wilson, after embarrassing the woman by an
                     unfeeling stare.</p>
                  <p>"I did not say, ma'am, for I thought, may be, when you looked at me so severe,
                     you would know me."</p>
                  <p>"Let me take your baby, while you rest a little," said Jane.</p>
                  <p>"Oh miss, he is not fit for you to take, he has had a dreadful spell with the
                     whooping-cough and the measles, and they have left him kind-o' sore and
                     rickety; he has not looked so chirk as he does to-day since we left Buffalo."
                     Jane persisted in her kind offer, and the woman turned again to Mrs.
                     Wilson—"Can't you call to mind, ma'am, Polly Harris, that lived five years at
                     your brother Squire Elton's?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes, I recollect you now; but you married and went away; and people
                     should get their victuals where they do their work."</p>
                  <p>"I did not come to beg," replied the woman.</p>
                  <p>"That may be," said Mrs. Wilson; "but it is a very poor calculation for the
                     people that move into the new countries to come back upon us as soon as they
                     meet with any trouble. I wonder our Select Men don't take it in hand."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! ma'am!" said the woman, "I guess you was never among strangers; never knew
                     what it was to long to see your own people. Oh it is a heart-sickness, that
                     seems to wear away life!"</p>
                  <p>"Whether I was, or was not, I don't know what that signifies to you; I should
                     be glad to know what your business is with me, if you have any, which I very
                     much doubt."</p>
                  <p>"I am afraid, ma'am, you will not see fit to make it your business," said the
                     poor woman; and she sighed deeply, and hesitated, as if she was discouraged
                     from proceeding, but the piteous condition of her children stimulated her
                     courage. "Well, ma'am, to begin with the beginning of my troubles, as I was
                     saying, I lived five years with your brother."</p>
                  <p>"Troubles!" exclaimed Mrs. Wilson, "you had an easy life enough of it there;
                     you was always as plump as a partridge, and your cheeks as red as a rose!"</p>
                  <p>"I had nothing to complain of but that I could never get my pay when I wanted
                     it. There never was a nicer woman than <emph>Miss</emph> Elton. I believe she
                     saved my life once when I had the <hi rend="i"/>typus fever; but then every
                     body knew she never had the use of much money; she never seemed to care any
                     thing about it—when she had any I could always get it; I hope no offence, but
                     every body knows the Squire was always a scheming, and seldom had the money
                     ready to pay his just debts. I am afraid the child tires you, miss;" she
                     continued, turning to Jane, who had walked to the window to hide the emotion
                     the woman's remarks produced.</p>
                  <p>"No," replied Jane, "I had rather keep it;" and the woman proceeded—</p>
                  <p>"It lacked but six weeks of the five years I had lived at the Squire's, when I
                     was married to Rufus Winthrop. When Rufus came to a settlement with the Squire,
                     there was a hundred dollars owing to me. We were expecting to move off at a
                     great distance, beyond the Genesee, and Rufus pressed very hard for the
                     payment: the Squire put him off from time to time: Rufus was a peaceable man,
                     and did not<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7726-00000048"/> want to go to law, and so
                     the upshot of it was, the Squire persuaded him <choice>
                        <sic>to to</sic>
                        <corr>to</corr>
                     </choice> take his note—</p>
                  <p>"That's a very likely story," said Mrs. Wilson, impatiently interrupting the
                     narrative—"I don't believe one word of it."</p>
                  <p>"Well, ma'am," replied Mrs. Winthrop, "I have that which must convince you;"
                     and she took from an old pocket-book a small piece of paper, and handed it to
                     Mrs. Wilson—"there is the identical note, ma'am, you can satisfy yourself."</p>
                  <p>Jane cast her eye on the slip of paper in her aunt's hand; it was but too
                     plainly written in her father's large and singular character. Mrs. Wilson
                     coldly returned it, saying, in a moderate tone, "It is as good to you now as a
                     piece of white paper."</p>
                  <p>"Then I have nothing in this world," said the poor woman, bursting into tears,
                     "but my poor sick, destitute children."</p>
                  <p>"How came you in such a destitute condition?" inquired Mrs. Wilson, who, now
                     that she saw the woman had no direct claim on her, was willing to hear her
                     story.</p>
                  <p>"Oh," answered the poor creature, "it seemed as if every thing went
                     cross-grained with us. There was never a couple went into the new countries
                     with fairer prospects; Rufus had tugged every way to save enough to buy him a
                     small farm. When we got to Buffalo, we struck down south, and settled just on
                     the edge of Lake Erie. We had a yoke of oxen, but one of them was pretty much
                     beat out on the road, and died the very day after we got to our journey's end:
                     there was a distemper among the cattle the next winter, and we lost the other
                     ox and our cow. In the spring, Rufus took the long ague, working out in the
                     swampy ground in wet weather, and that held him fifteen months; but he had made
                     some clearings, and we worried through; and for three years we seemed to be
                     getting along ahead a little. Then we both took the lake fever: we had neither
                     doctor nor nurse: our nighest neighbors were two miles off; they were more
                     forehanded than we, and despert kind, but it was not much they could do, for
                     they had a large sick family of their own. The fever threw my poor husband into
                     a slow consumption, and he died, ma'am, the 20th of last January, and that poor
                     baby was born the next week after he died. It seemed as if nothing could kill
                     me, though I have a weakness in my bones 'casioned by the fever, and distress
                     of mind, that I expect to carry to my grave with me. Sometimes my children and
                     I would almost starve to death; but Providence always sent some relief. Once
                     there was a missionary put up with us; he looked like a poor body, but he left
                     me two dollars; and once a Roman Catholic priest that was passing over into
                     Canada, gave me a gold piece, and that I saved, till I started on my journey.
                     While my husband was sick, he had great consarn upon his mind about Squire
                     Elton's note; we had heard rumours like that he had broke; but Rufus nor I
                     could not believe but what there would be enough to pay the note, out of all
                     his grandeur, and so Rufus left it in strict charge with me to come back as
                     soon as I could after the spring opened. And so, ma'am, as soon as the roads
                     were a little settled, I pulled up stakes and came off. My good christian
                     neighbours helped me up to Buffalo. I have been nine weeks getting from there,
                     though I was favoured with a great many rides"—</p>
                  <p>Here Mrs. Wilson interrupted the unfortunate narrator, saying,—"I cannot see
                     what occasion there was for you to be nine weeks on the road; I have known
                     persons to go from Boston to the Falls, and back again, in three weeks."</p>
                  <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7726-00000049"/>
                  <p>"Ah, ma'am!" replied the woman, "there is a sight of difference between a
                     gentleman riding through the country for pleasure, with plenty of money in his
                     pocket, and a poor sickly creature, begging a ride now and then of a few miles,
                     and then walking for miles with four little children, and one a baby."</p>
                  <p>"Four! your story grows—I thought you had but three."</p>
                  <p>"I have but three, ma'am; I buried my only girl, the twin to the second boy, at
                        <hi rend="i"/>Batavy. She never was hearty, and the travelling quite overdid
                     her." The afflicted woman wiped away the fast gathering tears with a corner of
                     her apron, and went on. "At <hi rend="i"/>Batavy I believe I should have gived
                     out, but there was a tender-hearted gentleman from the eastward, going on to
                     see the Falls, and he paid for my passage, and all my children's, in a
                     return-stage, quite to <hi rend="i"/>Genevy. This was a great relief to my
                     spirits, and easement to the children's feet; and so after that, we came on
                     pretty well, and met with a great deal of kindness; but, oh! ma'am, 'tis a
                     wearisome journey."</p>
                  <p>"And here you are," said Mrs. Wilson; "and I suppose the town must take care of
                     you."</p>
                  <p>"I did not mean to be a burden to the town," replied the woman. "If it pleased
                     the Lord to restore my health, and if I could have got the hundred dollars, I
                     would not have been a burden to any body. I calculated to hire me a little
                     place, bought a loom, and turned my hand to weaving—I am a master weaver,
                     ma'am."</p>
                  <p>"I am sorry for you, good woman," said Mrs. Wilson. "Here," said she, after
                     rummaging her pocket and taking out a reluctant nine-pence; "Here is a 'widow's
                     mite' for you. I can't give you the least encouragement about my brother's
                     debt. He left nothing but a destitute child that I have had to support ever
                     since his death."</p>
                  <p>"Is that little Jane?" exclaimed the woman, for the first time recalling to
                     mind the features of our heroine. "Well," added she, surveying her delicate
                     person with a mingled expression of archness and simplicity, "I think it can't
                     have cost you much to support her, ma'am. I wonder I did not know you," she
                     continued, "when you took my baby so kindly. It was just like you. I used to
                     set a great store by you. But you have grown so tall, and so handsome; as to
                     the matter of that, you was always just like a Lon'on doll."</p>
                  <p>Jane replaced the child in the mother's lap, and said to Mrs. Winthrop, "I
                     recollect you perfectly, Polly. You were very good to me."</p>
                  <p>I could not help it, for you was always as pleasant as a little lamb, and as
                     chipper as a bird; but," said she, observing the too evident traces of tears on
                     Jane's cheeks, "I am sorry if I have touched your feelings about the money. I
                     never mistrusted that it was you."</p>
                  <p>"Do not be uneasy on that account," replied Jane. "I am glad I have heard your
                     story, Polly."</p>
                  <p>She had listened to the unfortunate woman's history with the keenest anguish.
                     There is no feeling so near of kin to remorse as that which a virtuous child
                     suffers <choice>
                        <sic>frrom</sic>
                        <corr>from</corr>
                     </choice> the knowledge of a parent's vices. The injustice of her father
                     appeared to Jane to have either caused or aggravated every evil the poor woman
                     had suffered. Each particular was sharper than a serpent's tooth to our unhappy
                     orphan. She had not that convenient moral sense, quick to discern and lament
                     the faults of others, but very dull in the perception of our own duties. It was
                     the work of an instant with her to resolve to appropriate her newly acquired
                     treasure to the reparation<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7726-00000050"/> paration
                     of her father's injustice; and with the hasty generosity of youth, she left the
                     room to execute her purpose. But, when she took the pocket-book from its
                     hiding-place, and saw again that which she had looked upon with so much joy, as
                     the price of liberty and the means of independence, her heart misgave her; she
                     felt like a prisoner, the doors of whose prison-house have been thrown open to
                     him, who sees the inviting world without, and who is called upon, in the spirit
                     of martyrdom, to close the door, and bar himself from light and hope. Those who
                     have felt the difficulty of sacrificing natural and virtuous wishes to strict
                     justice, will pardon our heroine a few moments' deliberation. She thought that,
                     as the money had been chiefly the avails of the articles given her by Mr.
                     Lloyd, it could not be considered as derived from her father. She thought how
                     much Mary Hull had exerted herself, and how disappointed she would be; the
                     engagement with Mr. Evertson occurred to her, and she was not certain it would
                     be quite right to break it; and, last of all, she thought, that if her present
                     plans succeeded, it could not be very long before she might earn enough to
                     cancel the debt. Jane had not been used to parleying with her duties, or
                     stifling the voice of conscience; and in a moment the recollection of her
                     father's dishonesty, and the poor woman's perishing condition, swept away every
                     selfish consideration. "Oh, Lord!" she exclaimed, "if I have not compassion on
                     my fellow-servant, how can I hope for thy pity."</p>
                  <p>We would recommend to all persons, placed in similar circumstances, to all who
                     find almost as many arguments for the wrong as for the right, to bring to their
                     aid the certain light of Scripture, and we think they will be altogether
                     persuaded to be like our heroine, not "saving her bonds." Sure we are, that she
                     was never more to be envied than when, at the sound of the closing of the
                     parlour door, she flew down stairs, joined Mrs. Winthrop just as she was
                     saying, half sobbing, to her children, "Come, boys—I <emph>am</emph> poor now,
                     for my hope is all gone;" and walking a little distance, till a sharp angle in
                     the road concealed them from the house, she said, "Polly, here is a hundred
                     dollars. I know the debt my father owed you amounts to a good deal more now,
                     but this is all I have,—take it. It is not probable that I shall ever be able
                     to pay the rest, but I shall never forget that I owe it."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Winthrop was for a moment dumb with surprise; then bursting into tears of
                     gratitude and joy, she would have overwhelmed Jane with thanks, but she stopped
                     her, saying, "No, Polly, I have only done what was right. I have two favours to
                     beg of you—say nothing to any body in the world, of your having received this
                     money from me; and," added she, faltering, "do not, again, tell the story of
                     the——" injustice, she would have said, but the word choked her. "I mean, do not
                     say, to any one, that my parents did not pay you."</p>
                  <p>"Oh! Miss Jane," replied the grateful creature, "I'll mind every thing you tell
                     me, just as much as if it was spoken to me right out of Heaven."</p>
                  <p>And we have reasons to believe, she was quite as faithful to her promise as
                     could have been expected; for she was never known to make any communication on
                     the subject, except that, when some of her rustic neighbours expressed their
                     surprise at the sudden and inexplicable change in her circumstances, she would
                     say, "She came by it honestly, and by the honesty of some people too, who she
                     guessed, though they did it secretly, would be rewarded openly." And when she
                     heard Jane Elton's name mentioned, she would roll up her eyes and say, "That if
                     every body knew as much as she<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7726-00000051"/> did,
                     they would think that girl was an angel upon earth." These oracular hints were,
                     perhaps, not quite so much heeded as Polly expected; at any rate, she was never
                     tempted to disclose the grounds of her opinion.</p>
                  <p>Jane had a difficult task in reconciling her friend Mary to her disappointment.
                     While she felt a secret delight in the tried rectitude of her favourite, she
                     could not deny herself the indulgence of a little repining.—"If you had but
                     waited, Jane, till Mr. Lloyd came home, he would have advanced the money with
                     all his heart."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, but Mary, you must recollect Mr. Lloyd is not to return these six weeks;
                     and, in the mean time, what was to become of the poor woman and her starving
                     children? No, Mary, we must deal justly while we have it in our power. Is it
                     not your great Mr. Wesley who says, 'It is safe to defer our pleasures, but
                     never to delay our duties?'"</p>
                  <p>"It seems to me, Jane," replied Mary, "you pick fruit from every good tree, no
                     matter whose vineyard it grows in. Well, I believe you have done right; but I
                     shall tell the story to Mr. Evertson and Mrs. Harvey with a heavy heart."</p>
                  <p>"Tell them nothing," said Jane, "but that I had an unexpected call for the
                     money, and beg them to mention nothing of the past, for I will not
                     unnecessarily provoke aunt Wilson."</p>
                  <p>"Jane," said Mary earnestly, "you must not deny me the satisfaction of telling
                     how you have laid out the money."</p>
                  <p>"No," replied Jane, "you cannot have that pleasure without telling
                        <emph>why</emph> I was obliged thus to lay it out.—Oh," added she with more
                     emotion than she had yet shown, "I have never blamed my father that he left me
                     penniless; had he left me the inheritance of a good name, I would not have
                     exchanged it for all the world can give!"</p>
                  <p>Mary consoled her friend as well as she was able, and then reluctantly parted
                     from her, to perform her disagreeable duty. Mr. Evertson was exceedingly
                     disappointed; he said he had an offer of a very good assistant, who could
                     furnish more money than he expected from Jane; he had preferred Jane Elton, for
                     no sum could outweigh her qualifications for the station he wished her to fill.
                     He was, however, obliged to her for so promptly informing him of her
                     determination, as he had not yet sent a refusal to the person who had solicited
                     the place.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Harvey, not content with deploring, which she did sincerely, that she
                     could not have Jane for an inmate, wondered what upon earth she could have done
                     with a hundred dollars! and concluded "that it would be just like Jane Elton,
                     though it would not be like any body else in the world, to pay one of her
                     father's old debts with it." Will not our readers pardon Mary, if Mrs. Harvey
                     inferred from the smile of pleasure that brightened her face, that she had
                     sagaciously guessed the truth? Let that be as it may; all parties promised, and
                     what is much more extraordinary, preserved secrecy; and all that was left of
                     Jane's hopes and plans was the consciousness of having acted right—from right
                     motives. Could any one have seen the peacefulness of her heart, he would have
                     pronounced that consciousness a treasure that has no equivalent.</p>

                  <p>MORE than two years glided away without the occurrence of any incident in the
                     life of our heroine that would be deemed worthy of record, by any persons less
                     interested in her history than Mary Hull, or the writer of her simple annals.
                     The reader shall therefore be allowed to pass over this interval, with merely a
                     remark, that Jane had improved in mortal and immortal graces; that the
                     development of her character seemed to interest and delight Mr. Lloyd almost as
                     much as the progress of his own child, and that her uniform patience had
                     acquired for her some influence over the bad passions of her aunt, whose rough
                     points seemed to be a little worn by the continual dropping of Jane's
                     virtues.</p>
                  <p>In this interval, Martha Wilson had made a stolen match with a tavern-keeper
                     from a neighbouring village, and had removed from her mother's house, to
                     display her character on a new stage, and in a worse light.</p>
                  <p>Elvira, at eighteen, was much the same as at sixteen, except, that the gayety
                     of her spirits was somewhat checked by the apprehension (that seemed to have
                     grown of late) that Edward Erskine's affections, which had been vacillating for
                     some time between her and her cousin, would finally preponderate in Jane's
                     favour. It may appear singular, that the same person should admire both the
                     cousins; but it must be remembered, that Edward Erskine was not (as our readers
                     are) admitted behind the scenes; and it must be confessed, that he had not so
                     nice a moral sense, as we hope they possess. He neither estimated the purity of
                     Jane's character, as it deserved to be estimated, nor felt for the faults of
                     Elvira the dislike they merited. Edward Erskine belonged to one of the best
                     families in the county of ——. His parents had lost several children in their
                     infancy, and this boy alone remained to them—to become the sole object of their
                     cares and fondness. He was naturally what is called 'good-hearted,' which we
                     believe means thoughtlessly kind and unscrupulously generous. Flattery, and
                     unlimited indulgence made him vain, selfish, and indolent. These qualities
                     were, however, somewhat modified by a frank and easy temper, and sheltered by
                     an uncommonly handsome exterior. Some of his college companions thought him a
                     genius, for, though he was seldom caught in the act of studying, he passed
                     through college without disgrace; this (for he certainly was neither a genius
                     nor a necromancer) might be attributed in part to an aptness at learning, and
                     an excellent memory; but chiefly to an extraordinary facility at appropriating
                     to himself the results of the labours of others. He lounged through the
                     prescribed course of law studies, and entered upon his professional career with
                     considerable <foreign xml:lang="FRA">éclat.</foreign> He had a rich and
                     powerful voice; and it might be said of him, as of the chosen king of
                     Israel—that 'from the shoulders upwards, he was taller and fairer than any of
                     his brethren.' These are qualifications never slighted by the vulgar; and which
                     are said to be passports<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7726-00000053"/> ports to
                     ladies' favour. He had too, for we would do him ample justice, uncommon
                     talents, but not such as we think would justify the remark often made of him,
                     "that the young squire was the <emph>smartest</emph> man in the country." In
                     short, he belonged to that large class of persons who are generous, but not
                     just; affectionate, but not constant; and often kind, though it would puzzle a
                     casuist to assign to their motives their just proportions of vanity and
                     benevolence. He had recently, by the death of his parents, come into the
                     possession of a handsome estate; and he was accounted the first match in the
                     county of ———.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson could not be insensible to the advantages that she believed might
                     be grasped by Elvira, and she determined to relax the strict rule of her house,
                     and to join her assiduities to her daughter's arts, in order to secure the
                     prize. She was almost as much embarrassed in her manœuvres as the famous
                     transporter of the fox, the geese, and the corn. If she opened her doors to
                     young Erskine, to display her daughter, Jane must be seen too; and though she
                     was sufficiently ingenious in contriving ways and means of employing Jane, and
                     securing a clear field for Elvira, Erskine, with the impatience and perversity
                     of a spoiled child, set a double value on the pleasure that was denied him.</p>
                  <p>The affairs of Mrs. Wilson's household were in this train, when the following
                     conversation occurred between the cousins:—</p>
                  <p>"If there is a party made to-morrow, to escort the bride, do you expect to join
                     it, Jane?" said Elvira to her cousin, with an expression of anxiety that was
                     quite as intelligible as her question.</p>
                  <p>"I should like to do so," replied Jane.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, that of course," answered Elvira; "but I did not ask what you would
                        <emph>like,</emph> but what you <emph>expect.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"You know, Elvira, I am not sure of obtaining your mother's permission."</p>
                  <p>"For once in your life, Jane, do be content to speak less like an oracle, and
                     tell me in plain English, whether you expect to go, if you can obtain mother's
                     permission."</p>
                  <p>"In plain English, then, Elvira, <emph>yes,</emph>" replied Jane, smiling.</p>
                  <p>"You seem very sure of an invitation," answered Elvira, pettishly. Jane's deep
                     blush revealed the truth to her suspicious cousin, which she did not wish to
                     confess or evade; and Elvira continued, "I was sure I overheard Edward say
                     something to you about the ride last night, when you parted on the steps." She
                     paused, and then added, her eyes flashing fire, "Jane, Edward Erskine preferred
                     me once, and in spite of your arts, he shall prefer me again. Remember, miss,
                     the fate of lady Euphrasia."</p>
                  <p>Jane replied, good naturedly, "I do remember her; but if her proud and artful
                     character suits me, the poverty and helplessness of my condition bears a
                     striking resemblance to the forlorn Amanda's. I trust, however, that my fate
                     will resemble neither of your heroines, for you cannot expect me, on account of
                     the honour of being your rival, to be dashed from a precipice, to point the
                     moral of your story; and I am very certain of not marrying a lord."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, for there is no lord in this vulgar country to marry; but, with all your
                     affectation of modesty, you aspire to the highest station within your
                     reach."</p>
                  <p>Jane made no reply, and Elvira poured out her spleen in invectives, which
                     neither abated her own ill humour, nor disturbed her cousin's equanimity. She
                     was determined to<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7726-00000054"/> compass her
                     purposes, and in order to do so, she imparted her conjectures to her mother,
                     who had become as faithful, as she was a powerful auxiliary.</p>
                  <p>In the evening they were all assembled in the parlour. Edward Erskine entered,
                     and his entrance produced a visible sensation in every member of the little
                     circle. Mrs. Wilson dropped half a needleful of stitches on her knitting work,
                     and gave it to Jane to take them up. Jane seemed to find the task very
                     difficult; for a little girl, who sat by the working stand, observed, "Miss
                     Jane, I could take up the stitches better than you do; you miss them half."</p>
                  <p>"Give me my spectacles—I'll do it myself," said Mrs. Wilson. "Some people are
                     very easily discomposed."</p>
                  <p>It was a warm evening in the latter part of September; the window was open;
                     Jane retreated to it, and busied herself in pulling the leaves off a rose-bush.
                     Erskine brought matters to a crisis by saying, "I called, Mrs. Wilson, to ask
                     of you the favour of Miss Elton's company to-morrow on the bridal escort."</p>
                  <p>"I am sorry," replied Mrs. Wilson, "that any young woman's manners, who is
                     brought up in my house, should authorize a gentleman to believe she will, of
                     course, ride with him if asked."</p>
                  <p>"I beg your pardon, madam," replied Edward (for he, at least, had no fear of
                     the redoubtable Mrs. Wilson), "I have been so happy as to obtain Miss Elton's
                     consent, subject to yours."</p>
                  <p>"Is it possible!" answered Mrs. Wilson, sneeringly—"quite an unlooked-for
                     deference from <emph>Miss Elton;</emph> not unnecessary, however, for she
                     probably recollected, that tomorrow is lecture day; and, indifferent as she is
                     to the privilege of going to meeting, she knows that no pleasures ever prevent
                     my going."</p>
                  <p>"No, madam," replied Erskine, "the pleasures of <emph>others</emph> weigh very
                     light against your duties."</p>
                  <p>Before Mrs. Wilson had made up her mind whether or not to resent the sarcasm,
                     Erskine rose, and joining Jane at the window, whispered to her, "Rouse your
                     spirit, for heaven's sake; do not submit to such mean tyranny."</p>
                  <p>Jane had recovered her self-possession, and she replied, smiling, "It is my
                     duty to subdue, not rouse my spirit."</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Duty!</emph>" exclaimed Erskine; "leave all that ridiculous cant for
                     your aunt: I abhor it. I have your promise, and your promise to me is surely as
                     binding as your <emph>duty</emph> to your aunt."</p>
                  <p>"That promise was conditional," replied Jane, "and it is no longer in my power
                     to perform it."</p>
                  <p>"Nor in your inclination, Miss Elton?"</p>
                  <p>Jane was not well pleased that Erskine should persevere, at the risk of
                     involving her with her aunt; and to avoid his importunity, and her aunt's
                     displeasure, she left the room. "The girl wants spirit," said Erskine,
                     mentally; "she is tame, very tame. It is quite absurd for a girl of seventeen
                     to talk about duties."</p>
                  <p>He was about to take leave, when Mrs. Wilson, who knew none of the skilful
                     tactics of accomplished manœuverers, though her clumsy assaults were often as
                     irresistible, said, "Don't be in such haste, Mr. Erskine. Elvira may go with
                     you."</p>
                  <p>Edward's first impulse was to decline the offer; but he paused. Elvira was
                     sitting by her mother, and she turned upon him a look of appeal and admiration;
                     his vanity, which had been piqued by Jane, was soothed by this tribute, and<pb
                        n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7726-00000055"/> he said, "If Miss Wilson is inclined
                     to the party, I will call for her to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>Miss Wilson confessed her inclination with a glow of pleasure that consoled him
                     for his disappointment.</p>
                  <p>Elvira made the most of the advantage she had gained. Mrs. Wilson had of late,
                     though the effort cost her many a groan, indulged Elvira's passion for dress,
                     in the hope that the glittering of the bait would attract the prey. In this
                     calculation she was not mistaken; for, though Erskine affected a contempt for
                     the distinctions of dress, he had been too much flattered for his personal
                     charms, to permit him to be insensible to them; and when he handed Elvira into
                     his gig, he noticed, with pleasure, that she was the best dressed and most
                     stylish looking girl in the party. His vanity was still further gratified, when
                     he overheard his servant say to one of his fellows, "By George, they are a most
                     noble looking pair!" Such is the cormorant appetite of vanity, never satisfied
                     with the quantity, and never nice as to the quality of the food it devours.</p>
                  <p>Elvira had penetration enough to detect the weakest points in the fortress she
                     had to assail; and so skilfully and successfully did she ply her arts on this
                     triumphant day, that Erskine scarcely thought of Jane, and we fear not once
                     with regret.</p>
                  <p>Poor Jane remained at home, mortified that Edward went without her, and vexed
                     with herself that she was mortified. To avoid seeing the party on their return,
                     she went out to walk, and was deliberating whither to direct her steps, when
                     she met her friend Mr. Lloyd. "Ah, Jane," said he, "I just came on an errand
                     from my saucy little girl; she has succeeded for the first time to-day in
                     hitching words together, so as to make quite an intelligible sentence; and she
                     is so much elated, that she has bid me tell thee she cannot go to sleep till
                     'dear Jane' has heard her read."</p>
                  <p>Jane replied, she "should be glad to hear her;" but with none of the animation
                     with which she usually entered into the pleasures of her little friend. Mr.
                     Lloyd was disappointed; but he thought she had been suffering some domestic
                     vexation, and they walked on silently.</p>
                  <p>After a few moments he said, "Quaker as I am, I do not like a silent
                     meeting;—though I should be used to it, for, except that I must answer the
                     questions of my Rebecca, and am expected by thy friend Mary to reply to her
                     praises of thee, I have not much more occasion for the gift of speech than the
                     brothers of La Trappe."</p>
                  <p>"You forget," replied Jane, who felt her silence gently reproached, "that
                     besides all the use you have for that precious faculty, in persuading the
                     stupid and the obstinate to adopt your benevolent plans of reform, you
                     sometimes condescend to employ it in behalf of a very humble young friend."</p>
                  <p>"But that young friend must lay aside her humility so far as to flatter me with
                     the appearance of listening."</p>
                  <p>Jane was a little disconcerted, and Mr. Lloyd did not seem quite free from
                     embarrassment; but as he had roused her from her abstractedness, he began to
                     expatiate on the approach of evening, the charms of that hour when the din of
                     toil has ceased, and no sound is heard but the sweet sounds of twilight
                     breathing the music of nature's evening hymn; he turned his eye to the heavens,
                     which, in their "far blue arch," disclosed star after star, and then the
                     constellations in their brightness. He spoke of the power that formed, and the
                     wisdom that directed them. Jane was affected by his devotion; it was a
                     Promethean touch, that infused a soul<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7726-00000056"
                     /> into all nature. She listened with delight, and before they reached the
                     house, her tranquillity was quite restored; and the child and father were both
                     entirely satisfied with the pleasure she manifested in the improvement of her
                     little favourite. But her trials were not over: after the lesson was past—"Dear
                     Jane," said Rebecca, "why did not thee go with the party to-day? I saw them all
                     go past here, and Mr. Erskine and Elvira were laughing, and I looked out sharp
                     for thee; would not any body take thee, Jane?"</p>
                  <p>Jane did what of all other things she would least have wished to have done—she
                     burst into tears.</p>
                  <p>The sweet child, whose directness had taken her by surprise, crept up into her
                     lap, and putting her arms around her neck, said affectionately, "I am sorry for
                     thee, dear Jane; don't cry, father would have asked thee, if he had gone." Poor
                     Jane hid her blushes and her tears on the bosom of her kind, but unskilful
                     comforter. She felt the necessity of saying something; but confessions she
                     could not make, and pretences she never made.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Lloyd saw and pitied her confusion: he rose, and tenderly placing his hand
                     on her head, he said, "My dear young friend, thou hast wisely and safely guided
                     thy little bark thus far down the stream of life; be still vigilant and
                     prudent, and thou wilt glide unharmed through the dangers that alarm thee." He
                     then relieved Jane from his presence, saying, "I am going to my library, and
                     will send Mary to escort thee home."</p>
                  <p>Jane could not have borne a plainer statement of her case; and though it was
                     very clear that Mr. Lloyd had detected the lurking weakness of her heart, yet
                     she was soothed by his figurative mode of insinuating his knowledge and his
                     counsel. Persons of genuine sensibility possess a certain tact, that enables
                     them to touch delicate subjects without giving pain. This touch differs as much
                     from a rude and unfeeling grasp as does the management of a fine instrument in
                     the hands of a skilful surgeon, from the mangling and hacking of a vulgar
                     operator.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Lloyd had heard the village gossip of Edward Erskine's divided attentions
                     to the cousins. Nothing that concerned Jane was uninteresting to him; and he
                     had watched with eager anxiety the character and conduct of Erskine. He had
                     never liked the young man; but he thought that he had probably done him
                     injustice, and he had too fair a mind to harbour a prejudice. "Perhaps," he
                     said to himself, "I have judged him hardly; I am apt to carry my strait-coat
                     habits into every thing; the young man's extravagant way of talking, his
                     sacrifices to popularity, and his indolence and love of pleasure, may all have
                     been exaggerated in my eyes by their opposition to the strict, sober ways in
                     which I have been bred; at any rate, I will look upon the bright side. Jane
                     Elton, pure, excellent as she is, cannot love such a man as Edward Erskine
                     appears to me to be; and she is too noble, I am sure, to regard the advantages
                     which excite the cupidity of her vulgar aunt."</p>
                  <p>The result of Mr. Lloyd's investigations was not favourable to Erskine. Still
                     his faults were so specious, that they were often mistaken for virtues; and
                     virtues he had, though none unsullied. There was nothing in his character or
                     history, as far as Mr. Lloyd could ascertain it, that would give him, a right
                     to interfere with his advice to Jane; but still he felt as if she was on the
                     brink of a precipice, and he had no right to warn her of her danger. Perhaps
                     this was a false delicacy, considering the amount of the risk; but there are
                     few persons of principle and refinement who do not shrink<pb n="114-115"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000057"/> from meddling with affairs of the heart. Mr.
                     Lloyd hoped—believed that Jane would not marry Edward Erskine; but he did not
                     allow enough for the inexperience of youth, for the liability of a young lady
                     of seventeen to fall in love; for the faith that hopes all things, and believes
                     all things—it wishes to believe.</p>
                  <p>The fall, the winter, and the spring wore away, and, as yet, no certain
                     indication appeared of the issue of this, to our villagers, momentous affair.
                     Edward certainly preferred Jane, and yet he was more at his ease with Elvira.
                     He could not but perceive the decided superiority of Jane; but Elvira made him
                     always think more and better of himself; and this most agreeable effect of her
                     flatteries and servility reflected a charm on her. Jane was never less
                     satisfied with herself than during this harassing period of her life. A new set
                     of feelings were springing up in her heart, over which she felt that she had
                     little control. At times, her confidence in Edward was strong; and then,
                     suddenly, a hasty expression, or an unpremeditated action, revealed a trait
                     that deformed the fair proportions of the hero of her imagination. Elvira's
                     continual projects, and busy rivalry, provoked, at last, a spirit of
                     competition; which was certainly natural, though wrong; but, alas! our heroine
                     had infirmities. Who is without them?</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of the month of June, David Wilson came from college, involved
                     in debt and in disgrace. His youthful follies had ripened into vices, and his
                     mother had no patience, no forbearance for the faults, which she might have
                     traced to her own mismanagement, but from which she found a source that
                     relieved her from responsibility. The following was the close of an
                     altercation, noisy and bitter, between this mother and son:—"I am ruined,
                     utterly ruined, if you refuse me the money. Elvira told me you received a large
                     sum yesterday; and 'tis but one hundred dollars that I ask for."</p>
                  <p>"And I wonder you can have the heart to ask," replied Mrs. Wilson, sobbing with
                     passion, not grief; "you have no feeling; you never had any for my afflictions.
                     It is but two months, yesterday, since Martha died, and I have no reason to
                     hope for her she died without repentance."</p>
                  <p>"Ha!" replied David, "Elvira told me, that she confessed, to her husband, her
                     abuse of his children, her love of the bottle, (which, by the by, every body
                     knew before,) and a parcel of stuff that, for our sakes, I think she might have
                     kept to herself."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes, she did die in a terrible uproar of mind about some things of that
                     kind; but she had no feeling of her lost state by nature."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, the devil!" grumbled the hopeful son and brother; "if I had nothing to
                     worry my conscience but my <emph>state by nature,</emph> I might get one good
                     night's sleep, instead of lying from night till morning like a toad under a
                     harrow."</p>
                  <p>This comment was either unheard or unheeded by the mother, and she went on:
                     "David, your extravagance is more than I can bear. I have been wonderfully
                     supported under my other trials. If my children, though they are my flesh and
                     blood, are not elected, the Lord is justified in their destruction, and I am
                     still. I have done my duty, and I know not 'why tarry His chariot wheels.'"</p>
                  <p>"It is an easy thing, ma'am," said David, interrupting his mother, "to be
                     reconciled to everlasting destruction; but if your mind is not equally resigned
                     to the temporal ruin of a child, you must lend me the money."</p>
                  <p>"Lend it! You have already spent more than your portion<pb n="116-117"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000058"/> tion in riotous living, and I cannot, in
                     conscience, give you any thing."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson thus put a sudden conclusion to the conversation, and retreated
                     from the field, like a skilful general, having exhausted all her
                     ammunition.</p>
                  <p>As she closed the door, David muttered, "curses on her conscience; it will
                     never let her do what she is not inclined to, and always finds a reason to back
                     her inclinations. The money I must have; if fair means will not obtain it, foul
                     must."</p>

                  <p>IT was on the evening of the day on which the conversation we have related had
                     occurred between young Wilson and his mother, that Jane, just as she had parted
                     with Erskine, after an unusually delightful walk, and was entering her aunt's
                     door, heard her name pronounced in a low voice. She turned, and saw an old man
                     emerging from behind a projection of the house. He placed his finger on his
                     lips by way of an admonition to silence, and said softly to Jane, "For the love
                     of Heaven, come to my house to-night; you may save life: tell no one, and come
                     after the family is in bed."</p>
                  <p>"But, John, I do not know the way to your house," replied Jane, amazed at the
                     strange request.</p>
                  <p>"You shall have a guide, miss. Don't be afraid; 'tis not like you to be afraid
                     when there is good to be done; and I tell you, you may save life; and every one
                     that knows me, knows I never tell a lie for any body."</p>
                  <p>"Well, said Jane, after a moment's pause "if I go, how shall I find the
                     way?"</p>
                  <p>"That's what I am afraid will frighten you most of all;<pb n="118-119"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000059"/> but it must be so. You know where Lucy Willett's
                     grave is, on the side of the hill, above the river; there you will find crazy
                     Bet waiting for you. She is a poor cracked body, but there is nobody I would
                     sooner trust in any trouble; besides, she is in the secret already, and there
                     is no help for it."</p>
                  <p>"But," said Jane, "may I not get some one else to go with me?"</p>
                  <p>"Not for the wide world. Nothing will harm you."</p>
                  <p>Jane was about to make some further protestation, when a sound from the house
                     alarmed the man, and he disappeared as suddenly as he had appeared.</p>
                  <p>John was an old man who had been well known to two or three successive
                     generations in the village. He had not strength or health for hard labour, but
                     had gained a subsistence by making baskets, weaving new seats into old chairs,
                     collecting herbs for "spring beer," and digging medicinal roots from the
                     mountains; miscellaneous offices, which are usually performed by one person,
                     where the great principle of a division of labour is yet unknown and
                     unnecessary. A disciple of Gall might, perhaps, have detected in the
                     conformation of the old man's head, certain indications of a contemplative turn
                     of mind, and a feeling heart; but, as we are unlearned in that fashionable
                     science, we shall simply remark, that there was in the mild cast of his large
                     but sunken eye, and the deep-worn channels of his face, an expression that
                     would lead an observer to think he had felt and suffered; that he possessed the
                     wisdom of reflection, as well as the experience of age; and that he had been
                     accustomed, in nature's silent and solitary places to commune with the Author
                     of Nature. He inhabited a cottage at some distance from the village, but within
                     the precincts of the town. When the skill of the domestic leeches was at fault,
                     in the case of a sick cow or a wormy child, he was called to a consultation;
                     and the efficacy of the simples he had administered, had sometimes proved so
                     great, as to induce a suspicion of a mysterious charm. But the superstitious
                     belief in witches and magic has vanished with the credulities of other times;
                     and the awe of 'John of the Mountain,' as he was called, or, for brevity's
                     sake, 'John Mountain,' never outlived the period of childhood.</p>
                  <p>Jane knew that John was honest and kind-hearted, and particularly well disposed
                     to her, for he had occasionally brought her a pretty wild-flower, or a basket
                     of berries; and then he would say. "Ah, Miss Jane, I grow old and forgetful,
                     but the old man can't forget the kindness that's been done to him in days past;
                     you was as gay as a lark then. My poor old bald head! it's almost as bare
                     inside as out; but I shall never forget the time—it was a sorrowful year, we
                     had had a hard winter, the snows drifted on the mountains, and for six weeks I
                     never saw the town, and poor Sarah lying sick at home; and when I did get out,
                     I came straight to your mother's, for she had always a pitiful heart, and an
                     open and full hand too, and she stalked my alms basket full of provisions. Then
                     you came skipping out of the other room, with a flannel gown in your hand, and
                     your very eyes laughed with pleasure, and when you gave it to me, you said, "It
                     is for your wife, and I sewed every stitch of it, John;" and then you was not
                     bigger than a poppet, and could not speak plain yet. When I got home, and told
                     my old woman, she shook her head, and said, you "was not long for this world;"
                     but I laughed at her foolishness, and asked her, if the finest saplings did not
                     live to make the noblest trees? Thanks to Him that is above, you are alive at
                     this day, and many a wanderer will yet find shelter under your branches."</p>

                  <p>After John's departure, Jane remained for a few moments where he had left her,
                     ruminating on his strange request, when her attention was called to a noise in
                     her aunt's sleeping apartment, and she heard, as she thought, crazy Bet's voice
                     raised to its highest pitch. She passed hastily through the passage, and on
                     opening her aunt's door, she beheld a scene of the greatest confusion. The
                     bed-clothes had been hastily stripped from the bed and strewed on the floor,
                     and Bet stood at the open window with the bed in her right hand. She had, by a
                     sudden exertion of her strength, made an enormous rent in the well-wove home
                     made tick, and was now quite leisurely shaking out the few feathers that still
                     adhered to it. In her left hand she held a broom, which she dexterously
                     brandished, to defend herself from the interference of Sukey, the colored
                     servant girl, who stood panic-struck and motionless; her dread of her
                     mistress's vengeance impelling her forward, and her fear of the moody maniac
                     operating upon her locomotive powers, like a Gorgon influence. Her conflicting
                     fears had not entirely changed her Ethiopian skin, but they had subtracted her
                     colour in stripes, till she looked like Robin Hood's willow wand.</p>
                  <p>"Why did you not stop her?" exclaimed Jane, hastily passing the girl.</p>
                  <p>"Stop her, missy? the land's sake! I could as easy stop a flash of lightning!
                     missy must think me a 'rac'lous creature, respecting me to hold back such a
                     harricane."</p>
                  <p>At Jane's approach Bet dropped the broom, and threw the empty bed-tick at poor
                     Sukey, who shook it off, not, however, till her woolly head was completely
                     powdered with the lint. "Now, Sukey," screamed Bet with a wild peal of
                     laughter, "look in the glass, and you'll see how white you'll be in Heaven; the
                     black stains will all be washed out there!"</p>
                  <p>"But, Bet," said Jane, where are the feathers?"</p>
                  <p>"Where child? she replied, smiling with the most provoking indifference, "where
                     are last year's mourners? where is yesterday's sunshine, or the morning's
                     fog?"</p>
                  <p>"Why did you do this, Bet?"</p>
                  <p>"Do you ask a <emph>reason</emph> of me?" she replied, with a tone in which
                     sorrow and anger were equally mingled, and then putting her finger to her
                     forehead, she added, "the space is empty where it should be, Jane—quite empty,
                     and sometime aching!"</p>
                  <p>Jane felt that the poor woman was not a subject of reproach; and turning away,
                     she said, "Aunt will be very angry."</p>
                  <p>"Yes," replied Bet, "she will weep and howl, but she should thank me for
                     silencing some of the witnesses."</p>
                  <p>"Witnesses, Bet?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, child, witnesses; are not moth-eaten garments and corrupted riches
                     witnesses against the rich, the hard-hearted, and close-handed? She should not
                     have denied a bed to my aching head and weary body. She should not have told
                     me, that the bare ground and hard boards were soft and easy enough for a
                     "rantipole beggar."</p>
                  <p>The recollection of the promise she had given to John now occurred to Jane, and
                     she was deliberating whether or not to speak to Bet about it, when Mrs. Wilson,
                     who had been absent on a visit to one of her neighbors, came in. In her passage
                     through the kitchen, Sukey had hinted to her her loss, and she hastened on to
                     ascertain its extent. Inquiries were superfluous; the empty tick was lying
                     where Sukey had<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7726-00000061"/> left it, and the
                     feathers which it had contained were not. Mrs. Wilson darted forwards towards
                     Bet, on whom she would have wreaked her hasty vengeance, but Bet, aware of her
                     intention, sprang through the window, quick as thought, and so rapid, and
                     seemingly, spiritual, was her flight, that a minute had scarcely passed, when
                     the shrill tones of her voice were heard rising in the distance, and they were
                     just able to distinguish the familiar words of her favorite methodist hymn— <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"Sinners stand a trembling,</l>
                           <l>Saints are rejoicing."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson turned to Jane, and with that disposition which such persons have
                     when any evil befalls them, to lay the blame on somebody, she would have vented
                     her spite on her, but it was too evident that the only part Jane had had in the
                     misfortune was an ineffectual effort to avert it, and the good lady was
                     deprived of even that alleviation of her calamity. This scene at which, in
                     spite of her aunt's awful presence, Jane had laughed heartily, was not at all
                     adapted to inspire her with confidence in the guide, whose wild and fantastic
                     humours she knew it to be impossible for any one to control. Her resolution was
                     a little shaken; but, after all, she thought, "It is possible I may find the
                     house without her. I know the course I should take. At any rate, I should be
                     miserable if any evil should come of my neglect of old John's request. There
                     can be no real dangers, and I will not imagine any."</p>
                  <p>Still, after the family were all hushed in repose, and Jane had stolen from her
                     bed and dressed herself for her secret expedition, she shrunk involuntarily
                     from the task before her. "I do not like this mystery," said she, mentally. "I
                     wish I had told my aunt, and asked David to go with me, or I might have told
                     Mary Hull. There could have been no harm in that. But it is now too late. John
                     said, I might save life, and I will think of nothing else."</p>
                  <p>She rose from the bed, where she had seated herself to ponder, for the last
                     time, upon the difficulties before her, crept softly down stairs, passed her
                     aunt's room, and got clear of the house unmolested, except by a slight growl
                     from Brutus, the house-dog, whose dreams she had broken, but, at her well-known
                     kindly patting, and "Lie down, Brutus, lie down," he quietly resumed his
                     sleeping posture. Her courage was stimulated by having surmounted one obstacle.
                     The waning moon had risen, and shed its mild lustre over the peaceful scene.
                     "Now," thought Jane, "that I have stirred up my womanish thoughts with a manly
                     spirit, I wonder what I could have been afraid of."</p>
                  <p>Anxious to ascertain whether she was to have the doubtful aid of crazy Bet's
                     conduct, or trust solely to her own, she pressed onward. To shorten her way to
                     Lucy's grave, and to avoid the possibility of observation, she soon left the
                     public road, and walked along under the shadow of a low-browed hill, which had
                     formerly been the bank of the river, but from which it had receded and left an
                     interval of beautiful meadow between the hill and its present bed. The deep
                     verdure of the meadow sparkled with myriads of fire-flies, that seemed in this,
                     their hour, to be keeping their merry revels by the music of the passing
                     stream. The way was, as yet, perfectly familiar to Jane. After walking some
                     distance in a straight line, she crossed the meadow by a direct path to a large
                     tree, which had been, in part, uprooted by a <emph>freshet,</emph> and which
                     now lay across the river, and supplied a rude passage to the adventurous; the
                     tenacity of some of its roots still retaining it firmly in the bank.
                     Fortunately the stream was unusually<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7726-00000062"/>
                     low, and when our heroine reached the farther extremity of the fallen trunk,
                     she sprang without difficulty over the few feet of water between her and the
                     dry sand of the shore.</p>
                  <p>"That's well done!" exclaimed crazy Bet, starting up from a mound in the form
                     of a grave. "Strong of heart, and light of foot, you are a fit follower for one
                     that hates the broad and beaten road, and loves the narrow straight way and the
                     high rock. Sit down and rest you," she continued, for Jane was out of breath
                     from ascending the deep bank to where crazy Bet stood; "sit down, child; you
                     may sit quiet. It is not time for her to rise yet."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Bet," said Jane, "if you love me, take those greens off your head; they
                     make you look so wild."</p>
                  <p>A stouter heart than Jane's would have quailed at Bet's appearance. She had
                     taken off her old bonnet and tied it on a branch of the tree that shaded the
                     grave, and twisted around her head a full leaved vine, by which she had
                     confined bunches of wild flowers, that drooped around her pale brow and haggard
                     face; her long hair was streaming over her shoulders; her little black mantle
                     thrown back, leaving her throat and neck bare. The excitement of the scene, the
                     purpose of the expedition, and the moonlight, gave to her large black eyes an
                     unusual brightness.</p>
                  <p>To Jane's earnest entreaty she replied, "Child, you know not what you ask. Take
                     off these greens, indeed! Every leaf of them is a prayer. There is a charm in
                     every one of them. There is not an imp of the evil one that dares to touch me
                     while I wear them. The toad with his glistening eye, springs far from me; and
                     the big scaly snake, glides away from me."</p>
                  <p>"But," said Jane, in a tone of more timid expostulation, "what have I to guard
                     me, Bet?"</p>
                  <p>"You!" and as she spoke she stroked Jane's hair back from her pure smooth brow;
                     "have not you innocence? and know you not that is 'God's seal in the forehead'
                     to keep you from all harm. I have had <hi rend="i"/>Guerdeen, but innocence is
                     stronger than a regiment of them! Foolish girl! sit down—I say, she will not
                     rise yet."</p>
                  <p>Jane obeyed her command, and rallying her spirits, replied, "No, Bet, I am not
                     afraid she will rise. I believe the dead lie very quiet in their graves."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, those may that die in their beds, and are buried by the tolling of the
                     bell, and lie with company about them in the churchyard; but, I tell you, those
                     that row themselves over the dark river, never have a quiet night's rest in
                     their cold beds."</p>
                  <p>"Come," said Jane, impatiently rising, "for mercy's sake, let us go."</p>
                  <p>"I cannot stir from this spot," replied Bet, "till the moon gets above that
                     tree; and so be quiet, while I tell you Lucy's story. Why, child, I set here
                     watching by her many a night, till her hour comes, and then I always go away,
                     for the dead don't love to be seen rising from their beds."</p>
                  <p>"Well, Bet, tell me Lucy's story, and then I hope you will not keep me any
                     longer here; and you need not tell me much, for, you know, I have heard it a
                     thousand times."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! but you did not see her as I did, when Ashley's men went out, and she
                     followed them, and begged them on her knees, for the love of God, not to fire
                     upon the prisoners; for the story had come, that Shay's<ref rend="super"

                        n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7726-00000063"/> is now. She did not speak a word—she
                     fell upon his neck, and she clasped her arms round him; they thought to cut
                     them off, it was so hard to get them loose;—and when they took her from him,
                     (and the maniac laid her hand on Jane's head) she was all gone here. The very
                     day they put him under the green sod, she drowned herself in that deep place,
                     under the mourning willow, that the boys call Lucy's well. And they buried her
                     here for the squires and the deacons found it against law and gospel too, to
                     give her christian burial."</p>
                  <p>Bet told all these circumstances with an expression and action that showed she
                     was living the scene over, while her mind dwelt on them. Jane was deeply
                     interested; and when Bet concluded, she said, "Poor Lucy! I never felt so much
                     for her."</p>
                  <p>"That's right, child: now we will go on; but first let that tear-drop that
                     glistens in the moonbeam, fall on the grave, it helps to keep the grass green;
                     and the dead like to be cried for," she added mournfully.</p>
                  <p>They now proceeded; crazy Bet leading the way, with long and hasty strides, in
                     a diagonal course still ascending the hill, till she plunged into a deep wood,
                     so richly clothed with foliage, as to be impervious to the moon-beams, and so
                     choaked with underbrush, that Jane found it very difficult to keep up with her
                     pioneer. They soon however, emerged into an open space, completely surrounded
                     and enclosed by lofty trees. Crazy Bet had not spoken since they began their
                     walk; she now stopped, and turning abruptly to Jane, "Do you know," said she,
                     "who are the worshippers that meet in this temple? the spirits that were
                     'sometime disobedient,' but since <emph>He</emph> went and preached to them,
                     they came out from their prison house, and worship in the open air, and under
                     the light of the blessed heavens."</p>
                  <p>"It is a beautiful spot," said Jane; I should think all obedient spirits might
                     worship in this temple.</p>
                  <p>"Say you so;—then worship with me." The maniac fell on her knees—Jane knelt
                     beside her: she had caught a spark of her companion's enthusiasm. The
                     singularity of her situation, the beauty of the night, the novelty of the
                     place, on which the moon now riding high in the heavens poured a flood of
                     silver light, all conspired to give a high tone to her feelings. It is not
                     strange she should have thought she never heard any thing so sublime as the
                     prayer of her crazed conductor—who raised her arms and poured out her soul in
                     passages of scripture the most sublime and striking, woven together by her own
                     glowing language. She concluded suddenly, and springing on her feet, said to
                     Jane, "Now follow me: fear not, and falter not; for you know what awaits the
                     fearful and unbelieving,"</p>
                  <p>Jane assured her she had no <emph>fear</emph> but that of being too late. "You
                     need not think of that; the spirit never quits till I come."</p>
                  <p>They now turned into the wood by a narrow pathway, whose entrance laid under
                     the shadow of two young beach trees: crazy Bet paused—"See ye these, child,"
                     said she, pointing to the trees, "I know two who grew up thus on the same spot
                     of earth;—so lovingly they grew," and she pointed to the interlacing of the
                     branches—"young and beautiful; but the axe was laid to the root of one—and the
                     other (and she pressed both her hands on her head, and screamed wildly) died
                     here." A burst of tears afforded her a sudden relief.</p>
                  <p>"Poor broken-hearted creature!" murmured Jane.</p>
                  <p>"No, child; when she weeps, then the band is loosened<pb n="128-129"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000064"/> for," added she, drawing closer to Jane and
                     whispering, "they put an iron band around her head, and when she is in
                     darkness, it presses till she thinks she is in the place of the tormenter: by
                     the light of the moon it's loosened. You cannot see it; but it is there—always
                     there."</p>
                  <p>Jane began now to be alarmed at the excitement of Bet's imagination; and
                     turning from her abruptly, entered the path, which, after they had proceeded a
                     few yards, seemed to be leading them into a wild trackless region. "Where are
                     we going Bet?" she exclaimed. "Through a pass, child, that none knows but the
                     wild bird and the wild woman. Have you never heard of the "caves of the
                        mountain?"<ref rend="super" target="#note_004" xml:id="return_004">*</ref>

                           phrase, the "Ice-hole," is now well known to the visitors of Berkshire as
                           the "<hi rend="i"/>Ice Glen."</p>
                     </note>
                  <p>"Yes," replied Jane; "but I had rather not go through them to-night. Cannot we
                     go some other way!"</p>
                  <p>"Nay, there is no other way; follow me, and fear not."</p>
                  <p>Jane had often heard of the pass called the 'Mountain-Caves,' and she believed
                     it had only been penetrated by a few rash youths of daring and adventurous
                     spirit. She was appalled at the thought of entering it in the dead of night,
                     and with such a conductor; she paused, but she could see no way of escape, and
                     summoning all her resolution, she followed Bet, who took no note of her
                     scruples. They now entered a defile, which apparently had been made by some
                     tremendous convulsion of nature, that had rent the mountain asunder, and piled
                     rock on rock in the deep abyss. The breadth of the passage, which was walled in
                     by the perpendicular sides of the mountain, was not in any place more than
                     twenty feet; and sometimes so narrow, that Jane thought she might have extended
                     tended her arms quite across it. But she had no leisure for critical accuracy;
                     her wayward guide pressed on, heedless of the difficulties of the way. She
                     would pass between huge rocks, that had rolled so near together, as to leave
                     but a very narrow passage between them; then grasping the tangled roots that
                     projected from the side of the mountain, and placing her feet in the fissures
                     of the rocks, or in the little channels that had been worn by the continual
                     dropping from the mountain rills, she would glide over swiftly and safely, as
                     if she had been on the beaten highway. They were sometime compelled, in the
                     depths of the caverns, to prostrate themselves, and creep through narrow
                     apertures between the rocks it was impossible to surmount; and Jane felt that
                     she was passing over masses of ice, the accumulation perhaps of a hundred
                     winters. She was fleet and agile, and inspired with almost supernatural
                     courage; she, 'though a woman, naturally born to fears,' followed on
                     resolutely, till they came to an immense rock, whose conical and giant form
                     rested on broken masses below, that on every side were propping this 'mighty
                     monarch of the scene.'</p>
                  <p>For the first time, crazy Bet seemed to remember she had a companion, and to
                     give a thought to her safety. "Jane," said she, "go carefully over this lower
                     ledge, there is a narrow foothold there; let not your foot slip on the wet
                     leaves, or the soft moss. I am in the spirit, and I must mount to the
                     summit."</p>
                  <p>Jane obeyed her directions, and when without much trouble, she had attained the
                     farther side of the rock, she looked back for crazy Bet, and saw her standing
                     between heaven and earth on the very topmost point of the high rock: she leant
                     on the branch of a tree she had broken off in her struggle to reach that lofty
                     station. The moon had declined<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7726-00000065"/> a
                     little from the meridian; her oblique rays did not penetrate the depths where
                     Jane stood, but fell in their full brightness on the face of her votress above.
                     Her head, as we have noticed, was fantastically dressed with vines and flowers;
                     her eyes were in a fine 'frenzy, rolling from earth to heaven, and heaven to
                     earth;' she looked like the wild genius of the savage scene, and she seemed to
                     breathe its spirit, when, after a moment's silence, she sang, with a powerful
                     and thrilling voice, which waked the sleeping echoes of the mountain, the
                     following stanza: <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"Tell them 'I AM,' Jehovah said</l>
                           <l>To Moses, while earth heard in dread,</l>
                           <l rend="ti-1">And smitten to the heart;</l>
                           <l>At once above, beneath, around,</l>
                           <l>All nature, without voice or sound,</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>In vain Jane called upon her. In vain she entreated her to descend. She seemed
                     wrapped in some heavenly vision; and she stood mute again and motionless, till
                     a bird, that had been scared from its nest in a cleft of the rock, by the wild
                     sounds, fluttered over her and lighted on the branch she still held in her
                     hand. "Oh!" exclaimed she, "messenger of love and mercy, I am content;" and she
                     swiftly descended the sloping side of the rock, which she hardly seemed to
                     touch.</p>
                  <p>"Now," said Jane, soothingly, "you are rested, let us go on."</p>
                  <p>"Rested! yes, my body is rested, but my spirit has been the way of the eagle in
                     the air. You cannot bear the revelation now, child. Come on, and do your
                     earthly work."</p>
                  <p>They walked on for a few yards, when Bet suddenly turned to the left and
                     ascended the mountain, which was there less steep and rugged than at anyplace
                     they had passed. At a short distance before her Jane perceived, glimmering
                     through the trees, a faint light. "Heaven be praised!" said she, "that must be
                     John's cottage."</p>
                  <p>As they came nearer the dog barked; and the old man, coming out of the door,
                     signed to Jane to sit down on a log, which answered the purpose of a rude
                     door-step; and then speaking to crazy Bet, in a voice of authority, which, to
                     Jane's utter surprise, she meekly obeyed—"Take off," said he, "you mad fool,
                     them jinglements from your head, and stroke your hair back like a decent
                     christian woman; get into the house, but mind you, say not a word to her."</p>
                  <p>Crazy Bet entered the house, and John, turning to Jane, said, "You are an angel
                     of goodness for coming here to-night, though I am afraid it will do no good;
                     but since you are here, you shall see her."</p>
                  <p>"See her! see what, John?" interrupted Jane.</p>
                  <p>"That's what I must tell you, miss; but it is a piercing story to tell to one
                     that looks like you. It's telling the deeds of the pit to the angels above." He
                     then went on to state, that a few days before, he had been searching the
                     mountains for some medicinal roots, when his attention was suddenly arrested by
                     a low moaning sound, and on going in the direction from which it came, he found
                     a very young looking creature, with a new-born infant, wrapped in a shawl, and
                     lying in her arms. He spoke to the mother, but she made no reply, and seemed
                     quite unconscious of every thing, till he attempted to take the child from her;
                     she then grasped it so firmly, that he found it difficult to remove it. He
                     called his wife to his assistance, and placed the infant in her arms. Pity for
                     so young a sufferer, nerved the old man with unwonted strength, and enabled him
                     to bear the mother to his hut.<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7726-00000066"/> There
                     he used the simple restoratives his skill dictated; but nothing produced any
                     effect till the child, with whom the old woman had taken unwearied pains,
                     revived and cried. "The sound," he said, "seemed to waken life in a dead body."
                     The mother extended her arms, as if to feel for her child, and they gently laid
                     it in them. She felt the touch of its face, and burst into a flood of tears,
                     which seemed greatly to relieve her; for after that she took a little
                     nourishment, and fell into a sweet sleep, from which she awoke in a state to
                     make some explanations to her curious preservers. But as the account she gave
                     of herself was, of necessity, interrupted and imperfect, we shall take the
                     liberty to avail ourselves of our knowledge of her history, and offer our
                     readers a slight sketch of it.</p>

                  <p>THE name of the stranger was Mary Oakley. Her parents had gone out adventurers
                     to the West Indies, where, at the opening of flattering prospects, they both
                     died victims to the fever of the climate, which seldom spares a northern
                     constitution. Mary, then in her infancy, had been sent home to her
                     grandparents, who nursed this only relic of their unfortunate children with
                     doting fondness. They were in humble life; and they denied themselves every
                     comfort, that they might gratify every wish, reasonable and unreasonable, of
                     their darling child. She, affectionate and ardent in her nature, grew up
                     impetuous and volatile. Instead of 'rocking the cradle of reposing age,' she
                     made the lives of her old parents resemble a fitful April day, sunshine and
                     cloud succeeding each other in rapid alternation. She loved the old people
                     tenderly—passionately, when she had just received a favour from them; but, like
                     other spoiled children, she never testified that love by deferring her will to
                     theirs, or suffering their wisdom to govern her childish inclinations. She grew

                  <p>Most unhappily for her, there was a college in the town where she lived, and
                     she very early became the favourite belle of the young collegians, whose
                     attentions she received with delight, in spite of the remonstrances and
                     entreaties of her guardians, who were well aware that a young and beautiful
                     creature could not, with propriety or safety, receive the civilities of her
                     superiors in station, attracted by her personal charms.</p>
                  <p>David Wilson, more artful, more unprincipled than any of his companions,
                     addressed her with the most extravagant flattery, and lavished on her costly
                     favours. Giddy and credulous, poor Mary was a victim to his libertinism. He
                     soothed her with hopes and promises, till, in consequence of the fear of
                     detection in another transaction, where detection would have been dangerous, he
                     left —— and returned to his mother's, without giving Mary the slightest
                     intimation of his departure.</p>
                  <p>She took the desperate resolution of following him. She felt certain she should
                     not survive her confinement, and hoped to secure the protection of Wilson for
                     her infant. Her tenderness, we believe, more than her pride, induced her to
                     conceal her miseries from her only true friends. She thought any thing would be
                     easier for them to bear than a knowledge of her misconduct; and for the few
                     days she remained under their roof, and while she was preparing a disguise for
                     her perilous journey, she affected slight sickness and derangement. They were
                     alarmed and anxious, and insisted on making a bed for her in their room: this
                     somewhat embarrassed her proceedings; but, on the night of her escape, she told
                     them, with a determined manner, that she could only sleep in her own bed, and
                     alone in her own room. They did not resist her; they never had. Mary kissed
                     them when she bade them good-night with unusual tenderness. They went sorrowing
                     to their beds. She wrote a few incoherent lines, addressed to them, praying for
                     their forgiveness; expressing her gratitude and her love; and telling them,
                     that life before her seemed a long and a dark road, and she did not wish to go
                     any farther in it, and begging them not to search for her, for in one hour the
                     waves would roll over her. She placed the scroll on the table, crept out of her
                     window, and left for ever the protecting roof of her kind old parents.</p>
                  <p>When they awoke to a knowledge of their loss, they were overwhelmed with grief.
                     Their neighbours flocked about them, to offer their assistance and consolation;
                     and though some of the most penetrating among them suspected the cause of the
                     poor girl's desperation, more forbearing and kind than persons usually are in
                     such circumstances, they spared the old people the light of their
                     conjectures.</p>
                  <p>Poor Mary persevered in her fatiguing and miserable journey, which was rendered
                     much longer by her fearfully shunning the public road. She obtained a kind
                     shelter at the farmers' houses at night, where she always contrived to satisfy
                     their curiosity by some plausible account of herself. At the end of a week she
                     arrived, wearied and exhausted, in the neighbourhood of Wilson. She watched for
                     him in the evening, near his mother's house, and succeeded in obtaining an
                     interview with him. He was enraged that she had followed him, and said that it
                     was impossible for him to do any thing for her. She told him she asked nothing
                     for herself; but she entreated him not to add to his guilt the crime of
                     suffering their unhappy offspring to die with neglect. Utterly selfish and
                     hard-hearted, the wretch turned from her without one word of kindness: and then
                     recollecting that if she was<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7726-00000068"/>
                     discovered, he should be involved in farther troubles, he returned, and gave
                     her a direction, which she believed would enable her to find John's cottage on
                     the mountain. If she gets there, thought he as he left her, whether she lives
                     or dies, she will be far out of the way for the present—and the future must
                     take care of itself.</p>
                  <p>Mary with a faint heart followed his direction, and the next day she was
                     discovered by old John in the situation we have mentioned. Perhaps there are
                     some who cannot believe that any being should be so utterly depraved as David
                     Wilson. But let them remember, that he began with a nature more inclined to
                     evil than to good, that his mother's mismanagement had increased every thing
                     that was bad in him, and extinguished every thing that was good—that the
                     continual contradictions of his mother's professions and life, had led him to
                     an entire disbelief of the truths of religion, as well as a contempt of its
                     restraints.</p>
                  <p>After the old man had finished Mary's story, or rather so much of it as he had
                     been able to gather from her confessions, Jane asked him "Why she had been sent
                     for?"</p>
                  <p>"Why miss," he replied, "after the poor thing had come to herself, all her
                     trouble seemed to be about her baby, and I did not know what to advise her; my
                     woman and I might have done for it for the present, but our sun is almost set,
                     and we could do but for a little while. I proposed to her to go for Wilson, and
                     I am sure the sight of her might have softened a heart of flint; but she
                     shivered at the bare mention of it: she said, 'No, no; I cannot see that cruel
                     face upon my deathbed.' And then I thought of you, and I told her if there was
                     any body could bring him to a sense of right it was you, and that at any rate
                     you might think of some comfort for her; for I told her every body in the
                     village knew you for the wisest and discreetest, and gentlest. At first she
                        <emph>relucted;</emph> and then the sight of her baby seemed to persuade
                     her, and she bade me go, but she gave me a strict charge that no one should
                     come with you; for she said she wished her memory buried with her in the grave.
                     When I left her to go to you, I hoped you might speak some words of comfort to
                     her that would be better than medicine for her, and heal the body as well as
                     the mind; but when I came back, there was a dreadful change—the poor little one
                     had gone into a fit, and she would take it from my wife into her arms, and
                     there it died more than an hour ago—and she sits up in the bed holding it
                     yet—and she has not spoken a word, nor turned her eyes from it—her cheeks look
                     as if there was a living fire consuming her. Oh, Miss Jane, it is awful to look
                     upon such a fallen star! Now you are prepared—come in—may be the sight of you
                     will rouse her."</p>
                  <p>Jane followed John into his little habitation. The old couple had kindly
                     resigned their only bed to the sufferer. She was sitting as John had described
                     her, fixed as a statue. Her beautiful black glossy curls, which had been so
                     often admired and envied, were snarled, and clustered in rich masses over her
                     temples and neck. A tear that had started from the fountain of feeling, now
                     sealed for ever, hung on the dark rich eye-lash that fringed her downcast eye.
                     Jane wondered that any thing so wretched could look so lovely. Crazy Bet was
                     kneeling at the foot of the bed, and apparently absorbed in prayer, for her
                     eyes were closed, and her lips moved, though they emitted no sound. The old
                     woman sat in the corner of the fire-place, smoking a broken pipe, to soothe the
                     unusual agitation she felt.</p>
                  <p>Jane advanced towards the bed. "Speak to her," said John. Jane stooped, and
                     laid her hand gently on Mary's.<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7726-00000069"/> She
                     raised her eyes for the first time, and turned them on Jane with a look of
                     earnest inquiry, and then shaking her head, she said in a low mournful
                     voice—"No, no; we cannot be parted; you mean to take her to heaven, and you say
                     I am guilty, and must not go. They told me you were coming—you need not hide
                     your wings—I know you—there is none but an angel would look upon me with
                     pity."</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" exclaimed Jane, "can nothing be done for her? at least let us take away
                     this dead child, it is growing cold in her arms." She attempted to take the
                     child, and Mary relaxed her hold; but as she did so, she uttered a faint
                     scream, the paleness of death overspread her face, and she fell back on the
                     pillow.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, she is gone!" exclaimed John.</p>
                  <p>Crazy Bet sprang on her feet, and raised her hand—"Hush!" said she, "I heard a
                     voice saying, 'Her sins are forgiven'—'she is one come out of great
                     tribulation.'"</p>
                  <p>There were a few moments of as perfect stillness as if they had all been made
                     dumb and motionless by the stroke of death. Jane was the first to break
                     silence—"Did she," she inquired of the old man, "express any penitence—any
                     hope?"</p>
                  <p>John shook his head. "Them things did not seem to lay on her mind; and I did
                     not think it worth while to disturb her about them. Ah, miss, the great thing
                     is how we live, not how we die."</p>
                  <p>Jane felt the anxiety, so natural, to obtain some religious expression, that
                     should indicate preparation in the mind of the departed.</p>
                  <p>"Surely," said she, "it is never too late to repent—to beg forgiveness."</p>
                  <p>"No, miss," replied John, who seemed to have religious notions of his
                     own—"especially when there has been such a short account as this poor child
                     had; but the work must be all between the creature and the Creator; and for my
                     part, I don't place much dependence on what people say on a death-bed. I have
                     lived a long life, Miss Jane, and many a one have I seen, and heard too, when
                     sickness and distress were heavy upon them, and death staring them in the face,
                     and they could not sin any more—they would seem to repent, and talk as
                     beautiful as any saint; but if the Lord took his hand from them, and they got
                     well again, they went right back into the old track. No, Miss Jane, it is the
                     life—it is the life, we must look to. This child," he added, going to the bed,
                     and laying his brown and shrivelled hand upon her fair young brow, now chill
                     and changeless;' "this child was but sixteen, she told me so. The Lord only
                     knows what temptations she has had. He it is, Miss Jane, that has put that in
                     our hearts that makes us feel sorry for her now; and can you think that He is
                     less pitiful than we are? I think she will be beaten with few stripes; but," he
                     continued solemnly, covering his face with his hands,—" we are poor ignorant
                     creatures; it is all a mystery after this world; we know nothing about it."</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said Jane, "we do know, John, that all will be right."</p>
                  <p>"True," he replied; "and it is that should make us lay our fingers on our
                     mouths and be still."</p>
                  <p>Jane had been so much absorbed in the mournful scene, that the necessity of her
                     return before the breaking of day had not occurred to her mind, and would not,
                     perhaps, if John had not, after a few moments' pause, reminded her of it, by
                     saying, "I am sorry, Miss Jane, you have had such a walk for nothing; but,"
                     added he, "to the wise nothing is vain, and you are of so teachable a make,
                     that you may have learned<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7726-00000070"/> ed some
                     good lessons here; you may learn, at least, that there is nothing to be much
                     grieved for in this world but guilt; and some people go through a long life
                     without learning that. You had better return now; I will go round the hill with
                     you, and show you the path this crazy creature should have led you. She is in
                     one of her still fits now: there is nothing calms her down like seeing death:
                     she will not move from here till after the burying."</p>
                  <p>Jane looked for the last time on the beautiful form before her, and with the
                     ingenuous and keen feeling of youth, wept aloud.</p>
                  <p>"It is indeed a sore sight," said John; "it makes my old eyes run over as they
                     have not for many a year. The Lord have mercy on her destroyer! Oh, miss! it is
                     sad to see this beautiful flower cut down in its prime; but who would change
                     her condition for his? He may go rioting on, but there is that gnawing at his
                     heart's core that will not be quieted."</p>
                  <p>Jane told the kind old man that she was now ready to go, and they left the hut
                     together. He led her by a narrow foot-path around the base of the mountain,
                     till they came to a part of the way familiar to Jane. She then parted from her
                     conductor, after inquiring of him if he could inter the bodies secretly? He
                     replied, that he could without much difficulty; and he certainly should, for he
                     had given his promise to the young creature, who seemed to dread nothing so
                     much as a discovery which might lead to her old parents knowing her real
                     fate.</p>
                  <p>Anxious to reach home in time to avoid the necessity of any disclosures, Jane
                     hastened forward, and arrived at her aunt's before the east gave the slightest
                     token of the approach of day. She entered the house carefully, and turned into
                     the parlour to look for some refreshment in an adjoining pantry. A long walk,
                     and a good deal of emotion, we believe, in real life, are very apt to make
                     people, even the most refined, hungry and thirsty.</p>
                  <p>Jane had entered the parlour, and closed the door after her, before she
                     perceived that she was not the only person in it; but she started with alarm,
                     which certainly was not confined to herself, when she saw standing at Mrs.
                     Wilson's desk, which was placed at one corner of the room, her son David, with
                     his mother's pocket-book in his hand, from which he was in the act of
                     subtracting a precious roll of bank bills that had been deposited there the day
                     before. Jane paused for a moment, and but for a moment, for as the truth
                     flashed on her, she sprang forward, and seizing his arm, exclaimed, "For
                     Heaven's sake, David, put back that money! Do not load yourself with any more
                     sins."</p>
                  <p>He shook her off, and hastily stuffing the money in his pocket, said that he
                     must have it; that his mother would not give him enough to save him from
                     destruction; that he had told her ruin was hanging over his head; that she had
                     driven him to help himself; and, "as to sin," he added fiercely, "I am in too
                     deep already to be frightened by that thought."</p>
                  <p>It occurred to Jane that he might have been driven to this mode of supplying
                     himself, in order to relieve the extreme need of Mary Oakley; and she told him,
                     in a hurried manner, the events of the night. For a moment he felt the sting of
                     conscience, and, perhaps, a touch of human feeling; for he staggered back into
                     a chair, and covering his face with his hands, muttered, "<emph>Dead!</emph>
                     Mary <emph>dead!</emph> Good God! Hell has no place bad enough for me;" and
                     then rousing himself, he said, with a deep tone, "Jane Elton, I am a ruined,
                        desperate<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7726-00000071"/> perate man. You thought
                     too well of me, when you imagined it was for that poor girl I was doing this
                     deed. No, no! her cries did not trouble me; but there are those whose clamours
                     must be hushed by money—curse on them!"</p>
                  <p>"But," said Jane, "is there no other way, David? I will entreat your mother for
                     you."</p>
                  <p>"Yes! yes, and she will heed you as much as a wolf does the bleating of a lamb.
                     I tell you, I am desperate, Jane, and care not for the consequences. But," he
                     added, "I will run no risk of discovery," and as he spoke, he drew a pistol
                     from beneath his surtout, and putting the muzzle to his breast, said to Jane,
                     "give me your solemn promise, that you will never betray me, or I will put
                     myself beyond the reach of human punishment."</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" said Jane, "I will promise any thing. Do not destroy your soul and body
                     both."</p>
                  <p>"Do you promise, then?"</p>
                  <p>"I do, most solemnly."</p>
                  <p>"Then," said he, hastily replacing the pistol, and locking the desk with the
                     false key he had obtained; "then all is as well as it can be. My mother will
                     suspect, but she will not dare to tell whom; and your promise, Jane, <choice>
                        <sic>maks</sic>
                        <corr>makes</corr>
                     </choice> me secure."</p>
                  <p>Jane saw he was so determined, that any further interposition would be useless;
                     and she hurried away to her own apartment, where she threw herself upon her
                     bed, sorrowing for the crimes and miseries of others. Quite exhausted with the
                     fatigues of the night, she soon fell asleep.</p>
                  <p>She was too much distressed and terrified, to reflect upon the consequences
                     that might result from the exacted promise. She had, doubtless, been
                     unnecessarily alarmed by David's threat of self-slaughter; for, confused and
                     desperate as he was, he would hardly have proceeded to such an outrage; and,
                     besides, we have reason to believe the pistol was neither primed nor loaded,
                     but that he had provided himself with it for emergencies which might occur in
                     the desperate career in which he had engaged. He had been concerned with two
                     ingenious villains in changing the denomination of bank bills. His accomplices
                     had been detected and imprisoned, and they were now exacting money from him by
                     threatening to disclose his agency in the transaction.</p>
                  <p>Always careless of involving himself in guilt, and goaded on by the fear of the
                     state-prison, he resolved, without hesitation, on this robbery, which would not
                     only give him the means of present relief, but would supply him with a store
                     for future demands, which he had every reason to expect from the character of
                     his comrades.</p>

                  <p>JANE, exhausted by the agitations of the night, contrary to her usual custom,
                     remained in bed much longer than the other members of the family, and did not
                     awake from deep and unquiet slumbers, till the bell called the household to
                     prayers.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson was scrupulous in exacting the attendance of every member of her
                     family at her morning and evening devotions. With this requisition Jane
                     punctually and cheerfully complied, as she did with all those that did not
                     require a violation of principle. But still she had often occasion secretly to
                     lament, that where there was so much of the form of worship, there was so
                     little of its spirit and truth; and she sometimes felt an involuntary
                     self-reproach, that her body should be in the attitude of devotion, while her
                     mind was following her aunt through earth, sea, and skies, or pausing to wonder
                     at the remarkable inadaptation of her prayers to the condition and wants of
                     humanity in general, and especially to their particular modification in her own
                     family.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson was fond of the bold and highly figurative language of the
                     prophets; and often identified herself with the Psalmist, in his exultation
                     over his enemies, in his denunciations, and in his appeals for vengeance.</p>
                  <p>We leave to theologians to decide, whether these expressions from the king of
                     Israel are meant for the enemies of the church, or whether they are to be
                     imputed to the dim light which the best enjoyed under the Jewish dispensation.
                     At any rate such as come to us in 'so questionable a shape,' ought not to be
                     employed as the medium of a Christian's prayer.</p>
                  <p>When Jane entered the room, she found her aunt had begun her devotions, which
                     were evidently more confused than usual; and when she said (her voice wrought
                     up to the highest pitch) "Lo! thine enemies, O Lord! lo, thine enemies shall
                     perish: all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered; but my horn shalt thou
                     exalt like the horn of a unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil: mine eye
                     also shall see my desire on my enemies, and my ears shall hear my desire of the
                     wicked that rise up against me;" Jane perceived, from her unusual emotion, that
                     she must allude to something that touched her own affairs, and she conjectured
                     that she had already discovered the robbery. Her conjectures were strengthened
                     when she observed, that, during the breakfast, her aunt seemed very much
                     agitated; but she was at a loss to account for the look she darted on her, when
                     one of the children said, "How your hair looks, Jane; this is the first time I
                     ever saw you come to breakfast without combing it."</p>
                  <p>Jane replied, that she had overslept.</p>
                  <p>"You look more," said Elvira, "as if you had been watching all night, and
                     crying too, I should imagine, from the redness of your eyes—and now I think of
                     it," she added, regardless<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7726-00000073"/> less of
                     Jane's embarrassment, "I am sure I heard your door shut in the night, and you
                     walking about your room."</p>
                  <p>Jane was more confused by the expression of her aunt's face, than by her
                     cousin's observations. What, thought she, can I have done to provoke her? I
                     certainly have done nothing; but there is never a storm in the family, without
                     my biding some of its pitiless pelting.</p>
                  <p>After breakfast, the family dispersed, as usual, excepting Mrs. Wilson, David,
                     and Jane, who remained to assist her aunt in removing the breakfast apparatus.
                     Mrs. Wilson, neither wishing nor able any longer to restrain her wrath, went up
                     to her desk, and taking hold of a pocket handkerchief which appeared to lie on
                     the top of it, but which, as she stretched it out, showed one end caught and
                     fastened in the desk—"Do you know this handkerchief, Jane Elton?" she said, in
                     a voice choking with passion.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, ma'am," replied Jane, turning pale—"it is mine." She ventured, as she
                     spoke, to look at David. His eyes were fixed on a newspaper, he seemed to be
                     reading; not a muscle of his face moved, nor was there the slightest trace of
                     emotion.</p>
                  <p>"Yours," said Mrs. Wilson; "that you could not deny, for your name is at full
                     length on it; and when did you have it last?"</p>
                  <p>"Last night, ma'am."</p>
                  <p>"And who has robbed me of five hundred dollars? Can you answer to that?"</p>
                  <p>Jane made no reply. She saw, that her aunt's suspicions rested on her, and she
                     perceived, at once, the cruel dilemma in which she had involved herself by her
                     promise to David.</p>
                  <p>"Answer me that," repeated Mrs. Wilson, violently.</p>
                  <p>"That I cannot answer you, ma'am."</p>
                  <p>"And you mean to deny that you have taken it yourself?"</p>
                  <p>"Certainly I do, ma'am," replied Jane, firmly, for she had now recovered her
                     self-possession. "I am perfectly innocent; and I am sure that, whatever
                     appearances there may be against me, you cannot believe me guilty—you do
                     not."</p>
                  <p>"And do you think to face me down in this way? I have evidence enough to
                     satisfy any court of justice. Was not you heard up in the night—your guilty
                     face told the story, at breakfast, plainer than words could tell it. David,"
                     she continued to her son, who had thrown down the paper and walked to the
                     window, where he stood with his back to his mother, affecting to whistle to a
                     dog without; "David, I call you to witness this handkerchief, and what has now
                     been said; and remember, she does not deny that she left it here."</p>
                  <p>One honest feeling had a momentary ascendency in David's bosom; and he had
                     risen from his seat with the determination to disclose the truth, but he was
                     checked by the recollection that he should be compelled to restore the money,
                     which he had not yet disposed of. He thought, too, that his mother knew, in her
                     heart, who had taken the money; that she would not dare to disclose her loss,
                     and if she did, it would be time enough for him to interpose when Jane should
                     be in danger of suffering otherwise than in the opinion of his mother, whose
                     opinion, he thought, not worth caring for. Therefore, when called upon by his
                     mother, he made no reply, but turning round and facing the accuser and the
                     accused, he looked as composed as any uninterested spectator.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson proceeded, "Restore me my money, or abide the consequences."</p>
                  <p>"The consequences I must abide, and I do not fear them,<pb n="148-149"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000074"/> nor shrink from them, for I am innocent, and God
                     will protect me."</p>
                  <p>At this moment they were interrupted by the entrance of Edward Erskine; and our
                     poor heroine, though the instant before she had felt assured and tranquil in
                     her panoply divine, burst into tears, and left the room. She could not endure
                     the thought of degradation in Erskine's esteem; and she was very sure that her
                     aunt would not lose such an opportunity of robbing her of his good opinion. She
                     did not mistake. Mrs. Wilson closed the door after Jane; and seating herself,
                     all unused as she was to the melting mood, gave way to a passion of tears and
                     sobs, which were, as we think, a sincere tribute to the loss she had
                     experienced.</p>
                  <p>"For Heaven's sake, tell me what is the matter?" said Erskine to young Wilson;
                     for his impatience for an explanation became irrepressible, not on account of
                     the old woman's emotion, for she might have wept till she was like Niobe, all
                     tears, without provoking an inquiry, but Jane's distress had excited his
                     anxiety.</p>
                  <p>"The Lord knows," replied David; "there is always a storm in this house;" and
                     he flung out of the room without vouchsafing a more explicit answer.</p>
                  <p>Erskine turned to Mrs. Wilson: "Can you tell me, madam, what has disturbed Miss
                     Elton?"</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson was provoked that he did not ask what had disturbed her, and she
                     determined he should not remain another moment without the communication, which
                     she had been turning over in her mind to get it in the most efficient form.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! Mr. Erskine," she said, with the abject whine of a hypocrite; "oh! my
                     trial is more than I can endure. I could bear they should devour me and lay
                     waste my dwelling-place place; I could be supported under that; but it is a
                     grief too heavy for me to reveal to you the sin, and the disgrace, and the
                     abomination, of one that I have brought up as my own—who has fed upon my
                     children's bread."</p>
                  <p>"Madam," interrupted Erskine, "you may spare yourself and me any more words. I
                     ask for the cause of all this excitement?"</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson would have replied angrily to what she thought Erskine's
                     impertinence; but, remembering that it was her business to conciliate not
                     offend him, she, after again almost exhausting his patience by protestations of
                     the hardship of being obliged to uncover the crimes of her relation, of the
                     affliction she suffered in doing her duty, &amp;c., &amp;c., told him with
                     every aggravation that emphasis and insinuation could lend to them, the
                     particulars of her discovery.</p>
                  <p>With unusual self-command he heard her through; and though he was unable to
                     account for the suspicious circumstances, he spurned instinctively the
                     conclusion Mrs. Wilson drew from them.</p>
                  <p>Her astonishment, that he neither expressed horror, nor indignation, nor
                     resentment towards the offender, was not at all abated when he only replied by
                     a request to speak alone with Miss Elton.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson thought he might intend the gathering storm should burst on Jane's
                     head; or, perhaps, he would advise her to fly; at any rate, it was not her cue,
                     to lay a straw in his way at present. She even went herself and gave the
                     request to Jane, adding to it a remark, that as she "was not very fond of
                     keeping out of Erskine's way, she could hardly refuse to come when asked."</p>
                  <p>"I have no wish to refuse;" replied Jane, who, ashamed of having betrayed so
                     much emotion, had quite recovered her<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7726-00000075"
                     /> self-possession, and stood calm in conscious integrity—"But hear me, ma'am,"
                     said she to her aunt, who had turned and was leaving the room—"all connection
                     between us is dissolved for ever; I shall not remain another night beneath a
                     roof where I have received little kindness, and where I now suffer the
                     imputation of a crime, of which I am certain you do not believe me guilty."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson was for a moment daunted by the power of unquestionable
                     innocence.—"I know not where I shall go, I know not whether your persecutions
                     will follow me; but I am not friendless—nor fearful."</p>
                  <p>She passed by her aunt, and descended to the parlour. 'No thought infirm
                     altered her cheek;" her countenance was very serious, but the peace of virtue
                     was there. Her voice did not falter in the least, when she said to Edward, as
                     he closed the door on her entrance into the parlour—"Mr. Erskine, you have no
                     doubt requested to see me in the expectation that I would contradict the
                     statement my aunt must have made to you. I cannot, for it is all true."</p>
                  <p>Edward interrupted her—"I do not wish it, Jane. I believe you are perfectly
                     innocent of that and of every other crime—I do not wish you even to deny it. It
                     is all a devilish contrivance of that wicked woman."</p>
                  <p>"You are mistaken, Edward; it is not a contrivance; the circumstances are as
                     she has told them to you: Elvira did not mistake in supposing she heard me up
                     in the night; and my aunt did find my handkerchief in her desk. No, Edward: she
                     is right in all but the conclusion she draws from these unfortunate
                     circumstances; perhaps," she added after a moment's pause, "a kinder judgment
                     would not absolve me."</p>
                  <p>"A saint," replied Edward cheeringly, "needs no absolution. No one shall be
                     permitted to accuse you, or suspect you; you can surely explain these
                     accidental circumstances, so that even your aunt, malicious—venomous as she is,
                     will not dare to breathe a poisonous insinuation against you, angel as you
                     are."</p>
                  <p>"Ah," replied Jane, with a sad smile, "there are and there ought to be, few
                     believers in earthborn angels. No, Mr. Erskine, I have no explanation to make:
                     I have nothing but assertions of my innocence, and my general character to rely
                     upon. Those who reject this evidence must believe me guilty."</p>
                  <p>She rose to leave the room. Erskine gently drew her back, and asked if it were
                     possible she included him among those who could be base enough to distrust her;
                     and before she could reply he went on to a passionate declaration of his
                     affections, followed by such promises of eternal truth, love, and fidelity, as
                     are usual on such occasions.</p>
                  <p>At another time, Jane would have paused to examine her heart, before she
                     accepted the profession made by her lover, and she would have found no
                     tenderness there that might not be controlled and subdued by reason. But now,
                     driven out from her natural protectors by suspicion and malignant accusation,
                     and touched by the confiding affection that refused to suspect her; the
                     generosity, the magnanimity that were presented in such striking contrast to
                     the baseness of her relations—she received Edward's declaration with the most
                     tender and ingenuous expression of gratitude; and Erskine did not doubt, nor
                     did Jane at that moment, that this gratitude was firmly rooted in love.</p>
                  <p>Edward, ardent and impetuous, proposed an immediate marriage: he argued, that
                     it was the only, and would be an effectual, way of protecting her from the
                     persecutions of her aunt.</p>
                  <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7726-00000076"/>
                  <p>Jane replied, that she had very little reason to fear that her aunt would
                     communicate to any other person her suspicions. "She had a motive towards you,"
                     she added, "that overcame her prudence. I have found a refuge in your heart,
                     and she cannot injure me while I have that asylum. I have too much pride,
                     Edward, to involve you in the reproach I may have to sustain. I had formed a
                     plan this morning, before your generosity translated me from despondency to
                     hope, which I must adhere to, for a few months at least. An application has
                     been made to me to teach some little girls who are not old enough for Mr.
                     Evertson's school: my aunt, as usual, put in her veto; I had almost made up my
                     mind to accept the proposal in spite of it, when the events of the morning came
                     to my aid, and decided me at once, and I have already announced to my aunt my
                     determination to leave her house. I trust that in few months something will
                     occur, to put me beyond the reach of suspicion, and reward as well as justify
                     your generous confidence."</p>
                  <p>Edward entreated—protested—argued—but all in vain; he was obliged at length to
                     resign his will to Jane's decision. Edward's next proposal was to announce the
                     engagement immediately. On this he insisted so earnestly, and offered for it so
                     many good reasons, that Jane consented. Mrs. Wilson was summoned to the
                     parlour, and informed of the issue of the conference, of which she had expected
                     so different a termination. She was surprised—mortified—and most of all,
                     wrathful—that her impotent victim, as she deemed Jane, should be rescued from
                     her grasp. She began the most violent threats and reproaches. Edward
                     interrupted her by telling her that she dare not repeat the first, and from the
                     last her niece would soon be for ever removed; as he should require they should
                     in future be perfect strangers. Mrs. Wilson felt like a wild animal just
                     encaged; she might lash herself to fury, but no one heeded her.</p>
                  <p>Edward left the room, saying, that he should send his servant to convey Jane's
                     baggage wherever she would order it to be sent. Jane went quietly to her own
                     apartment, to make the necessary arrangements; there she soon overheard the low
                     growlings of Mrs. Wilson's angriest voice, communicating, as she inferred from
                     the loud responsive exclamations and whimpering, her engagement to Elvira. Mrs.
                     Wilson's perturbed spirit was not quieted even by this outpouring; and after
                     walking up and down, scolding at the servant and the children, she put on her
                     hat and shawl, and sallied out to a shop, to pay a small debt she owed there.
                     No passion could exclude from her mind for any length of time the memory of so
                     disagreeable a circumstance as the necessity of paying out money. After she had
                     discharged the debt, and the master of the shop had given her the change, he
                     noticed her examining one of the bills he had handed her with a look of
                     scrutiny and some agitation. He said, "I believe that is a good bill, Mrs.
                     Wilson; I was a little suspicious of it too at first; I took it, this morning,
                     from your son David, in payment of a debt that has been standing more than a
                     year. I thought myself so lucky to get any thing, that I was not very
                     particular."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson's particularity seemed to have a sudden quietus, for she pushed the
                     bill into the full purse after the others, muttering something about the folly
                     of trusting boys being rightly punished by the loss of the debt.</p>
                  <p>The fact was, that Mrs. Wilson recognized this bill the moment she saw it, as
                     one of the parcel she had received the day before, and which she had marked, at
                     the time, for she was eagle-eyed in the detection of a spurious bill. There is
                        nothing<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7726-00000077"/> more subtle, more
                     inveterate than a habit of self-deception. It was not to the world alone that
                     Mrs. Wilson played the hypocrite, but before the tribunal of her own conscience
                     she appeared with hollow arguments and false pretences. From the moment she had
                     discovered her loss in the morning, she had, at bottom, believed David guilty;
                     she recollected the threats of the preceding day, and her first impulse was to
                     charge him with the theft, and to demand the money; but then, she thought, he
                     was violent and determined, and that without exposing him (even Mrs. Wilson
                     shrunk from the consequences of exposure to her son), she could not regain her
                     money. She was at a loss how to account for the appearance of Jane's
                     handkerchief; but neither that, nor Jane's subsequent emotion at the breakfast
                     table, nor her refusal to make any explanation of the suspicious circumstances,
                     enabled Mrs. Wilson to believe that Jane had borne any part in the dishonesty
                     of the transaction. Such was the involuntary tribute she paid to the tried,
                     steadfast virtue of this excellent being. Still she could not restrain the
                     whirlwind of her passion; and it burst, as we have seen, upon Jane. She was at
                     a loss to account for Jane's refusal to vindicate herself. It was impossible
                     for her to conceive of the reasons that controlled Jane. She could not see up
                     to such an elevation. She felt so fearful, at first, that any investigation
                     would lead to the discovery of the real criminal, that she had not communicated
                     the fact of the handkerchief to any one, even to Elvira; whose discretion,
                     indeed, she never trusted; but, after she found that Jane was in a dilemma,
                     from which she would not extricate herself by any explanations, she thought
                     herself the mistress of her niece's fate; and the moment she saw Erskine, she
                     determined to extract good out of the evil that had come upon her, to dim the
                     lustre of Jane's good name, that 'more immediate Jewel of her soul,' and thus
                     to secure for her daughter the contested prize. But Mrs. Wilson, it seems, was
                     destined to experience, on this eventful day, how very hard is the way of the
                     transgressor. Her niece's fortunes were suddenly placed beyond her control or
                     reach; and nothing remained of all her tyranny and plots, but the pitiful and
                     malignant pleasure of believing, that Jane thought herself in some measure in
                     her power, though she knew that she was not.</p>
                  <p>After the confirmation of her conjecture at the shop, she saw that secrecy was
                     absolutely necessary; and she was too discreet to indulge herself with telling
                     Elvira any of the particulars, about which she had been so vociferous to the
                     young lovers.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps few ladies, old or young, were ever less encumbered with baggage than
                     Jane Elton, and yet, so confused was she with the events of the night and
                     morning, that the labour of packing up, which at another time she would have
                     despatched in twenty minutes, seemed to have no more tendency to a termination
                     than such labours usually have in dreams. In the midst of her perplexities one
                     of the children entered and said Mr. Lloyd wished to speak to her. She was on
                     the point of sending him an excuse, for she felt an involuntary disinclination
                     to meet his penetrating eye at this moment, when recollecting how much she owed
                     to his constant, tender friendship, she subdued her reluctance, and obeyed his
                     summons. When she entered the room, "I am come," said he, "Jane, to ask thee to
                     walk with me. I am an idler and have nothing to do, and thou art so industrious
                     thou hast time to do every thing. Come, get thy hat. It is 'treason against
                     nature' sullenly to refuse to enjoy so beautiful a day as this." Jane made no
                     reply. He saw she was agitated, and leading<pb n="156-157"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000078"/> her gently to a chair, said, "I fear thou art
                     not well, or, what is much worse, not happy."</p>
                  <p>Jane would have replied, "I am not;" but she checked the words, for she felt as
                     if the sentiment they expressed, was a breach of fidelity to Erskine; and
                     instead of them she said, hesitatingly, "I ought not to be perfectly happy till
                     my best (I should say one of my best) friends knows and approves what I have
                     done this morning."</p>
                  <p>"What hast thou done, Jane?" exclaimed Mr. Lloyd, anticipating from her
                     extraordinary embarrassment and awkwardness the communication she was about to
                     make; "hast thou engaged thyself to Erskine?"</p>
                  <p>She faltered out, "Yes."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Lloyd made no reply: he rose and walked up and down the room, agitated, and
                     apparently distressed. Jane was alarmed; she could not account for his emotion;
                     she feared he had some ground for an ill opinion of Edward, that she was
                     ignorant of. "You do not like Edward?" said she; "you think I have done
                     wrong?"</p>
                  <p>The power of man is not limited in the moral as in the natural world. Habitual
                     discipline had given Mr. Lloyd such dominion over his feelings, that he was
                     able now to say to their stormy wave, 'thus far shalt thou come, and no
                     farther.' By a strong and sudden effort he recovered himself, and turning to
                     Jane, he took her hand with a benignant expression—"My dear Jane, thy own heart
                     must answer that question. Dost thou remember a favourite stanza of thine? <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"Nae treasures nor pleasures</l>
                           <l>Could make us happy lang;</l>
                           <l>The heart aye's the part aye</l>
                           <l>That makes us right or wrang."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Jane imagined that Mr. Lloyd felt a distrust of her motives. "Ah!" she replied,
                     "the integrity of my heart will fail to make me happy, if I have fallen under
                     your suspicion. If you knew the nobleness, the disinterestedness of Erskine's
                     conduct, you would be more just to him, and to me."</p>
                  <p>"It is not being very unjust to him, or to any one, to think him unworthy of
                     thee, Jane. But since these particulars would raise him so much in my opinion,
                     why not tell them to me? May not 'one of your best friends' claim to know, that
                     which affects, so deeply, your happiness?"</p>
                  <p>Jane began a reply, but hesitated, and faltered out something of its being
                     impossible for her to display to Mr. Lloyd, Erskine's generosity in the light
                     she saw it.</p>
                  <p>"Dost thou mean, Jane, that the light of truth is less favourable to him than
                     the light of imagination?"</p>
                  <p>"No," answered Jane; "such virtues as Edward's, shine with a light of their
                     own; imagination cannot enhance their value."</p>
                  <p>"Still," said Mr. Lloyd, "they shine but on one happy individual. Well, my dear
                     Jane," he continued, after a few moments' pause, "I will believe without
                     seeing. I will believe thou hast good reasons for thy faith, though they are
                     incommunicable. If Erskine make thee happy, I shall be satisfied."</p>
                  <p>Happily for both parties, this very unsatisfactory conference was broken off by
                     the entrance of Erskine's servant, who came, as he said, for Miss Elton's
                     baggage. Jane explained, as concisely as possible, to Mr. Lloyd, her plans for
                     the present, and then took advantage of this opportunity to retreat to her own
                     apartment, which she had no sooner entered than she gave way to a flood of
                     tears, more bitter than any her aunt's injustice had cost her. She had,
                     previous to her interview<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7726-00000079"/> view with
                     Mr. Lloyd, determined not to disclose to him, or Mary Hull, the disagreeable
                     affair of the robbery. She wished to spare them the pain which the knowledge of
                     a perplexity from which they could not extricate her, must give to them. She
                     was sure Mary, whose discernment was very quick, and who knew David well,
                     would, at once, suspect him; and therefore, she thought, that in telling the
                     story, she should violate the spirit of her promise; and, at bottom, she felt a
                     lurking apprehension that Mr. Lloyd might think there was more of gratitude
                     than affection in her feelings to Erskine; she thought it possible, too, he
                     might not estimate Edward's magnanimity quite as highly as she did; for
                     "though," she said, "Mr. Lloyd has the fairest mind in the world, I think he
                     has never liked Erskine. They are, certainly, very different"—and she sighed as
                     she concluded her deliberations.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Lloyd, after remaining for a few moments in the posture Jane had left him,
                     returned to his own home, abstracted and sad. 'The breath of Heaven smelt as
                     wooingly,' and the sun shone as brightly as before, but there was now no
                     feeling of joy within to vibrate to the beauty without; and he certainly could
                     not be acquitted of the 'sullen neglect of nature,' that he had deemed treason
                     an hour before.</p>
                  <p>"I knew," thought he, "she was fallible, and why should I be surprised at her
                     failure? It cannot be Erskine, but the creature of her imagination, that she
                     loves. She is too young to possess the Ithuriel touch that dissolves false
                     appearances: she could not detect, under so specious a garb, the vanity and
                     selfishness that counterfeit manly pride and benevolence. If he were but worthy
                     of her, I should be perfectly happy."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Lloyd mistook; he would not, even in that case, have been perfectly happy.
                     He did not, though he was very much of a self-examiner, clearly define all his
                     feelings on this trying occasion. He had loved Jane first as a child, and then
                     as a sister; and of late he had thought if he could love another woman, as a
                     wife, it would be Jane Elton. But his lost Rebecca was more present to his
                     imagination than any living being. He had formed no project for himself in
                     relation to Jane; yet he would have felt disappointment at her appropriation to
                     any other person, though, certainly, not the sorrow which her engagement to
                     Erskine occasioned him. Mr. Lloyd was really a disinterested man. He had so
                     long made it a rule to imitate the Parent of the universe, in still educing
                     good from evil, that, in every trial of his life, it was his first aim to
                     ascertain his duty, and then to perform it. He could weave the happiness of
                     others, though no thread of his own was in the fabric. In the present case, he
                     resolved still to watch over Jane; to win the friendship of Erskine, to
                     endeavor to rectify his principles, to exert over him an insensible influence,
                     and, if possible, to render him more worthy of his enviable destiny.</p>
                  <p>In the course of the day, Mary Hull heard the rumours that had already spread
                     through the village, of Jane's removal to Mrs. Harvey's, and her engagement.
                     She ran to the library door, and in the fulness of her heart, forgetful of the
                     decorum of knocking, she entered and found Mr. Lloyd sitting with his little
                     girl on his knee. "Mary, I am glad to see thee," said the child; "I cannot get
                     a word from father; he is just as if he was asleep, only his eyes are wide
                     open."</p>
                  <p>Mary, regardless of the child's prattle, announced the news she had just heard.
                     Mr. Lloyd coldly replied, that he knew it already; and Mary left the room, a
                     little hurt that he had not condescended to tell her, and wondering what made
                     him so indifferent, and then wondering whether it was indifference; but as she
                     could not relieve her mind, she<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7726-00000080"/>
                     resolved to go immediately to Jane, with whom the habits of their early lives,
                     and her continued kindness, had given and established the right of free
                     intercourse.</p>
                  <p>She found Jane alone, and not looking as happy as she expected. "You have come
                     to give me joy, Mary," she said, smiling mournfully as she extended her hand to
                     her friend.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," replied Mary, "I came with that intention, and you look as if joy was
                     yet to be given. Well," she continued after a pause, "I always thought you and
                     Mr. Lloyd were different from any body else in the world, but now you puzzle me
                     more than ever. I expected to see your aunt Wilson look grum—that's natural to
                     her, when any good befalls any one else; and Elvira, who every body knows has
                     been setting her cap every way for Erskine, ever since she was old enough to
                     think of a husband: she has a right to have her eyes as red as a ferret's. But
                     there is Mr. Lloyd, looking as sorrowful as if he had seen some great trouble,
                     and could not relieve it; and you, my dear child, I have seen you pass through
                     many a dark passage of your life with a happier face than you wear now, when
                     you are going to have the pride of the county for your husband, to be mistress
                     of the beautiful house on the hill, and have every thing heart can desire."</p>
                  <p>Jane made no explanation nor reply, and after a few moments' consideration Mary
                     proceeded—"To be sure, I could wish Erskine was more like Mr. Lloyd; but then
                     he is six or eight years younger than Mr. Lloyd, and in that time, with your
                     tutoring, you may make him a good deal like Mr. Lloyd (Mr. Lloyd was Mary's
                     beau-ideal of a man); that is, if your endeavours are blessed. It is true, I
                     always thought you would not marry any man that was not religious; not but what
                     'tis allowable, for even professors do it; but then, Jane, you are more
                     particular and consistent than a great many professors; and, I know, you think
                     there is nothing binds hearts together like religion—that bond endures where
                     there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage."</p>
                  <p>Poor Jane had listened to Mary's pros and cons with considerable calmness; but
                     now she laid her head in her friend's lap, and gave vent to the feelings she
                     had been all day arguing down, by a flood of tears. "Ah! my dear Jane, is it
                        <emph>there</emph> the shoe pinches? I an't sorry to find you have thought
                     of it though. If the 'candle of the Lord' is lighted up in the heart, we ought
                     to look at every thing by that light. But now you have decided, turn to the
                     bright side. I don't know much about Mr. Erskine; he is called a nice young
                     man, and who knows what he may become, when he sees how good and how beautiful
                     it is to have the whole heart and life ordered and governed by the christian
                     rule. I often think to myself, Jane, that your life, and Mr. Lloyd's too, are
                     better than preaching. Don't take on so, my child," she continued, soothingly;
                     "you have Scripture for you; for the Bible says, 'the believing wife may
                     sanctify the unbelieving husband;' and that must mean that her counsel and
                     example shall win him back to the right way, and persuade him to walk in the
                     paths of holiness. Cheer up, my child, there is good missionary work before
                     you; and I feel as if you had many happy days to come yet. Those that sow in
                     tears, shall reap with joy. It is a load off my mind, at any rate, that you are
                     away from your aunt's, and under good Mrs. Harvey's roof. I stopped at your
                     aunt's on my way here, and she raised a hue and cry about your leaving her
                     house so suddenly; she said, your grand fortune had turned your head; 'she was
                     not disappointed, she had never expected any gratitude from you! but 'twas not
                     for worldly hire she did her duty!' Poor, poor soul! I would not judge her
                     uncharitably; but I do<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7726-00000081"/> believe she
                     has the 'hope that will perish.' I just took no notice of her, and came away.
                     As I was passing through the kitchen, Sukey says to me, 'Mrs. Wilson may look
                     out for other <emph>help,</emph> for now Miss Jane is gone out from us, I
                     shan't stay to hear nothing but disputings, and scoldings, and prayers.' 'But,'
                     says I, 'Sukey, you don't object to the prayers?' 'Yes,' says she, 'I don't
                     like lip prayers—it is nothing but a mockery.'"</p>
                  <p>"Sukey has too much reason," replied Jane. "But now, Mary, you must not think
                     from what you have seen that I am not happy, for I have reason to be grateful,
                     and I ought to be very, very happy."</p>
                  <p>'<emph>Ought,</emph>' thought Mary, 'she may be <emph>contented,</emph> and
                        <emph>resigned,</emph> and even <emph>cheerful,</emph> because she
                        <emph>ought</emph>—but happiness is not duty-work.' However, she had
                     discretion enough to suppress her homely metaphysics; and patting Jane's head
                     affectionately, she replied, "Yes, my child, and if you wish it, I will set
                     these tears down for tears of joy, not sorrow." Jane smiled at her friend's
                     unwonted sophistry, and they parted: Mary, confirmed in a favourite notion,
                     that every allotment of Providence is designed as a trial for the character;
                     that all will finally work together for good; and that Jane was going on in the
                     path to perfection, which, though no Methodist, she was not (in her partial
                     friend's opinion) far from attaining. Jane was very much relieved by Mary's
                     wise suggestions and sincere sympathy.</p>
                  <p>A sagacious observer of human nature and fortunes has said, that "if there were
                     more knowledge, there would be less envy." The history of our heroine is a
                     striking exemplification of the truth of this remark: when all was darkness
                     without, she had been looked upon by the compassionate as an object of pity,
                     for they could not see the sunshine of the breast; and now that she was
                     considered as the chief favourite of the fickle goddess, there was not one that
                     would have envied her, if the internal conflict she suffered—if that most
                     unpleasant of all feelings, disagreement with herself, had been as visible as
                     her external fortunes were.</p>
                  <p>Erskine was in too good humour with himself, and with Jane, to find fault with
                     any thing: yet he certainly was a little disappointed, that in spite of his
                     earnest persuasions to the contrary, she firmly persisted in the plan of the
                     school; and we fear he was surprised, perhaps slightly mortified, that she
                     showed no more joy at having secured a hand and a station, to which he knew so
                     many had aspired.</p>

                  <p>JANE entered upon the duties of her new vocation with more energy and interest
                     than could have been reasonably expected from a young lady who had so recently
                     entered into an engagement of marriage, and one which opened upon her the most
                     flattering prospects. She already felt the benefits resulting from the severe
                     discipline she had suffered in her aunt's family. She had a rare habit of
                     putting <emph>self</emph> aside; of deferring her own inclinations to the will,
                     and interests, and inclinations of others. A superficial survey of the human
                     mind in all its diversity of conditions, will convince us that it may be
                     trained to any thing; else, how shall we account for the proud exultation of a
                     savage amidst the cruellest tortures his triumphant enemy can inflict; or for
                     any of the wonderful phenomena of enterprise, of fortitude, of patience, in
                     beings whose physical natures are so constituted, that they instinctively
                     shrink from suffering?</p>
                  <p>Our fair young readers (if any of that class condescend to read this unromantic
                     tale) will smile at the idea that Jane had any farther occasion for the virtues
                     of adversity; but she was far from being happy; she had not that firm
                     confidence in the character of her lover that could alone have inspired the joy
                     of hope, and secured a quiet spirit. Since her engagement, and even before, and
                     ever since she had been interested in Erskine, she had not dared to sound the
                     depths of her heart. Though quite a novice in the experience of love, she would
                     have been able to detect its subtleties; she would have been able to ascertain
                     the nature, and amount of her affection for Erskine, had she not been driven by
                     his apparent magnanimity, and the oppression of her relations, to a sudden
                     decision. We appeal then once more to our fair young readers, and trust their
                     justice will award to our heroine some praise, for her spirited and patient
                     performance of her duties to her young pupils, who were very far from imagining
                     that their kind and gentle teacher had any thing in the world to trouble her,
                     or to engage her mind, but their wants and pursuits.</p>
                  <p>Her disquietude did not escape the quickened vision of her vigilant friend Mr.
                     Lloyd; he observed the shadows of anxiety settling on her usually bright and
                     cheerful countenance, but even he had no conception of the extent of her busy
                     apprehensions and secret misgivings.</p>
                  <p>Week after week passed away, and there seemed to be no prospect that any thing
                     would occur to free Jane from the very unpleasant situation in which her aunt's
                     accusations had placed her. Erskine became restless and impatient, derided all
                     Jane's arguments in favor of delaying their marriage, and finally affected to
                     distrust her affection for him. If the undefined, and undefinable sentiment
                     which was compounded in Jane's heart of youthful preference and gratitude, was
                        not<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7726-00000083"/> love, Jane believed it was,
                     and she at last yielded a reluctant consent, that the marriage should take
                     place at the end of three months, even though nothing should occur to release
                     her from her aunt's power.</p>
                  <p>It was a few days after this promise had been given, that as she was one day
                     returning from her school, Erskine joined her.—"Your friend Robert Lloyd," said
                     he, "has taken a mighty fancy to me of late—I cannot conceive what is the
                     reason of it."</p>
                  <p>Jane blushed, for she thought he might have guessed the reason. "I am glad of
                     it," she replied," for he seems to have withdrawn from me, and you are the only
                     person, Edward, to whom I should be willing to relinquish any portion of Mr.
                     Lloyd's regard."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, Jane! you need not be alarmed; he and I should never mix, any more than
                     oil and vinegar."</p>
                  <p>"I am sorry for that; but which is the oil, and which is the vinegar?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, he is the oil, soft—neutralizing—rather tasteless; while I, you know, have
                     a character of my own—am positive—am—but perhaps it would not be quite modest
                     for me to finish the parallel. To confess the truth to you, Jane, I have always
                     had an aversion to Quakers; they are a very hypocritical sect, depend upon it;
                     pretending, sly, avaricious, cheating rogues."</p>
                  <p>"That's a harsh judgment," replied Jane, with some warmth, "and a prejudice, I
                     think: is not Mr. Lloyd the only Quaker you know?"</p>
                  <p>"Why—ye—yes, the only one I know much of."</p>
                  <p>"And does he justify your opinion?"</p>
                  <p>"I don't know: it takes a great while to find them out; and even if Lloyd
                     should be what he would seem, the exception only proves the rule. I have always
                     disliked Quakers. I remember a story my father used to tell, when I was a
                     child, about his being overreached in a most ingenious, practised manner, by
                     one of the sly-boots, as he called the whole race. It was not an affair of any
                     great moment; but no man likes to be outwitted in a bargain, and my father used
                     to say it gave him an antipathy to the very name of a Quaker."</p>
                  <p>"I think your father was in fault," replied Jane, "so carelessly to implant a
                     prejudice, which, as it seems to have had very slight ground, I trust has not
                     taken such deep root that it cannot he eradicated."</p>
                  <p>"There is more reason in my judgment than you give me credit for," replied
                     Edward pettishly. "If they are an upright, frank people, why is the world kept
                     in ignorance of their belief? The Quakers have no creed; and though I have no
                     great faith in the professors of any sect, yet they ought to let you know what
                     they do think; it is fair and above board. You may depend upon it, Jane, the
                     Quakers are a jesuitical people."</p>
                  <p>"Have you ever read any of their books?" inquired Jane.</p>
                  <p>"I read them!" he replied, laughing; "why, my dear girl, do you take me for a
                     theologian? No—I never read the books of any sect; and Quaker books, I believe
                     there are not. Quaker books!" he continued, still laughing, "no, no—I shall
                     never addict myself to divinity, till Ann Ratcliffe writes sermons, and Tom
                     Moore warbles hymns."</p>
                  <p>Jane did not join in his laugh; but replied, "There is a book, Edward, that
                     contains the creed of the Quakers: a creed to which they have never presumed to
                     add any thing, nor have they taken any thing from it; the only creed to which
                     they think it right to require the assent of man, and<pb n="168-169"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000084"/> from which no rational man can dissent—that book
                     is <emph>the Bible!</emph> and," she continued, earnestly, "their faith in this
                     creed is shown by their works. My dear Edward, examine their history for their
                     vindication."</p>
                  <p>"That I need not, while their cause has so fair a champion."</p>
                  <p>"Spare me your sarcasms, Edward, and let me entreat you to look at the life of
                     their wise and excellent Penn. See him patiently and firmly enduring
                     persecution, and calumny, and oppression at home; giving up his time, his
                     fortune, his liberty, to the cause of suffering humanity, in every mode of its
                     appeal to his benevolence. Follow him with his colony to the wilderness, and
                     see him the only one of all the colonial leaders, (I grieve that I cannot

                      the only one who treated the natives of the land with justice and
                     mercy. Our fathers, Edward, refused to acknowledge the image of God in the poor
                     Indian. They affected to believe they were the children of the evil one, and
                     hunted them like beasts of prey, calling them 'worse than Scythian wolves;'
                     while Penn, and his peaceful people, won their confidence, their devotion, by
                     treating them with even-handed justice, with brotherly kindness; and they had
                     their reward; they lived unharmed among them, without forts, without a weapon
                     of defence. Is it not the Friends that have been foremost and most active in
                     efforts for the abolition of slavery? Among what people do we find most
                     reformers of the prisons—guardians of the poor and the oppressed—most of those
                     who 'remember the forgotten, and attend to the neglected—who dive into the
                     depths of dungeons, and plunge into the infection of hospitals?'"</p>

                     your glowing cheek. I think friendship is a stronger feeling in your heart than
                     love, Jane," he continued, with a penetrating look that certainly did not abate
                     the carnation of her cheek. "If I, and all my ancestors had gone on crusades
                     and pilgrimages, the spirit would not have moved you to such enthusiasm in our
                     cause, as you manifest for the broad-brimmed, straight-coated brethren of
                        <emph>friend Lloyd.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Edward, have you yet to learn of me, that I speak least of what I feel
                     most?"</p>
                  <p>The gentleness of Jane's manner, and the tenderness of her voice, soothed her
                     lover; and he replied, "Forgive me, dear Jane, a little jealousy; you know
                     jealousy argues love. To confess to you the honest truth, I felt a little more
                     ticklish than usual, this evening, on the subject of quakerism. I had just
                     parted with Mr. Lloyd; and he has been earnestly recommending to me, to
                     undertake a reform in our poor-laws, by which he thinks, that we should rid
                     ourselves of the burden of supporting many who are not necessarily dependent on
                     us, and improve the condition of those who are. The plan seems to me to be good
                     and feasible."</p>
                  <p>"And what then, Edward, provoked your displeasure?"</p>
                  <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7726-00000085"/>
                  <p>"Why, he wished me to take the whole conduct of it. He preferred that the plan
                     should appear to originate with me; that I should head a petition to the
                     Legislature; and if we succeeded, that I shall superintend the execution of the
                     plan."</p>
                  <p>"Still, dear Edward, I see any thing but offence in all this."</p>
                  <p>"Because your eye-sight is a little dimmed by your partiality. Do you believe,
                     Jane, that any man would be willing to transfer to another all the merit and
                     praise of a scheme, which, if it succeed, will be a most important benefit to
                     the community; will be felt, and noticed, and applauded by every body? No—there
                     is some design lurking under this specious garb of
                     disinterestedness—disinterestedness! it only exists in the visions of poets, or
                     the Utopian dreams of youth; or, perhaps, embodied in the fine person of a hero
                     of romance."</p>
                  <p>Oh! my dear Edward, it does exist; it is the principle, the spirit of the
                     Christian!"</p>
                  <p>"<emph>For example</emph>—of your aunt Wilson, and of sundry other stanch
                     professors I could mention, who, <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"'If <emph>self</emph> the wavering balance shake,</l>
                           <l>It's <emph>never</emph> right adjusted.'"</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>"Is it fair," replied Jane, "to condemn a whole class because some of its
                     members are faithless and disloyal? A commander does but <emph>decimate</emph>
                     a mutinous corps; and you exclude the whole from your confidence, because a few
                     are treacherous. I allow," continued Jane, "there are a few, very few, who are
                     perfectly disinterested; but every Christian, in proportion to his fidelity to
                     the teachings and example ple of his Master, will be moved and governed by this
                     principle."</p>
                  <p>Perhaps Edward felt a passing conviction of the truth of Jane's assertions; at
                     any rate, he made no reply, and afterwards he shunned the subject; and even
                     Jane seemed to shrink from it as one upon which they had no common feeling.</p>
                  <p>The day before entering on the duties of her second school-term, Jane
                     determined to indulge herself in a solitary walk to the cottage of old John of
                     the Mountain. She had purchased some comforts for the old people, with a part
                     of her small earnings, and she knew if she carried them herself she should
                     double their value. She found the way without difficulty, for her night-walk
                     had indelibly impressed it on her memory. On her approach to the cottage, and
                     as she emerged from the wood, she perceived just on its verge a slight rising
                     in the form of a grave; a wild rose-bush grew beside it. Jane paused for a
                     moment, and plucking one of the flowers, she said, "fragrant and transient,
                     thou art a fit emblem of the blasted flower below!" As she turned from the
                     grave, she perceived that a magical change had been wrought upon John's hut.
                     Instead of a scarcely habitable dwelling, of decayed logs, filled in with mud,
                     she saw a neat little framed house, with a fence around it, and a small garden
                     annexed to it, inclosed with a post and rail fence of neat construction. Jane
                     hastened forward, and entered the cottage with the light step of one who goes
                     on an errand of kindness.</p>
                  <p>"Who would have thought," said the good dame, as she dusted a chair and handed
                     it to Jane, "of your coming all this way to see whether we were above ground
                     yet?"</p>
                  <p>"Ah," said John, 'there are some in this world, a precious<pb n="172-173"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000086"/> cious few, who remember those that every body
                     else forgets."</p>
                  <p>"I could not forget you, my good friends," replied Jane, "though John does not
                     come any more to put me in mind of you."</p>
                  <p>"Why, Miss Jane," said John, "I grow old, and I have been but twice to the
                     village since that mournful night you was here, and then I was in such a
                     worrying matter that I did not think even of you."</p>
                  <p>"What have you had to disturb you?" inquired Jane. "I hoped from finding you in
                     this nice new house that all had gone well since I saw you."</p>
                  <p>"Ah," replied John, "I have been greatly favoured; but the storm came before
                     the calm. Miss Jane, did you never hear of my <emph>law-suit?</emph> the whole
                     town was alive with it."</p>
                  <p>Jane assured John that she had never heard a word of it; that she had a little
                     school to take care of; and that she saw very few persons, and heard little
                     village news, even when it was as important as his law-suit.</p>
                  <p>"Then, Miss Jane," said John, "if you have time and patience to hear an old
                     man's story, I will tell you mine. It is fifty years since my old woman and I
                     settled down in these woods. Like all our fellow-creatures, we have had our
                     portion of storms and sunshine: it has pleased the Lord to lop off all our
                     branches, to cut down the little saplings that grew up at our feet, and leave
                     us two lonely and bare trunks, to feel, and resist the winds of heaven as we
                     may: two old evergreens," he continued, with a melancholy smile, "that flourish
                     when every thing has faded about them. Yes, fifty years I have seen the sun
                     come over that mountain every morning; and there is not a tree in all these
                     thick woods but it seems like an old friend to me. Here my sons and daughters
                     have been born to me, and here I have buried them, all but poor Jem, who you
                     know was lost at sea. They died when they were but little children, and nobody
                     remembers them but us; but they are as fresh in our minds as if it was but
                     yesterday they were playing about us, with their laughing eyes and rosy cheeks.
                     This has not much to do with my lawsuit," continued John, after a pause, and
                     clearing his voice, "only that I shall want some excuse for loving the old spot
                     so well before I get through with my story. I hired this bit of land of a man
                     that's been dead twenty years, and it has changed hands many a time since, but
                     I have always been able to satisfy for the rent; it was but a trifle, for no
                     one but I would fancy the place. Lately it's come into the hands of the two
                     young Woodhulls, by the death of the Deacon their father. They are two
                     hard-favoured, hardhearted, wild young chaps, Miss Jane, that think all the
                     world was made for them, and their pleasure. If my memory serves me, it was
                     just one week after you was here, that they were up hunting in these woods with
                     young Squire Erskine. John, the eldest, took aim at a robin that was singing on
                     the tree just before my door: it had built its nest there early in the summer:
                     we had fed it with crumbs from our table, and it was as tame as a chicken. I
                     told this to them, and begged the little innocent's life so earnestly, that the
                     boys laughed, but Erskine said, 'Let the old man have his way.' They said it
                     was nonsense to give up to my whims, and told me to take away my hand, (for I
                     had raised it up to protect the nest,) or they would fire through it. I did
                     take it away, and the nest with it, and brought it into the house. They came
                     swearing in, and demanded the bird. I refused to give it up; they grew more and
                     more angry: may be Erskine might have brought them to reason, but he had walked
                        away.<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7726-00000087"/> They said it was their
                     land, and their bird, and they would not be thwarted by me; and they called me,
                     and my wife too, many a name that was too bad for a decent person's ear. They
                     worked themselves up to a fury, and then warned me off the ground. I made no
                     reply; for I thought when they got over their passion they'd forget it. But
                     they returned the next day with handspikes, and threatened to pull the house
                     down on our heads, if we did not come out of it. <choice>
                        <sic>I I</sic>
                        <corr>I</corr>
                     </choice> have had a proud spirit in my day, Miss Jane, but old age and
                     weakness have tamed it. I begged them to spare us our little dwelling, with
                     tears in my eyes; and my poor old woman prayed she might bring out the few
                        <emph>goods</emph> we had; but oh! 'a fool in his folly is like a bear
                     robbed of her whelps.' They said they would dust our <emph>goods</emph> for us;
                     and so we came out and turned away our faces; but we heard the old house that
                     had sheltered us so long crumble to pieces, as you would crush an egg-shell in
                     your hand; yes, and we heard their loud deriding laugh; but thank the Lord, we
                     were too far off, to hear the jokes they passed between every peal of laughter.
                     Ah, there is more hope of any thing than of a hard heart in a young body."</p>
                  <p>"Can it be possible," interrupted Jane, "that for so slight a cause the
                     Woodhulls could do you such an injury?"</p>
                  <p>"It is even so," replied John; "youth is headstrong, and will not bear
                     crossing."</p>
                  <p>"But where did you find a shelter?"</p>
                  <p>"I led my wife down the other side of the mountain, to one Billy Downie's, a
                     soft feeling creature, who has more goodness in his heart than wit in his head,
                     and he made us kindly welcome. I left my wife there, and the next day I came
                     over to the village, to see if the law would give me justice of those that had
                     no mercy. I should have gone to Squire Erskine with my case, for knew he was
                     called a fine pleader, though he is too wordy to suit me—but he was a friend of
                     the Woodhulls, and so I applied to the stranger that's lately moved in: he
                     proved a raw hand. The trial was appointed for the next Saturday. The day came;
                     and all the men in the village were collected at the tavern, for Erskine was to
                     plead for the Woodhulls, and every body likes to hear his silver tongue."</p>
                  <p>"Erskine plead for the Woodhulls!" exclaimed Jane.</p>
                  <p>"Oh yes, Miss Jane; for, as I told you, they are very thick. My attorney was a
                     kind of a 'prentice-workman at the law; he was afraid of Erskine too; and he
                     stammered, and said one thing and meant another, and made such a jingle of it,
                     I could not wonder the justice and the people did not think I had a good claim
                     for damages. But still, the plain story was so much against the Woodhulls, and
                     the people of the village are so friendly-like to me, that it is rather my
                     belief I should have been righted, if Erskine had not poured out such a power
                     of words, that he seemed to take away people's senses. He started with what he
                     called a proverb of the law, and repeated it so many times, I think I can never
                     forget it, for it seemed to be the hook he hung all his argufying upon. It was
                        '<foreign xml:lang="LAT">cujus est solum, ejus est usque ad
                     cœlum,</foreign>' (we have taken the liberty slightly to correct the old man's
                     quotation of the Latin;) which, if I rightly understood it, means, that whoever
                     owns the soil, owns all above it to the sky; and though it stands to reason it
                     can't be so, yet Erskine's fine oration put reason quite out of the question;
                     and so the justice decided that the Woodhulls had a right to do what seemed
                     good in their own eyes with my furniture; and then he gave me a bit of an
                     exhortation, and told me I should never make out well in the world, if I did
                     not know more of<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7726-00000088"/> the laws of the
                     land! and concluded with saying, I ought to be very thankful I had so little to
                     be destroyed. I said nothing; but I thought it was late in the day for me to
                     study the laws of the land; and my mite was as much to me as his abundance to
                     him. When the trial was over, Erskine and the Woodhulls invited the justice and
                     the company in the bar-room to treat them; and through the open door I heard
                     Erskine propose a bumper to those who knew how to maintain their rights. "No,"
                     Woodhull said, "it should be to him who knew how to defend a friend"—right or
                     wrong, thought I. But," said John, pausing, "my story is too long for you Miss
                     Jane."</p>
                  <p>Jane had turned away her head; she now assured John she was listening to every
                     word he said, and begged him to go on.</p>
                  <p>"Well, miss, I thought I was alone in the room, and I just let out my heart, as
                     you know a body will when he thinks there is no eye but His that's above, sees
                     him. I saw nothing before Sarah and I, but to go upon the town, and that's what
                     I always had a dread of; for, though I have been a poor man all my life, Miss
                     Jane, what I had was my own. I have been but weakly since I was a boy, but my
                     woman and I have been sober and industrious. We have always had a shelter for
                     ourselves; and sometimes, too, for a poor houseless creature that had not a
                     better; and we wanted but little, and we were independent: and then you know,
                     what the town gives is neither given or taken with a good will. Well, as I
                     said, I thought I was alone in the room; but I heard a slight noise behind me,
                     and there was one who had not followed the multitude; he had a clear open face,
                     and <emph>that look</emph>—I can't justly describe it, Miss Jane, but it seems
                     as if it was the light of good deeds sent back again; or, may be, the seal the
                     Lord puts upon his own children—and pity and kindness seemed writ in every line
                     of his face. Do you know who I mean?"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Lloyd," she replied, in a scarcely audible voice.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes—any body that had ever seen him would guess. He beckoned to me to
                     shut the door, and asked me if I had any particular attachment to this spot;
                     and I owned to him, as I have to you, my childishness about it; and he smiled,
                     and said he was afraid I was too old to be cured of it; and then asked, if I
                     believed I could persuade the young men to sell as much of the land as I should
                     want. I was sure I could, for I know they are wasteful and ravenous for money,
                     and besides they had had their own will, and the land was of no use to them.
                     And then he told me, Miss Jane, that he would give me the money for the land,
                     if I could make a bargain with the Woodhulls, and enough besides to build me a
                     comfortable little house. I could not thank him—I tried, but I could not; and
                     so he just squeezed my hand and said, he understood me—and charged me to keep
                     it a secret where I got help; and I have minded him till this day, but I could
                     not keep it from you."</p>
                  <p>"You'd better stop now, John," said the old woman, "for the long walk, and the
                     long story, have quite overdone Miss Jane; she looks tired out, and pale and
                     red in a minute."</p>
                  <p>Jane was obliged to own she did not feel well; but after drinking some water,
                     she made an effort to compose herself and asked the old man, "What reason he
                     had to think the Woodhulls and Erskine were intimate friends?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, did you never hear, miss, that it was Erskine that got John Woodhull
                     clear when Betsy Davis sued him for breach of promise? I was summoned to court
                     as a witness. It was a terrible black business; but Erskine made it all smooth;
                     and after the trial was past, I overheard these chaps<pb n="178-179"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000089"/> flattering Erskine till they made him believe he
                     was more than mortal. At any rate, they put such a mist before his eyes, that
                     he could not see to choose good from evil, else he never would have chosen them
                     for his companions; he never would have been led to spend night after night
                     with them at the gambling club."</p>
                  <p>"At the gambling club, John!—where—what do you mean?" and poor Jane clasped her
                     hands together, and looked at him with an expression of such wretchedness, that
                     the old man turned his eyes from her to his wife and back again to Jane, as if
                     he would, but durst not, inquire the reason of her emotion.</p>
                  <p>"I have done wrong," he stammered out, "old fool that I was. Erskine is your
                        <emph>friend,</emph> Miss Jane. The Lord forgive me," he added, rising and
                     walking to the door. Jane had risen also, and with a trembling hand was tying
                     on her hat. "And the Lord help thee, child," he continued, turning again
                     towards her, "and keep thee from every snare. Well, well!—I never should have
                     thought it."</p>
                  <p>Jane felt humbled by the old man's sympathy; and yet it was too sincere, too
                     kindly felt, to be repressed. She was hastening away, when Sarah said, "You
                     have forgotten your bundle, miss."</p>
                  <p>"It is for you, my good friend," she replied; and, without awaiting their
                     thanks, she bade them farewell, and was soon out of sight of the old man, whose
                     eye followed her quick footsteps till she was hid by the adjoining wood. He
                     then turned from the door, and raised his hands and his faded eyes, glistening
                     with the gathering tears, to Heaven—"Oh Lord!" he exclaimed, "have mercy on thy
                     young servant. Suffer not this child of light to be yoked to a child of
                     darkness."</p>
                  <p>We believe that, in all classes and conditions, women are more inclined than
                     men to look on the bright side of marriage. In this case Sarah, after a little
                     consideration, said, "I'm thinking, John, you take on too much; you are
                     borrowing trouble for Miss Jane. She is a wise, discreet young body, and she
                     may cure Mr. Erskine of his faults. Besides, if he does go astray a little,
                     that's no uncommon thing for a young man; he is not wicked and hard-hearted
                     like the Woodhulls."</p>
                  <p>"No, no, Sarah, he an't so bad as the Woodhulls, but he has been a spoilt child
                     from the beginning: he is a comely man to look to, and he has a glib tongue in
                     his head; but he is all for self—all for self, Sarah. You might as well
                     undertake to make the stiff branches of that old oak tender and pliable as the
                     sprouts of the sapling that grows beside it, as to expect Miss Jane can alter
                     Erskine. No—He alone can do it with whom all things are possible. We have no
                     right to expect a miracle. She has no call to walk upon the sea, and we cannot
                     hope a hand will be stretched out to keep her from sinking. It is the girl's
                     beauty has caught him; and when that is gone, and it is a quickly fading
                     flower, she will have no hold whatever on him."</p>
                  <p>We know not how long the old man indulged in his reflections, for he was not
                     again interrupted by Sarah, whose deference for her husband's superior sagacity
                     seems to have been more habitual than even her namesake's of old.</p>
                  <p>Our unhappy heroine pursued her way home, her mind filled with 'thick coming'
                     and bitter fancies, revolving over and over again the circumstances of John's
                     narrative. He had thrown a new light on the character of her lover; and she
                     blamed herself, that faults had seemed so dim to her, which were now so
                     glaring. She was not far from coming to the result, which, we trust, our
                     readers have expected from the<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7726-00000090"/>
                     integrity and purity of her character. "If I had remained ignorant of his
                     faults," she thought, "I should have had some excuse: I might then have hoped
                     for assistance and blessing in my attempts to reform him. It would be
                     presumption to trust, now, in any efforts I could make; and what right have I,
                     with my eyes open, to rush into a situation where my own weak virtues may be
                     subdued by trials——must be assailed by temptation? Oh! when I heard him speak
                     lightly of religion, how could I hope he would submit to its requisitions and
                     restraints? I started at the first thought, that he was unprincipled; and yet I
                     have always known there was no immovable basis for principle, but religion.
                     Selfish—vain—how could I love him? And yet—and she looked at the other side of
                     the picture—his preference of me was purely disinterested—an
                     orphan—destitute—almost an outcast—liable to degradation—and he has exposed
                     himself to all the obloquy I may suffer—and does he not deserve the devotion of
                     my life?" A moment before, she would have answered her self-interrogation in
                     the negative; but now she seemed losing herself in a labyrinth of opposing
                     duties. She thought that she ought not to place implicit reliance in John's
                     statements. He might have exaggerated Erskine's faults. In his situation, it
                     was natural he should; but he had such a calm, sober way with him, every word
                     bore the impress of truth. The story of the gambling club had turned the scale;
                     but John might have been misinformed.</p>
                  <p>Thus, after all her deliberations, Jane re-entered her home without having come
                     to any decision. Though we believe the opinion of a great moralist is against
                     us, we doubt if "decision of character" belongs to the most scrupulously
                     virtuous.</p>

                  <p>AS Jane entered Mrs. Harvey's door, she met her kind hostess just returning
                     from a walk, her face flushed with recent pleasure. "Where upon earth have you
                     been?" she exclaimed. "Ah! if you had gone with me, you would not have come
                     home with such a wo-begone face. Not a word! Well—nothing for nothing is my
                     rule, my dear; and so you need not expect to hear where I have been, and what
                     superb papers have come from New York, for the front rooms; and beautiful
                     china, and chairs, and carpets, and a fine work-table, for an industrious
                     little lady, that shall be nameless; all quite too grand for a sullen, silent,
                     deaf and dumb school-mistress." She added, playfully, "If our cousin Elvira had
                     been out in such a shower of gold, we should have been favoured with sweet
                     smiles and sweet talk for one year at least. But there comes he that will make
                     the bird sing, when it won't sing to<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7726-00000091"/>
                     any one else: and so my dear, to escape chilling a lover's atmosphere, or being
                     melted in it, I shall make my escape."</p>
                  <p>Jane would gladly have followed her, but she sat still, after hastily throwing
                     aside her hat, and seizing the first book that she could lay her hands upon, to
                     shelter her embarrassment. She sat with her back to the door.</p>
                  <p>Edward entered, and walking up to her, looked over her shoulder as if to see
                     what book had so riveted her attention. It chanced to be Penn's "Fruits of
                     Solitude." "Curse on all Quakers and quakerism!" said he, seizing the book
                     rudely and throwing it across the room; "wherever I go, I am crossed by
                     them."</p>
                  <p>He walked about, perturbed and angry. Jane rose to leave him, for now, she
                     thought, was not the time to come to an explanation; but Erskine was not in a
                     humour to be opposed in any thing. He placed his back against the door, and
                     said, "No, Jane, you shall not leave me now. I have much to tell you. Forgive
                     my violence. There is a point beyond which no rational creature can keep his
                     temper. I have been urged to that point; and, thank Heaven, I have not learnt
                     that smooth-faced hypocrisy that can seem what it is not."</p>
                  <p>Jane trembled excessively. Erskine had touched the 'electric chain;' she sunk
                     into a chair, and burst into tears.</p>
                  <p>"I was right," he exclaimed; "it is by your authority, and at your instigation,
                     that I am dogged from place to place by that impertinent fellow; you have
                     entered into a <emph>holy league;</emph> but know, Miss Elton, there is a
                     tradition in our family, that no Erskine was ever ruled by his wife; and the
                     sooner the lady who is destined to be mine learns not to interfere in my
                     affairs, the more agreeable it will be to me, and the more safe for
                     herself."</p>
                  <p>Jane's indignation was roused by this strange attack; and resuming her
                     composure, she said, "If you mean that I shall understand you, you must explain
                     yourself, for I am ignorant and innocent of any thing you may suspect me
                     of."</p>
                  <p>"Thank heaven!" replied Erskine, "I believe you, Jane; you know in the worst of
                     times I have believed you; and it was natural to be offended that you should
                     distrust me. You shall know the 'head and front of my offending.' The sins that
                     have stirred up such a missionary zeal in that Quaker saint, will weigh very
                     light in the scales of love."</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps," said Jane gravely, "I hold a more impartial balance than you
                     expect."</p>
                  <p>"Then you do not love me, Jane, for love is, and ought to be, blind; but I am
                     willing to make the trial; I will never have it repeated to me, that 'if you
                     knew all, you would withdraw your affections from me.' No one shall say that
                     you have not loved me, with all my youthful follies on my head. I know you are
                     a little puritanical; but that is natural to one who has had so much to make
                     her miserable; the unhappy are driven to religion. But you are young and
                     curable, if you can be rescued from this Quaker influence."</p>
                  <p>Edward still rattled on, and seemed a little to dread making the promised
                     communication; but at last, inferring from Jane's seriousness that she was
                     anxious, and impatient himself to have it over, he went on to tell her—that
                     from the beginning of their engagement, Mr. Lloyd had undertaken the <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">surveillance</foreign> of his morals; that certainly he had
                     been very civil to him, and possibly, if he had not been fortified by his
                     antipathy to Quakers, he should have surrendered his confidence to him.</p>
                  <p>"No gentleman," he said, "no man of honourable feeling—no man of proper
                     sensibility—would submit to the interference<pb n="184-185"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000092"/> rence of a stranger—a man not much older than
                     himself—in matters that concerned himself alone; it was an intolerable outrage.
                     If Jane were capable of a fair judgment, she would allow that it was so."</p>
                  <p>Jane mildly replied, that she could only judge from the facts; as yet she had
                     heard nothing but invectives. Erskine said, he had imagined he was stating his
                     case in a court of love, and not of law; but he had no objection, since his
                     judge was as sternly just as an old Roman father, to state facts. He could
                     pardon Mr. Lloyd his eagerness to make him adopt his plans of improvement in
                     the natural and moral world: to the first he might have been led by his taste
                     for agriculture, (which he believed was unaffected,) and to the second he was
                     pledged by the laws of meddling quakerism. Still he said none but a Quaker
                     would have thought of prying into the affairs of people who were strangers to
                     him—however, that might be pardoned; as he said before, he supposed every
                     Quaker was bound to 'bear his testimony,' that he believed was their cant term
                     for their impertinence. "But, my sweet judge, you do not look propitious,"
                     Erskine continued after this misty preamble, from which Jane could gather
                     nothing but that his prejudices and pride had thrown a dark shadow over all the
                     virtues of Mr. Lloyd.</p>
                  <p>"I cannot, Erskine, look propitious on your sneers against the principles of my
                     excellent friend."</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps," replied Erskine tartly, "his practise will be equally immaculate in
                     your eyes. And now, Jane, I beseech you for once to forget that Mr. Lloyd is
                     your <emph>excellent friend;</emph> a man who bestowed some trifling favours on
                     your childhood, and remember the rights of one to whom you at least owe your
                     love—though he would neither accept that, nor your gratitude, as a debt."</p>
                  <p>Jane assured him she was ready to hear any thing and every thing impartially
                     that he would tell her. He replied, that he detested stoical impartiality; that
                     he wished her to enter into his loves and his hates, without asking a reason
                     for them. "But since," he continued, "you must have the reason, I will not
                     withhold it. As I told you, I submitted to a thousand vexations, little
                     impertinences: he is plausible and gentlemanly in his manners, so there was
                     nothing I could resent, till after a contemptible affair between John and the
                     old basket-maker and the Woodhulls, in which I used my humble professional
                     skill to extricate my friends, who had been perhaps a little hasty in revenging
                     the impertinence of the foolish old man. Lloyd was present at the trial before
                     the justice: I fancied, from the expression of his face, that he wished my
                     friends to be foiled, and this stung me, and stimulated my faculties. I
                     succeeded in winning my cause in spite of law and equity, for they were both
                     against me; and this you know is rather flattering to one's talents. The
                     Woodhull's overwhelmed me with praises and gratitude. I felt sorry for the
                     silly old man, whom they had very unceremoniously unhoused, and I proposed a
                     small subscription to enable him to pay the bill of costs, &amp;c., which was
                     his only receipt from the prosecution. I headed it, and it was soon made up;
                     but the old fellow declined it with as much dignity as if he had been a king in
                     disguise. It was an affair of no moment, and I should probably never have
                     thought of it again, if Lloyd had not the next day made it the text upon which
                     he preached as long a sermon as I would hear, upon the characters of the
                     Woodhulls; he even went so far as to presume to remonstrate with me upon my
                     connection with them; painted their conduct on various occasions in the
                     blackest colours; spoke of their pulling down the old hovel, which<pb
                        n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7726-00000093"/> had in fact been a mere cumberer of
                     the ground for twenty years, as an act of oppression and cruelty; said their
                     habits were all bad; their pursuits all either foolish or dangerous. I
                     restrained myself as long as possible, and then I told him, that I should not
                     submit to hear any calumnies against my friends; friends who were devoted to
                     me, who would go to perdition to serve me. If they had foibles, they were those
                     that belonged to open, generous natures; they were open-handed, and
                     open-hearted, and had not smothered their passions, till they were quite
                     extinguished. I told him they were honourable young men, not governed by the
                     fear that 'holds the wretch in order.' He might have known that I meant to tell
                     him they were what he was not; but he seemed quite unmoved, and I spoke more
                     plainly. I had never, I told him, been accustomed to submit my conduct to the
                     revision of any one; that he had no right, and I knew not why he presumed, to
                     assume it, to haunt me like an external conscience; that my 'genius was not
                     rebuked by his,' neither would it be, if all the marvellous light of all his
                     brethren was concentrated in his luminous mind."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Erskine, Erskine!" exclaimed Jane, "was this your return for his friendly
                     warning?"</p>
                  <p>"Hear me through, Jane, before you condemn me. He provoked me more than I have
                     told you. He said that I was responsible to you for my virtue; that I betrayed
                     your trust by exposing myself to be the companion, or the prey, of the vices of
                     others. Would you have had me borne this, Jane? Would you thank me for allowing
                     that he was more careful of your happiness than I am?"—"Well," added he, after
                     a moment's pause, "as you do not reply, I presume you have not yet decided that
                     point. We separated, my indignation roused to the highest pitch, and he cold
                     and calm as ever. When we next met, there was no difference in his manners to
                     me that a stranger would have observed; but I perceived his words were all
                     weighed and measured, as if he would not venture soon again to disturb a lion
                     spirit."</p>
                  <p>"Is this all?" asked Jane.</p>
                  <p>"Not half," replied Erskine; and after a little hesitation he continued, "I
                     perceive that it is impossible for you to see things in the light I do. Your
                     aunt with her everlasting cant, your Methodist friend with her old maid
                     notions, and this precise Quaker, above all, have made you so rigid, have so
                     bound and stiffened every youthful indulgent feeling, that I have little hope
                     of a favourable judgment."</p>
                  <p>"Then," said Jane, rising, "it is as unnecessary as painful for me to hear the
                     rest."</p>
                  <p>"No, you shall not go," he replied; "I expect miracles from the touch of love.
                     I think I have an advocate in your heart, that will plead for me against the
                     whole 'privileged order' of professors—of every cast. Do not be shocked, my
                     dear Jane; do not, for your own sake, make mountains of molehills, when I tell
                     you, that the young men of the village instituted a club, three or four months
                     since, who meet once a week socially, perhaps a little oftener, when we are all
                     about home: and"—he hesitated a moment, as one will when he comes to a ditch,
                     and is uncertain whether to spring over, to retreat, or to find some other way;
                     but he had too much pride to conceal the fact, and though he feared a little to
                     announce it, yet he was determined to justify it. Jane was still mute, and he
                     went on—"We play cards; sometimes we have played later and higher perhaps than
                     we should if we had all been in the leading-strings of prudence; all been bred
                     Quakers. Our club are men of honour and spirit, high-minded<pb n="188-189"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000094"/> ed gentlemen; a few disputes, misunderstandings,
                     might arise now and then, as they will among people who do not weigh every
                     word, lest they should chance to have an idle one to account for; but, till the
                     last evening, we have, in the main, spent our time together as whole-souled
                     fellows should, in mirth and jollity. As I said, last evening
                     unfortunately——"</p>
                  <p>"Tell me nothing more, Mr. Erskine; I have heard enough," interrupted Jane.</p>
                  <p>"What! you will not listen to friend Lloyd's reproaches; not listen to what
                     most roused his holy indignation?"</p>
                  <p>"I have no wish to hear any thing further," replied Jane. "I have heard enough
                     to make my path plain before me. I loved you, Edward; I confessed to you that I
                     did."</p>
                  <p>"And you do not any longer?"</p>
                  <p>"I cannot; the illusion has vanished. Neither do you love me." Edward would
                     have interrupted her; but she begged him to hear her, with a dignified
                     composure, that convinced him this was no sudden burst of resentment, no
                     girlish pique that he might soothe with flattery and professions. "A most
                     generous impulse, Edward, led you to protect an oppressed orphan; and I thought
                     the devotion of my heart and my life were a small return to you. It is but a
                     few months since. Is not love an engrossing passion? But what sacrifices have
                     you made to it? Oh, Edward! if in the youth and spring of your affection I have
                     not had more power over you, what can I hope from the future?"</p>
                  <p>"Hope!—believe every thing, Jane. I will be as plastic as wax, in your hands.
                     You shall mould me as you will."</p>
                  <p>"No, Edward; I have tried my power over you, and found you wanting. Broken
                     confidence cannot be restored."</p>
                  <p>"Jane, you are rash; you are giving up independence— protection. If you reject
                     me, who will defend you from your aunt? Do you forget that you are still in her
                     power?"</p>
                  <p>"No," replied Jane; "but I have the defence of innocence, and I do not fear
                     her. It was not your protection, it was not independence I sought, it was a
                     refuge in your affection;—that has failed me. Oh, Edward!" she continued,
                     rising, "examine your heart as I have examined mine, and you will find the tie
                     is dissolved that bound us; there can be no enduring love without sympathy; our
                     feelings, our pursuits, our plans, our inclinations are all diverse."</p>
                  <p>"You are unkind, ungrateful, Jane."</p>
                  <p>"I must bear that reproach as I can; but I do not deserve it, Mr. Erskine."</p>
                  <p>Erskine imagined he perceived some relenting in the faltering of her voice, and
                     he said, "Do not be implacable, Jane; you are too young, too beautiful, to
                     treat the follies of youth as if they were incurable; give me a few months'
                     probation, I will do any thing you require; abandon the club, give up my <choice>
                        <sic>asoociates</sic>
                        <corr>associates</corr>
                     </choice>."</p>
                  <p>Jane paused for a moment, but there was no wavering in her resolution—" No, Mr.
                     Erskine; we must part now; if I loved you, I could not resist the pleadings of
                     my heart."</p>
                  <p>Erskine entreated—promised every thing; till convinced that Jane did not
                     deceive him or herself, his vanity and pride, mortified and wounded, came to
                     his relief, and changed his entreaties to sarcasms. He said the rigour that
                     would immolate every human feeling, would fit her to be the Elect Lady of the
                     Shaker society; he assured her that he would emulate her stoicism.</p>
                  <p>"I am no stoic," replied Jane; and the tears gushed from her eyes. "Oh,
                     Erskine! I would make any exertions, any sacrifices to render you what I once
                     thought you. I<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7726-00000095"/> would watch and toil
                     to win you to virtue—to heaven. If I believed you loved me, I could still hope,
                     for I know that affection is self-devoting, and may overcome all things.
                     Edward," she continued, with trembling voice, "there is one subject, and that
                     nearest to my heart, on which I discovered soon after our engagement we were at
                     utter variance. When I first heard you trifle with the obligations of religion,
                     and express a distrust of its truths, I felt my heart chill. I reproached
                     myself bitterly for having looked on your insensibility on this subject as the
                     common carelessness of a gay young man, to be expected and forgiven, and easily
                     cured. These few short months have taught me much; have taught me, Erskine, not
                     that religion is the only sure foundation of virtue—that I knew before—but they
                     have taught me, that religion alone can produce unity of spirit; alone can
                     resist the cares, the disappointments, the tempests of life; that it is the
                     only indissoluble bond—for when the silver chord is loosed, this bond becomes
                     immortal. I have felt that my most sacred pleasures and hopes must be
                     solitary." Erskine made no reply; he felt the presence of a sanctified spirit.
                     "You now know all, Erskine. The circumstances you have told me this evening, I
                     partly knew before."</p>
                  <p>"From Lloyd?" said Edward. "He then knew, as he insinuated, why your 'colour
                     had faded.'"</p>
                  <p>"You do him wrong. He has never mentioned your name since the morning I left my
                     aunt's. I heard them by accident, from John."</p>
                  <p>"It is, in truth, time we should part, when you can give your ear to every idle
                     rumour;" he snatched his hat, and was going.</p>
                  <p>Jane laid her hand on his arm, "Yes, it is time," she said, "that we should
                     part; but not in anger. Let us exchange forgiveness, Edward." Erskine turned,
                     and wept bitterly. For a few gracious moments his pride, his self-love, all
                     melted away, and he felt the value, the surpassing excellence of the blessing
                     he had forfeited. He pressed the hand Jane had given him to his lips,
                     fervently; "Oh, Jane," he said, "you are an angel; forget my follies, and think
                     of me with kindness."</p>
                  <p>"I shall remember nothing of the past," she said, with a look that had 'less of
                     earth in it than heaven,' "but your goodness to me—God bless you, Edward; God
                     bless you!" she repeated, and they separated—for ever!</p>
                  <p>For a few hours Erskine thought only of the irreparable loss of Jane's
                     affections. Every pure, every virtuous feeling he possessed, joined in a
                     clamorous tribute to her excellence, and in a sentence of self condemnation
                     that could not be silenced. But Edward was habitually under the dominion of
                     self-love, and every other emotion soon gave place to the dread of being looked
                     upon as a rejected man. He had not courage to risk the laugh of his associates,
                     or what would be much more trying, their affected pity; and to escape it all,
                     he ordered his servant to pack his clothes, and make the necessary preparations
                     for leaving the village in the morning, in the mail-stage for New-York. He was
                     urged to this step too, by another motive, arising from a disagreeable affair
                     in which he had been engaged—the affair which had induced Mr. Lloyd to make a
                     second attempt to withdraw him from his vicious associates. At a recent meeting
                     of the club, the younger Woodhull had introduced a gentleman who pretended to
                     be a Mr. Rivington, from Virginia. Woodhull had met him at Saratoga Springs.
                     They were kindred spirits, and, forming a sudden friendship, Rivington promised
                     Wood-hull that, after he had exhausted the pleasures of the Springs<pb
                        n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7726-00000096"/> he would come to ——, and pass a few
                     days with him before his return to Virginia. Rivington was a fit companion for
                     his new friend; addicted to a score of vices; gambling high, and out-drinking,
                     out-swearing, and out-bullying his comrades. Edward was certainly far better
                     than any other member of this precious association. He was, from the first,
                     disgusted with the stranger, with his gross manners, and not a little with the
                     manifest indisposition to pay to him the deference he was accustomed to receive
                     from the rest of the company. The club sat later than usual. Rivington's
                     passions became inflamed by the liquor he had drank. A dispute arose about the
                     play. Erskine and John Woodhull were partners. Rivington accused Woodhull of
                     unfair play. Edward defended his partner. A violent altercation ensued between
                     them. The lie was given and retorted in so direct a form as to afford ample
                     ground for an honourable adjustment of the dispute.</p>
                  <p>"Rivington said, "If he had to deal with a Virginan—a man of honour—the quarrel
                     might be settled in a gentlemanly way; but a sniveling cowardly Yankee had no
                     honour to defend." Edward was provoked to challenge him; and arrangements were
                     made for the meeting at daylight in the morning, in a neighbouring wood, which
                     had never been disturbed by harsher sound than a sportsman's gun. The brothers
                     were to act as seconds.</p>
                  <p>The parties were all punctual to their appointment. The morning, of which they
                     were going to make so unhallowed a use, was a most beautiful one. The mist took
                     a poet's liberty and played with realities. The place of rendezvous was on a
                     hill-side. Below it the valley appeared a lake over which floated a tremulous
                     veil of vapor. Dotting it here and there were green spires of Lombardy poplar,
                     branches of sugar maple with its massive foliage, and widely spreading boughs
                     of the drooping elm—that queen of beauty.</p>
                  <p>"Jocund day stood tip-toe on the summit of monument," brightened the green
                     hill-tops and shone all along the wavy outline of the mountains. But this
                     lovely aspect of nature was unheeded and unnoticed by these rash young men. Her
                     sacred volume is a sealed book to those who are inflamed by passion, or
                     degraded by vice.</p>
                  <p>The ground was marked out, the usual distance prescribed by the seconds, and
                     the principals were just about to take their stations, when they were
                     interrupted by Mr. Lloyd, who in returning from his morning walk, passed
                     through this wood, which was within a short distance of his house. On emerging
                     from the thick wood, into the open space selected by the young men, they were
                     directly before him, so that it was impossible for him to mistake the design of
                     their meeting.</p>
                  <p>"Confusion!" exclaimed Edward; mortified that Mr. Lloyd, of all men living,
                     should have witnessed this scene; and then turning to him, "To what, sir," said
                     he haughtily, "do we owe the favour of your company?"</p>
                  <p>"Purely to accident, Mr. Erskine, or, I should say, to Providence, if I may be
                     so happy as to prevent a rash violation of the laws of God and man."</p>
                  <p>"Stand off, sir!" said Edward, determined now to brave Mr. Lloyd's opposition,
                     "and witness, if you will, for you shall not prevent, our brave encounter."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Lloyd had interposed himself between Edward and his adversary, and he did
                     not move from his station. "A brave encounter, truly!" he replied, pointing
                     with a smile of contempt at Rivington, who was shaking as if he had an ague;
                     "that young man's pale cheeks and trembling limbs<pb n="194-195"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000097"/> do not promise the merit of bravery to your
                     encounter, Mr. Erskine."</p>
                  <p>"The devil take the impertinent fellow!" exclaimed the elder Woodhull (Edward's
                     second); "proceed to your business, gentlemen."</p>
                  <p>Erskine placed himself in an attitude to fire, and raised his arm. Mr. Lloyd
                     remained firm and immovable. "Do you mean to take my fire, sir?" asked Erskine.
                     "If you continue to stand there, the peril be upon yourself; the fault rests
                     with you."</p>
                  <p>"I shall risk taking the fire, if thou dare risk giving it," replied Mr. Lloyd,
                     coolly.</p>
                  <p>"Curse him!" said Woodhull, "he thinks you are afraid to fire."</p>
                  <p>This speech had the intended effect upon Erskine. "Give us the signal," he
                     said, hastily.</p>
                  <p>The signal was given, and Edward discharged his pistol. The ball grazed Mr.
                     Lloyd's arm, and passed off without any other injury. "It was bravely done,"
                     said he, with a contemptuous coolness, that increased, if any thing could
                     increase the shame Erskine felt, the moment he had vented his passion by the
                     rash and violent act. "We have been singularly fortunate," he continued,
                     "considering thou hast all the firing to thyself, and two fair marks. Poor
                     fellow!" he added, turning to Rivington, "so broad a shield as I furnished for
                     thee, I should have hoped would have saved some of this fright."</p>
                  <p>John Woodhull had perceived that his friend's courage, which, the preceding
                     evening, had been stimulated by the liquor, had vanished with the fog that
                     clouded his reason; and ever since they came on the battle-ground, he had been
                     vainly endeavouring to screw him up to the sticking point, by suggesting, in
                     low whispers, such motives as he thought might operate upon him; but all his
                     efforts were ineffectual. Rivington was, to use a vulgar expression, literally
                     'scared out of his wits.' When the signal was given for firing, he had essayed
                     to raise his arm, but it was all unstrung by fear, and he could not move it.
                     The sound of Erskine's pistol completed his dismay; he dropped his pistol, said
                     he was willing to own he was no gentleman; he would beg Mr. Erskine's pardon,
                     and all the gentlemen's pardon; he would do any thing almost the gentlemen
                     would say.</p>
                  <p>John Woodhull felt his own reputation implicated by his principal's cowardice;
                     and passionate and reckless, he seized the pistol, and would have discharged
                     the contents at Rivington; but Mr. Lloyd seeing his intention, caught hold of
                     his arm, wrenched the pistol from him, fired it in the air, and threw it from
                     him. "Shame on thee, young man!" he exclaimed, "does the spirit of murder so
                     possess thee, that it matters not whether thy arm is raised against friend or
                     foe?"</p>
                  <p>"He is no friend of mine," replied Woodhull, vainly endeavouring to extricate
                     himself from Mr. Lloyd's manly grasp; he is a coward, and by my life and sacred
                     honour!"—</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Mr. Woodhull! sir," interrupted Rivington, "I am your friend, sir, and all
                     the gentlemen's friend, sir. I am much obliged to you, sir," turning to Mr.
                     Lloyd, who could not help laughing at the eagerness of his cowardice; "I am
                     sorry for the disturbance, gentlemen, and I wish you all a good morning,
                     gentlemen!" and so saying, he walked off the ground as fast as his trembling
                     limbs could take him.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Lloyd now released young Woodhull from his hold; and winding his
                     handkerchief around his arm, which was slightly bleeding, he said, "I perceive
                     there is no further occasion for my interposition. I think the experience of
                        this<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7726-00000098"/> morning will not tempt you
                     to repeat this singular disturbance of the peace of this community."</p>
                  <p>The party were all too thoroughly mortified to attempt a reply, and they
                     separated. Erskine felt a most humiliating consciousness of his disgrace; but
                     he had not sufficient magnanimity to confess it, nor even to express a regret
                     that he had wounded a man, who exposed his life to prevent him from committing
                     a crime. The Woodhulls were deprived of the pitiful pleasure of sneering at Mr.
                     Lloyd's want of courage. The younger brother's arm still ached from his
                     experience of Mr. Lloyd's physical strength; and they all felt the inferiority
                     of their boastful, passionate, and reckless foolhardiness, to the collected,
                     disinterested courage of a peaceful man, who had risked his life in their
                     quarrel.</p>
                  <p>To fill up the measure of their mortification, Rivington had not left the
                     village two hours, before several persons arrived there in pursuit of him. They
                     informed his new friends, that he was not a Virginian, a name that passes among
                     our northern bloods as synonymous with high-breeding, high-mindedness, noble
                     daring, &amp;c., &amp;c., but that he was a countryman of their own, a
                     celebrated swindler, who had lived by his wits, ascending by regular gradations
                     through the professions of hostler, dancing-master, and itinerate actor; and
                     that having lately, by cleverness in managing the arts of his vocation,
                     possessed himself of a large sum of money, he had made his debût as gentleman
                     at the Springs.</p>
                  <p>After the events of the morning, Mr. Lloyd felt more anxiety than ever on Jane
                     Elton's account; and never weary in well-doing, he determined to make one more
                     effort to rescue Erskine from the pernicious society and influence of the
                     Woodhulls. He solicited an interview with him; and without alluding to the
                     events of the morning, he remonstrated warmly and kindly against an intimacy,
                     of which the degradation and the danger were too evident to need pointing out.
                     He trusted himself to speak of Jane, of her innocence, her purity, her trustful
                     affection, her solitariness, her dependence.</p>
                  <p>At any other time, we cannot think Edward would have been unmoved by the
                     eloquence of his appeal; but now he was exasperated by the mortifications of
                     the morning; and when Mr. Lloyd said, "Erskine, if Jane Elton knew all, would
                     she not withdraw her affections from thee?" he replied, angrily, "She shall
                     know all. I have a right to expect she will overlook a few foibles; such as
                     belong to every young man of spirit. She owes me, at least, so much indulgence.
                     She is bound to me by ties that cannot be broken—that she certainly cannot
                     break." He burst away from Mr. Lloyd, and went precipitately to Mrs. Harvey's,
                     where the explanation we have related ensued, and put a final termination to
                     their unequal alliance.</p>
                  <p>The speculations of villagers are never at rest till they know the wherefore of
                     the slightest movements of the prominent personages that figure on their
                     theatre. Happily for our heroine, who was solicitous for a little while to be
                     sheltered from the scrutiny and remarks of her neighbours, the affair of the
                     duel soon became public, and sufficiently accounted for Erskine's abrupt
                     departure.</p>
                  <p>Jane would have communicated to Mary, her kind, constant friend Mary Hull, the
                     issue of her engagement; but it so happened, that she was at this time absent
                     on a visit to her blind sister. She felt it to be just, that she should
                     acquaint Mr. Lloyd with the result of an affair, in which he had manifested so
                     benevolent and vigilant a care for her happiness. Perhaps she felt a natural
                     wish, that he should know his confidence in her had not been misplaced. She
                     could not<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7726-00000099"/> speak to him on the
                     subject, for their intercourse had been suspended of late; and besides, she was
                     habitually reserved about speaking of herself. She sat down to address a note
                     to him; and, after writing a dozen, each of which offended her in some
                     point—either betrayed a want of delicacy towards Erskine, or a sentiment of
                     self-complacency—either expressed too much, or two little—she threw them all
                     into the fire, and determined to leave the communication to accident.</p>

                  <p>A FEW days after Erskine's departure, Mrs. Harvey entered Jane's room
                     hastily,—"Our village," she exclaimed, "is the most extraordinary place in the
                     world; wonders cease to be wonderful among us."</p>
                  <p>"What has happened now?" inquired Jane, "I know not from your face whether to
                     expect good or evil."</p>
                  <p>"Oh evil, my dear, evil enough to grieve and frighten you. Your wretched cousin
                     David Wilson has got himself into a scrape at last, from which all the arts of
                     all his family cannot extricate him. You know," she continued, "that we saw an
                     account in the New-York paper of last week, of a robbery committed on the
                     mail-stage: the robbers have been detected and taken, and Wilson, who it seems
                     had assumed a feigned name, is among them."</p>
                  <p>"And the punishment is death!" said Jane, in a tone of sorrow and alarm.</p>
                  <pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7726-00000100"/>
                  <p>"Yes; so Mr. Lloyd says, by the laws of the United States, against which he has
                     offended. Mr. Lloyd has been here, to request that you, dear Jane, will go to
                     your aunt and say to her that he is ready to render her any services in his
                     power. You know he is acquainted in Philadelphia, where David is imprisoned,
                     and he may be of essential use to him."</p>
                  <p>"My poor aunt, and Elvira! what misery is this for them?" said Jane,
                     instinctively transfusing her own feelings into their bosoms.</p>
                  <p>"For your aunt it may be," replied Mrs. Harvey, "for I think nothing can quite
                     root out the mother; but as for Elvira, I believe she is too much absorbed in
                     her own affairs to think of David's body or soul."</p>
                  <p>"I will go immediately to my aunt; but what has happened to Elvira?"</p>
                  <p>"Why Elvira, it seems, during her visit to the west, met with an itinerant
                     French dancing-master, who became violently enamored of her, and who did not
                     sigh or hope in vain. She probably knew his vocation would be an insuperable
                     obstacle to her seeing him at home; and so between them they concerted a scheme
                     to obviate that difficulty, by introducing him to Mrs. Wilson as a French
                     physician, from Paris, who should volunteer his services to cure her scrofula,
                     which, it is said, has lately become more troublesome than ever. By way of a
                     decoy, he was to go upon the usual quack practice of "no cure no pay."</p>
                  <p>"And this," exclaimed Jane, "is the sick physician we heard was at my
                     aunt's?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, poor fellow, and sick enough he has been. He arrived just at twilight,
                     last week on Monday, and having tied his horse, he was tempted, by seeing the
                     door of the chaise-house half open, to go in there to arrange his dress
                     previous to making his appearance before Miss Wilson. He had hardly entered
                     before old Jacob coming along, saw the door open, and giving the careless boys
                     (whom he supposed in fault) a reversed blessing, he shut and fastened it. It
                     was chilly weather, you know, but there the poor fellow was obliged to stay the
                     live-long night, and till Jacob, sallying forth to do his morning chores,
                     discovered him half-starved and half-frozen. But," said Mrs. Harvey, "you are
                     prepared to go to your aunt, and I am detaining you—you may ask the sequel of
                     Elvira."</p>
                  <p>"Oh no, let me hear the rest of it; only be short, dear Mrs. Harvey, for if any
                     thing is to be done for that wretched young man, not a moment should be
                     lost."</p>
                  <p>"My dear, I will be as short as possible; but my words will not all run out of
                     my mouth at once, as they melted out of Munchausen's horn. Well, this poor
                     French doctor, dancer, or whatever he is, effected an interview with Elvira,
                     before he was seen by the mother; and though no doubt she was shocked by his
                     unsentimental involuntary vigil, she overlooked it, and succeeded in palming
                     him off on the old lady as a foreign physician, who had performed sundry
                     marvellous cures in his western progress. Mrs. Wilson submitted her disease to
                     his prescription. In the meanwhile, he, poor wretch, as if a judgment had come
                     upon him for his sins, has been really and seriously sick, in consequence of
                     the exposure to the dampness of a September night, in his nankins; and Elvira
                     has been watching and nursing him according to the best and most approved
                     precedents to be found in ballads and romances."</p>
                  <p>"Is it possible," asked Jane, "that aunt Wilson should be<pb n="202-203"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000101"/> imposed on for so long a time? Elvira is
                     ingenious, and ready, but she is not a match for her quick-sighted mother."</p>
                  <p>"No, so it has proved in this case. The doctor became better, and the patient
                     worse; his prescriptions have had a dreadful effect upon the scrofula; and as
                     the pain increased, your aunt became irritable and suspicious. Last evening,
                     she overhead a conversation between the hopeful lovers, which revealed the
                     whole truth to her."</p>
                  <p>"And what has she done?"</p>
                  <p>"What could she do, my dear, but turn the good-for-nothing fellow out of doors,
                     and exhaust her wrath upon Elvira. The dreadful news she received from David
                     late last evening, must have driven even this provoking affair out of her
                     troubled mind. But," said Mrs. Harvey, rising and going to the window, "who is
                     that coming through our gate? Elvira, as I live!—what can she be after
                     here?"</p>
                  <p>"My aunt has probably sent for me," replied Jane; and she hastened to open the
                     door for her cousin, who entered evidently in a flutter. "I was just going to
                     your mother's," said Jane.</p>
                  <p>"Stay a moment," said Elvira; "I must speak with you. Come into your room," and
                     she hastened forward to Jane's apartment. She paused a moment on seeing Mrs.
                     Harvey, and then begged she would allow her to speak with her cousin alone.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Harvey left the apartment, and Elvira turned to Jane, and was beginning
                     with great eagerness to say something, but she paused—unpinned her shawl, took
                     it off, and then put it on again—and then asked Jane, if she had heard from
                     Erskine; and, without waiting a reply, which did not seem to be very ready, she
                     continued, "How glad I was he fought that duel; it was so spirited. I wish my
                     lover would fight a duel. It would have been delightful if he had only been
                     wounded."</p>
                  <p>Jane stared at her cousin, as if she had been smitten with distraction.
                     "Elvira," she said, with more displeasure than was often extorted from her,
                     "you are an incurable trifler! How is it possible, that at this time you can
                     waste a thought upon Erskine or his duel?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh! my spirits run away with me, dear Jane; but I do feel very miserable," she
                     replied, affecting to wipe away the tears from her dry eyes. Poor David!—I am
                     wretched about him. He has disgraced us all. I suppose you have heard, too,
                     about Lavoisier. Every body has heard of mother's cruelty to him and to me. Oh,
                     Jane! he is the sweetest creature—the most interesting being"——</p>
                  <p>"Elvira," replied Jane, coldly, "I do not like to reproach you in your present
                     affliction; but you strangely forget all that is due to your sex, by keeping up
                     such an intercourse with a stranger—by ranting in this way about a wandering
                     dancing-master—a foreigner."</p>
                  <p>"A foreigner, indeed! as if that was against him. Why, my dear, foreigners are
                     much more genteel than Americans; and besides, Lavoisier is a count in
                     disguise. Oh! if you could only hear him speak French; it is as soft as an
                     Æolian harp. Now, Jane, darling, don't be angry with me. I am sure there never
                     was any body so persecuted and unfortunate as I am. Nobody feels for me."</p>
                  <p>"It is impossible, Elvira, to feel for those who have no feeling for
                     themselves."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Jane! you are very cruel," replied Elvira, whimpering; "I have been crying
                     ever since I received poor David's letter, and it was about that I came here;
                     but you do<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7726-00000102"/> not seem to have any
                     compassion for our sorrows, and I am afraid to ask for what I came for."</p>
                  <p>"I cannot afford to waste any compassion on unnecessary or imaginary sorrows,
                     Elvira. The real and most horrible calamity that has fallen upon you, requires
                     all the exertions and feelings of your friends."</p>
                  <p>"That's spoken like yourself, dear, blessed Jane," said Elvira, brightening;
                     "now I am sure you will not refuse me—you are always so generous and kind."</p>
                  <p>"I have small means to be generous," replied Jane; "but let me know, at once,
                     what it is you want, for I am in haste to go to your mother."</p>
                  <p>"You are a darling, Jane—you always was."</p>
                  <p>"What is it you wish, Elvira?" inquired Jane again, aware that Elvira's
                     endearments were always to be interpreted as a prelude to the asking of a
                     favour.</p>
                  <p>"I wish, dear Jane," she replied, summoning all her resolution to her aid; "I
                     wish you to lend me twenty dollars. If you had seen David's piteous letter to
                     me, you could not refuse. It is enough to make any body's heart ache; he is
                     down in a dark disagreeable dungeon, with nothing to eat from morning to night,
                     but bread and water. He petitions for a little money so earnestly, it would
                     make your heart bleed to read his letter. Mother declares she will not send him
                     a dollar."</p>
                  <p>"How do you intend sending the money to him?" asked Jane, rising and going to
                     her bureau.</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" replied Elvira, watching Jane's movements, "you are a dear soul. It is
                     easy enough getting the money to him. I heard, this morning, that Mr. Harris is
                     going on to the south; he starts this afternoon. I shall not mind walking to
                     his house, though it is four miles from here. I shall go immediately, and I
                     shall charge him to deliver the money himself. It will be such a relief and
                     comfort to my unfortunate brother."</p>
                  <p>There seemed to be something in Elvira's eagerness to serve her brother, and in
                     her newly awakened tenderness for him, that excited Jane's suspicions; for she
                     paused in the midst of counting the money, turned round, and fixed a
                     penetrating look upon her cousin. Elvira, without appearing to notice any thing
                     peculiar in her expression, said (advancing towards her), "Do be quick, dear
                     Jane; it is a great way to Mr. Harris's; I am afraid I shall be late."</p>
                  <p>Jane had finished counting the money.</p>
                  <p>"Twenty dollars, is it, dear?" said Elvira, hastily and with a flutter of joy
                     seizing it. "There are five dollars more," she continued, looking at a single
                     bill Jane had laid aside; "let me have that too, dear, it will not be too much
                     for David."</p>
                  <p>"I cannot," replied Jane; "that is all I have in the world, and that I owe to
                     Mrs. Harvey."</p>
                  <p>"La, Jane! what matter is that; you can have as much money as you want of
                     Erskine; and besides, you need not be afraid of losing it; I shall soon be of
                     age, and then I shall pay you, for mother can't keep my portion from me one day
                     after that. Then I will have a cottage. Lavoisier says, we can have no idea, in
                     this country, how beautiful a cottage is, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">á la
                        Française.</foreign> Do, dearest, let me have the other five."</p>
                  <p>"No," said Jane, disgusted with Elvira's importunity and levity, and replacing
                     the note in her drawer; "I have given you all I possess in the world, and you
                     must be content with it."</p>
                  <p>Elvira saw that she should obtain no more. She hastily kissed Jane; and after
                     saying, "Good-bye, my dear, go to<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7726-00000103"/>
                     mother's, and stay till I come," she flew out of the house, exulting that her
                     false pretences had won so much from her cousin. At a short distance from Mrs.
                     Harvey's she joined her lover, according to a previous arrangement between
                     them.</p>
                  <p>Lavoisier had procured a chaise from a neighbouring farmer, which was
                     principally devoted to the transportation of its worthy proprietor and the
                     partner of his joys to and from the meeting-house on Sundays and lecture days,
                     but was occasionally hired out <emph>to oblige</emph> such persons as might
                     stand in need of such an accommodation, and could afford to pay what was
                     "consistent" for it.</p>
                  <p>"Allons—marche donc!" said the dancing philosopher to his horse, after seating
                     Elvira; and turning to her, he pressed one of her hands to his lips, saying,
                     "Pardonnez-moi,"—adding as he dropt it, "tout nous sourit dans la nature."</p>
                  <p>Elvira pointed out the road leading to the dwelling of a justice of the peace,
                     a few miles below the line which divides the State of Massachusetts from that
                     of New-York. They arrived at this temple of Hymen, and of petty legislation
                     about eleven in the morning. The justice was at work on his farm; a messenger
                     was dispatched for him, with whom he returned in about thirty minutes, which
                     seemed as many hours to our anxious lovers.</p>
                  <p>"Dey say," said Lavoisier, "l'amour fait passer le temps, but in l'Amerique it
                     is very differente."</p>
                  <p>The justice took Lavoisier aside, and inquired whether there were any
                     objections to the marriage, on the part of the lady's friends.</p>
                  <p>"Objection!" said Lavoisier, "it is the most grand félicité to every body. You
                     cannot conceive."</p>
                  <p>On being further interrogated, Lavoisier confessed that they came from
                     Massachusetts; and being asked why they were not married at the place of the
                     lady's residence, he said that "some personnes without sensibilité may wait,
                     but for mademoiselle and me, it is impossible."</p>
                  <p>Elvira being examined apart, in like manner, declared that her intended
                     husband's impatience and her own dislike to the formality of a publishment, had
                     led them to avoid the usual mode and forms of marriage.</p>
                  <p>The justice, who derived the chief profits of his office from clandestine
                     matches, and who had made these inquiries more because it was a common custom,
                     than from any scruples of conscience, or sense of official duty, was perfectly
                     satisfied; and after requiring from the bridegroom the usual promise to love
                     and cherish; and from the bride, to love, cherish, and obey; pronounced them
                     man and wife, and recorded the marriage in a book containing a record of
                     similar official acts, and of divers suits and the proceedings therein.</p>
                  <p>The bride and bridegroom immediately set out for the North River, intending to
                     embark there for New-York.</p>
                  <p>"These things do manage themselves better in France," said Lavoisier. "Les
                     nôces qui se font ici—the marriages you make here—are as solemn que la
                     sepulture—as to bury. Le Cupidon ici a l'air bien sauvage; if de little god was
                     paint here, they would make him work as de justice. Eh bien!" said he, after a
                     pause, "chacun a son métier; without some fermiers there should not be some
                     maîtres-de-danse, some professeurs of de elegant arts: et sans les justices,
                     you would not be mon ange—you would not be Madame Lavoisier."</p>
                  <p>Elvira was so occupied with the change in her condition, and the prospect
                     before her, that she did not observe the direction in which they were
                     travelling; and by mistake they<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7726-00000104"/> took
                     the road leading back through a cleft in the mountain towards a village in the
                     vicinity of the one they had left.</p>
                  <p>As they ascended the top of a hill, their steed began to prick his ears at the
                     distant sound of a drum and fife, which the fugitives soon perceived to be part
                     of the pride, pomp, and circumstance of a militia training. The village tavern
                     was in full view, and within a short distance, and the company was performing
                     some marching evolution a little beyond. An election of captain had just taken
                     place; and the suffrages of the citizen soldiers had fallen upon a popular
                     favourite, who had taken his station as commanding officer, and was showing his
                     familiarity with the marches and counter-marches of Eaton's Manual. He had been
                     just promoted from the rank of first lieutenant; and previous to the dismissal
                     of his men, which was about to take place, he drew them up in front of the
                     village store, when according to custom, and with due regard to economy, which
                     made the store a more eligible place for his purposes than the tavern, he
                     testified his gratitude for the honour which had been done him by copious
                     libations of cherry rum, and of St. Croix, which was diluted or not, according
                     to the taste of each individual. The men soon began to grow merry; and some of
                     them swore that they would not scruple to vote for the captain for
                     major-general, if they had the choosing of that officer. The venders of
                     gingerbread felt the influence of the good fellowship and generosity which the
                     captain had set in motion. A market for a considerable portion of their
                     commodity was soon furnished by the stimulated appetites of the men, and a
                     portion was distributed by the more gallant among them, to some spectators of
                     the softer sex, who were collected upon the occasion.</p>
                  <p>The happy pair in the mean time had arrived at the tavern. Elvira's attention
                     had not been sufficiently awakened by any thing but the conversation of her
                     husband, to notice where she was, until she was called to a sense of her
                     embarrassing situation by the landlord's sign, as it was gently swinging in the
                     wind between two high posts, and exhibited a successful specimen of village
                     sign-painting, the distinguished name of the host, and the age of his
                     establishment.</p>
                  <p>Elvira directed the Frenchman to stop and turn his horse, which he did
                     immediately, without understanding the object.</p>
                  <p>"Eh bien!" said he, his eyes still fixed on the young soldiers; "Il me vient
                     une idée. I shall tell you." He went on to signify that he would immediately
                     offer to teach the art of fencing and of using the broad-sword; that he would
                     instruct them "dans l'art militaire, à la mode de Napoleon;" and that, after
                     giving a few lessons, he would make a tournament, in which he would let them
                     see, among other things, how Bonaparte conquered the world; how the cavalry
                     could trample down flying infantry; and how the infantry, in such
                     circumstances, could defend themselves; and that he would, in this way, make
                     himself "bien riche."</p>
                  <p>During all this time Elvira was collecting her wits to know what the emergency
                     required; and as soon as Lavoisier's volley ceased, she begged him to return
                     again, thinking she might best avoid observation by seeking shelter in the
                     tavern till dark.</p>
                  <p>They immediately alighted, and Lavoisier, after showing his bride to her
                     apartment, descended to give some orders about his horse; when, to his
                     astonishment, he was accosted by the jolly landlord, whose name was Thomas,
                     "Ha, mounsheer! I guess you are the man who staid with me a fortnight two years
                     ago, when I kept house in York State, and borrowed my chaise to go a jaunting,
                     and told me to take care<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7726-00000105"/> of your
                     trunk, that had nothing but a big stone in it, till you came back. I got my
                     horse and chaise again," continued he, seizing the astounded professor of the
                     dancing and military arts by the collar, "and now I'll take my reck'nin' out of
                     your skin, if I can't get it any other way."</p>
                  <p>At this moment the new captain and a considerable number of his merry men
                     entered the house. After they had learned the circumstances of the case, from
                     what passed between monsieur and the landlord, one of them cried out, "Ride him
                     on a rail—let him take his steps in the air!"</p>
                  <p>"He ought to dance on nothing, with a rope round his neck," said Thomas.</p>
                  <p>"No, no," said a third, "he has taken steps enough; that flashy jacket had
                     better be swapped for one of tar and feathers."</p>
                  <p>"Messieurs, messieurs," said Lavoisier, "je suis bien malheureux. I am very
                     sorry. Il etoit mon malheur—it was my misère to not pay monsieur Thomas, and it
                     was his malheur not to be paid. I shall show you my honneur, when I shall get
                     de l'argent. Il faut se soumettre aux circonstances. De honesty of every body
                     depend upon what dey can do. I am sure, every body is gentleman in dis country.
                     C'est un beau pays."</p>
                  <p>By this time one of the corporals had set a skillet of tar on the fire, and
                     another, by the direction of the lieutenant, who seemed to take upon himself
                     the command of the party, had brought a pillow from a bed in an adjoining room.
                     The pillow was very expeditiously uncased, and a sufficient rent made in the
                     ticking. The astonished Français stood aghast, as his bewildered mind caught a
                     faint notion of the purpose of these preparations. He changed his tones of
                     supplication to those of anger. "Vous êtes des sauvages!" he exclaimed. "You
                     are monstres, diables! You do not merit to have some gentiman to teach la belle
                     danse in dis country."</p>
                  <p>"He'll cackle like a blue-jay," said the corporal, "by the time we get the
                     feathers on him."</p>
                  <p>"They are hen's feathers," said the lieutenant, "but they'll do. Now ensign
                     Sacket get on to the table, and corporal you hand him the skillet of tar. You
                     Mr. Le Vosher, or whatever your name is, stand alongside of the table."</p>
                  <p>Monsieur believed his destiny to be fixed—"Oh, mon Dieu!" he exclaimed; "le
                     diable! qu'est que c'est que ça? Vat you do—vat is dat?"</p>
                  <p>"Tar, tar, nothing but tar—stand up to the table," was the reply.</p>
                  <p>"Sacristie! put dat sur ma tête—on my head et sur mes habits—my clothes; mes
                     beaux habits de noces—my fine clothes for de marriage! Oh, messieurs, de grace,
                     pardonnez-moi; vous gaterez—you will spoil all my clothes."</p>
                  <p>"Blast your clothes!" said the corporal; "pull them off."</p>
                  <p>"Je vous remercie, tank you, gentlemen;" and he very deliberately divested
                     himself of a superfine light-blue broadcloath coat, and embroidered silk vest,
                     a laced cravat and an under cravat of coarser fabric. He prolonged the
                     operation as much as possible, making continued efforts to conciliate the
                     compassion of his persecutors, which only added to their merriment.</p>
                  <p>At last all pretences for delay were over; every voice was hushed. The ensign
                     began to uplift the fatal skillet, when all composure of mind forsook the
                     affrighted bridegroom, and he uttered a loud shriek. Favoured by the general
                     stillness, Elvira distinctly heard his voice, and knew at once that it
                     betokened the extremity of distress. She rushed to the rescue, screaming for
                     mercy. The men fell back, leaving their<pb n="212-213"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000106"/> trembling victim in the centre of the room. "Ah!
                     ma chère, quels bêtes!" he exclaimed, with a grimace that produced a peal of
                     laughter. One of the men threw him his coat, another his vest; while the
                     corporal set down the skillet, saying, "If it had not been for his
                        <emph>gal,</emph> I'd have given him a wedding suit."</p>
                  <p>But we rather think monsieur would have been released without the interposition
                     of his distressed bride, for a Yankey mob is proverbially good-natured, and the
                     merry men had enlisted in the landlord's cause, for the sake of a joke, rather
                     than with the intention of inflicting pain. After the ludicrous adventure was
                     over—ludicrous to the jolly <emph>trainers,</emph> but sad enough to the
                     fugitive pair—Elvira deemed it expedient to press their retreat. Monsieur
                     brought the chaise to the door, and they drove away amidst the loud huzzas and
                     merry clappings of the jovial company.</p>

                  <p>DAVID WILSON, not long after the affair of the robbery of his mother's desk,
                     went to New-York, in order to see his comrades, who were imprisoned there, and,
                     if possible, to abate <choice>

                     in (attracted doubtless by natural affinities) with other companions as wicked,
                     and more desperate, he soon spent in that city, which affords remarkable
                     facilities for ridding men of their money, all that remained of the five
                     hundred dollars. He preyed on others for a little time, as he had been their
                     prey; and, finally reduced to extreme want, he joined two of his new associates
                     in an attempt on the southern mail, which ended in his detection and commitment
                     to jail in Philadelphia, where he was now awaiting a capital trial. A
                     particular account of the whole affair, accompanied with letters from her son,
                     was transmitted to Mrs. Wilson, who seemed now to be visited on every side with
                     the natural and terrible retribution of her maternal sins.</p>
                  <p>After Elvira's departure, with all the profits of her little<pb n="214-215"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000107"/> school, Jane did not delay another moment to go
                     to her aunt's, in order to communicate to her Mr. Lloyd's kind offer of
                     assistance, and to extend to her any aid or consolation in her own power.</p>
                  <p>She found Mrs. Wilson alone, but not in a frame of mind that indicated any just
                     feelings. She received her niece coldly. After a silence of a few moments,
                     which Jane wished but knew not how to break, she inquired of Mrs. Wilson,
                     whether she had any more information respecting David than was public?</p>
                  <p>Her aunt replied, she had not. She understood the particulars were all in the
                     paper, even to his name; she thought that might have been omitted; but people
                     always seemed to delight in publishing every one's misfortunes.</p>
                  <p>Jane asked if the letters expressed any doubt that David would be
                     convicted?</p>
                  <p>"None," Mrs. Wilson said. "To be sure," she added, "I have a letter from David,
                     in which he begs me to employ counsel for him: so I suppose he thinks it
                     possible that he might be cleared: but a drowning man catches at straws."</p>
                  <p>"Do you know," inquired Jane, "the names of the eminent lawyers in
                     Philadelphia? Mr. Lloyd will be best able to inform you whom to select among
                     them. I will go to him immediately."</p>
                  <p>"No, no, child; I have made up my mind upon that subject. It would be a great
                     expense. There is no conscience in city lawyers; they would devour all my
                     substance, and do me no good after all. No, no—I shall leave David entirely in
                     the hands of Providence."</p>
                  <p>"And can you, aunt," said Jane, "acquiesce in your son's being cut off in the
                     spring of life, without an effort to save him—without an effort to procure him
                     a space for repentance and reformation?"</p>
                  <p>"Do not presume, Jane Elton," replied Mrs. Wilson, "to instruct me in my
                     duties. A space for repentance! A day—an hour—a moment is as good as an
                     eternity for the operations of the Spirit. Many, at the foot of the gallows,
                     have repented, and have died exulting in their pardon and newborn hope."</p>
                  <p>"Yes," replied Jane; "and there have been many who have thus repented and
                     rejoiced, and then been reprieved; and have they then shown the only
                     unquestionable proof of genuine penitence—a renewed spirit? Have they kept the
                     commandments, for by this shall ye know that they are the disciples of Christ?
                     No: they have returned to their old sins, and been tenfold worse than at
                     first."</p>
                  <p>"I tell you," said Mrs. Wilson, impatiently, "you are ignorant, child; you are
                     still in the bond of iniquity; you cannot spiritually discern. There is more
                     hope, and that is the opinion of some of our greatest divines, of an open
                     outrageous transgressor, than of one of a moral life."</p>
                  <p>"Then," replied Jane, "there is more hope of a harvest from a hard-bound,
                     neglected field, than from that which the owner has carefully ploughed and
                     sowed, and prepared for the sun and the rains of heaven."</p>
                  <p>"The kingdom of grace is very different from the kingdom of nature," answered
                     Mrs. Wilson. "The natural man can do nothing towards his own salvation. Every
                     act he performs, and every prayer he offers, but provokes more and more the
                     wrath of the Almighty."</p>
                  <p>Jane made no reply; but she raised her hands and eyes as if she deprecated so
                     impious a doctrine, and Mrs. Wilson went on: "Do not think my children are
                     worse than others;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7726-00000108"/> you, Jane, are as
                     much a child of wrath, and so is every son and daughter of Adam, as he is—all
                     totally depraved—totally corrupt. You may have been under more restraint, and
                     not acted out your sins; but no thanks to you;" and she continued, fixing her
                     large gray eyes steadfastly on Jane, "there are beside my son who would not
                        <emph>seem</emph> better, if they had not friends to keep their secrets for
                     them." Mrs. Wilson had, for very good reasons, never before alluded to the
                     robbery of her desk, since the morning it was committed; but she was now
                     provoked to foul means to support her argument, tottering under the assault of
                     facts.</p>
                  <p>Jane did not condescend to notice the insinuation; she felt too sincere a pity
                     for the miserable self-deluded woman; but, still anxious that some effort
                     should be made for David, she said to Mrs. Wilson, "Is there, then, nothing to
                     be done for your unhappy son?"</p>
                  <p>"Nothing, child, nothing; he has gone out from me, and he is not of me; his
                     blood be upon his own head; I am clear of it; my 'foot standeth on an even
                     place.' My case is not an uncommon one," she continued, as if she would by this
                     vain babbling, silence the voice within. "The saints of old—David, and Samuel,
                     and Eli, were afflicted as I am, with rebellious children. I have planted and I
                     have watered, and if it is the Lord's will to withhold the increase, I must
                     submit."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, aunt!" exclaimed Jane, interrupting and advancing towards her, "do not—do
                     not, for your soul's sake, indulge any longer this horrible delusion. You have
                     more children," she continued, falling on her knees, and taking one of her
                     aunt's hands in both hers, and looking like a rebuking messenger from Heaven,
                     "be pitiful to them; be merciful to your own soul. You deceive yourself. You
                     may deceive others; but God is not mocked."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson was conscience stricken. She sat as motionless aa a statue; and
                     Jane went on with the courage of an Apostle to depicture, in their true
                     colours, her character and conduct. She made her realize, for a few moments at
                     least, the peril of her soul. She made her feel, that her sound faith, her
                     prayers, her pretences, her meeting-goings, were nothing—far worse than nothing
                     in the sight of Him, who cannot be deceived by the daring hypocrisies, the
                     self-delusions, the refugies of lies, of his creatures. She described the
                     spiritual disciple of Jesus; and then presented to Mrs. Wilson so true an image
                     of her selfishness, her pride, her domestic tyranny, and her love of money,
                     that she could not but see that it was her very self. There was that in Jane's
                     looks, and voice, and words, that was not to be resisted by the wretched woman;
                     and like the guilty king, when he saw the record on the wall, her "countenance
                     was changed, her thoughts were troubled, and her knees smote one against the
                     other."</p>
                  <p>At this moment they were interrupted by the entrance of Mr. Lloyd. Jane rose,
                     embarrassed for her aunt and herself, and walked to the window. Mrs. Wilson
                     attempted to speak, to rise; she could do neither, and she sunk back on her
                     chair, convulsed with misery and passion. Mr. Lloyd mistook her agitation for
                     the natural wailing of a mother and with instinctive benevolence he advanced to
                     her, and said, "Be composed, I pray; I have intelligence that will comfort
                     thee."</p>
                  <p>"What is it?" inquired Jane, eager to allay the storm she had raised.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson was unable to speak.</p>
                  <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7726-00000109"/>
                  <p>"Thy son has escaped, Mrs. Wilson, and is, before this, beyond the reach of his
                     country's laws. Here is a letter addressed to thee, which came inclosed in one
                     to me." Mr. Lloyd laid the letter on Mrs. Wilson's lap, but she was unable to
                     open it or even to hold it. Her eyes were fixed, her hands firmly closed, and
                     she continued to shiver with uncontrollable emotion. "She is quite
                     unconscious," he said, "she does not hear a word I say to her."</p>
                  <p>Jane flew to her assistance, spoke to her, entreated her to answer, bathed her
                     temples and her hands—but all without effect. "Oh!" she exclaimed, terrified
                     and dismayed, "I have killed her."</p>
                  <p>"Do not be so alarmed," said Mr. Lloyd, "there is no occasion for it; the
                     violence of her emotion has overcome her, it is the voice of nature; let us
                     convey her to her bed."</p>
                  <p>Jane called assistance, and they removed her to her own room, and placed her on
                     her bed.</p>
                  <p>"See," whispered Mr. Lloyd to Jane, after a few moments, "she is becoming
                     composed already; leave her for a little time with this domestic—I have much to
                     say to thee."</p>
                  <p>Jane followed him to the parlour. He took both her hands, and said, his face
                     radiant with joy, "Jane, many daughters have done virtuously, but thou
                     excellest them all Nay, do not tremble, unless it be for the sin of having kept
                     from me so long the blessed intelligence of this morning."</p>
                  <p>Poor Jane tried to stammer out an apology for her reserve, but Mr. Lloyd
                     interrupted her by saying playfully, "I understand it all; I am too old, too
                     stern, too—Quakerish, to be a young lady's confidant."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, say not so," exclaimed Jane, gathering courage from his kindness; "you
                     have been my benefactor, my guardian, my kindest friend; forgive my silence—I
                     feel it all—I have always felt it; perhaps most, when I seemed most
                     insensible." Mr. Lloyd looked gratified beyond expression; it cost him an
                     effort to interrupt her. But he said, "Nay, my sweet friend, it will be my turn
                     next, if thou dost not stop, and I too shall be, as the French name my
                     brethren, a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Trembleur.</foreign> I have a great deal to
                     tell thee; our joys have clustered. What sayest thou, Jane, to another walk to
                     old John's, with as strange, and a more welcome guide, than crazy Bet. I have
                     no time to lose in enigmas: our dispatches were brought by a sailor, a fine
                     good-natured, hardy-looking fellow, who came to my house this morning. I was
                     wondering what he could be doing so far from his element, when Mary, who
                     returned to us yesterday, opened the door for him, and exclaimed, with a
                     ludicrous mixture of terror and joy, 'The Lord have mercy on us! is it you, or
                     your ghost, Jemmy?' The sailor gave her a truly professional, and most
                     unghostly, smack, and replied between crying and laughing, 'I am no ghost,
                     Mary, as you may see; but excuse me, Mary, (for Mary had stepped back, a little
                     embarrassed by the involuntary freedom of her friend,) I was so glad, I could
                     not help it. No, no, Mary, I am no ghost, but a prodigal that's come back,
                     thanks to the Lord! a little better than I went.' James, who is indeed the long
                     lost son of our good friend John of the Mountain, went on to detail his
                     experiences to Mary, who by turns raised her hands and eyes in wonder and
                     devout thankfulness. The amount of it is, for their joy overflowed all barriers
                     of reserve, he left this place ten years ago in despair, because Mary would not
                     marry him, and sailed to the Mediterranean; the poor fellow was taken by the
                     Algerines, and after suffering almost incredibly for six years, he was so happy
                     as to procure his freedom along with some English captives. After his
                        release,<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7726-00000110"/> he said he could not
                     endure the thought of coming to his father and mother quite destitute; for, as
                     he said to Mary, though he was a wild lad, and had a fancy to follow the sea,
                     her cruelty would not have driven him to leave them, if he had not hoped to get
                     something to comfort their old age with. He wrote them an account of his
                     sufferings, and of an engagement he had made to go to Calcutta in the service
                     of an English merchantman. The letters it seems never reached them. He went to
                     India; many circumstances occurred to advance him in the favour of his
                     employer; his integrity, which, he said, the tears streaming from his eyes, was
                     'all owing to the teachings and examples of his good old parents;' and his
                     intelligence, 'thanks to his country, which took care to give the poor man
                     learning,' occasioned his being employed in the Company's service, and sent
                     with some others into the interior of India on business of great hazard and
                     importance, the success of which his employers attributed to him, and rewarded
                     him most liberally. All these facts came out inevitably in the course of his
                     narrative, for he spoke not boastfully, but with simplicity and gratitude. He
                     has returned with enough to purchase a farm, and give to his parents all that
                     they want of this world; and, what our friend Mary thinks best of all, he has
                     come home a Methodist, having been made one by a missionary of that zealous
                     sect in India. If I have not misinterpreted Mary's glistening eye, this fact
                     will cost me my housekeeper."</p>
                  <p>"Dear, dear Mary!" exclaimed Jane, brushing away the tears of sympathy and joy
                     that Mr. Lloyd's narrative had brought to her eyes, "and John, and old Sarah.
                     Oh, it is as beautiful a conclusion of their lives, as if it had been conjured
                     up by a poet."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, Jane," replied Mr. Lloyd, "there are realities in the kind dispositions of
                     Providence more blessed than a poet can dream of; and there are virtues in real
                     life," he continued, smiling, "that might lend a persuasive grace to the page
                     of a moralist; it is of those I must now speak."</p>
                  <p>"Not now," said Jane, hastily rising, "I must go to my aunt."</p>
                  <p>"At least then, take these letters with thee; the levity of one will give thee
                     some pain; in the other, the wretched Wilson has done thee late justice. Now
                     go, my blessed friend, to thy aunt; would that thou couldst minister to her
                     mind, distracted by these terrible events. Oh, that power might be given to thy
                     voice to awaken her conscience from its deep, oblivious sleep!"</p>
                  <p>It was a remarkable proof of Mr. Lloyd's habitual grace, that he did not
                     forget, at this moment, that Jane could not work miracles without supernatural
                     assistance.</p>
                  <p>There is not a happier moment of existence than that which a benevolent being
                     enjoys, when he knows that the object of his solicitude and love has passed
                     safely through trial, is victorious over temptation, and has overcome the
                     world. This was the joy that now a thousand fold requited Mr. Lloyd for all his
                     sufferings in the cause of our heroine. Would Mr. Lloyd have been equally happy
                     in the proved virtue of his favourite, if hope had not brightened his dim
                     future with her sweetest visions? Certainly not. He who hath wonderfully made
                     us, hath, in wisdom, implanted the principle of self-love in our bosoms; and
                     let the enthusiast rave as he will, it is neither the work of grace nor of
                     discipline to eradicate it; but it may, and if we would be good, it must be
                     modified, controlled, and made subservient to the benefit and happiness of
                     others.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Lloyd had no very definite plans for the future; but<pb n="222-223"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000111"/> his horizon was brightening with a coming day;
                     and without vanity or presumption, he trusted all would be well.</p>
                  <p>Jane returned to her aunt's apartment, and found her in a sullen stupor. She
                     did not seem to notice; at any rate, she made no reply to Jane's kind
                     inquiries, and she, after drawing the curtains and dismissing the attendant,
                     sat down to the perusal of the letters Mr. Lloyd had given to her. The first
                     she read was from Erskine to Mr. Lloyd, and as it was not long, and was rather
                     characteristic, we shall take the liberty to transcribe it for the benefit of
                     our readers.</p>

                              <p>"In returning to my lodgings, late last evening, I was accosted by
                                 a man, muffled in a cloak. I recognised his voice at once. It was
                                 our unfortunate townsman, Wilson. He has succeeded <foreign
                                    xml:lang="FRA">à merveille</foreign> in an ingenious plan of
                                 escape from durance, and sails in the morning for one of the West
                                 India islands, where he will, no doubt, make his debût as pirate,
                                 or in some other character, for which his training has equally
                                 qualified him. A precious rascal he is indeed; but, allow me a
                                 phrase of your fraternity, sir, I had no <emph>light</emph> to give
                                 him up to justice, after he had trusted to me; and more than that,
                                 for he informs me, that he had, since his confinement, written to
                                 the Woodhulls to engage me as counsel, and through them he learnt
                                 the fact of my being in this city. This bound me, in some sort, to
                                 look upon the poor devil as my client; and, as it would have been
                                 my duty to get him out of the clutches of the law, it would have
                                 been most ungracious to have put him into them, you know, since his
                                 own cleverness, instead of mine, has extricated him. He has
                                 explained to me, and he informs me has communicated to you, (for he
                                 says he cannot trust his mother to make them public,) the
                                 particulars of the sequestration of the old woman's money. I think
                                 Miss Elton never imparted to you the event that led to the sudden
                                 engagement, from which she has chosen to absolve me; and you have
                                 yet to learn, that there is generosity, disinterestedness in the
                                 world, that may rival the virtue which reposes under the shadow of
                                 the broad-brim. But, your pardon. I have wiped out all scores. The
                                 reception I have met with in this finest of cities, has been such
                                 as to make me look upon the incidents of an obscure village as mere
                                 bagatelles, not worthy of a sigh from one who can bask in the broad
                                 sunshine of ladies' favour and fortune's gifts. One word more,
                                    <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en passant,</foreign> of Wilson's
                                 explanations. I rejoice in it sincerely, on Miss Elton's account.
                                 She deserved to have suffered a little for her childishness in
                                 holding herself bound by an exacted promise, for having put herself
                                 in a situation in which her guilt would have seemed apparent to any
                                 one but a poor dog whom love had hoodwinked——pro tempore. She is
                                 too young and too beautiful a victim for the altar of conscience.
                                 However, I forgive her, her scruples, her fanaticism, and her
                                 cruelties; and wish her all happiness in this world and the next,
                                 advising her not to turn anchorite here, for the sake of
                                 advancement there.</p>
                              <p>"I know not when I shall return to the village life: stale, flat,
                                 and unprofitable. This gay metropolis has cured me of my rural
                                 tastes; and, as I flatter myself, fashion's hand has quite effaced
                                 my rusticity.</p>

                  <p>"And is this the man," thought Jane, as she folded the letter, "that I have
                     loved—that I fancied loved me?"—and her heart rose in devout thankfulness for
                     the escape she had made from an utter wreck of her happiness.</p>
                  <p>She next read Wilson's letter to Mr. Lloyd. It began with the particulars of
                     his late escape, which seemed to possess his mind more than any thing else. He
                     then said, that being about to enter on a new voyage, he wished to lighten his
                     soul of as much of its present cargo as possible. He stated, and we believe
                     with sincerity, that he had intended, if it ever became necessary, to assert
                     Jane's innocence; but that, as long as no one believed her guilty, he had
                     thought it fair to slip his neck out of the yoke; and now, that every body
                     might know how good she was, he wished Mr. Lloyd to make known all the
                     particulars of the transaction. He then went on to detail as much as he knew of
                     her visit to the mountain, which had led to her subsequent involvement. He
                     expressed no remorse for the past, no hope of the future. His wish to exculpate
                     Jane had arisen from a deep feeling of her excellence, and seemed to be the
                     last ray of just or kindly feeling that his dark, guilty spirit emitted.</p>
                  <p>Jane had scarcely finished reading the letters, when her attention was called
                     to her aunt, who had been thrown into a state of agitation almost amounting to
                     frenzy, by the perusal of her son's farewell letter to herself, which Mr. Lloyd
                     had placed on the pillow beside her, believing that it merely contained such
                     account of David's escape and plans, as would have a tendency to allay the
                     anguish of her mind, which he still supposed arose solely from her
                     apprehensions for her son's life. But Mr. Lloyd was too good even to conceive
                     of the bitterness of a malignant, exasperated spirit, wrought to madness, as
                     Wilson's was, by his mother's absolute refusal to make any effort to save his
                     life.</p>
                  <p>The letter was filled with execrations. "If I have a soul," he said, " eternity
                     will be spent in cursing her who has ruined it;" but he did not fear the
                     future—hell was a bug-dear to frighten children. "You," he continued, "neither
                     fear it, nor believe it; for if you did, your religion would be something
                     besides a cloak to hide your hard, cruel heart. Religion! what is it but a
                     dream, a pretence? I might have believed it, if I had seen more like Jane
                     Elton—whom you have trodden on, wrongfully accused, when <emph>you knew</emph>
                     her innocent. Mother, mother! oh, that I must call you so!—as I do it, I howl a
                     curse with every breath—you have destroyed me. You it was that taught me, when
                     I scarcely knew my right hand from my left, that there was no difference
                     between doing right and doing wrong, in the sight of the God you worship; you
                     taught me, that I could do nothing acceptable to him. If you taught me truly, I
                     have only acted out the nature totally depraved, (your own words,) that he gave
                     to me, and I am not to blame for it. I could do nothing to<pb n="226-227"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000113"/> save my own soul; and according to your own
                     doctrine, I stand now a better chance than my moral cousin, Jane. If you have
                     taught me falsely, I was not to blame; the peril be on your own soul. My mind
                     was a blank, and you put your own impressions on it; God (if there be a God)
                     reward you according to your deeds!"</p>
                  <p>This horrible letter, of which we have given a brief specimen; and subtracted
                     from that the curses that pointed every sentence, seemed for a little while to
                     swell the clamours of Mrs. Wilson's newly awakened conscience. But, alas! the
                     impression was transient; the chains of systematic delusion were too firmly
                     riveted—the habits of self-deception too strong, to be overcome.</p>
                  <p>Jane, fearful that the violence of her aunt's passion would destroy her reason,
                     sought only, for the remainder of the day and the following night, to soothe
                     and quiet her. She remained by her bedside, and silently watched, and prayed.
                     Mrs. Wilson's sleep was disturbed, but she awoke somewhat refreshed, and quite
                     composed. Her first action was to tear David's letter into a thousand
                     fragments. She was never known afterwards to allude to its contents, nor to her
                     conversation with Jane. There was a restlessness through the remainder of her
                     life, which betrayed the secret gnawings of conscience. Still it is believed,
                     she quelled her convictions as Cromwell is reported to have done, when, as his
                     historian says, he asked Goodwin, one of his preachers, if the doctrine were
                     true, that the elect should never fall, nor suffer a final reprobation?—"
                     Nothing more certain," replied the preacher. "Then I am safe," said the
                     Protector; "for I am sure I was once in a state of grace."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson survived these events but a few years. She was finally carried off
                     by scrofula, a disease from which she had suffered all her life, and which had
                     probably increased the natural asperity of her temper; as all evils, physical
                     as well as moral, certainly make us worse, if they do not make us better.
                     Elvira was summoned to her death-bed; but she arrived too late to receive
                     either the reproaches or forgiveness of her mother. Jane faithfully attended
                     her through her last illness, and most kindly ministered to the diseases of her
                     body. Her mind no human comfort could reach; no earthly skill touch is secret
                     springs. The disease was attended with delirium; and she had no rational
                     communication with any one from the beginning of her illness. This Jane
                     afterwards sincerely deplored to Mr. Lloyd, who replied, "I would not sit like
                     the Egyptians in judgment on the dead. Thy aunt has gone with her record to Him
                     who alone knows the secrets of the heart, and therefore is alone qualified to
                     judge His creatures; but for our own benefit, Jane, and for the sake of those
                     whose probation is not past, let us ever remember the wise saying of William
                     Penn, 'a man cannot be the better for that religion for which his neighbour is
                     the worse.' I have no doubt thy aunt has suffered some natural compunctions for
                     her gross failure in the performance of her duties; but she felt safe in a
                     sound faith. It is reported, that one of the Popes said of himself, that 'as
                     Eneas Sylvius, he was a damnable heretic, but as Pius II. an orthodox
                     Pope.'"</p>
                  <p>"Then you believe," replied Jane, "that my unhappy aunt deceived herself by her
                     clamorous profession?"</p>
                  <p>"Undoubtedly. Ought we to wonder that she effected that imposition on herself,
                     by the aid of self-love, (of all love the most blinding,) since we have heard,
                     in her funeral sermon, her religious experiences detailed as the triumphs of a
                     saint; her strict attention on religious ordinances commended, as if they were
                     the end and not the means of a religious life; since<pb n="228-229"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000114"/> we (who cannot remember a single gracious act of
                     humility in her whole life) have been told, as a proof of her gracious state,
                     that the last rational words she pronounced were, that she 'was of sinners the
                     chief?' There seems to be a curious spiritual alchymy in the utterance of these
                     words; for we cannot say, that those who use them mean to 'palter in a double
                     sense,' but they are too often spoken and received as the evidence of a hopeful
                     state. Professions and declarations have crept in among the Protestants, to
                     take the place of the mortifications and penances of the ancient church; so
                     prone are men to find some easier way to heaven than the toilsome path of
                     obedience."</p>

                  <p>WE have anticipated our story, tempted by a natural desire to conclude the
                     history of Mrs. Wilson, that its deep shade might not interfere with the bright
                     lights that are falling on the destiny of our heroine. After the dissolution of
                     her engagement with Erskine, Jane continued her humble vocation of
                     schoolmistress for some months. Rebecca Lloyd had from the beginning been one
                     of her pupils, and a favourite among them; and so devotedly did the child love
                     her instructress, that Mr. Lloyd often thought impulse was as sure a guide for
                     her affections as reason for his. Jane's care of his child furnished him
                     occasion, and an excuse when he needed it, for frequent intercourse with her,
                     and in this intercourse there were none of those mysterious embarrassments
                     (mysterious, because inexplicable to all but the parties) that so often check
                     the progress of affection. Jane, released from the thraldom in which she had
                     been bound to Erskine, was as happy as a liberated captive. Her tastes and her
                     views were similar to Mr. Lloyd's, and she found in his society a delightful<pb
                        n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7726-00000115"/> ful exchange, and a rich
                     compensation for the solitude to which her mind and affections had been
                     condemned.</p>
                  <p>We are ignorant, perhaps Jane was, of the precise moment when gratitude melted
                     into love, and friendship resigned the reins to his more fervid dominion. But
                     it was not long after this, nor quite "a year and a day" (the period of
                     mourning usually allotted to a faithful husband) after her separation from
                     Erskine, that, as she was sitting with Mrs. Harvey in her little parlour, Mr.
                     Lloyd entered with his child. After the customary greetings, Mrs. Harvey
                     suddenly recollected that some domestic duties demanded her presence, and
                     saying with an arch smile to Mr. Lloyd that she "hoped he would overlook her
                     absence," she left the room. Little Rebecca was sitting on her father's knee;
                     she took from his bosom a miniature of her mother, which he always wore there,
                     and seemed intently studying the lovely face which the artist had truly
                     delineated. "Do the angels look like my mother?" she asked.</p>
                  <p>"Why, my child?"</p>
                  <p>"I thought, father, they might look like her, she looks so bright and so good."
                     She kissed the picture, and after a moment's pause, added, "Jane looks like
                     mother, all but the cap; dost not thee think, father, Jane would look pretty in
                     a Quaker cap?" Mr Lloyd kissed his little girl, and said nothing. Rebecca's
                     eyes followed the direction of her father's: "Oh, Jane!" she exclaimed, "thou
                     dost not look like mother now, thy cheeks are as red as my new doll's."</p>
                  <p>The child's observation of her treacherous cheek had certainly no tendency to
                     lessen poor Jane's colour. She would have been glad to hide her face any where,
                     but it was broad daylight, and there was now no escape from the declaration
                     which had been hovering on Mr. Lloyd's lips for some weeks, and which was now
                     made in spite of Rebecca's presence. It cannot be denied, in deference to the
                     opinion of some very fastidious ladies, that Jane was prepared for it; for
                     though the marks of love are not quite as obvious, as the lively Rosalind
                     describes them, yet we believe that, except in the case of very wary
                     lovers—cautious veterans—they are first observed by the objects of the
                     passion.</p>
                  <p>We are warned from attempting to describe the scene to which our little pioneer
                     had led the way, by the fine remark of a sentimentalist, who compares the
                     language of lovers to the most delicate fruits of a warm climate—very delicious
                     where they grow, but not capable of transportation.</p>
                  <p>The result of the interview was perfectly satisfactory to both parties; and as
                     this was one of the occasions when all the sands of time are "diamond sparks,"
                     it is impossible to say when it would have come to a conclusion had it not been
                     for little Rebecca, who seemed to preside over the destinies of that day.</p>
                  <p>Her father had interpreted his conversation with Jane to his child, and had
                     succeeded in rendering the object and the result of it level to her
                     comprehension, and she had lavished her joy in loud exclamations and tender
                     caresses; till finding she was no longer noticed, she had withdrawn to a
                     window, and was amusing herself with gazing at the passengers in the street,
                     when she suddenly turned to Jane, and raising the window at the same moment,
                     she said, "Oh, there goes Mary to lecture, may I call her and tell her?"</p>
                  <p>At this moment the sweet child might have asked any thing without the chance of
                     a refusal, and ready assent was no sooner granted, than she screamed and
                     beckoned to Mary, who immediately obeyed the summons.</p>
                  <p>Mary entered, and Rebecca closing the door after her,<pb n="232-233"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000116"/> said, "I guess thee will not want to go to
                     lecture to-day, Mary, for I have a most beautiful secret to tell thee; hold
                     down thy ear, and promise never to tell as long as thy name is Mary Hull;" and
                     then, unable any longer to subdue her voice to a whisper, she jumped up and
                     clapped her hands, and shouted, "Joy, joy, joy! Mary, Jane Elton is coming to
                     live with us all the days of her life, and is going to be my own mother."</p>
                  <p>Mary looked to Mr. Lloyd, and then to Jane, and read in their faces the
                     confirmation of the happy tidings; and to Rebecca's utter amazement, the tears
                     streamed from her eyes. "Oh, Mary!" said she, turning disappointed away, "now I
                     am ashamed of thee, I thought thee would be as glad as I am."</p>
                  <p>But Mr. Lloyd and Jane knew how to understand this expression of her feelings;
                     they advanced to her and gave her their hands; she joined them: "the Lord hath
                     heard my prayer," she said.</p>
                  <p>"I thank thee, Mary," replied Mr. Lloyd; "God grant I may deserve thy
                     confidence."</p>
                  <p>"If she has prayed for it, what then does she cry for?" said Rebecca, who stood
                     beside her father, watching Mary's inexplicable emotion, and vainly trying to
                     get some clue to it.</p>
                  <p>"Come with me, my child, and I will tell thee," replied her father, and he very
                     discreetly led out the child, and left Jane with her faithful friend.</p>
                  <p>The moment he had closed the door, Mary said, smiling through her tears of joy,
                     "It has taken me by surprise at last, but for all that I am not quite so blind
                     as you may think. Do you remember, Jane, telling me one day when you laid your
                     book down to listen to Mr. Lloyd, who was talking to Rebecca, that since your
                     mother's voice had been silent, you had never heard one so sweet as Mr.
                     Lloyd's. I thought to myself then you seemed to feel just as I do when I hear
                     the sound of James's voice; not that I mean to compare myself to you, or James
                     to Mr. Lloyd, but it is the <emph>nature of the feeling</emph>—it is the same
                     in the high and the low, the rich and the poor."</p>
                  <p>"Was that all the ground of your suspicion?" asked Jane, smiling at her
                     friend's boasted sagacity.</p>
                  <p>"No, not quite all; James has been very impatient for our marriage; and from
                     time to time I have told Mr. Lloyd I wished he would look out for some one to
                     take charge of his house, and I advised him not to get a very young person,
                     for, says I, they are apt to be flighty. I never saw one that was not, but Jane
                     Elton. He smiled and blushed, and asked me what made me think that you were so
                     much above the rest of your sex, and so I told him, and he never seemed to
                     weary with talking about you."</p>
                  <p>"I am rejoiced," replied Jane, "that your partiality to me reconciles you to
                     the disparity in our ages."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, that is nothing; that is, in your case it is nothing. Let us see, eleven
                     years. In most cases it would be too much, to be sure; there is just four years
                     between James and I, that is just right, I think; and then, dear Jane, you are
                     so different from other people, you need not go by common rules."</p>
                  <p>The overflowing of Mary's heart was checked by the entrance of some company. As
                     she parted with Jane, she whispered, "I shall not think of leaving Mr. Lloyd
                     till you are married, be it sooner or later; when I see you in your own home,
                     it will be time enough to think of my affairs."</p>
                  <p>There still remained a delicate point to adjust: Mr.<pb n="234-235"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000117"/> Lloyd had been brought up a Quaker, and he had
                     seen no reason to depart from the faith or mode of worship which had come down
                     to him from his ancestors, and for which he felt on that account (as who does
                     not?) an attachment and veneration. He rarely, if ever, entered into discussion
                     upon religious subjects, and probably did not feel much zeal for some of the
                     peculiarities of his sect. He was not disposed to question their utility in
                     their ordinary operation upon common character. He knew how salutary were the
                     restraints of discipline upon the mass of men, and he considered the discipline
                     of habits and opinions infinitely more salutary than the direct and coarse
                     interference of power. He perceived, or thought he perceived, that as a body of
                     men, the "Friends" were upon the whole more happy and prosperous than any
                     other. No litigious contentions ever came among them. This circumstance Mr.
                     Lloyd ascribed in a considerable degree to the uniformity of their opinions,
                     habits, and lives, and to their custom of restricting their family alliances
                     within the limits of their own sect. Mr. Lloyd regarded with complacency most
                     of the characteristics of his own religious society; and those which he could
                     not wholly approve, he was yet disposed to regard in the most favourable light;
                     but he was no sectarian: his understanding was too much elevated, and his
                     affections were too diffused to be confined within the bounds of sect. Such
                     ties could not bind such a spirit. If any sectarian peculiarities had
                     interfered to restrain him in the exercise of his duty, or while acting under
                     the strong impulses of his generous nature, he would have shaken them off "like
                     dew-drops from a lion's mane." Exclusion from the society would have been
                     painful to him for many reasons, but the fear of it could not occasion a
                     moment's hesitation in his offering his hand to a woman whom he loved and
                     valued, and whose whole life he saw animated by the essential spirit of
                     Christianity. He determined now to inform his society of his choice, and to
                     submit to the censure and exclusion from membership that must follow. But Mr.
                     Lloyd was saved the painful necessity of breaking ties which were so strong
                     that they might be called natural bonds.</p>
                  <p>Jane had been early led to inquire into the particular modification of religion
                     professed by her benefactor, and respect for him had probably lent additional
                     weight to every argument in its favour. This was natural; and it was natural
                     too, that after her matured judgment sanctioned her early preference, she
                     should from motives of delicacy have hesitated to declare it. If it cannot be
                     denied that this proselyte was won by the virtues of Mr. Lloyd, it is to be
                     presumed that no Christian will deny the rightful power of such an
                     argument.</p>
                  <p>If the reader is not disposed to allow that Jane's choice of the religion of

                  <p>Not a word had passed between Mr. Lloyd and Jane on the subject of the mental
                     deliberations and resolves of each, when a few days after their engagement,
                     Jane said to him, "I have a mind to improve the fatal hint of my little

                  <p>"What dost thou mean, Jane?" inquired Mr. Lloyd, who seemed a little puzzled by
                     the gravity of her face, which was not quite in keeping with the playfulness of
                     her words.</p>
                  <p>"Seriously," she replied, "with your consent and approbation, I mean to be a

                  <p>"Shall my people be thy people?" exclaimed Mr. Lloyd with great animation.
                     "This, indeed, converts to pure gold the only circumstance that alloyed my
                     happiness; but do not imagine, dear Jane, that I think it of the least
                     consequence, by what name the different members of the Christian family are
                     called."</p>
                  <p>"But you think it right and <emph>orderly,</emph>" she replied, smiling, "that
                     the wife should take the name of the husband."</p>
                  <p>"I think it most happy, certainly."</p>
                  <p>There remained now no reason for deferring the marriage longer than was
                     rendered necessary by the delays attending the admission of a new member into
                     the Friends' society.</p>
                  <p>It was a beautiful morning in the beginning of May—the mist had rolled away
                     from the valley, and wreathed with silvery clouds the sides and summits of the
                     mountains—the air was sweet with the 'herald blossoms' of spring—and nature,
                     rising from her wintry bed, was throwing on her woods and fields her drapery of
                     tender green—when a carriage, containing Mr. Lloyd, Mary Hull, and little
                     Rebecca, stopped at Mrs. Harvey's door; Jane, arrayed for a journey, stood
                     awaiting it on the piazza; old John, the basket-maker, was beside her, leaning
                     on his cane, and good Mrs. Harvey was giving Jane's baggage to James, who
                     carried it to the carriage. "Farewell, dear Jane," said Mrs. Harvey,
                     affectionately kissing her;—"now go, but do not forget there are other
                     'friends' in the world, beside Quakers. Return to us soon; we are all impatient
                     to see you the happy mistress of the house in which you was born."</p>
                  <p>John followed her to the carriage, and respectfully taking her hand and Mr.
                     Lloyd's—"You've been my best friends," said he; "take an old man's blessing,
                     whose sun, thanks to the Lord who brought Jemmy back! is setting without a
                     cloud. God grant you both," he added, joining their hands, "a long and a happy
                     day. Truly says the good book, 'light is sown for the righteous, and joy for
                     the upright in heart.'"</p>
                  <p>James was the only person that did not seem to have his portion of the common
                     gladness. He had, with a poor grace, consented to defer his nuptials till
                     Mary's return from Philadelphia. He did not mind the time, he said, "five or
                     six weeks would not break his heart, though he had waited almost as long as
                     Jacob now; and he was not of a distrustful make; but it was a long way to
                     Philadelphia, and the Lord only knew what might happen." But nothing did
                     happen; at least nothing to justify our constant lover's forebodings.</p>
                  <p>Jane was received with cordiality into the Friends' society, and their hands
                     were joined, whose hearts were 'knit together.'</p>
                  <p>The travellers returned, in a few weeks, to ——, happy in each other, and
                     devoting themselves to the good and happiness of the human family. Their good
                     works shone before men; and "they seeing them, glorified their Father in
                     heaven." We dare not presume upon the good nature of our readers so far, as to
                     give the detail of Mary's wedding; at which our little friend Rebecca was the
                     happy mistress of ceremonies.</p>
                  <p>There yet remains something to be told of one of the persons of our humble
                     history, whom our readers may have forgotten, but to whom Mr. Lloyd extended
                     his kind regards—<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7726-00000119"/> the poor lunatic,
                     crazy Bet. He believed that her reason might be restored by skilful
                     management—by confinement to one place, and one set of objects, and by the
                     sedative influence of gentle manners, and regular habits in her attendants. He
                     induced Mary, in whose judiciousness and zeal he placed implicit confidence, to
                     undertake the execution of his plan; but after a faithful experiment of a few
                     months, they were obliged to relinquish all hope of restoring the mind to its
                     right balance. Mary said, when the weather was dull, she was as quiet as any
                     body; but if the sun shone out suddenly, it seemed as if its bright beams
                     touched her brain. A thunder-storm, or a clear moonlight, would throw her back
                     into her wild ways. "The poor thing," Mary added, "had such a tender heart,
                     that there seemed to be no way to harden it. If she sees a lamb die, or hears a
                     mournful note from a bird, when she has her <emph>low</emph> feelings, she'll
                     weep more than some mothers at the loss of a child."</p>
                  <p>No cure could be effected; but Mary's house continued to be the favourite
                     resort of the interesting vagrant. Her visits there became more frequent and
                     longer protracted. Mary observed, that the excitement of her mind was
                     exhausting her life, without Bet's seeming conscious of decay of strength, or
                     any species of suffering.</p>
                  <p>The last time Mary saw her, was a brilliant night during the full harvest moon;
                     she came to her house late in the evening; the wildness of her eye was tempered
                     with an affecting softness; her cheek was brightened with the hectic flush that
                     looks like 'mockery of the tomb'—Mary observed her to tremble, and perceived
                     that there was an alarming fluttering in her pulse. "You are not well," said
                     she.</p>
                  <p>"No, I am not well," Bet replied, in a low plaintive tone; "but I shall be
                     soon—here," said she, placing Mary's hand on her heart—"do not you feel it
                     struggling to be free?"</p>
                  <p>Mary was startled—the beating was so irregular, it seemed that every pulsation
                     must be the last. "Oh!" she exclaimed, "poor creature, let me put you in bed;
                     you are not fit to be sitting here."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no!" Bet replied, in the same feeble, mournful tone; 'I cannot stay here.
                     The spirits are out by the light of the blessed moon. Hark! do you not hear
                     them, Mary?"—and she sung so low that her voice sounded like distant music: <q>
                        <l>"Sister spirit, come away!"</l>
                     </q> "And do you not see their white robes?" she added, pointing through the
                     window to the vapour that curled along the margin of the river, and floated on
                     the bosom of the meadow.</p>
                  <p>Mary called to her husband, and whispered, "The poor thing is near death; let
                     us get her on the bed."</p>
                  <p>Bet overheard her. "No, do not touch me," she exclaimed; "the spirit cannot
                     rise here." She suddenly sprang on her feet, as if she had caught a new
                     inspiration, and darted towards the door. Mary's infant, sleeping in the
                     cradle, arrested her eye; she knelt for a moment beside it, and folded her
                     hands on her breast. Then rising, she said to Mary, "The prayer of the dying
                     sanctifies." The door was open, and she passed through it so suddenly that they
                     hardly suspected her intention before she was gone. The next morning she was
                     discovered in the church-yard, her head resting on the grassy mound that
                     covered the remains of her lover. Her spirit had passed to its eternal
                     rest!</p>

                  <p>THE exhaustion occasioned in Massachusetts by her struggles to support the
                     revolutionary contest, in which her efforts were, at least, equal to those of
                     any other State, and the taxes, which, at the close of the war, were
                     necessarily imposed upon the citizens by the State government, were the
                     principal causes of the disturbances in 1786-7, which are now talked of by some
                     of the older inhabitants, and particularly in the western part of the
                     commonwealth, as the "<hi rend="i"/>Shays war." It was so called from Daniel
                     Shays, one of the principal insurgents, and now (1822) a peaceable citizen and
                     revolutionary pensioner in the western part of the State of New-York.</p>
                  <p>This rebellion is certainly a stain upon the character of Massachusetts—almost
                     the only one. It may, nevertheless, serve to exhibit in a favourable light the
                     humane and orderly character of her inhabitants. If there were no wrongs to be
                     redressed, there were heavy sufferings and privations to be borne. The stimulus
                     of the revolutionary war had not wholly subsided, and the vague and fanciful
                     anticipations of all the blessings to be conferred by "glorious liberty," had
                     passed away. The people found that they had liberty indeed, but it was not what
                     they had painted to their fancies. They enjoyed a republican government, but
                     with it came increased taxation, poverty, and toil. Their means were rather
                     straitened than enlarged. From the embarrassment and confusion of the times,
                     debts had multiplied and accumulated; courts were established, and the laws
                     were enforced.</p>
                  <p>The organization of courts and the collection of debts, formed one of the
                     principal grounds of discontent. The court-houses were attacked and their
                     session sometimes prevented. The party in favour of the State government, and,
                     of course, of the support of the laws, was commonly called the <hi rend="i"
                     />court party. An Englishman might smile at such an application of the
                     term.</p>
                  <p>The insurrectionary spirit was very general throughout the commonwealth; and it
                     might be said that the western counties were in the possession of the rebels
                     against republicanism. It endured, however, but for a few months, and was
                     chiefly put down by the voluntary and spirited exertions of the peaceable
                     inhabitants. While it lasted, there was, of course, a considerable degree of
                     license, and occasional pilfering, for it could hardly be called plunder: but
                     there was little destruction of property, and no cruelty. Sometimes a few
                     individuals of the court party, and sometimes a few <hi rend="i"/>Shaysites
                     were made prisoners; and in such cases they were shut up in rooms during the
                     stay of the conquering party, and occasionally marched off with them on their
                     retreat.</p>
                  <p>It is probable that about fifteen or twenty <choice>

                     sentence of a civil magistrate.</p>
                  <p>The most severe engagement which occurred during the contest, took place in
                     Sheffield, on the 27th of February, 1787. The government party was composed of
                     militia from Sheffield and Barrington; in number about eighty men, and
                     commanded by Colonel John Ashley, of Sheffield. This party, hearing that the
                     rebels had appeared in force, in Stockbridge, where they had committed some
                     depredations, and taken several prisoners, pursued them for some time without
                     success, and did not fall in with them until their return to Sheffield, to
                     which place the rebels had marched by a different route. The insurgents were
                     more numerous, but possessed less confidence than the government party. This
                     circumstance was every where observable during the contest. Upon this occasion,
                     as the most effectual protection, they placed their prisoners in front of their
                     line, and between themselves and their assailants. They probably expected a
                     parley, and that the parties would separate without bloodshed. This had
                     sometimes happened before, from the great reluctance which all felt to proceed
                     to extremities against their neighbours and acquaintances. But Colonel Ashley
                     was a man of determined spirit, and fully<pb n="242-243"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000121"/> convinced that energetic measures had <choice>

                     </choice> necessary, he ordered his men to fire. They knew their friends, and
                     remonstrated. The Colonel exclaimed, "God have <emph>marcy</emph> on their
                     souls, but pour in your fire!" They did so, and after an engagement of about
                     six minutes, the rebels fled. Their loss was two men killed, and about thirty,
                     including their captain, wounded. The loss of the government party was two men
                     killed, and one wounded. Of the former number, one was a prisoner who had been
                     forced into the front of the rebel line.</p>
                  <p>If the remembrance of this commotion had not been preserved by the classical
                     pen of Minot, its tradition would, probably, expire in one or two
                     generations.</p>
                  <p>This is the only civil war which has ever been waged in our country, unless the

                  <p>AN old friend once described to me the following scene, of which, in his early
                     boyhood, he was an eye-witness, and desired me to record it. He is, even now,
                     but slightly bent under the weight of more than eighty years. He has a strong
                     voice, a hearty laugh, a sound memory, and other healthful physical attributes,
                     that as accompanying four-score, will be as incredible to the descendants of
                     the present dyspeptic generation, as is the longevity of the antediluvians to
                     our skeptical cotemporaries.</p>
                  <p>My friend belonged to one of the aristocratic families of Massachusetts. People
                     then dared to boast that distinction. And even now he may claim a charter of
                     nobility that none will dispute, for he bears a name illustrated by a
                     progenitor who, when he wrote, had no rival, and even now has no superior, upon
                     that topic on which he exercised his marvellous intellect.</p>
                  <p>It was on a Sabbath day, (I dare not, in this relation, use other than a
                     Puritan term,) late in April, in 1776, that an unprecedented bustle occurred in
                     one of the quietest villages of Berkshire. The stern, long Winter of our
                        hill-country<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7726-00000123"/> had just passed
                     away. The tempests of a sterner Winter were beginning in our political world—a
                     Winter whose storm was to drive out all old customs, observances, relations,
                     and to be followed by a Spring of vigorous life, suited to our young
                     country.</p>
                  <p>The genial sunbeams of the long afternoon played on the few framed houses of
                     the village, and on the Indian huts scattered among them, which seemed to be
                     rooted there, as were the affections of their doomed masters. And did ever
                     savage or civilized man dwell in that sweet valley, who did not cling to it as
                     if it were in truth their <emph>mother</emph> earth!</p>
                  <p>Times are changed there now. Hideous telegraph poles deform its embowered
                     street, and the "whistle" of the rail-car shrieks from its lowlands. But then,
                     as now, even late in April, Winter lingered on the wet, cold, dull-coloured
                     hillside; the forest trees were yet brown and naked; but, oh! how fresh and
                     bright was the grass in the meadows—how deep-coloured the furrows just turned
                     up for the corn-planting—how rich the green of the Winter wheat-fields—how
                     sparkling the musical stream that, in the early Spring-time, seemed to sing of
                     nothing but its freedom! And then, as my friend said, "the willows, where we
                     cut our sticks, along the Housatonic, looked as if they had been dipped in
                     melted gold; the maples were flushed with their red buds; the air at our
                     windows was so inviting with the young buds of the lilacs! The girls were
                     longing to go out to pick cresses and violets by the brook side; the hens were
                     cackling—the birds singing—the Deacons could not stop them; but we children had
                     to stay, silent and sad, in-doors, and study our catechisms, and watch—which we
                     did more than study—the shadows, as they crept (how slowly!) over the valley,
                     and up, and up, the Eastern hills; and not till the last purple ray had faded
                     from the very crest of the mountains, were we permitted to sally forth. With
                     the setting of the sun ended 'holy time.' The Sabbath sun was in our eyes a
                     mortal enemy—so tedious was the long 'holy time' to us. God forgive our parents
                     that it was so!"</p>
                  <p>On the memorable afternoon we are commemorating, my octogenarian friend, then a
                     boy of seven or eight years, was sitting with the other children of the
                     household, near a window, which afforded a tempting view of the different
                     avenues that converged to the village-green, which village-green was a
                     dangerous competitor with the lucid "Westminster Shorter Catechism," for their
                     bright eyes—the truant eyes had wandered.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Phœbe, how pleasant the green looks!" said the boy. "I wish the moon would
                     shine as bright as the sun does; then we could see to play ball after sunset.
                     Don't you wish so, Phœbe?"</p>
                  <p>Phœbe was a pattern Puritan child, faithful and sedate. Without raising her
                     eyes, she went on, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">sotto voce,</foreign> committing to
                     memory her appointed task, which, at that moment, happened to be the tremendous
                     answer to the question, in the Shorter Westminster Catechism—the child's
                     spiritual bread and meat of that day—"What is the misery of that estate
                     whereunto man fell?"</p>
                  <p>"Phœbe," resumed her brother, "do you believe Deacons were ever boys and girls,
                     like we are?"</p>
                  <p>"All mankind, by their fall, lost communion with God, are under His wrath and
                     curse, and so made liable to all the miseries of this life, to death itself,
                     and to the pains of hell for ever," murmured Phœbe.</p>
                  <p>"Phœbe, Phœbe!" called out her brother again. "I declare, there is Squire
                     Woodhull coming out of his house, and Deacon Orne out of his! Look."</p>
                  <pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7726-00000124"/>
                  <p>But Phœbe was immovable.</p>
                  <p>"All mankind, by their fall," she continued.</p>
                  <p>"Why see, Phœbe! there is Captain Bradley, and Mr. Taylor, too? What can it
                     mean, Phœbe?"</p>
                  <p>Phœbe was as firm as Atlas.</p>
                  <p>"And so made liable to all the miseries of this life, to death itself, and to
                     the pains of hell for ever," &amp;c., she reiterated.</p>
                  <p>It was worthy of observation that these familiar words of eternal doom made no
                     more impression on the serene child than if she were
                     repeating—"Dickery-dickery-dock," or any other of Mother Goose's lyrics.</p>
                  <p>"Phœbe," resumed her brother, "I never saw any one like you; why don't you
                     look? There comes Levi Carter, and Joshua Lee. They have both got guns. What
                     will Deacon Orne say?"</p>
                  <p>By this time Phœbe's attention was completely aroused. She closed her little
                     blue book, and the children all clustered together to observe the scene, which
                     was soon interpreted to them by their excellent mother, who came from her
                     nursery, with her infant child, Rhoda, in her arms, beautiful then, as
                     tradition has it, beautiful still, as all can testify who are acquainted with
                     that majestic form, fresh cheek, beaming eye, and most serene aspect.</p>
                  <p>The gathering on the Sabbath, so astounding to the children, was occasioned by
                     the arrival of an express, bringing news of the battle of Lexington. An
                     association called MINUTE MEN, from the fact that they held themselves ready to
                     go forth in their country's service at a minute's warning, had been formed
                     throughout the towns of Massachusetts. Each man in the village had been
                     notified to meet instantly on the green. The inhabitants were few, but every
                     man capable pable of bearing arms, "Minute Men," and others not thus enrolled,
                     came, old and young, each with a comprehension of the sacred principles for
                     which he was to contend, and for which he was willing to leave his home and
                     peril his life. These principles had been maturing in Anglo-Saxon minds from
                     the days of King John and the Charter, and they were now ripened into the
                     glorious truths proclaimed in our Declaration of Independence.</p>
                  <p>Our men were ready and eager for their work, but not one among them probably
                     had the faintest imagination that the destinies of the world hung upon the
                     issue of the contest on which they were entering.</p>
                  <p>There were volunteers not enrolled with the Minute men, and the purpose of the
                     gathering was to decide who should be permitted to go, and who should perform
                     the inglorious duty of remaining at home, to take care of the women and
                     children, and keep the Indians in order. "I have not fired a gun these ten
                     years," said Deacon Orne, "but I guess I can do it as well as my
                     neighbours."</p>
                  <p>One lad nudged another, whispering, "Did not I tell you the Deacon had grit for
                     all?"</p>
                  <p>"If Mrs. Bradley is willing," said her husband, the Captain, "there's no man
                     readier nor happier to go than I am," he could afford to defer to his
                     help-meet, for the little world of S—— knew their wills were one.</p>
                  <p>"I ask no woman's leave to do my duty," said little gnarly squally Obid Allen,
                     the well known tyrant of his household. "I go."</p>
                  <p>"That is doubtful yet," said William Freeman, to whom the command of the minute
                     men of S—— was assigned; "every one cannot have the privilege, Obid, and we
                     must take such only as can be serviceable." William Freeman<pb n="250-251"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000125"/> was a stout, tall, well-made yeoman, standing
                     six feet two inches without his shoes, some forty-two or three years old, in
                     the prime of manhood, <emph>a living man</emph> in the comprehensive sense of
                     that term, beloved and respected in the little community of S—— as no other man
                     was. Most of the men were zealous patriots eager for the service. The selection
                     made by Freeman, met with unanimous acquiescence. Few wished to dispute it, and
                     none dared. To the astonishment of all, however, Obid Allen was among the
                     picked men. This he explained confidentially to a friend, saying, "Obid will be
                     a wasp among us, I know, and I fear a coward—your tyrants at home, for the most
                     part, are. But to tell you the truth, it was an opportunity to relieve his
                     women folks, and I could not neglect it!"</p>
                  <p>The dispositions for the march were promptly made. There was no time to be
                     lost. They were to depart that evening. Some among them never to return, some
                     to homes, how changed! some, themselves mournfully changed! One solemn office
                     remained before their dispersion. The children of the Puritans were not men to
                     embark in a serious enterprise without appealing to the great Disposer of
                     events; and now the children's wonder was again excited by seeing the Pastor
                     descending the long straight road from the hill overhanging the village where
                     his house, like a watch-tower on Zion, stood. He was attended by a young friend
                     who was then residing with him. He was himself then still young, though he had
                     already been ten years on a ministry which he was destined to continue in that
                     favoured place, in zeal and purity, for more than sixty years! "Why, mother,"
                     exclaimed little Phœbe, "Mr. West is not going to fight, is he? a minister, and
                     such a little man too!"</p>
                  <p>"Little," exclaimed her brother, "I guess he is as tall as Alexander, for
                     Master Day says Alexander was not taller than he is."</p>
                  <p>"I don't know, my child; but don't, my son, let your mind run upon heathen
                     people. Attend to what is going on."</p>
                  <p>"I guess Mr. Oakley will go, don't you Phœbe?" whispered the rebuked child to
                     his sister—"he is so tall, and beautiful, and has such black eyes! he is
                     something like a soldier!"</p>
                  <p>Whether Mr. Oakley would have gone or not, had the opportunity been offered
                     him, we cannot say, for the quota was already made up. Perhaps he was glad to
                     avoid the necessity of a choice, for though the colony was the land of his
                     birth and to be his future residence, more than half his life had been passed
                     in England, and it was natural that his affections should be divided. That they
                     leaned to the wrong side, the villagers all thought, and as he approached,
                     there were whispers among them. "He is a friend of Mr. West, or we would give
                     him a piece of our mind!" "This is no time for Tories." "No, nor for fine
                     gentlemen with gloves and ruffles, we must handle things without mittens
                     now-a-days." "Hush, boys!" said William Freeman, who stood a little apart with
                     this knot of free speakers, "don't be saucy to Mr. Oakley, he is my friend as
                     well as the minister's—he is something more than a fine gentleman—a scholarly
                     man, and none the worse for not wanting to fight his cousins and friends whose
                     bread and salt he has eaten on the other side.—You have come in good time,
                     sir," he added, advancing and giving his hand to the Pastor—"every thing is
                     settled, the men are ready to march, and we wait only for you to ask the Lord's
                     blessing on our endeavours."</p>
                  <p>The twilight was near, the deepening shadows stealing over the valley typified
                     the dark passage through which the<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7726-00000126"/>
                     people were to pass, the sun beams on the eastern hills the light beyond it.
                     The men leaning on their guns and staves arranged themselves in a circle around
                     the minister—a group of Indian men and women had gathered, and stood on one
                     side listening reverently. The minister prayed and wept. To the last of his
                     long good life he was marked by a sensibility that gushed forth in sympathy for
                     all his people; the just and unjust—saints and sinners, all shared a heart wide
                     enough for all.</p>
                  <p>The boy of whom we have spoken, was permitted by his mother to go out and
                     listen to the service. No wonder the scene never passed from his memory.</p>
                  <p>That war was thus fitly begun in the self-devotion and 'self-sacrifice of
                     thoughtful fathers, faithful husbands, brothers and sons, and sanctified by the
                     prayers of holy men which was for self-government, an equality of rights and
                     privileges—the freedom and happiness of all. The battle was fought on their
                     mother earth, about their own homesteads. On the other side the soldiers were a
                     good part mercenaries, and aliens from the household for which they fought,
                     and, for the most part, ignorant and brutish men.</p>

                     <p>"I have no time to give any directions, Sylvy," said William Freeman to his
                        sister, a tall, gaunt, elderly woman. "You know full as well as I how to
                        take care of every thing—the horses, cattle, pigs and hens. You'll give them
                        all plenty to eat, for that's your nature, and that's the main chance. Ben
                        will be a plague—boys always are—but he being motherless, you won't feel it
                        so much. Don't humour him too much, Sylvy. Don't go out, as you did last
                        winter in the snow, and feed the horses that he went to bed and forgot. Take
                        care! don't tie up the portmanteau yet, I want to put this in."</p>
                     <p>"What is it, brother?" asked Sylvy, who kept her head averted that her
                        brother might not see the tears that were pouring down her cheeks.</p>
                     <p>"Well, its Lucy's profile that Staunton Oakley cut for me last week—it is
                        only an outline, but I can fill it up with blue eye and round cheeks, and a
                        sweet little fair child's face. You think I am foolish?—I, more than
                        forty!"</p>
                     <p>"No, no, brother, don't I set by her almost as much as you do—poor little
                        dove."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, Sylvy, and that is a comfort to me now; if it tore my heart in two to
                        leave Lucy and Willie, I should go, but now I go cheerfully; for I know you
                        will always consider for them. I confide them to you, and go in peace. Lucy
                        is a helpless little thing, but it is my fault. She was so young when we
                        married that she has always seemed to me like a child."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, never mind, brother, it is easy to care for her—truly the pleasure and
                        comfort of my life."</p>
                     <p>"I have no words to thank you, Sylvy; but words are nothing between you and
                        I, I have bid her good-bye. It has taken the strength out of me; It makes me
                        feel like a poor soldier," and he wiped away his tears, as he added, "This
                        little woman makes such a child of me. I left her with Willie on her lap,
                        both sobbing; I hear them now. By the way, Sylvy, I have forgotten to tell
                        you that I have engaged Staunton Oakley to teach Will."</p>
                     <p>"To teach Willie, brother? Willie is but six. I have<pb n="254-255"
                           xml:id="VAC7726-00000127"/> heard that Mr. Staunton Oakley is a finished
                        scholar. Surely he is not a suitable teacher for Willie."</p>
                     <p>"Maybe not. But Oakley is halting about his profession. He is fallen under

                     <p>A wagon drove to the door. William Freeman threw in his portmanteau, turned
                        and looked around for the last time. Every object was daguerreotyped on his
                        heart. He kissed his sister's coarse cheek as fervently as if she were the
                        loveliest woman in creation, and knocking with his iron knuckles on his
                        wife's bed-room door, he said, in a cheering tone—"God bless you dear,
                        dearest little wifie," dashed off his tears and departed.</p>

                     <head>A RETROSPECT.</head>
                     <p>William Freeman's body, mind and heart, were in that state which, in our
                        present hacknied phrase, would be called normal. Capricious nature—no, this
                        is but vulgar slang—nature is but another name for the great Creator of
                        perfect works; not nature, then, but the transmitted wrongs done to her so
                        often, effect such incongruous combination as a heart of infinite
                        expansiveness in a half-developed body, a gigantic intellect, like Pope's,
                        Napoleon's, or Alexander Hamilton's, in a stinted, almost dwarfish frame,
                        that when the world has assurance of a man in the highest intellectual and
                        moral attributes, with their fitting majestic investment, he receives, as
                        William Freeman did, the tribute of trust, and love, and reverence. Freeman
                        was of a good old English stock, but the branch in this country had, by
                        adverse accidents, been reduced to an humble condition of life, and William
                        and his sister Sylvy, four or five years older than himself, were left, at
                        an early age, with no inheritance but a sterile farm, on the cold sea-shore
                        of Massachusetts; this they exchanged for one in better position and
                        condition in a lovely valley in the most western county of the same State.
                        This, by the joint management of brother and sister, improved rapidly in
                        value and productiveness. As it was the good custom of those times for a man
                        to take a help-mate so soon as he had a roof to shelter her, it was a
                        subject of discussion among the male and female gossips of S——, why William
                        Freeman remained a bachelor? Some fancied it was from regard to Miss Sylvy,
                        who was a 'set-body,' and had too long governed their joint household to
                        bear a deposition from her feminine supremacy. But they misjudged. Miss
                        Sylvy was as far above the little competitions and meannesses of domestic
                        rivalries as any man. In truth, she was remarkably exempt from any feminine
                        peculiarities. Of the two, her brother had more of the tenderness and
                        softness, and far more of the gentleness and polish that characterizes the
                        minor sex. Sylvy was true as steel, faithful, kind-hearted, and entirely in
                        thought, word and deed, devoted to her brother; but a more masculine
                        creature has seldom appeared in woman's form. So she was made, and she was
                        content with nature's decrees, never opposing them by any compromises, or
                        palliations of dress or habit. If Sylvy had lived in our day she would have
                        deemed a women's rights<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7726-00000128"/>
                        convention a superfluous mooting of a foolish question. Her might was her
                        right. She was a woman of action, doing cheerfully and well the duty nearest
                        to her, and not disturbing herself by a theoretical claim to those for which
                        she was neither qualified by nature nor education. Her life had one ruling
                        purpose, the advancement of her brother's interest and happiness—one
                        absorbing affection, not expressed in words, but told in the deeds of every
                        day.</p>
                     <p>As William Freeman's protracted bachelorship was a mystery not to be solved
                        by people so ingenious, earnest and indefatigable as his neighbours of S——,
                        we should not attempt it. He might have had an early disappointment "down
                        East," but nothing could be more unlikely. Any woman beloved by this
                        magnificent-looking man, frank, affectionate, good-humoured and agreeable,
                        could not choose but to love him. He deferred, on all suitable occasions, to
                        his sister's wishes, but he had no fear of her to prevent his doing what was
                        right; and, besides, she had been heard to say more than once that, "as to
                        marrying, that was not in her way, but she wondered brother put it off—it
                        was a pity for the girls!" She now and then hinted to him that life was
                        going on, and its great work not done! Still he remained in obstinate,
                        inexplicable content—a man sound in mind, body and estate, and yet a
                        bachelor!</p>
                     <p>Freeman's nearest neighbours were the Scotts. They were a head-over-heels
                        family, with some eight or ten children, that scrabbled their way up into
                        life as they could. Besides these, there was a little orphan niece, Lucy
                        Clay, a fair, delicate, gentle creature, who looked, among the nut-brown
                        Scotts, as a Saxon child might in a Gipsy camp, or a pearl on common earth.
                        She naturally attracted William Freeman's observation. He loved children,
                        and Lucy soon became came a favourite. He gave her rides; he took her to his
                        hay field; she was permitted to tumble his hay-cocks, and always rode home
                        on the load—the prettiest flower that ever grew, he said, in meadow, or
                        garden. Miss Sylvy was in nowise addicted to pets; dogs she kept strictly to
                        their official duty, and cats she tolerated only as necessary evils; but
                        brother's plaything, as she called little Lucy, soon became her
                           <emph>weakness</emph>—the first she had ever shown. Nothing was forbidden
                        her—nothing was good enough for her—she, who never before, was jealous of
                        any thing, was jealous of Lucy's rights in the rough democracy of the
                        Scott's household. She held to children being hardy, but she was alarmed if
                        Lucy dampened her little feet, and finally, upon the little girl letting
                        fall a silent tear on being rather rudely summoned home by one of "Scott's
                        boys," Sylvy could bear it no longer, and she distinctly proposed to her
                        brother that Lucy should have a home with them. "The Scotts," she said,
                        "were overrun with children—she did not see as brother would ever have a
                        family of his own—Mrs. Scott did not take suitable care of her own
                        children—little Lucy, poor little dove. needed the best of care."</p>
                     <p>There was no need of multiplying arguments to William Freeman. They fell
                        upon a willing mind, and little Lucy was forthwith begged as a boon, and
                        dropped off, by the Scotts, as a burden. We said that Miss Sylvy was not,
                        like most women-kind, addicted to pets, but now it seemed that all the
                        womanly weakeness, if it must be so called, that, with others of her sex is
                        diffused over a lifetime, had accumulated, to be lavished on her "little
                        dove"—the first soft epithet she was known to use. Flower-beds were sown for
                        Lucy—chickens were reared for her—kittens were permitted, and dovecotes were
                        built over the porch.</p>
                     <pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7726-00000129"/>
                     <p>William Freeman, in his domain, was not less indulgent. William, in rustic
                        phrase, was a great reader, but now he could not fully enjoy his book unless
                        Lucy were sitting by him, stroking her kittens, stringing flowers, or
                        knitting a garter, the hardest task Miss Sylvy ever laid on her. If he drove
                        out she was beside him, permitted to hold the whip, or take the reins; if he
                        sat on the porch smoking, (young men of that day smoked their pipes as they
                        now do their cigars,) she sat beside him. She was a luxury in the house, and
                        like other luxuries, came to be more essential than "necessaries." She lived
                        in a placid, perennial contentment, the inward motions of her heart
                        harmonizing with the symmetry of her lovely face and form. When she was
                        seventeen William Freeman was thirty-five; about this time he became
                        abstracted and fitful; he lost his colour and his appetite. "It was
                        unaccountable," Miss Sylvy said, "how brother was 'running down.'"</p>
                     <p>Suddenly there was a change; he was brighter, happier, handsomer than ever,
                        and Miss Sylvy who never dreamed of any weaving of sentimental fabrics among
                        her domestic looms, was astounded by the communication that Lucy was to be
                        her brother's wife. She laughed for half an hour.—"Why, what is the matter,
                        Sylvy?" said her brother—"you don't refuse your consent?"</p>
                     <p>"Brother! No, indeed; but it seems so odd—<emph>little</emph> Lucy!"</p>
                     <p>"Yes; like the bee, she is little; but her fruit is the chief of sweet
                        things, Sylvy."</p>
                     <p>"And, you may say more than that, brother; unlike the bee, she has no sting.
                        Well, it's just right; and, if I were not the dumb thing I am, I should have
                        thought of it before. Lucy would have married—gone away—how in the world
                        could we have lived without her?"</p>
                     <p>The bans were proclaimed, to the infinite surprise of the good people of
                        S——, who made more than a nine days' wonder of it; all opining that William
                        Freeman might have made a much more advantageous match, and saying that, "if
                        they were he, they should not have chosen such a 'helpless little piece' as
                        Lucy Clay." But, they were not he; and nothing was more natural than for his
                        generous nature to match his strength with her weakness, to extend his
                        protection to her helplessness.</p>
                     <p>Never did a match of such apparent disparity prove happier than his, for the
                        seven years that followed, and up to the time of the departure we have
                        recorded.</p>
                     <p>Here we hesitate to go farther. We would fain linger in this paradise of a
                        happy home. But, change comes to all, and happy should they esteem
                        themselves to whom it comes in the common providential forms of sickness,
                        death, and pecuniary trial.</p>
                     <p>The years went on—every month, every day, and every hour, marked by William
                        Freeman's services to his country. He was rapidly advanced to a colonelcy.
                        We have nothing to do with his public career; but insomuch as it was
                        interwoven with his domestic history. Others may have equalled him in
                        courage and conduct—none surpassed him; and few equalled him in his minute
                        attention to the wants of his men, in his fatherly care of them, and in his
                        general humanity.</p>
                     <p>How matters were getting on at home may be indicated by the following

                                    tucks me in; and she warms mother's bed with the great
                                    warming-pan; and she warms Mr. Oakley's, but she does not warm
                                    mine, because she says she means to make a man of me, I think I
                                    am too much of a man already to sleep in a trundle-bed, but then
                                    I sleep there to be near my little mother, if she wants any
                                    thing. That is right, is it not, sir?</p>
                                 <p>"Is not Obed Allen hateful, father? He came here yesterday. Aunt
                                    Sylvy was weaving. There was a fire in the dwelling-room; but
                                    Aunt Sylvy didn't ask him to go in there. We don't often have a
                                    fire there; for Aunt Sylvy thinks so much of the wants of the
                                    poor soldiers, that she saves every way, to have the more to
                                    send them. So Mr. Allen sat down in the kitchen, and asked Aunt
                                    Sylvy all sorts of questions. Sometimes she answered 'Yes,' and
                                    sometimes 'No,' and sometimes she made no answer at all, but
                                    kept driving her shuttle.</p>
                                 <p>"'Mrs. Freeman was not much hurt last evening, was she?' he
                                    said.</p>
                                 <p>"'No,' says Aunt Sylvy.</p>
                                 <p>"'I heard her head was bleeding when he brought her home—was
                                    it?'</p>
                                 <p>"'No.'</p>
                                 <p>"Don't you think, father, he might have said Mr. Oakley, instead
                                    of he?</p>
                                 <p>"He went on:</p>
                                 <p>"'It's dangerous sport, sledding down hill, and some folks might
                                    call it unbecoming and unsuitable for a married woman in
                                       <emph>her</emph> situation.'</p>
                                 <p>"Aunt Sylvy looked black as thunder, but she didn't speak. I
                                    wanted to shoot him. Was it wrong, sir? Now, sir, I will tell
                                    you just how it was. Last night was a beautiful<pb n="262-263"
                                       xml:id="VAC7726-00000131"/> tiful moonlight; and there had
                                    been a little thaw and sudden freezing, and the trees were
                                    coated with ice, and all hanging with icicles, and every bush
                                    and weed and spear of grass sparkled as if it was hung with
                                    jewels; and I begged mother to go out with me and let me coast
                                    her down the little hill, the smooth path, all glaze ice now,
                                    between the laurel-bushes that are as green as they were when
                                    the flowers were on them last summer. So, after I had urged her,
                                    dear little mother wrapped up, and she and Mr. Oakley came on to
                                    the hill. He asked her first to go down with him, but she chose
                                    me. When we were half way down, she got so frightened that she
                                    jumped off and struck her head, and stunned herself; and Mr.
                                    Oakley took her in his arms and brought her home—you know he
                                    could easy do it, little mother is so light. She soon got over
                                    it, and to-day is as well as ever.</p>
                                 <p>"I can't think how Obed Allen knew any thing about it, for all
                                    the boys were sledding down the long hill. But Aunt Sylvy says
                                    some people are all eyes and ears to no good.</p>
                                 <p>"Then old Allen tried who he could peck at next. He said Mrs.
                                    Orne was spoiling her children in the Deacon's absence; he said
                                    he went into Mrs. Orne's to carry some letters he brought from
                                    the Deacon, and there was one for little Josh, and the boy
                                    capered and shouted as if his father had sent him a gold piece.
                                    It being bedtime, his sister Nancy took him to put him to bed,
                                    and pretty soon she came back, laughing, and said Josh was so
                                    bewildered with joy, that, after he had said his prayers, he
                                    said, 'Oh, Nancy, I don't know whether I said my prayers or Jack
                                    Sprat!'</p>
                                 <p>"'He ought to have been flogged for such profanity,' old Allen
                                    said, 'and Nancy for laughing at it.'</p>
                                 <p>"Now, dear father, if you have a chance do tell Deacon Orne, and
                                    see if he don't laugh too.</p>
                                 <p>"'If the boy, in the bewilderment of his innocent joy, did say
                                    Jack Sprat, it was more acceptable, I guess,' says Aunt Sylvy,
                                    'than some folks' prayers!'</p>
                                 <p>"I know she meant Obed Allen's, but he did not take the hint.
                                    Pretty soon he nodded his head towards the dwelling-room door,
                                    and said:</p>
                                 <p>"'I should think <emph>she</emph> would want to come out, and
                                    inquire about the Colonel, instead of sitting to hear him read
                                    verses.'</p>
                                 <p>"'If you mean my mother, Mr. Allen,' I said, 'she has had good
                                    long letters from my father, and I guess she don't want to hear
                                    any thing you can say.'</p>
                                 <p>"He looked cross enough, and then said:</p>
                                 <p>"'Some folks don't feel as other folks feel, but I should not
                                    want that fine fellow sleeping in my best bed, and reading to my
                                    wife, while I was out in camp.'</p>
                                 <p>"I don't know what made Aunt Sylvy so angry at this, but she
                                    threw down her shuttle, opened the outside door wide, and
                                    said—</p>
                                 <p>"'Walk <emph>out,</emph> Obed Allen, and never walk
                                       <emph>in</emph> again!'</p>
                                 <p>"And as he went out, she said—</p>
                                 <p>"'Honour and shame is in talk, and the tongue of a man is his
                                    fall!'</p>
                                 <p>"It was good enough for him, any way, was not it, sir?</p>
                                 <p>"Well, sir, I believe I have told you about every thing, only
                                    that poor old Daisy is on her last legs, Aunt Sylvy says, and
                                    she has halter-broken the colt herself; and Mr. Oakley don't
                                    study any more at Mr. West's, but he is studying law. He is a
                                    very kind man—very good to me, and to dear little mother, and to
                                    Aunt Sylvy; but there is one thing I don't like—he lies in bed
                                    in the morning till we have all done<pb n="264-265"

                                    to get over again. That is not like you, dear father.</p>
                                 <p>"Now I have nothing more at present, sir; only Widow Darley is
                                    dead; and Tom, our oldest cat, has disappeared.</p>

                                    still call me so) thanks you from the bottom of her heart for
                                    your long letters. How kind of you, after your long days'
                                    marches, and your hard, hard work, to sit up at night to write
                                    to us, and especially to me, who am but a poor and short
                                    letter-writer myself. Oh, my dear heart, when will this tedious
                                    war be over, and you be at home again? Not that every thing does
                                    not go on very well. Dear sister Sylvy sees to every thing,
                                       <emph>does</emph> every thing. I am a poor thriftless wife to
                                    you, and I am afraid I shall not even be a mere ornamental piece
                                    of furniture—a 'jim crack' of William Freeman's (as you remember
                                    who, called me), if you do not soon come home. I am getting
                                    thinner and thinner, and you will have to put on your spectacles
                                    (I cannot believe you wear spectacles!) to see me.</p>
                                 <p>"Our dear boy is going on wonderfully under Mr. Oakley's
                                    tuition. He is very faithful to him. Mr. Oakley goes out very
                                    little. He is disliked as a Tory, and looked upon with
                                    suspicion, and always hears something disagreeable.</p>
                                 <p>"Our people are always talking of the war, or their crops or
                                    their cattle; so he finds it pleasanter with Willie and me. I
                                    believe he has made up his mind to the law, but he does not much
                                    incline to any profession, and I should not wonder if he spent
                                    his life in reading and writing, and in a sort of dreamy
                                    way.</p>
                                 <p>"I shall send by Allen, the cots you requested me to make for
                                    Captain Stiles. There are two dozen. I hope they will make his

                                 <head>Miss Sylvy Freeman to Colonel Freeman.</head>
                                 <p>"DEAR AND RESPECTED BROTHER:—Your letter was duly received two
                                    weeks after date. I thank you for its approving words; also for
                                    your profitable advice, concerning the farm, stock, and so
                                    forth, which shall—the Lord willing—be attended to.</p>
                                 <p>"But truly, brother, you are the faithful one to family as well
                                    as country. If your head-work and hand-work is in camp, your
                                    heart is in your own home; and mine seems as if it would burst
                                    when I read your loving words to Lucy and<pb n="266-267"
                                       xml:id="VAC7726-00000133"/> Willie, and to me. But I ain't
                                    one that talks about feeling, so I proceed to outside things. I
                                    have found the great conveniency of turning round the shed to
                                    front south. It has, I believe, saved the lives of the young
                                    stock this winter. Its been a cracking winter, but the rougher
                                    it is the tougher I grow; and truly, brother, the older I grow
                                    the lighter every thing seems, as it were, that I can do for you
                                    and yours. The Lord hath greatly blessed me in this, that when I
                                    do good, I know to whom I do it.</p>
                                 <p>"The wool has turned out remarkable—partly owing to there being
                                    no waste, having sheared myself. The finest I selected for your
                                    new suit, and I would not give it for the best broadcloth woven
                                    in old England. Lucy has a gown from the same fleece, and which
                                    I dyed before pulling, a deep crimson, with a dye of old
                                    Kaleny's, and she looks like a bird in it. I could not help
                                    saving off a Sunday suit for Willie, the dutifullest boy that
                                    ever lived—the boldest—the best. The rest of the wool I have
                                    done with as you desired; and the rolls of flannel-cloth are to
                                    be forwarded by the committee to your poor soldiers that you say
                                    shiver with cold, and never with fear. The Lord help them
                                    through.</p>
                                 <p>"As soon as the spring opens, the Committee will see to sending
                                    off the surplus potatoes, beans, &amp;c., of which we have a
                                    plentiful lot, to some part where they will be of use to the
                                    army. I shall send also to you, a box of good cotton-wick dips.
                                    I made the same for Mr. Oakley's use—he often reading late at
                                    night to Lucy, and thereby trying his eyes. He is a kind
                                    man—faithful to Willie. I greatly fear he will never do much for
                                    himself. Some weeks he will be a lawyer, and then, when peace
                                    comes, he will go back to England and enter the church; and
                                    then, he will give himself up to a wandering life, and go to
                                    Egypt and the far East. And so he talks—as changeable as a
                                    weather-cock. It was a pity they spoilt him in England. If he
                                    had been brought up to work, he might have been made a man of.
                                    But, I don't know; I am afeard his laziness is in the bone—you
                                    can't make strong cloth out of rotten flax. But, any how, it's a
                                    fine opportunity to have such a scholarly man to teach our
                                    Willie, and to be company to our little Lucy, and read poetry to
                                    her, and such kind of cakes and gingerbread, and keep her
                                    content, as it were, and cheerful, while you are away. But a man
                                    should be a man, and gird on his sword for one side or the
                                    other; or, in these times, handle the axe, and reap the field;
                                    and 'hate not laborious work—which the Most High hath ordained.'
                                    But he is a beautiful young man, for all—pleasant spoken—and we
                                    are as happy a family as we can be when the noble chief and head
                                    is gone.</p>
                                 <p>"So, dear brother, I remain faithfully yours, till death,</p>

                     <p>The above letters, slightly abridged, from those preserved in the family
                        archives, indicate sufficiently the condition of things in William Freeman's
                        family in the third year of his absence. They satisfied his heart—amid all
                        the trials, struggles and privations of his military life, his affections
                        settled in peace over his home. It seemed to him a little kingdom of his
                        own, where the sun always shone, and into whose rest he should enter as soon
                        as his work for his country was over.</p>
                     <p>His magnanimity, his boldness, and perhaps more than these qualities that
                        belong to physical health and strength; his eminent good sense, his charming
                        good humour, and his indefatigable humanity, won the love of his companions
                        in arms, and drew confidence and favours from the highest quarters. His
                        career was a most active and successful one.</p>
                     <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7726-00000134"/>
                     <p>The only time he was ever known to lose his self-command, and with it, as he
                        afterwards confessed, a portion of his self-respect, was on occasion of a
                        visit from Allen, after his return from S——. Allen had attained the place of
                        sutler in the Army—an office admirably adapted to his taste and genius.
                        Freeman had often detected, and corrected Allen's petty impositions and
                        overreachings, but had never lost his temper, and the scurvy sutler had no
                        fear of exciting his anger.</p>
                     <p>"Why, Colonel, you don't ask after your folks," said Allen.</p>
                     <p>"No, I have letters from them."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, but letters don't tell every thing."</p>
                     <p>"They tell me all I wish to hear—and just what I wish."</p>
                     <p>"It's pretty judicious to be satisfied with them, may be."</p>
                     <p>There was something in Allen's manner that conveyed more than met the
                        ear.</p>
                     <p>"Have you bad news?—speak—don't hesitate—speak—. I command you."</p>
                     <p>"Why, Colonel! we ain't on duty."</p>
                     <p>"Tell me what you know—what have you heard? Is my wife sick? my boy? my
                        sister?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, no, no! nothing like that."</p>
                     <p>"Why scare me then, man! I suppose one of my horses is dead—or my
                        cattle—they may all die—if the blessed God keep hearty my little family.
                        Yes, though the flock be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd
                        in the stalls, yet will I rejoice in the Lord, and joy in the gifts He has
                        given me."</p>
                     <p>"Don't mount too high a horse, Colonel; pride goes before a fall. I suppose
                        there is something in a family that some men care for besides enjoying
                        health?"</p>
                     <p>"What in the name of goodness are you driving at, Allen? Were you at my
                        house?—did you see my family?"</p>
                     <p>"I saw Miss Sylvy, and your boy; he is a stout, healthy lad—but he wants
                        your correcting—he's for'ard, and free-spoken."</p>
                     <p>"Did you not see my wife?"</p>
                     <p>"N—o—no. Not exactly see her—I heard them talking and laughing in the
                        dwelling-room—she and that—and that genteel spark you keep there."</p>
                     <p>"Then they were all well, and at home, and cheerful?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, that's true—some folks think something too cheerful."</p>
                     <p>"And why?—speak plainer, Allen, or I'll shake your meaning out of you."</p>
                     <p>Allen saw the Colonel was not a man to receive inuendoes. "Well, then," he
                        said, "if I must speak, I must. Folks up there think it ain't every man that
                        would be willing to leave a woman, young enough to be his daughter, and the
                        handsomest woman in all the country round, to keep company month in and
                        month out—year in and year out, with a British-bred Tory spark—a picture of
                        a man!"</p>
                     <p>"Is that all?" said Colonel Freeman, not a shade darkening his hopeful,
                        trustful face.</p>
                     <p>"Well, no, not quite all; some folks talk, and some folks think more than
                        they talk."</p>
                     <p>"Hold your infamous tongue!" cried Colonel Freeman. The Colonel's quarters
                        were in a farm-house. His door opened upon a narrow strip of level ground
                        which descended some ten or twelve feet, precipitously to the road. He
                        opened the door, seized Allen by the collar, and thrust him out with such
                        force that he went down the bank, head over heels, to the road, to the
                        infinite delight of a dozen spectators who knew<pb n="270-271"
                           xml:id="VAC7726-00000135"/> him, detested him, and happened to be passing
                        at the moment.</p>
                     <p>Colonel Freeman was remarkable, even among his self-controlling countrymen,
                        for his equal temper. It was not with him, as with them, the equal pressure
                        on all sides, that kept him subdued and quiet, but it was a magnanimity of
                        nature—an atmosphere too pure and high for storms.</p>
                     <p>When one of the spectators who had witnessed his practical rebuke said, "If
                        you had broken the fellow's neck you would have served him right."</p>
                     <p>"No, no," replied the Colonel. "I am sorry I did it—sorry I put my hand upon
                        him—it wasn't right—the poor, weak, bandy-legged, miserable detestable
                        scoundrel that he is—he is not worth it."</p>
                     <p>Three months elapsed, when Colonel Freeman received a letter from his
                        sister, for the most part detailing the prosperity of the farm and
                        household, and closing thus:</p>
                     <p>"I am loth to disturb your mind, brother, but it's right you should know the
                        great change that has taken place in the family. Our dear little Lucy has
                        got all of a nerve. No wonder, you so long absent, and exposed to so many
                        dangers. She was fractious for a week, and did not speak to any of us—not
                        even to Willie—and suddenly Mr. Oakley determined to leave; his feelings
                        being grated, I suppose, she having refused for many days to see him. I did
                        not ask questions. He did see her before going. I heard her cry so that it
                        most broke my heart. He went—and he told Willie he had obtained a pass to
                        New-York, and expected to go from there, by the first opportunity, to
                        England. Poor Willie is downhearted—he is writing to you. But cheer up,
                        brother, 'It's a long lane that never turns,' and when you come home all
                        will go smooth again."</p>
                     <p>Willie's mother had charged him to say nothing to his father of her
                        dejection, and he did not, but lamented grievously the departure, and loss
                        of his tutor.</p>
                     <p>Colonel Freeman knew that his wife was of a delicate and susceptible
                        constitution. He willingly and lovingly believed that his sister was right
                        in her suggestion—that Lucy's nerves had been weakened by anxiety, and,
                        recalling Allen's suggestions, he thought it probable that the unkind
                        surmises of her neighbors had reached her ears, and that she had decided on
                        parting with Mr. Oakley, and not being able from motives of delicacy to tell
                        him why; and, not willing to distress her husband with her perplexities, she
                        had appeared wayward and dejected. He immediately wrote her a letter full of
                        tenderness, and told her that the moment he could arrange his affairs, he
                        should make her a visit.</p>
                     <p>But to do this was impossible. The military affairs of the country became
                        more and more perplexed, and the duties more and more imperative. Colonel
                        Freeman was not a man to defer his duty to his country to the indulgence of
                        his domestic claims and affections. From month to month, and week to week,
                        he planned to go home, and was disappointed. In the mean time no
                        extraordinary news came from his family. Miss Sylvy never lost an
                        opportunity of writing. She grew more and more minute in her accounts of her
                        farming economy, and said less and less of 'poor little Lucy,' as she now
                        invariably designated her. What she did say was the truth, but in the least
                        alarming form she could put it. "Poor little Lucy's spirits don't gain."
                        "The poor little woman keeps to her room and says little—her appetite don't
                        improve." "I hope, brother, you'll excuse poor little Lucy not writing. She
                        is low in strength, and dreadful low spirited." So on, and so on, from month
                        to month. But what was more painful to<pb n="272-273"
                           xml:id="VAC7726-00000136"/> Colonel Freeman was that his son, whose
                        letters had been pervaded with notices of his mother, now never mentioned
                        her—and that he persevered in his silence even after his father, again and
                        again, reproached him with it. Alas! for the poor boy.</p>
                     <p>At last, and unexpectedly at last, came to the happy Colonel, the power to
                        suspend his command for a short time, and having obtained leave of absence,
                        he joyfully set his face homeward.</p>
                     <p>He had, till now, as well as he could, turned aside thoughts of home. Now,
                        permitted, they overpowered and possessed his whole being. Happiness is the
                        health of the spirit, and in his sound nature the tendencies were so strong
                        to it, that anxieties and fears fled from him as demons from daylight. To
                        his happy anticipations his home was the home he had left. His appearance
                        would at once restore his wife—and all would be as it had been, with the
                        added joy of meeting. His return had been so sudden to himself, that he had
                        not announced or even intimated it to his family, but when within a few
                        miles of home, it occurred to him that his unexpected appearance might be
                        too much for his little nervous wife, and he sent forward a courier with a
                        note to his sister. The man was unacquainted with the country—he took a
                        wrong road, and the Colonel, driving rapidly and eagerly forward, arrived
                        before him. He turned up to his own gate. His horses were grazing in the
                        paddock next to his garden; he did not see them. Ben, grown from boyhood to
                        manhood, turned his oxen, who were drawing home a load of hay, to let the
                        Colonel pass, and grinned joyfully at his master, but the Colonel did not
                        speak to him, so full was his heart of the dear people within. He entered
                        through the kitchen. There was no one there, but every thing was just as he
                        had left it; and he paused for an instant, with a feeling that the long gap
                        of absence was closed, annihilated. It was but an instant, and his heart
                        swelling, and his strong hand trembling, he opened the 'dwelling-room' door.
                        There, too, was vacancy, and silence. For the first time an apprehension
                        entered the Colonel's mind, like the sudden coming of a cloud in the clear
                        sky, a fear, an indefinable dread. He paused—listened. He heard no sound.
                        His wife's bed-room was beyond, and opened out of the dwelling-room. His old
                        dog "Bose" was lying at the door. He opened his eyes, and evidently
                        recognized his master, for he vehemently wagged his tail, but without
                        moving, or making the slightest noise. "Not even my dog moves to meet me!"
                        flashed through the Colonel's mind. Who could comprehend, explain or limit
                        the feelings of that poor old animal who at that moment blended servant and
                        friend? The Colonel shoved him aside with his foot and opened wide the door.
                        It was the middle of a July afternoon, the room was darkened—one of the
                        window blinds being left just open enough to admit the necessary light.</p>
                     <p>The Colonel's wife was stretched on the bed, covered only with a sheet, and
                        white as the sheet. Her eyes were closed. Her beautiful curling hair lay in
                        tangled masses on the pillow, her arms were outstretched, and her hands
                        tight clasped over her head. This was the only indication that life was
                        still there. Their boy, Willie, sat close to the bedside of his mother, with
                        his back to the door. "Hush, doctor!" he rather breathed, than said, "mother
                        is sleeping;" and then turning round and seeing it was not the doctor, and
                        was his father, for he instantly recognized him, he sprang into his arms,
                        buried his face in his father's bosom, and tried, but alas! tried in vain,
                        to suppress his sobs. One other object<pb n="274-275"
                           xml:id="VAC7726-00000137"/> had caught William Freeman's eye, and he, who
                        had never flinched at the cannon's mouth, now shook like a smitten woman.
                        His sister Sylvy was sitting at the farthest extremity of the room, with a
                        new-born baby on her lap. Her eyes once met her brother's—then fell, and she
                        remained silent, and motionless.</p>
                     <p>The whole story was told. The iron entered the husband's—father's soul. He
                        reeled, and involuntarily grasped the post of the bedstead. His wife awoke,
                        opened her eyes and fixed them on him. This steadied him. She gazed intently
                        for half a minute. Her glance seemed to burn into his very soul.</p>
                     <p>She uttered a loud, prolonged shriek. The blood rushed into her blanched
                        cheeks, and springing up in the bed, she clasped her arms tight around his
                        neck.</p>
                     <p>"It <emph>was</emph> a dream—a dream, a horrid dream!—a nightmare!" she
                        screamed. "You are here, my husband!—my honoured, dear husband! It was a
                        dream—my arms are around you, and you don't spurn me—you don't call me that
                        dreadful name! Oh! how they rung it in my ears! It <emph>was</emph> a dream!
                        I see you!—I see you! I was not false—bad! I couldn't be—I loved you—I do
                        love you! It was a horrid dream!"</p>
                     <p>She paused—she still hung around his neck; but she let her head fall back
                        and gazed intently in her husband's face.</p>
                     <p>"Why," she said, in her own natural, low, subdued tone, but lower, tenderer
                        than ever—"Why don't you kiss your little Lucy?"</p>
                     <p>And then, starting away from him as if a harpy had seized her, and flashing
                        her eye around the room, she pointed to the baby, and shrieked:</p>
                     <p>"There!—there!—there!"</p>
                     <p>It was a shriek that seemed to comprehend all human woe</p>
                     <p>"Oh! it was <emph>not</emph> a dream!—it was not a dream!" she screamed, and
                        sinking down, she covered her face. "Oh! hide me—hide me—bury me deep under
                        ground! He has seen me—he hates me! Oh! God of mercy! strike me dead! Why
                        can't I die?"</p>
                     <p>Colonel Freeman didn't speak. He stood motionless beside the bed. Gloom and
                        misery had settled on his noble countenance. His son threw himself beside
                        his mother; he tore the sheet from her face, laid his cheek to hers, and
                        said—</p>
                     <p>"Dear, dear mother, don't! Father will speak to you—in a minute he will.</p>
                     <p>This apparently soothed her. She was quiet for a moment; but the tide flowed
                        back and swept every thing before it. She pushed her boy aside, threw back
                        the tresses of hair that she had gathered over her face, raised up, leaning
                        on her elbow, looked vacantly at her husband, at the infant, at her boy, and
                        broke out into peals of maniac laughter.</p>
                     <p>Colonel Freeman fled from the room.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, mother! dear mother! don't!" besought poor Willie.</p>
                     <p>Sylvy laid down the baby and rushed to the bedside. In her effort to
                        suppress her feelings and her words at her brother's sudden appearance, she
                        had bitten through her lip, and the blood had trickled down over her white,
                        loose gown. The blood stains caught Lucy's eye.</p>
                     <p>"Did you kill her?" she asked with that sudden change of countenance and
                        flash of intelligence, common in madness. "Did you, sister Sylvy? Oh! how
                        could you? Well, I don't know that I am sorry; it's all for the best; she
                        was innocent, poor little thing! You are sure she is quite, quite dead?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, no, dear child!—she is not dead—she is not harmed. I will take care of
                        her—I will, Lucy."</p>
                     <pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7726-00000138"/>
                     <p>"Will you? Will you tell him she is innocent? Ask him, beg him, pray him to
                        let her stay with him. I am going where all bad women go—going—going!"</p>
                     <p>Her utterance became incoherent and confused, and from that time, though her
                        mind was filled with distressful visions, she had rarely and at long
                        intervals any memory, or even faint shadowing, of the realities of her own
                        existence and its dreadful calamity.</p>
                     <p>Colonel Freeman went to his room—shut and locked the door. His sister went
                        often to the entry that communicated with his apartment, and signified, by
                        her footsteps, that she was there; but there was no response to her, and she
                        understood her brother too well to force herself upon him.</p>
                     <p>Evening came. Willie said—</p>
                     <p>"Don't you think, Aunt Sylvy, that my father will come down before
                        bed-time?"</p>
                     <p>"No—I think not."</p>
                     <p>"But he has eaten no dinner and no supper?"</p>
                     <p>"I think he does not miss them, Willie. Go to bed, child; go to bed—you can
                        go to sleep."</p>
                     <p>"I cannot—I feel as if I never should go to sleep again."</p>
                     <p>The little fellow crept up stairs, and laid himself down by his father's
                        door, and there he lay a weary hour, listening to the low, sad sounds
                        within; and then the blessing of childhood fell upon him, and he slept till
                        the sun rose. He then made a movement that indicated his awaking, and his
                        father opened the door and drew him into the room. He put his arms fondly
                        over the boy.</p>
                     <p>"It was kind of you, my child, to lie down there; it comforted me."</p>
                     <p>"Did it, sir? I am glad."</p>
                     <p>"You have grown, Willy!"</p>
                     <p>"Why, yes, sir. I was only a child when you went away."</p>
                     <p>A slight shiver passed over Colonel Freeman.</p>
                     <p>"It is a great while—four years the 22d of last April. You have not changed
                        otherwise than being taller, and more manly. You are the same kind-hearted
                        boy—you love your little mother?"</p>
                     <p>There was an unwonted trembling of his voice on the last words.</p>
                     <p>"Lover her, father! I love her better than any one in the world. I can't
                        help loving her. Can you, sir?"</p>
                     <p>His eyes fell.</p>
                     <p>"No, Willie. Tell me, my boy, why you never mention ed your mother all the
                        spring and winter in your letters?"</p>
                     <p>"She begged me not to, sir; and she used to say, over and over again—'I am
                        not your mother, Willie; I am not your father's wife!' I could not think
                        what she meant; and she cried; so I couldn't do what she asked me not to
                        do."</p>
                     <p>"I do not blame you, my boy. And now we stand together, and the world
                        sha'n't move us. Go down stairs and ask your aunt to send Ben to me with my
                        portmanteau, and water and towels; and ask your aunt to come to me in half
                        an hour."</p>
                     <p>"Will you not come to breakfast, sir?"</p>
                     <p>"If I can, my son; I am not hungry now."</p>
                     <p>"But, father, you have not eaten since yesterday morning! You will be
                        sick!"</p>
                     <p>"Don't fear that, my boy. You know I am a soldier, and used to fasting. Go
                        now."</p>
                     <p>If one so sick at heart could have been sick in body, it would have been an
                        infinite relief.</p>
                     <p>Miss Sylvy counted the minutes, and in half an hour precisely was in her
                        brother's room. The Colonel had gone<pb n="278-279"
                           xml:id="VAC7726-00000139"/> through the renovation of washing and
                        shaving, and he was composed in his manner, but his ghastly paleness, a
                        general tremulousness, and his heavy, dull, sick eye, showed how the strong
                        man had been taken down.</p>
                     <p>"Sit down, my good sister," he said.</p>
                     <p>Her brother's composure seemed preternatural to Sylvy; it awed her. She sank
                        into a chair, and said, without addressing him, for she seemed to speak
                        unconsciously,</p>
                     <p>"My knees are weak. I wonder what ails me!"</p>
                     <p>"Sylvy," said her brother, "we have a task to do, and we must set shoulder
                        to shoulder. You have ever been the friend that is the medicine of life to
                        me, and so you will continue to be. It seems to me that I have lived ages
                        and ages since I opened that door yesterday. It has been a sorrowful
                        night."</p>
                     <p>He paused, and wept like a child.</p>
                     <p>"I didn't mean this should be again," he continued; "but nature will have
                        her way. Sylvy, light has broken upon me. I think the good God has answered
                        my prayer, and given me wisdom to direct my steps aright. I have laid out my
                        course, and with His help I will maintain it. How is she this morning?"</p>
                     <p>"Just so—lost, entirely lost, but not raving."</p>
                     <p>"Did she sleep?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, a sort of sleep, brother. The doctor gave her opium. Her sleep was
                        full of groans, and sobs, and confused talk!"</p>
                     <p>"Sylvy, give me in brief the history of the past week—go no farther back—I
                        have made out the fatal story. I speak of it now for the first and last
                        time. Let no friend ever speak to me on the subject. If an enemy does, I
                        shall know how to answer him. I remember when it was you said she had a
                        falling out with—with—" (his voice choked)—"with Oakley. The last of
                        November he left here. Her life since has been one of remorse and misery.
                        Tell me now, Sylvy, what I asked of you."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, brother; but I must go farther back than last week. I didn't tell you
                        all in my letters. Maybe I was wrong; but, says I to myself, brother can't
                        leave his duty, and what's the use of distressing him?</p>
                     <p>"It was weeks and weeks before her dejection was known to the neighbours.
                        She was always a little house-body, you know—no hand for visiting; and so
                        after you went away, we seldom saw the neighbours, and I am a still body at
                        best. It was enough to tell the work-folks that Mrs. Freeman was not well;
                        and so it went on for weeks, till one day Mr. West called, and after telling
                        me that he had heard that Oakley had got safe into New-York, he asked to see
                        her; I could not refuse him, so I led him right into the dwelling-room. She
                        started and turned pale, for she had got so nervous then she could not bear
                        any thing. Mr. West soon saw how low she was, and he thought it was on
                        account of your long absence, and anxiety, and so on; and the good man's
                        tears ran down his face—he is a dreadful feeling man you know—but he told
                        her she 'ought to submit, and remember she was a professor!'</p>
                     <p>"'Yes—yes,' she said—it was the first word she spoke—'a professor, and a
                        hypocrite!'</p>
                     <p>"'But, my dear young friend,' he said, 'you surely have not lost your
                        hope?'</p>
                     <p>"'I have, I have,' she cried, 'for ever and for ever!'</p>
                     <p>"He talked long, and handled her as if she had been a little child. You
                        know, brother, how, from the very first she had that about her that made
                        every one gentle with her. But,<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7726-00000140"/>
                        then, Mr. West, out of the range of doctrine, and down the pulpit stairs, is
                        gentle to every one. Well, he talked, she not answering a word, but looking
                        steadfastly down. He told her the church and he had been well satisfied with
                        her experience at her examination, and that many a saint had low times,—but
                        that final perseverance was sure. He said that he had known others who, in
                        trying circumstances, or poor health, were tempted by Satan to give up their
                        precious hope. She answered not a word. He told her he would send her his
                        unpublished work on the Atonement, and he did so, and other writings of
                        learned divines on the Perseverance of Saints, and so on. She never opened
                        them—and she begged me never to bring Mr. West into her room again, and
                        wrought me to promise I would not. She said the evil spirit most tormented
                        her when a good spirit was near. But she said little. There were days and
                        days she saw no face but mine, for she said she could not even bear Willie's
                        presence—and then, again, she could not bear to have him move from her side.
                        She never opened one of your letters—she would not even touch them. She said
                        she was not worthy. She had them put in a basket on the table, beside which
                        he sat, and Willie said, many a time, she would bend her head over it, and
                        the tears would fall like rain. You may see them now all crumpled with her
                        tears—poor little dear!"</p>
                     <p>"Merciful God!" exclaimed Colonel Freeman, starting from his seat with
                        uncontrollable emotion. He was soon again calm. "Proceed, Sylvy," he
                        said.</p>
                     <p>"Well, brother—so it went on. I saw she did not get thin or pale—and I kept
                        hoping that when the time for the singing of birds came, and the woods
                        freshened, and the grass sprung, and the blossoms came out, she would rise.
                        But, no, she who had loved all such pretty things, never seemed to desire
                        any of them now. Day and night I considered about writing to you—but I knew
                        how the country needed all your strength, and how you were harassed, and I
                        much doubted if this were a case that even you could help; not that I
                        ever—ever—for an instant mistrusted the truth. You know, brother, I am not
                        much acquainted with woman's business, and I am not one of the suspicious or
                        observing kind—and truly, truly I should as soon have surmised evil of one
                        of the angels that stand before, the Heavenly throne as of our Lucy—poor
                        little dear! I always went into her room before I went to bed, to see if
                        there were any thing to be done,—and night before last, as I was leaving the
                        room, I heard a groan—I turned and looked at her. 'You are in distress,' I
                        said.</p>
                     <p>"'I am always in distress,' she answered.</p>
                     <p>"'But,' says I, 'Lucy, this is something more than common.'</p>
                     <p>"'It is!—it is!' she says, and clenching both her hands, she told me what
                        was coming—'I shall die,' she says, 'I know I shall die; for I have prayed
                        and prayed for that. I have asked nothing else. God is merciful, and he will
                        grant me that. I would rather go now to the fire prepared for me than meet
                        your brother's altered eye.'</p>
                     <p>"She never called you husband—poor little dear!—from the time her spirits
                        first failed. I was calm, brother. The shock was too great for words, or
                        tears. Her sufferings increased beyond account. I had never been in such a
                        situation before, and though she begged me to let her die alone with me, I
                        dared not. So I roused Ben, and sent for Doctor Lyman. He said not one word
                        when I told him. But he felt. Well, the child was born towards morning.
                        Doctor Lyman was doctor, nurse, and every thing—for I knew no more than you
                        would, brother, what to do. I think<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7726-00000141"
                        /> she wandered a little from the moment the child was born. She would see
                        Willie—she would not be denied. Doctor Lyman said it was not safe to refuse
                        her. I told him Willie might be relied on. The doctor went out and talked to
                        Willie himself—I don't know what he said, but I surmise the poor boy knows
                        enough what it all means. Doctor Lyman said, says he, 'Miss Sylvy, keep your
                        doors shut and <emph>locked.</emph> The hellish spirit of gossip is awake in
                        the village,' says he, 'but, if possible, it shall not be gratified this
                        time. For the present, take the best care you can. You know how to keep
                        close—so do I. We will consider for the future. Perhaps I will, myself, go
                        to the Colonel—but we leave that. Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof.
                        We will shelter her if we can. She is a million times better than those that
                        are ready and glad to believe in her backsliding, 'tigers and foul beasts!'
                        says he."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, that it should be so—'earth and ashes' as we all are!" groaned Colonel
                        Freeman.</p>
                     <p>Sylvy had finished her mournful story, and she was not addicted to any
                        prosing comments, least of all at this time was she like to offend in this
                        way. After a few moments' silence, Colonel Freeman said, "Thank you, my good
                        sister; I believe you have done all for the best. There is much wisdom in a
                        good and feeling heart. Tell Dr. Lyman I kindly thank him. I cannot speak
                        even to him on the subject. But, do you tell him, Sylvy, I wish to have no
                        concealments—no false shows—no acting lies. No, say not that last to him. He
                        is an honest man, and meant no wrong. I have my own view of the matter. I
                        wish to shape our life for the equal eye of God, and not with any respect to
                        the erring, presumptuous hard judgment with which man, and woman too, judge
                        their own frail fellow-creatures. No, I have laid out my course, and with
                        God's help and blessing, I will follow it. I have no blame to throw upon my
                        poor little wife—if she were herself, I would go upon my knees and ask her
                        forgiveness. It is not that I take blame for marrying one so much younger
                        than myself. You know, Sylvy, our love filled up that chasm! But, how could
                        I, deemed a prudent man—arrived at the age of cool forethought and
                        discretion, invite a man—an idle man—with all the qualities pleasing in the
                        eye of a young woman, in the closest intimacy with my wife. I, who was her
                        earthly providence, should have preserved her from temptation, and not
                        thrust her into it. I look back and see that repentance and remorse followed
                        close on transgression. Surely, if a mortal's penitence can expiate sin, she
                        has washed hers out by months of continual tears—by days and nights of
                        untold misery. My life henceforth shall be devoted to her—if she lives. If
                        she dies, and I think she will die, not one reproachful thought will turn to
                        the time since we parted, but I will lay her down in the grave lovingly, and
                        in the hope of a joyful re-union."</p>
                     <p>"Brother, I thought you would feel so—I know your nature—but—"</p>
                     <p>"But what, Sylvy?"</p>
                     <p>"You forget the law, brother—the law of church and state divorces you?"</p>
                     <p>"Forget!" echoed Colonel Freeman. "She has, herself, divorced us—broken for
                        ever our marriage bond—but what law can prevent my cherishing her as a
                        child—loving her as a child. We have a wide land, Sylvy; if she lives we
                        will take her beyond the reach of the laws she has offended. We will live
                        where God, who forgiveth, will alone take cognizance of us. We will all go
                        together, Sylvy."</p>
                     <p>"The baby, brother?"</p>
                     <pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7726-00000142"/>
                     <p>"I have wrestled there, Sylvy. I cannot see how it is right to cast out from
                        us the only perfectly innocent one among us. And yet to take it with us a
                        perpetual memento, badge, and reproach! I leave that, Sylvy. I trust to have
                        strength for my duty when the time comes. For the present, find a nurse, and
                        let the poor little heir of shame and sorrow be well cared for."</p>
                     <p>"But you must leave us, brother, and return to duty?"</p>
                     <p>"No, I never will leave my home again. Others can as well perform my public
                        duty—none other can do it here. There is my letter to the commanding
                        officer."</p>
                     <p>He laid under her eye an unsealed letter. Sylvy read the few words
                        following, which were all it contained.</p>

                     <p>The dishonour of Colonel Freeman's house was soon known through the little
                        community of S——. The weak had their pleasure in the mean "I told you so!"
                        The wicked scoffed; the hard-hearted thought the Colonel should be dealt
                        with for winking at sin; the pitiful dropped a tear over their erring
                        sister, and said nothing. There were a few magnanimous minds that
                        sympathized with the divine qualities of Colonel Freeman, and felt how much
                        greater was the husband, who could hold an even scale, who could forgive and
                        succour, than he who crushes and avenges. Mercy is thrice blessed. "Pride is
                        hateful before God and man."</p>
                     <p>"Man proposes—God disposes," as the projects and disappointments of every
                        day show. Colonel Freeman took his breakfast with his sister and son. Ben,
                        and a small servant girl, as was the custom of the time, even with most of
                        our New England gentry, sitting at one end of the table. The Colonel was
                        calm and self-possessed. He commended Miss Sylvy's bread—he had never seen
                        as good, he said, since he had left his own home. "The making of good bread
                        was one of the first of duties—but few," he said—and there was a faint, but
                        benign smile on his face as he looked to his sister in saying it—"but few
                        performed it." He thanked the zealous little girl who had been out in the
                        dewy field to pick the strawberries for his breakfast. He asked Ben about
                        the planting and the stock. The storm had swept over him, but it had left
                        him lord of himself.</p>
                     <p>"You praise every thing, but you don't eat, father!" said poor Willie, who
                        watched him intently.</p>
                     <p>"Don't be anxious, my dear little boy—I am a strong man, and can bear a long
                        fast. In a day or two I shall do my part." He could not, with all his
                        resolution and effort, do it now; and he hastily left the table and joined
                        Dr. Lyman, who he knew was awaiting him in his wife's apartment. She was
                        awake. She turned her eyes, glancing on him, and they followed him as he
                        passed round to the foot of the bed. She was quiet, but it was a fearful
                        calm, an absence of the sense from which emotion and passion spring. Colonel
                        Freeman came round to the side of the bed. He took her hand. It was passive
                        in his. He stroked her hair from off her brow as he had been used to do when
                        she was a little girl. Not a muscle moved. "Lucy,—dear little Lucy!" he
                        said. She made no reply—no movement. He bent over her, and his hot tears
                        fell on her white cheek. She didn't feel them. He started away from her, and
                        paced up and down the room. She raised her head and leaned on her elbow—her
                        eyes still<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7726-00000143"/> intently fixed on him.
                        Having knit his mind to the worst—"Are her senses utterly gone, Doctor?" he
                        asked.</p>
                     <p>"I cannot tell you, my dear sir—it looks so, I confess—but I think not
                        utterly. She has spoken to me. She seems to be possessed with one idea. Mrs.
                        Freeman, do you know who you are looking at?"</p>
                     <p>"I know <emph>what</emph> I am looking at," she answered, speaking in her
                        natural voice, but with an inflexible harrowing monotony; "but you do not,
                        Doctor,—one shadow cannot see another. I excuse you sir,—but you need not
                        talk about it. I am a real living being, and talking rather worries me. Pass
                        this way—pass this way." She motioned her hand to her husband, and he came
                        again to the bedside.—"There it is, just so, Doctor. They are all
                        gone—there's nothing but shadows left!"</p>
                     <p>And so it seemed to her. This one idea had taken possession of her mind. God
                        had dealt mercifully with her. The great facts of her life were stricken
                        from her memory. The faculty was not utterly lost; for several days
                        following she continued to call the Doctor, Sylvy, and Willie by name—always
                        maintaining they were mere shadows. Doctor Lyman laid the baby on her arm,
                        hoping the intense feeling connected with its existence might stimulate her
                        mind to more rational action. But it failed of this effect. She only said in
                        the same unvarying tone, "It is but a little shadow, but it makes me
                        cold—take it away, if you please."</p>
                     <p>One after another was lost from her memory. Her husband lived alone there,
                        if that could be called life which to her was but the shadow of life. Day
                        after day—weeks—months—<emph>years!</emph> passed on and there was no
                        change. The only feeling she manifested was a preference of her husband's to
                        all other "shadows," as she called them. She made little demonstration, even
                        of this. She had a desire, as most people under a nervous derangement have,
                        to be in the open air, and she was permitted to walk in the fields behind
                        the house. No one but Colonel Freeman could induce her to return to it. He
                        had but to join her and turn towards the house—she followed, often repeating
                        "that shadow draws me after it!" The only food she tasted was that he
                        brought her. His patience and tenderness never abated. It was wonderful to
                        see a man in the vigour of his manhood—a man who had commanded a regiment in
                        perilous and perplexing times, who had won laurels in many battles, become
                        the gentle nurse—circumscribing his life, and renouncing power and fame, and
                        all that most men most love, most eagerly pursue.</p>
                     <p>He built an apartment for her with a southern aspect—hoping, as he said,
                        that the sun and moon would be God's ministers to her. He bought sweet
                        singing birds, and put them in cages by her window.</p>
                     <p>He planted lilacs and damask roses—the only flowering things then
                        domiciliated in Berkshire, about her window, and he trained around it a
                        monthly honey-suckle, obtained, at much pains. Thus the "Flower Angel" was
                        ever near her, expounding the parable of that modern Sirach, Edie
                        Ochil-tree, who says "it is to teach us not to slight them that are in the
                        darkness of sin and the decay of tribulation, that God sends odours to
                        refresh the withered hour."</p>
                     <p>A coarse jest at the expense of Colonel Freeman might have passed round in
                        the congregation of vulgar men at the village bar-room, and there might have
                        been depreciating whispers from some female Pharisee of a tea drinking—but
                        for the most part, men, women and children united in a sentiment of
                        reverence for the Freemans.</p>
                     <p>Taking into account what human nature is, we must attribute<pb n="288-289"
                           xml:id="VAC7726-00000144"/> tribute a portion of this to the natural
                        dignity and commanding presence of Colonel Freeman, to his soldierly
                        reputation, and to the purity of a life without reproach, which latter
                        carries with it a stronger prestige than the "divinity that doth hedge about
                        a king." There was a single exception to this general current of
                        respect.</p>
                     <p>Obed Allen returned to his home at the close of the war, one of the few
                        enriched by its employment, and puffed up, and glorying in his shame. The
                        very day after his return he met Col. Freeman at the village Post-Office.
                        Mail-day was then once a week, some great news was expected, and the little
                        room was crowded with men and lads from all the districts of the town. Allen
                        had not been long enough at home "to take an observation," (to borrow a
                        seaman's phrase,) that is (in our village parlance) he had not ascertained
                        "the mind of the street," and obedient to his own low instinct, he ventured
                        to the Colonel a jocular reference to the warning he had given him. Colonel
                        Freeman said nothing, but sent a glance through Allen, which, a bystander
                        said, put him in mind of the promise: "I will give unto you power to tread
                        on serpents and scorpions;" there was a general cry of "shame!" and Allen
                        was hustled round the room, and kicked out the door, and that very evening,
                        a brilliant moonlight one, the lads of the village rode him on a rail—a
                        species of Lynch law then much in fashion.</p>
                     <p>We have but one more incident to relate before we close this sad, but we
                        hope not quite useless story. Soon after the Peace, an English packet was
                        transmitted to Colonel Freeman, by official hands. He was alone with his
                        sister when he received it, and pleased and curious as one is at receiving
                        an important-looking dispatch, he turned it first on one side, and then on
                        the other, examined the stamps and the handwriting writing, and said, "Why,
                        Sylvy, one would think I was still somebody—a colonel at the head of a
                        regiment."</p>
                     <p>"Open it, brother—open it," said Sylvy, impatiently.</p>
                     <p>"Foreign Embassy! Secretary of Legation!" murmured the Colonel, still
                        reading the impressions—"what can this mean?"</p>
                     <p>"Open the letter, brother, open it—that is the shortest way to find what is
                        in it."</p>
                     <p>The Colonel smiled and broke the seal—and first read the envelope which was
                        merely a certificate of the genuineness of the inclosure. He broke the
                        second seal, and read as follows:—</p>

                        Colonel Freeman threw the letter across the table to his sister without
                        speaking a word.</p>
                     <p>"How dare he!" she exclaimed as she finished reading it.
                           '<emph>Regretted!</emph>' what a flimsy word for one who has no right all
                        his life to talk or think of any thing but sackcloth and ashes. How will you
                        answer it, brother?"</p>
                     <p>"There is but one way. I shall return his letter and draft through the hands
                        that forwarded it. My handwriting of the superscription will be explanation
                        enough to him."</p>
                     <p>By an inexplicable coincidence, marked events of life seem to fall together.
                        Miss Sylvy went habitually early to Mrs. Freeman's room, and washed and
                        dressed her, as when she had first come to live with her, and she was as
                           docile<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7726-00000145"/> cile and gentle in her
                        hands now as in childhood. She had always found her out of bed, and usually
                        pacing up and down the room, for, with the wakefulness that characterizes <choice>
                           <sic>insaniity</sic>
                           <corr>insanity</corr>
                        </choice>, her sleep ended with the first ray of daylight. On the day after
                        the receipt of Oakley's letter, on going to perform her morning office, she
                        found Lucy still in bed. Miss Sylvy approached the bed, and sat down, for
                        she found, to her surprise, that her patient was, as she believed, still
                        sleeping, and as she looked nearer, she thought much changed. There was a
                        slight knitting of the brow which had been smooth from vacuity—the blue
                        veins showed a quick and irregular beating of the heart. Soon she perceived
                        a movement of the eyeballs through the almost transparent lids, and a
                        tremulousness of the lids; and in a few moments, closed as they were, one
                        tear stole after another over her deathly pale cheek. Sylvy gently wiped
                        them away.</p>
                     <p>"Thank you, dear—good—sister," said Lucy, in the lowest, feeblest whisper,
                        "but don't speak to me, now—sit still, by me."</p>
                     <p>Sylvy obeyed—every minute seemed an age. But in a few minutes she again
                        spoke.</p>
                     <p>"Call your brother," she said, "and Willy—and lay my baby on my pillow."</p>
                     <p>"I will call them—but, your baby—dear little Lucy—your baby is in heaven.
                        She lived but a year."</p>
                     <p>"A year!" She opened her eyes, wide, and spoke with great increase of force.
                        "Why, I thought it was but yesterday, sister; a year! how strange! But she
                        is in heaven, you say—God is good and merciful! Call them, Sylvy."</p>
                     <p>Sylvy communicated the change to her brother and nephew—now a charming lad
                        of fifteen. They hastened, with throbbing hearts a suppressed emotion, to
                        the bed of the dying wife and mother. They both bent over and kissed her and
                        then knelt beside her. Colonel Freeman wore his hair long over his temples;
                        it was silvered, but it still retained the softness and waviness of his
                        youth. She put up her little hand and held it off his brow and looked calmly
                        and intently into his eyes till her arm dropped from weakness.</p>
                     <p>"My friend!—father!—husband!" she faintly articulated, "may I call you
                        husband?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, Lucy!—dear wife!—yes!"</p>
                     <p>"You have forgiven me?"</p>
                     <p>"Forgiven!—don't speak that word—you are dearer to me than my own soul.
                        Don't," he said, speaking with per feet calmness, for he feared a breath
                        might hurry away her fluttering spirit, "don't speak of the past—don't think
                        of it, dearest child."</p>
                     <p>"I must speak—for I am going away from you all; and I have much to say. How
                        long is it since you came home and stood there at the foot of the bed and
                        looked at me? Oh, my heart! be still one minute." She laid her hand on her
                        throbbing heart. "And Willie was there where he is now, and Sylvy sat by the
                        table, with my poor baby—how long?"</p>
                     <p>"Four years, yesterday!"</p>
                     <p>"Four years!—<emph>four years!</emph>—how strange—strange! I thought it was
                        yesterday morning. I remember nothing since, but a strange dream of
                        shadows—and a long, long walk with you, my husband—up through the
                        clover-field, and being so tired—and a feeling that you loved me, and pitied
                        me—and that you all would love me if you were any thing—but you seemed all,
                        but shadows. You took care of my sinless baby, dear husband? God received
                        it, and you, I know, did not cast it out."</p>
                     <p>"I did not, my child. Sylvy took it to her own room—<pb n="292-293"
                           xml:id="VAC7726-00000146"/> and we got a wet-nurse for it—and they told
                        me it thrived—but at the end of the year it pleased God suddenly to take it.
                        I did what I could for it—I never saw it."</p>
                     <p>Lucy drew a deep sigh. "Right—perfectly right," she said. "What a long dream
                        I have had—four years! I waked from it early this morning. It seemed to me,
                        this was not my room."</p>
                     <p>"No, dear child, it is a room I built for you."</p>
                     <p>"How strange—I got out of bed and crept, I was too weak to walk, to the
                        window. I opened the shutter, the clouds were rose-coloured. I had a feeling
                        I should soon be beyond them. There was the sweetest scent came into the
                        windows—it seemed to me the breath of an angel. I tried to think, I could
                        not think, but the past came back—one thing after another, as we see objects
                        as the light of day increases. And I had no distress—no distress. It seemed
                        to me, you all loved me, all were at sweet peace with me! I recalled that
                        hour of darkness and distress, when you came home, my honoured husband; I
                        seemed again to see your look of pity, and compassion and forgiveness, and
                        it was that gave me a sense of God's infinite mercy—yes, peace fell upon me,
                        God's peace, and all the world cannot take it away." She spoke in the lowest
                        audible tone, and audible only in profound silence, and to senses made most
                        acute by intense feeling. "Stand up, dear Willie," she said. "Oh—how tall—it
                           <emph>is</emph> four years! Willie, put your cheek down to mine, dear.
                        Willie, when you are a man, you will not blush at your mother's name? the
                        sin that has been repented in tears, and misery not to be told as mine
                        has—that God and man has forgiven, you will not blush for, my son?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, no—dear mother, no—never!"</p>
                     <p>"Sylvy," resumed the dying woman, "I have not breath to thank you. How
                        long-suffering, and slow to anger you were."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, dear little Lucy," said the faithful creature, "don't waste your breath
                        on me—I did nothing, I could not do any thing for you—but love you—that I
                        did."</p>
                     <p>A faint smile played over Lucy's pale—still beautiful lips. "Yes—and doing
                        that you could do—did do all the rest," she said—"Sylvy, I have a message
                        for Mr. West. Give my respectful love to that good man, and tell him God has
                        taught me better than when I cried in my despair that my hope was gone for
                        ever, and for ever—tell him that I returned to Him who forgiveth and
                        upbraideth not—and fell asleep in my Heavenly Father's arms." She then again
                        kissed Willie, motioned him aside, and drew her husband to her. "My
                        husband," she said, "dearest—best—we are again united!"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, my wife," he answered, "for ever and for ever!" A gleam of joy shot
                        through her eyes, a heavenly brightness overspread her whole face, it came
                        and went like a flash of lightning, but it left an ineffaceable impression
                        on those faithful ones who saw it. To them it was a preternatural light—a
                        visible token of God's presence.</p>
                     <p>Two days after, the neighbours assembled to perform the last services. When
                        Mr. West rose to make the prayer, he repeated, with a trembling voice, and
                        overflowing eyes, the message of the departed to him. It was his only
                        allusion to any thing peculiar in the circumstances of their friends. The
                        good man's mind, glowing with a sense of God's infinite love, kindled with
                        divine life spirits lower than his own.</p>
                     <p>Lucy Freeman was tenderly and reverently borne to her grave, and when the
                        sods were laid upon it, human, for once, reached heavenly love—there was
                        more joy, on earth as in<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7726-00000147"/> heaven,
                        over one that repenteth, than over ninety and nine that had not gone
                        astray.</p>
                     <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
                     <p>Colonel Freeman returned to life, not with a bowed head and faint heart, but
                        with that cheerful activity that springs from an assured faith in God, and
                        love to man. The only indication that he had suffered more than others
                        appeared in pity for the erring, and earnest efforts to reclaim them, and in
                        sympathy with every form of sorrow. It was said of him that not a day passed
                        over his head without some good, purposed and done. The prosperity of his
                        outward life overflowed the more barren condition of his neighbours.</p>
                     <p>His son grew up to place and honour in the State. He kept his promise to his
                        mother. Her name was transmitted to his children a dear, familiar, honoured
                        household word. And when he laid his father (after a serene and sound old
                        age) in a grave beside her in our village burial-ground, it was with "a
                        peace that passeth understanding."</p>

               <p>THE reign of Charles the Sixth is one of the most humiliating periods of the
                  French history, which, in its centuries of absolute kings and unquestioning
                  subjects, presents us a most melancholy picture of the degradation of man, and of
                  the disheartening prolongation of the infancy of society. Nature had given Charles
                  but an hereditary monarch's portion of brains, and that portion had not been
                  strengthened or developed by education or exercise of any sort. Passions he had
                  not; he never rose to the dignity of passion; but his appetites were strong, and
                  they impelled him, unresisted, to every species of indulgence. His excesses
                  brought on fits of madness, which exposed his kingdom to the rivalship and misrule
                  of the princes of the blood. Fortunately for the subsequent integrity of France,
                  these men were marked by the general, and, as it would seem, constitutional
                  weakness of transmitted royalty; and were besides too much addicted to pleasure,
                     to<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7726-00000148"/> crave political independence or
                  renown in arms, the common passions of the powerful and high-born.</p>
               <p>Instead of sundering the feeble ties that bound them to their allegiance; and
                  raising their princely domains to the independence of the crown, they congregated
                  at Paris, then, as now, the Paradise of the devotees to pleasure, and surrendered
                  themselves, as their chroniclers quaintly express it, to "<foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >festins, mascarades, danses, caroles et ébattemens,</foreign>" (every species
                  of diversion,) varied by an occasional affray, an ambuscade, or an assassination.
                  The talent, that is now employed upon the arts of life, in inventing new machines,
                  and contriving new fabrics, was then exhausted in originating new pastimes. Games
                  of cards, and the revival of dramatic entertainments, date from the period of our
                  story—the beginning of the fifteenth century.</p>
               <p>There shone at Charles's court one of those stars, that occasionally cross the
                  orbit of royalty, whose brilliancy obscured the splendour of the hereditary
                  nobility,—the lights, that, according to conservative opinion, are set in the
                  firmament to rule the day and night of the plebeian world.</p>
               <p>In the month of September, of the year 1409, a stranger, attended by a servant
                  with a small travelling-sack, knocked at the gate of a magnificent <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">hôtel</foreign> in Paris. He was answered by a porter, who cast
                  on him a glance of inquiry as keen as a bank clerk's upon the face of an unknown
                  bank-note; and, seeing neither retinue, livery, nor other insignia of rank, he was
                  gruffly dismissing him, when the stranger said, "Softly, my friend; present this
                  letter to the Grand-Master, and tell him the bearer awaits his pleasure! Throw the
                  sack down within the gate, Luigi!" he added to his attendant, "and come again at
                  twelve;" and, without more ado, he took his station within the court, a movement
                  in which the porter acquiesced quiesced, seeing that in the free bearing of the
                  stranger, and in the flashing of his dark eye, which indicated, it were wise not
                  to question an authority that had nature's seal. On one side of the court was a
                  fountain, and on the other a group of Fauns, rudely carved in wood. Adornings of
                  sculpture were then unknown in France;—the art was just reviving, and the ancient
                  models still lay buried under barbaric ruins. Two grooms appeared, conducting, in
                  front of the immense flight of steps that led up to the hôtel, four horses
                  caparisoned for their riders, two for females, as was indicated by the form of the
                  saddles, and the gay silk knots that decked the bridles, one of them being studded
                  with precious stones. At the same moment, there issued from the grand entrance a
                  gentleman, and a lady who had the comely <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >embonpoint</foreign> befitting her uncertain "certain age." She called her
                  companion "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon mari,</foreign>" and he assisted her to
                  mount, with that nonchalant, conjugal air, which indicate that gallantry had long
                  been obsolete in their intercourse.</p>
               <p>The interest the wife did not excite, was directed to another quarter. <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">Mon mari's</foreign> eye was constantly reverting to the door,
                  with an expression of eager expectation. "Surely," said the lady, "Violette has
                  had time to find my <foreign xml:lang="FRA">eau-de-rose;</foreign>—let us go, my
                  husband,—we are losing the freshness of the morning. She may follow with
                  Edouard."</p>
               <p>"Go you, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ma chère amie,</foreign>" replied her husband.
                  "Mount, Edouard, and attend your mistress,—my stirrup wants adjusting,—I'll follow
                  presently. How slow she rides! a plague on old women's fears!" he muttered, as she
                  ambled off. "Ah, there you are, my morning star," he cried, addressing a young
                  girl who darted through the door, and appeared well to warrant a comparison to the
                  most beautiful of the celestial lights. She wore a Spanish riding-cap, a cloth
                  dress, the waist neatly<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7726-00000149"/> fitted to her
                  person, and much in the fashion of the riding costume of the present day, save
                  that it was shorter by some half-yard, and thus showed to advantage a rich Turkish
                  pantalette and the prettiest feet in the world, laced in boots. "Is my lady gone?"
                  she exclaimed, dropping her veil over her face.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Violette, your lady is gone, but your lord is waiting for my lady's <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">mignonne.</foreign> Come, mistress of my heart! here is my hand
                  for your stepping-stone." He then threw his arm around her waist, under the
                  pretext of assisting her to mount; but she darted away like a butterfly from a
                  pursuer's grasp, and, snatching the rein from the groom's hand, and saying, "My
                  lord, I am country bred, and neither need nor like your gallantries," she led the
                  horse to the platform on which the Fauns were placed, and, for the first time
                  seeing the stranger, who stood, partly obscured by them, looking curiously upon
                  this little scene, she blushed, and he involuntarily bowed. It was an instinctive
                  homage, and she requited it with a look as different from that which she returned
                  to the libertine gaze of the Count de Roucy, as the reflection in a mirror of two
                  such faces, the one bloated and inflamed, the other pure and deferential, would
                  have been. Availing herself of the slight elevation of the platform, she sprang
                  into the saddle and set off at a speed that, in De Roucy's eye, provokingly
                  contrasted with her mistress's cautious movement. "Who are you, and what do you
                  here?" he said, turning to the stranger.</p>
               <p>"My name," replied the stranger, without condescending to notice the insolent
                  manner of the question, "is Felice Montano, and I am here on business with the
                  Grand-Master."</p>
               <p>"Did ye not exchange glances with that girl?"</p>
               <p>"I looked on her, and the saints reward her, she looked on me."</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Par amour?</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"I stand not here to be questioned;—I ne'er saw the lady before, but, with
                  Heaven's kind leave, I shall see her again!"</p>
               <p>"Take care,—the girl is my wife's minion, the property of the house,—ye shall be
                  watched!" muttered De Roucy, and, mounting his horse, he rode off, just as the
                  porter reappeared, attended by a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">valet-de-place,</foreign>
                  whose obsequious address indicated that a flattering reception awaited
                  Montano.</p>
               <p>Montano was conducted up a long flight of steps, and through a corridor to an
                  audience-room, whose walls were magnificently hung with tapestry, and its windows
                  curtained with the richest Oriental silk. Silver vases, candelabra of solid gold,
                  and various costly furniture, were displayed with dangerous profusion, offering a
                  tempting spoil to the secret enemies of their proprietor.</p>
               <p>There were already many persons of rank assembled, and others entering. Montano
                  stood apart, undaunted by their half insolent, half curious glances. He had
                  nothing to ask, and therefore feared nothing. He felt among these men, notorious
                  for their ignorance and their merely animal lives, the conscious superiority of an
                  enlightened man, that raised him far above the mere hereditary distinction,
                  stigmatized by a proud plebeian as the "accident of an accident." Montano was an
                  Italian, and proudly measured the eminence from which his instructed countrymen
                  looked down upon their French neighbours.</p>
               <p>As he surveyed the insolent nobles, he marvelled at the ascendency which Jean de
                  Montagu, the Grand-Master of the Palace, had maintained over them for nearly half
                  a century.<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7726-00000150"/> The son of a humble notary
                  of Paris, he had been ennobled by King John, had been the prime and trusted
                  favourite of three successive monarchs, had maintained through all his capricious
                  changes the favour of Charles, had allied his children to nobles and kings, had
                  liberally expended riches, that the proudest of them all did not possess, had
                  encouraged and defended the labouring classes, and was not known to have an enemy,
                  save Burgundy, the fearful "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Jean sans peur.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>The suitors to the Grand-Master had assembled early, as it was his custom to
                  receive those who had pressing business before breakfast, it being his policy not
                  to keep his suitors in vexing attendance. He knew his position, even while it
                  seemed firmest, to be an uncertain one; and he warily practised those arts which
                  smooth down the irritable surface of men's passions, and lull to sleep the hydra,
                  vanity.</p>
               <p>"The Grand-Master is true as the dial!" said a person standing near Montano; "the
                  clock is on the stroke of nine—mark me! as it striketh the last stroke, he will
                  appear."</p>
               <p>Montano fixed his eyes on the grand entrance to the saloon, expecting, that, when
                  the doors "wide open flew," he should see that Nature had put the stamp of her
                  nobility on the plebeian who kept these lawless lords in abeyance. The portal
                  remained closed, there was no <choice>
                     <sic>flurishing</sic>
                     <corr>flourishing</corr>
                  </choice> of trumpets, but, at a low side-door, gently opened and shut, entered a
                  man of low stature, and so slender and shrunken, that it would seem Nature and
                  time had combined to compress him within the narrowest limits of the human frame.
                  His features were small, his chin beardless, and the few locks that hung, like
                  silver fringe around his head, were soft and curling as an infant's. He wore a
                  Persian silk dressing-gown over a citizen's simple under-dress, and his tread was
                  so light, his manner so unpretending and unclaiming, that Montano would scarcely
                  have looked at him a second time, if he had not perceived every eye directed
                  towards him, and certain tokens of deference analogous to those flutterings and
                  shrinkings that are seen in the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">basse cour,</foreign> when
                  its sovereign steps forth among his subdued rivals. But, when he did look again,
                  he saw the fire glowing in a restless eye, that seemed to see and read all at a
                  glance,—an eye that no man, carrying a secret in his bosom, could meet without
                  quailing.</p>
               <p>"Your Grace believes," said the Grand-Master to the Duke of Orleans, who had been
                  vehemently addressing him in a low voice, "that these mysteries are a kind of
                  divertisement that will minister to our sovereign's returning health?"</p>
               <p>"So says the learned leech, and we all know they are the physic our brother
                  loves,"</p>
               <p>"Then be assured, your poor servant will honour the drafts on his master's
                  treasury, though it be well nigh drained by the revels of the late marriages. The
                  king's poor subjects starve, that his rich ones may feast; and children scarce out
                  of leading-strings are married, that their fathers and mothers may have pretexts
                  for dances and masquerades."</p>
               <p>"Methinks," said the Count de Vaudemont, the ally and messenger of Burgundy, "the
                  Grand-Master's example is broad enough to shelter what seems, in comparison of the
                  late gorgeous festival within these walls, but the revels of rustics."</p>
               <p>"The festivals within <emph>these</emph> walls are paid with coin from our own
                  poor coffers," replied the Grand-Master, "not drawn from the King's treasury, and
                  rusted with the sweat and tears of his subjects. But what have we here?" He passed
                  his eye over a petition to the King, from sundry artisans, whose houses had been
                  stripped of their movables by the<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7726-00000151"/>
                  valets of certain Dukes,—these valets pleading the common usage of justification
                  of this summary process. "Tell our good friends," he said, "it shall be my first
                  business to present this to our gracious sovereign; but, in the mean time, let
                  them draw on me for the amount of their losses. I can better afford the creditor's
                  patient waiting than our poor friends who, after their day's hard toil, should lie
                  securely on their own beds at night. Ah, my lords, why do ye not, like our
                  neighbours of England, make the poor man's cottage his castle." After various
                  colloquies with the different groups, in which, whether he denied or granted, it
                  was always with the same gracious manner, the same air of self-negation, he drew
                  near to De Vaudemont, who stood apart from the rest, with an air of frigid
                  indifference, and apparent unconsciousness of the Grand-Master's presence or
                  approach, till Montagu asked, in a low and deferential tone, "What answer sendeth
                  his Grace of B-b-b-b-b—?" Montagu had a stammering infirmity, which beset him when
                  he was most anxious to appear unconcerned. He lowered his voice at every fresh
                  effort to pronounce the name, and this confidential tone gave a more startling
                  effect to the loud, rough voice, in which the party addressed pronounced,
                  "Burgundy! his Grace bids me say, that for some diseases blood-letting is the only
                  remedy."</p>
               <p>"Tell Burgundy," replied the Grand-Master, now speaking without the slightest
                  faltering, and in allusion to the recent alliance of his own with the royal
                  family, "tell Burgundy, that the humblest stream that mingles with the Ganges
                  becomes a portion of holy water, and that blood-letting is dangerous when ye
                  approach the royal arteries! Ah!" he continued, turning suddenly to Montano,
                  grasping his hand, and resuming his usual tone, "You, I think, are the son of
                  Nicoló Montano,—welcome to Paris! You must stay to breakfast with me. I have much
                  to ask concerning my old friend. It is one and twenty years since your mother put
                  my finger in your mouth to feel your first tooth. Bless me, what goodly rows are
                  there now! So time passes!"</p>
               <p>"And where it were once safe to thrust your finger, it might now be bitten off.
                  Ha! Jean de Montagu?" growled Vaudemont.</p>
               <p>"When there are wolves abroad, we take care of our fingers," coolly replied
                  Montagu.</p>
               <p>These discourteous sallies and significant retorts were afterwards remembered, as
                  are the preludes to an earthquake after the catastrophe has interpreted them. The
                  assembly broke up, Montagu bidding his young friend to take a stroll in the
                  garden, and rejoin him at the ringing of the breakfast bell. When that sounded, a
                  valet appeared and conducted Montano to a breakfast room, where game, cakes, and
                  fruit were served on plate, and the richest wine sparkled in cups that old Homer
                  might fain have gemmed with his consecrating verse. "I had forgotten," said
                  Montagu, "that a boy of two and twenty needs no whetting to his appetite; but sit
                  ye down, and we will dull its edge. Ah, here you are, De Roucy. We have a guest to
                  season our fare this morning, the son of my old schoolmate, Nicoló Montano." De
                  Roucy bowed haughtily, and Montano returned the salutation as it was given. "Why
                  comes not Elinor to breakfast?" asked Montagu of the Count de Roucy, who was the
                  husband of his eldest daughter.</p>
               <p>"She likes not strangers."</p>
               <p>"God forgive her! Felice Montano is no stranger;—the son of her father's first and
                  best friend,—of the playfellow of his boyhood,—of the founder of his fortunes, a
                     <emph>stranger!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"I thought you had <emph>woven</emph> your own fortunes, sir."</p>
               <pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7726-00000152"/>
               <p>"So have I, and interwoven with them some rotten threads. Think not, De Roucy, I
                  do not notice, or that, noticing, I care for your allusion to my father's craft.
                  Come hither, Pierre." De Roucy's son, a boy of seven, came and stood at his knee.
                  "When you are grown a man, Pierre, remember, that, when your father's fathers were
                  burning cottages, bearing off poor men's daughters, slaughtering their cattle, and
                  trampling down their harvest-fields,—doing the work of hereditary lordlings,—my
                  child, your mother's ancestors were employed in planting mulberries, rearing
                  silkworms, multiplying looms,—in making bread and wine plenty, and adding to the
                  number of happy homes in their country."</p>
               <p>"But, grandpapa, I won't remember the wicked ones that stole and did such horrid
                  deeds!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, Pierre, you will be a lord then, and learn in lordly phrase to call stealing
                     <emph>levying.</emph> Go, boy, and eat your breakfast;—God forgive me! I have
                  worked hard to get my posterity into the ranks of robbers!"</p>
               <p>At another moment, Montano would have listened with infinite interest to all these
                  hints, as so many clues to the history and mind of a man who was the wonder of his
                  times; but now something more captivating to the imagination of two and twenty,
                  than the philosophy of any old man's history, occupied him, and he was wondering,
                  why no inquiry was made about the companion of the Countess, and whether that
                  creature, who seemed to him only fit to be classed with the divinities, was really
                  a menial in the house of this weaver's son.</p>
               <p>"Your father," resumed the Grand-Master, "writes with a plainness that pleases me.
                  I thank him. It shall not be my fault, if every window in my sovereign's palace is
                  not curtained with the silks from his looms; and, if it were not that my son's
                  espousals have drained my purse, I would give you the order on the instant for the
                  re-furnishing of my hôtel. But another season will come, and then we shall be in
                  heart again. Your father does not write in courtly vein. He says, that, amid his
                  quiet and obedient subjects, who toil and spin for him while he sleeps, he envies
                  not my uncertain influence over a maniac monarch, and dominion over factious
                  nobles. Uncertain,—St. Peter! What think ye, De Roucy? May not a man who has
                  allied one daughter to your noble house, another to the Sire de Montbaron, and
                  another to Melun, and now has affianced his only son to the Constable d'Albret,
                  doubly cousin to the King, may not he throw his glove in dame Fortune's face?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my lord, and dame Fortune may throw it back again. He only betrays his
                  weakness, who props himself on every side."</p>
               <p>"Weakness! I have not an enemy save Burgundy."</p>
               <p>"And he who has Burgundy needs none other."</p>
               <p>"You are billious this morning, De Roucy. But come, wherewith shall we entertain
                  our young friend? We have no pictures, no statues. Our gardens are a wilderness,
                  Montano, to your Paradise of Italy; but I have one piece of workmanship, that I
                  think would even startle the masters of your land." He called the servant in
                  waiting, and whispered an order to him. In a few moments the door re-opened, and a
                  young girl appeared, bearing a silver basket of grapes. Her hair was golden, and,
                  parted in front and confined on her temples with a silver thread, fell over her
                  shoulders, a mass of curls. Her head was gracefully bent over the basket she
                  carried, showing, in its most beautiful position, a swan-like neck. Her features
                  were all symmetrical, and her mouth had that perfection of outline, that art can
                  imitate, and that flexibility, obedient to<pb n="306-307"
                     xml:id="VAC7726-00000153"/> every motion of the soul, in which Nature is
                  inimitable. Her dress was of rich materials, cut in the form prescribed to her
                  rank. The mistresses were fond of illustrating their own generosity, or outdoing
                  their rivals, by the rich liveries of their train, while they jealously maintained
                  every badge of the gradation of rank. Her dress was much in the fashion of a Swiss
                  peasant girl of the present times. Her petticoat, of a fine light-blue cloth, was
                  full and short, exposing a foot and ankle, that a queen might have envied her the
                  power to show, and which she, however, modestly sheltered, with the rich silver
                  fringe that bordered her skirt. Her white silk boddice was laced with a silver
                  cord, and her short, full sleeves were looped with cords and tassels of the same
                  material. "Can ye match this girl in Italy?" whispered the old man to Montano.</p>
               <p>"In Italy! nay, my lord, not in the world is there such another model of
                  perfection!" replied Montano, who, changed as she was, by doffing her
                  demi-cavalier dress, had, at a glance, recognized his acquaintance of the
                  morning.</p>
               <p>"Thank you! Violette," said Montagu, "are these grapes from your own bower?"</p>
               <p>"They are, my lord."</p>
               <p>"Then they must needs be sweeter than old Roland's, for they have been ripened by
                  your bright eyes and sunny smiles."</p>
               <p>"Ah, but grandfather," interposed little Pierre, "Violette did not say that, when
                  I asked her for her grapes. She said, they would only taste good to her father,
                  for whom she reared them, and that I should love Roland's better."</p>
               <p>"And why did you not thus answer me, Violette?"</p>
               <p>"You asked for them, my lord,—the master's request is law to the servant."</p>
               <p>"God forgive me, if I be such a master! Take away the grapes, Violette, and send
                  them, with what else ye will from the refectory, to the forester. Nay, no thanks,
                  my pretty child, or, if you will, for all thanks let me kiss your cheek." Violette
                  stooped and offered her beautiful cheek, suffused with blushes, to Montagu's
                  lips.</p>
               <p>"The old have marvellous privileges!" muttered De Roucy. The same thought was
                  expressed in Montano's glance, when his eye, as Violette turned, encountered hers.
                  She involuntarily curtsied, as she recognized the gallant of the court. "A very
                  suitable greeting for a stranger, Violette," said the Grand-Master; "but this
                  youth must have a kinder welcome from my household. It is Felice Montano,—my
                  friend's son,—give him a fitting welcome, my child."</p>
               <p>"Nobles and princes," she replied, in a voice that set her words to music, "have
                  welcomes for <emph>your</emph> friends, my lord; but such as a poor rustic can
                  offer, she gives with all her heart." She took from her basket of grapes a
                  half-blown rose. "Will ye take this, Signor?" she said, "it offers ye Nature's
                  sweet welcome."</p>
               <p>Montano kissed the rose, and placed it in his bosom, as devoutly as if it had
                  dropped from the hand of his patron saint. He then opened the small sack which his
                  attendant had brought to the hôtel, and which, at his request, had been laid on a
                  side-table. It contained specimens of the most beautiful silks manufactured in his
                  father's filature in Lombardy, unrivalled in Italy. While these were spread out
                  and displayed, to the admiration of the Grand-Master, he took from among them, a
                     <emph>white silk scarf,</emph> embroidered in silver with lilies of the valley,
                  and, throwing it over Violette's shoulders, he asked, if she "would grace and
                  reward their arts of industry by wearing it?"</p>
               <p>"If it were fitting, Signor, one to whom it is prescribed<pb n="308-309"
                     xml:id="VAC7726-00000154"/> what bravery to wear, and how to wear it," she
                  replied, looking timidly and doubtfully at the Grand-Master.</p>
               <p>"It is <emph>not</emph> fitting," interposed De Roucy.</p>
               <p>"And pray ye, Sir, why not?" asked Montagu; "we do not here allow, that gauds are
                  for those alone who are born to them;—beneath our roof-tree, the winner is the
                  wearer;—keep it, my pretty Violette, it well becomes thee." Violette dropped on
                  her knee, kissed the Grand-Master's hand, and casting a look at Montano, worth, in
                  his estimation, all the words of thanks in the French language, she
                  disappeared.</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Montagu insisted, that during the time his young friend's negotiations with the
                  silk venders of Paris detained him there, he should remain an inmate of his
                  family; and nothing loath was Montano to accept a hospitality, which afforded him
                  facilities for every day seeing Violette. His affairs were protracted; day after
                  day he found some plausible pretext, if pretext he had needed, for delaying his
                  departure; but, by his intelligence, his various information, and his engaging
                  qualities, he had made such rapid advances in Montagu's favour, that he rather
                  wanted potent reasons to reconcile him to their parting. If such had been the
                  progress of their friendship, we need not be surprised, that one little month
                  sufficed to mature a more tender sentiment, a sentiment, that, in the young bosoms
                  of southern climes, ripens and perfects itself with the rapidity of the delicious
                  fruits of a tropical sun. Daily and almost hourly, Violette and Montano were
                  together in bower and hall. Set aside by their rank from an equal association with
                  the visitors of the Grand-Master, they enjoyed a complete plete immunity from any
                  open interference with their happiness; but Violette was persecuted with secret
                  gallantries from De Roucy, that had become more abhorrent to her since her
                  affections were consecrated to Montano. At the end of the month, their love was
                  confessed and plighted;—the Grand-Master had given his assent to their affiancing,
                  and the Countess de Roucy had yielded hers, glad to be relieved from a favourite,
                  whom she had begun to fear as a rival. The eighth of October was appointed for
                  their nuptials. "To-morrow morning, Violette," said Montagu to her on the evening
                  of the sixth, "ye shall go and ask your father's leave and blessing, and bid him
                  to the wedding. Tell him," he added, casting a side-glance towards De Roucy, who
                  stood at a little distance, eyeing the young pair "with jealous leer malign,"
                  "that I shall envy him his son-in-law;—nay, tell him not that, I will not envy any
                  man aught; my course has been one of prosperity and possession,—I have numbered
                  threescore and fifteen years,—I am now in sight of the farther shore of life, and
                  no man can interrupt my peaceful passage to it!"</p>
               <p>"Let no man count on that from which one hour of life divides him!" cried De
                  Roucy, starting from his fixed posture, and striding up and down the saloon. His
                  words afterwards recurred to all that then heard him, as a prophecy.</p>
               <p>Montano asked, for his morning's ride, an escort of six armed men. "I have
                  travelled," he said to the Grand-Master, "over your kingdom with no defence but my
                  own good weapon, and with gold enough to tempt some even of your haughty lords to
                  violence; till now, I never felt fear, or used caution."</p>
               <p>"Because till now," replied Montagu, "your heart was not bound up in the treasure
                  you exposed. That spirit is not human, that is not susceptible of fear."</p>
               <pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7726-00000155"/>
               <p>The escort was kindly provided, and, by Montagu's order furnished with baskets of
                  fruit, wine, &amp;c., to aid the extempore hospitalities of Violette's
                  cottage-home. Before the sun had nearly reached the meridian, she was within sight
                  of that dear home, on the borders of the Seine; and her eyes filled with tears,
                  as, pointing out to Montano each familiar object, she thought how soon she was to
                  be far separated from these haunts of her childhood. It was a scene of sylvan
                  beauty and rustic abundance. Stacks of corn and hay, protected from the weather,
                  not only witnessed the productiveness of the well-cultured farm, but seemed to
                  enjoy the security, with which they were permitted to lie on the lap of their
                  mother earth,—a rare security in those times of rapine, when the lazy nobles
                  might, at pleasure and with impunity, snatch from the laborers the fruit of their
                  toil. The cows were chewing the cud under the few trees of their sunny pasture,
                  the sheep feeding on the hill-side, the domestic birds gossiping in the
                  poultry-yard, and the oxen turning up, for the next summer's harvest, the rich
                  soil of fields whose product the proprietor might hope to reap, as he enjoyed,
                  through the favour of the Grand-Master, the benefit of the act called an <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">exemption de prise.</foreign> Barante, Violette's father, was
                  lying on an oaken settle, that stood under an old pear-tree, laden with fruit, at
                  his door. Two boys, in the perfection of boyhood, were eating their lunch and
                  gambling on the grass with a little sturdy house-dog; while an old, blind
                  grandmother sat within the door; she was the first to catch the sound of the
                  trampling of the horses' hoofs. "Look, Henri, who is coming," she said. The dog
                  and the boys started forth from the little court, and directly there was a
                  welcoming bark, and shouts of, "It's Violette! it's our dear sister!" Amidst this
                  shouting and noisy joy, Violette made her way to her father's arms, and the fond
                  embrace of the old woman.</p>
               <p>"And whom shall I bid welcome, Violette?" asked Barante, offering his hand to
                  Montano.</p>
               <p>"Signor Felice Montano," answered Violette, her eyes cast down, and her cheek
                  burning, as if, by pronouncing the name, she told all she had to tell.</p>
               <p>"Welcome here, Sir," resumed Barante; "ye have come, doubtless, to see how poor
                  folk live?" and the good man looked round on his little domain with a very proud
                  humility.</p>
               <p>"Oh no, dear father; he came not for that."</p>
               <p>"What did he come for, then, sister?" asked little Hugh.</p>
               <p>"I came not to see how <emph>you</emph> live," said Montano, "but to beg from you
                  wherewith to live myself," and, taking Barante aside, he unfolded his errand.</p>
               <p>"Come close to grandmother, Violette," said Henri, "and let her feel your russet
                  gown. I am glad you come not home in your bravery, for then you would not seem
                  like our own sister."</p>
               <p>"And yet," said the old woman, with a little of that womanish feeling, that clings
                  to the sex, of all conditions and ages, "I think none would become it better;—but,
                  dear me, Lettie, how you've grown! I can hardly reach to the top of your
                  head."</p>
               <p>"Not a hair's breadth have I grown, grandmother, since I saw you last; but now do
                  I seem more natural?" and she knelt down before the old woman.</p>
               <p>"Yes,—yes,—now you are my own little Lettie again,—your head just above my knee.
                  How time flies! it seems but yesterday, when your mother was no higher than this,
                  and it's five years, come next All-Saints-Day, since we laid her in the cold
                  earth. But why have you bound up your pretty curls in<pb n="312-313"
                     xml:id="VAC7726-00000156"/> this net-work, Lettie?" Henri playfully snatched
                  the silver net from her head, and her golden curls fell over her shoulders. The
                  old woman stroked, and fondly kissed them, and then passed her shrivelled fingers
                  over Violette's face, seeming to measure each feature. "Oh, if I could but once
                  more see those eyes,—I remember so well their colour,—just like the violet that is
                  dyed deepest with the sunbeams,—and that was why we call you Violette; but, when
                  they turned from the light, and glanced up through your long, dark eyelashes, they
                  looked black; so many a foolish one disputed with me the colour, as if I should
                  not know, that had watched them by all lights, since they first opened on this
                  world."</p>
               <p>"Dear grandmother, I am kneeling for your blessing, and you are filling my head
                  with foolish thoughts."</p>
               <p>"And there is another, who would fain have your blessing, good mother," said
                  Montano, whose hand Barante had just joined to Violette's.</p>
               <p>"What?—a stranger!—who is this?"</p>
               <p>"One, good mother, who craves a boon, which if granted, he desires nought else; if
                  denied, all else would be bootless to him."</p>
               <p>"What means he, Violette?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing,—and yet much, grandmother," replied Violette, with a smile and a blush,
                  that would, could the old woman have seen them, have interrupted Montano's
                  words.</p>
               <p>"Ah, a young spark!" she said. "It is ever so with them,—their cup foameth and
                  sparkleth, and yet there is nothing in it."</p>
               <p>"But there is much in it this time," interposed Barante; and, a little impatient
                  of the periphrasing style of the young people, he proceeded to state, in direct
                  terms, the character and purpose of his visitor, and said, in conclusion, "I have
                  given my consent and blessing; for you know, mother, we can't keep our Lettie,—we
                  bring up our children for others, not for ourselves, and, when their time comes,
                  they will, for it's God's law, leave their father's house and cleave unto a
                  stranger."</p>
               <p>"But why, dear Lettie," asked the old woman, "do ye not wed among your own people?
                  why go among barbarians?"</p>
               <p>"Barbarians! dear grandmother,—if ye knew all that I have learned of his people,
                  from Felice Montano, ye would think we were the barbarians, instead of they. Why,
                  grandmother, Felice can both read and write like any priest, while our great lords
                  can only make their mark. And so much do these Italians know of what the learned
                  call the <emph>arts</emph> and <emph>sciences</emph> (I know not the meaning of
                  the words, but Felice has promised to explain them to me, when we can talk of such
                  things), that our people call them <emph>sorcerers.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Ah, well-a-day! I thought how it would be, when the Lady Elinor took such a fancy
                  to your bonnie face, and begged you away from us. But why cannot ye content
                  yourself at the Grand-Master's?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, ask me not to stay there. He is as kind as my father, and so is the Lady
                  Elinor; but," added Violette in a whisper, "her husband is a bold, bad man; he
                  hath said to me what it maketh me blush to recall."</p>
               <p>"Why need ye fear him, Violette?"</p>
               <p>"Why fear him, grandmother! If all be true that men whisper of him, he dares do
                  whate'er the Evil One bids him. They say he was at the bottom of the horrid affair
                  at the Hôtel de St. Paul, and that, at Mans, he it was, that directed the mad King
                  against the Chevalier de Polignac."<ref rend="super" target="#note_006"

                  </p>
                  <p>"Among these festivals, there was one which terminated sadly. A widow, maid
                     of honour to the Queen, was married a second time, to a certain Chevalier du
                     Vermandois. The King ordered the nuptials to be celebrated at the palace.
                     The nuptials of widows were occasions of extreme licentiousness. Words and
                     actions were permitted, which elsewhere would have called forth blushes, at
                     a time when blushes were rare. The King, wishing to avail himself of the
                     occasion, assumed, with five of his young courtiers, the disguise of a
                     Satyr. Tunics besmeared with tar, and covered with tow, gave them, from head
                     to foot, a hairy appearance. In this costume, they entered the festive hall,
                     dancing. No one recognised them. While the five surrounded the bride, and
                     embarrassed her with their dances, Charles left them to torment his aunt,
                     the Duchess of Berri, who, though married to an old man, was the youngest of
                     the princesses. She could not even conjecture who he was. In the mean time,
                     the Duke of Orleans approached the others, with a torch in his hand, as if
                     to reconnoitre their faces, and set fire to the tow. It was but a sally of
                     mad sport on his part, though he was afterwards reproached with it, as if it
                     were an attempt on his brother's life. The King discovered himself to the
                     Duchess of Berri, who covered him with her mantle, and conducted him out of
                     the hall." Four of the five perished.</p>
                  <p>The historian, after saying that Charles, conducting his army into Brittany,
                     left Mans one very hot day, and that, while riding over a sandy plain, under
                     a vertical sun, and excited by a trifling accident and some random words of
                     his fool, he became suddenly mad, proceeds; "He drew his sword, and putting
                     his horse to his speed, and crying, 'On, on! Down with the traitors!' he
                     fell upon the pages and knights nearest to him. No one dared defend himself
                     otherwise than by flight, and, in this access of fury, he successively
                     killed the bastard De Polignac, and three other men. At first the pages
                     believed they had committed some disorder, which had enraged him; but, when
                     he attacked the Duke of Orleans, his brother, they perceived he had lost his
                     reason." The historian proceeds to say, that, not daring to control him,
                     they agreed upon the expedient of letting him pursue them till he was
                     exhausted; but finally a Norman knight, much loved by the King, ventured to
                     spring up behind him and pinion his arms.</p>

               <p>"But surely, dear child, the Grand-Master can protect ye."</p>
               <p>"Now he can,—but we know not how long his power may last. They say that he is far
                  out of favour with Burgundy, and none standeth long, on whom he frowneth. Indeed,
                  indeed, dear grandmother, it is better your child should go away, to a safe
                  shelter."</p>
               <p>"Ye have given me many reasons; but that ye love, is always enough for you young
                  ones. Well,—God speed ye,—ye must have your day; kneel down, both, and take an old
                  woman's blessing,—it may do ye good, under good conduct—it can do ye no harm!"</p>
               <p>This ceremony over, the boys, who had heard they were bidden to the wedding, and
                  who thought not of the parting, nor any thing beyond it, were clamorous in their
                  expressions of joy. Their father sent them, with some refection, to the men, who,
                  at his bidding, had conducted their horses to a little paddock in the rear of his
                  cottage, where they were refreshing them from his stores of provender.</p>
               <p>The day was passing happily away. Never had Violette appeared so lovely in
                  Montano's eyes, as in the atmosphere of home, where every look and action was
                  tinged by a holy light that radiated from the heart. Time passed as he always does
                  when he "only treads on flowers," and the declining sun admonished them to prepare
                  for their departure. "But first," said Barante, "let us taste together our dear
                  patron's bounty. Unpack that hamper, boys, and you, dear Violette, serve us as you
                  were wont." Violette donned her little home-apron of white muslin, tied with
                  sarsnet bows, and, spreading a cloth on the ground under the pear-tree, she and
                  the boys arranged the wine, fruit, and various confections from the basket. "It's
                  all sugar, Hugh!" said Henri, touching his tongue to the tip of a bird's wing.
                  "And this is sugar, too,!" replied Hugh, testing in the same mode a bunch of mimic
                  cherries. The<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7726-00000158"/> French <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">artistes</foreign> already excelled all others in every
                  department of the confectionary art, and to our little rustics their work seemed
                  miraculous. "Hark ye, Hugh!" said his brother; "I believe St. Francis dropped
                  these from his pocket, as he flew over."</p>
               <p>"Come, loiterers!" cried his father, "while you are gazing, we would be eating.
                  Ah, that is right, Signor Montano! Is it the <emph>last</emph> time, my pretty
                  Violette?" to Violette and Montano, who were leading the old woman from her chair
                  to the oaken settle. "Come, sit by me, my child. Now we are all seated, we will
                  fill the cup, and drink 'Many happy years to Jean de Montagu!'"</p>
               <p>As if to mark the futility of the wish, the progress of the cup to the lip was
                  interrupted by an ominous sound; and forth from the thick barrier of shrubbery,
                  that fenced the northern side of the cottage, came twelve men, armed and
                  masked.</p>
               <p>"De Roucy! God help us!" shrieked Violette.</p>
               <p>"Seize her instantly, and off with her, as I bade ye!" cried a voice, that Montano
                  recognised as the Count de Roucy's.</p>
               <p>"Touch her at your peril, villain!" cried Montano, drawing his sword and shouting
                  for his attendants. Montano and Barante, the latter armed only with a club, kept
                  their assailants at bay till his men appeared, and they, inspired by their
                  master's example and adjurations, fought valiantly! but one, and then another of
                  their number fell, and the ruffians were two to one against Violette's defenders.
                  The rampart they had formed around her was diminishing. "Courage, my boys,
                  courage!" cried Barante, as he shot a glance at his children, crouching round his
                  old mother, motionless as panic-struck struck birds. "Courage! God and the Saints
                  are on our side!"</p>
               <p>"Beat them back, my men!" shouted Montano. Jean de Montagu will reward ye!"</p>
               <p>"Jean de Montagu!" retorted De Roucy, "his bones are cracking on the rack! Ah! I'm
                  wounded!—'tis but a scratch!—seize her, Le Croy!—press on, my men!—the prize is
                  ours!" But they, seeing their leader fall back, for an instant faltered.</p>
               <p>A thought, as if from Heaven, inspired Montano. De Roucy, to avoid giving warning
                  of his approach, had left his horses on the outer side of the wood. Montano's
                  attendants had, just before the onset of De Roucy's party, saddled their master's
                  horse, and led him to the gate of the court; there he was now standing, and the
                  passage from Violette to him unobstructed. Once on him and started, thought
                  Montano, she may escape. "Mount my horse, Violette," he cried, "fear nothing,—we
                  will keep them back,—Heaven guard you!" Violette shot from the circle, like an
                  arrow loosed from the bow, unfastened the horse, and sprang upon him. He had been
                  chafing and stamping, excited by the din of arms, and impatient of his position;
                  and, as she leaped into the saddle, he sprang forward, swift as an arrow from the
                  Tartar's bow. Violette heard the yell of the ruffians mingling with the victorious
                  shouts of her defenders. Once her eye caught the flash of their arms; but whether
                  they were retreating or still stationary, she knew not. She had no distinct
                  perception, no consciousness, but an intense desire to get on faster than even her
                  flying steed conveyed her. There were few persons on the road, though passing
                  through the immediate vicinity of a great city. Many of those, who cultivated the
                  environs of Paris, had their dwellings, for greater security,<pb n="318-319"
                     xml:id="VAC7726-00000159"/> within the walls; and, their working-day being
                  over, they had already retired within them. <ref rend="super" target="#note_007"

               <p>From a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">hostelrie,</foreign> where a party of cavaliers
                  were revelling, there were opposing shouts of "Stop!" and "God speed ye!" and, of
                  the straggling peasants returning from market, some crossed themselves, fancying
                  this aerial figure, with colourless face and golden hair streaming to the breeze,
                  was some demon in angelic form; and others knelt and murmured a prayer, believing
                  it was indeed an angel. She had just made a turn in the road, which brought her
                  within sight of Notre Dame and the gates of Paris, when she heard the trampling of
                  horses coming rapidly on behind her. Her horse too heard the sound, and, as if
                  conscious of his sacred trust and duty, redoubled his speed. The sounds approached
                  nearer and nearer, and now were lost in the triumphing shouts of her pursuers.
                  Violette's head became giddy; a sickening despair quivered through her frame. "We
                  have her now!" cried the foremost, and stretched his hand to grasp her rein. The
                  action gave a fresh impulse to her horse. He was within a few yards of the
                  barriers. He sprang forward, and in an instant was within the gates. "We are
                  balked!" cried the leader of the pursuit, reining in his horse; and pouring out a
                  volley of oaths, he ordered his men to retreat, saying, it was more than the head
                  of a follower of De Roucy was worth, to venture within the barriers. As the sounds
                  of the retiring party died away, Violette's horse slackened his speed, and was
                  arrested by the captain of the guard, who had just begun the patrol for the night.
                  To his questions Violette replied not a word. Her consciousness was gone, and
                  exhausted and fainting, she slid from the saddle into his arms. Fortunately he was
                  a humane man; he was touched with her youthful and lovely face; and, not knowing
                  to what other place of shelter and security to convey her, he procured a litter,
                  and carried her to his own humble home, where he consigned her to the care of his
                  good wife Susanne. There being then little provision for the security of private
                  property and individual rights, Montano's horse was classed among those
                     <emph>strays,</emph> that, in default of an owner, escheated to the King, and
                  was sent, by the guard, to the King's stables; and thus all clue to Montano was
                  lost.</p>
               <p>As soon as Violette recovered her consciousness, her first desire was to get news
                  of those whom she had left in extremest peril; and, as the readiest means of
                  effecting this, she entreated the compassionate woman, who was watching at her
                  bedside, to send her to the Grand-Master.</p>
               <p>"The Grand-Master!" replied the good dame; "Mary defend us! what would ye with
                  him?"</p>
               <p>Violette, in feeble accents, explained her relations with him, and her hope,
                  through him, to obtain news of her friends. Susanne answered her with mysterious
                  intimations, which implied, not only that he, whom she deemed her powerful
                  protector, could do nothing for her, but that it was not even safe to mention his
                  name; and then after promising her that a messenger should be despatched, in the
                  morning, to her father's cottage, she administered the common admonitions and
                  consolations, that seem so very wise and sufficient to the bestower,—are so futile
                  to the receiver. "She must hope for the best;"—"she must cast aside her
                  cares;"—"sleep would tranquillize her;"—"brighter hours might come with the<pb
                     n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7726-00000160"/> morning; but if they came not, she
                  might live to see what seemed worst now, to be best, and, at any rate, grieving
                  would not help her."</p>
               <p>Thus it has been from the time of Job's comforters to the present; words have been
                  spoken to the wretched, as impotent as the effort of the child, who stretching his
                  arm against a torrent, expects to hold it back! But, to do Dame Susanne justice,
                  she acted as well as spoke; and the next morning a messenger was sent, and
                  returned in due time with news, which no art could soften to Violette. Her
                  father's cottage was burned to the ground, and all about it laid waste. Some
                  peasants reported that they had seen the flames during the night, and men, armed
                  and mounted, conveying off whatever was portable, and driving before them
                  Barante's live stock. What had become of the poor man, his children, and old
                  mother, no one knew; but there were certain relics among the ashes, which too
                  surely indicated they had not all escaped. Poor Violette had strength neither of
                  body nor mind left, to sustain her under such intelligence. She was thrown into a
                  delirious fever, during which she raved continually about her murdered family and
                  Montano, who was never absent from her thoughts. But, whatever an individual
                  sufferer might feel, such scenes of marauding and violence were too common to
                  excite surprise. "Barante," it was said, "had but met at last the fate of all
                  those, who were fools enough to labor and heap up riches, for the idle and
                  powerful to covet and enjoy."</p>
               <p>This feeling was natural and just in the labouring classes, when the valets of
                  princes were legalized robbers, and were permitted, whenever their masters idle
                  followers were to be accommodated, not only to slay the working man's beeves, and
                  appropriate the produce of his fields, but to enter his house and sweep off the
                  blankets that covered him, and the pillows on which his children were sleeping.
                  Those, who fancy the world has made no moral progress, should read carefully the
                  history of past ages, and compare the condition of the labourers then, like so
                  many defenceless sheep on the borders of a forest filled with beasts of prey, to
                  the security and independence of our working sovereigns. They would find, that the
                  jurisdiction of that celebrated judge, who unites in his own person the threefold
                  power of judge, jury, and executioner, was then exercised by the armed and
                  powerful; that it was universal and unquestioned; whereas now, if he ventures his
                  summary application of <emph>Lynch law,</emph> his abuses are bruited from Maine
                  to Georgia, and men shake their heads and sigh over the deterioration of the
                  world, and the licentiousness of liberty!</p>
               <p>On the ninth day of her illness, while Susanne was standing by Violette, she awoke
                  from her first long sleep. Her countenance was changed, her flaming colour was
                  gone, and her eye was quiet. She feebly raised her head, and, bursting into tears,
                  said, "Oh, why did you not wake me sooner?"</p>
               <p>"Why should I wake you, dear?"</p>
               <p>"Why! do you not hear that dreadful bell?" The great bell of Notre Dame was
                  tolling. "They will be buried,—the boys and all,—all,—before I get there!"</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Dieu-merci,</foreign> child, your people are not going to
                  the burial;—that bell tolls not for such as yours and mine. We are thrown into the
                  earth, and Notre Dame wags not her proud tongue for us."</p>
               <p>"Ah, true,—true." She pressed her hand on her head, as if collecting her thoughts;
                  and then, looking up timidly and shrinking from the answer, she said, "Ye've heard
                  nothing of them?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing as yet; but you are better, and that's a token<pb n="322-323"
                     xml:id="VAC7726-00000161"/> of more good to follow. Now rest again. It is a
                  noisy day. All the world is abroad. It's the nobles' concern, not ours; so I pray
                  ye sleep again, and, whatever ye hear, lift not your head; there be throngs of bad
                  men in the street, and where such are, there may be ugly sights. I will go below,
                  and keep what quiet I can for ye."</p>
               <p>Susanne's dwelling was old and rickety. The apartment under that which Violette
                  occupied, was a little shop, where Dame Susanne vended cakes, candies, and common
                  toys. Violette could hear every sentence spoken there in an ordinary tone; but,
                  owing to Susanne's well-meant efforts, her ear caught only imperfect sentences,
                  such as follow.</p>
               <p>"Good day, Mistress Susanne! will you lend me a lookout from your window to see
                  the——"</p>
               <p>"Hush!"</p>
               <p>"They're coming, mother! they're coming!"</p>
               <p>"Hush!"</p>
               <p>"There are Burgundy's men first; ye'll know them, boy, by the cross of St. Andrew
                  on their bonnets; and there are the Armagnacs,—see their scarfs!"</p>
               <p>"Speak lower, please neighbour!"</p>
               <p>"It's well for them they have provided against a rescue;—the <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">bourgeois</foreign> are all for him,—every poor man's heart is
                  for him; for why? he was for every poor man's right; God reward him."</p>
               <p>"Pray speak a little lower, neighbour."</p>
               <p>"But is it not a shame, Dame Susanne? But ten days ago and all, save Burgundy,
                  were his friends, and now——"</p>
               <p>"There he is mother! see! see!"</p>
               <p>"They stop! oh, mother, see him show his broken joints! Mother! mother! how his
                  head hangs on one side! Curse on the rack, that cracked his bones asunder!"</p>
               <p>"Hush! I bid ye hush!"</p>
               <p>"Who can that goodly youth be, that stands close by his side? See, he is speaking
                  to him!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, he looks like an angel,—so full of pity, mother!</p>
               <p>"By St. Dominic, neighbour, the boy is right!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, mother, what eyes he has;—now he is looking up,—see!"</p>
               <p>"Hush!"</p>
               <p>"But look at them, Dame Susanne,—would ye not think the lamp of his soul was
                  shining through them?"</p>
               <p>"See him kiss the poor, broken hand, that hangs down so! God bless him! there's
                  true courage in that; and see those same lips, how they curl in scorn, as he turns
                  towards those fierce wretches! He is some stranger-youth. Whence is he, think ye,
                  Susanne?"</p>
               <p>"I think by the cut of his neckcloth, and the fashion of his head-gear," replied
                  Susanne, who for a moment forgot her caution, "he comes from
                  <emph>Italy.</emph>"</p>
               <p>The words were talismanic to Violette. She sprang from her bed to the window, and
                  the first object she saw amid a crowd was Montano; the second, her protector and
                  friend, Jean de Montagu, the Grand-Master. He was stretched on a hurdle, for the
                  torments of the rack had left him unable to sustain an upright position.
                  Violette's eye was riveted to the mutilated form of her good old master. Her soul
                  seemed resolved into one deep supplication; but not one word expressed its intense
                  emotions, so far did they "transcend the imperfect offices of prayer." Not one
                  treacherous glance wandered to her lover, till the procession moved; and then the
                  thought, that she was losing her last opportunity of being reunited to him, turned
                  the current of feeling, and suggested an expedient, which she immediately put into
                  execution.</p>
               <pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7726-00000162"/>
               <p>She had taken her white scarf, in her pocket, to the cottage, to show it to her
                  father; and through her delirium she had persisted in keeping it by her. She now
                  hung it in the window, in the hope, that, fluttering in the breeze, it might
                  attract Montano's eye. She watched him, but his attention was too fixed to be
                  diverted by any thing, certainly not by a device so girlish. The procession moved
                  on. The hurdle, and the stately figure beside it, were passing from her view. She
                  threw the casement open, and leaned out. The scaffold, erected at the end of the
                  street, struck her sight. She shrieked, fainted, and fell upon the floor. That one
                  moment gave the colour to her after-life. She had been seen, and marked,—and was
                  remembered.</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>The Duke of Burgundy had taken advantage of a moment, when Charles was but
                  partially recovered from a fit of insanity, to compass the Grand-Master's ruin.
                  The nobles had wept at Montagu's execution, but they had been consoled by the rich
                  spoils of his estate. There was no such balm for the sovereign; and it became a
                  matter of policy to get up some dramatic novelty to divert his mind, and prevent a
                  recurrence to the past, which might prove dangerous, even to Burgundy.
                  Accordingly, a new <emph>mystery</emph> was put in train for presentation, and one
                  month after the last act of Montagu's tragedy, and while his dishonoured body was
                  still attached to the gibbet of Montfauçon, the gay world of Paris assembled, to
                  witness the representation of a legend of a certain saint, called "The Espousals
                  of St. Thérèse."</p>
               <p>The seat over which the regal canopy was suspended, corresponded to our stage-box,
                  and afforded an access to the stage, that royalty might use at pleasure. The King
                  was surrounded by his own family. His wandering eye, his vacant laugh, and
                  incessant talking, betrayed the still disordered state of his mind; for when sane,
                  amidst a total destitution of talents and virtues, he had a certain affability of
                  manner, and the polish of conventional life, which, as his historian says,
                  acquired for him the "ridiculous title of <emph>well-beloved.</emph>'" On
                  Charles's right sat his Queen, Isabel of Bavaria, a woman remarkable for nothing
                  but excessive obesity, the gluttony that produced it, and the indolence consequent
                  upon it,—and one passion, avarice. But she was a branch of transmitted royalty—and
                  ruled by <emph>divine right!</emph> (And sovereigns, such as these, are, in some
                  men's estimation, <emph>rulers.</emph>) Behind the Queen, a place was left vacant
                  for the Duke of Orleans who, in consequence of a marvellous escape from death
                  during a thunder-storm, when his horses had plunged into the Seine, had vowed to
                  pay his creditors, and had, on that very day, bidden them to dinner, at which he
                  had promised the dessert should be a satisfaction of their debts. "So soon from
                  your dinner, my lord?" said his Duchess to him as he entered, with an expression
                  of face, which indicated a fear that all had not gone as she wished.</p>
               <p>"Yes. A short horse is soon curried."</p>
               <p>"What? Came they not? Surely of the eight hundred bidden, there were many who
                  would not do you such discredit, as to believe your virtue exhaled with the
                  shower?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, their faith was sufficient,—they came, every mother's son of them, butchers,
                  bakers, fruiterers, and all."</p>
               <p>"And you sent them away happy?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, with one of the beatitudes;—blessed are those who have nothing! I charged my
                  valets to turn them back<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7726-00000163"/> from my gate,
                  and to tell them, if they came again, they should be beaten off!"</p>
               <p>There was a general laugh through the box. The Duchess of Orleans alone turned
                  away with an expression of deep mortification. Valentine Visconti, daughter of the
                  Duke of Milan and Duchess of Orleans, was one of the most celebrated women of her
                  time. Her graceful beauty seemed the impersonation of her lovely land—something
                  quite foreign to the French court. As she sat by the gross queen, she inspired the
                  idea of what humanity might become, when invested with the "glorified body" of the
                  Saints. Her soul beamed with almost preternatural lustre from her eyes, and spoke
                  in the musical accents of her beautiful lips. Her gentleness and sympathy, more
                  than the intellectual power and accomplishments, that signalized her amidst a
                  brutified and ignorant race, gave her an ascendency over the mad King, which
                  afforded some colour to the wicked imaginations of those who, in the end, accused
                  her of sorcery!—an accusation very common against the Italians of that period,
                  whose superior civilization and science were attributed to the diabolical arts of
                  magic. The secret of Valentine's power over the maniac King has been discovered
                  and illustrated by modern benevolence. She could lead him like a little child,
                  when, for months, he would not consent to be washed or dressed, and when these
                  offices were performed at night by ten men, masked, lest, when their sovereign
                  recovered all the reason he ever possessed, he should cause them to be hung for
                  this act of necessary violence!</p>
               <p>The spectators, while awaiting the rising of the curtain, were exchanging the
                  usual observations and salutations. "Valentine," whispered the beautiful young
                  wife of the old Duke of Berri, "did not that man,—<foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon
                     Dieu,</foreign> how beautiful he is!—who stands near the musicians, kiss his
                  hand to you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes,—he is my countryman."</p>
               <p>"I thought so;—he looks as if the blood of all your proud old nobles ran in his
                  veins;—the Confalonieris, Sforzas, Viscontis, and Heaven knows who."</p>
               <p>"He has a loftier nobility than theirs, my cousin; his charter is direct from
                  Heaven, and written by the finger of Heaven on his noble countenance. As to this
                  world's honours, he boasts none but such as the son of a rich and skilful weaver
                  of silks may claim."</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Mon Dieu!</foreign> is it possible; he is a counterfeit,
                  that well might pass in any King's exchequer. But he looks sad and abstracted,
                  and, seeing, seemeth as though he saw not. Know ye, cousin, what aileth him?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, but it is a long tale; the lady of his thoughts has strangely disappeared,
                  and, though for more than a month he has sought her, day and night, he hath, as
                  yet, no trace of her. He has come hither to-night at my bidding, for I deeply pity
                  the poor youth, and would fain divert his mind;—but soft,—the curtain is
                  rising!"</p>
               <p>"Pray tell me what means this scene, Valentine?"</p>
               <p>"It is the interior of a chapel. You know this legend of St. Thérèse?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed I do not. I cannot read, and my confessor never told it to me."</p>
               <p>"She was betrothed to one she loved. The preparations were made for the espousals,
                  when, on the night before her marriage, she saw, in vision, St. Francis, who bade
                  her renounce her lover, and told her, that she was the elected bride of Heaven;
                  that she must repair to the convent of the Sisters of Charity, and there resign
                  the world, and abjure its sinful passions. You now see her obedient to the
                  miraculous visitation. She has concluded her novitiate. One weakness she<pb
                     n="328-329" xml:id="VAC7726-00000164"/> has as yet indulged. She has secretly
                  retained the last gift of her betrothed. Hark! there you hear the vesper-bell. She
                  is coming to deposit it at that shrine, yonder."</p>
               <p>A female now entered, closely veiled and clad in a full, gray stuff dress, that
                  concealed every line of her person. She held something in her hands, which were
                  folded on her bosom, and walking, with faltering steps, across the stage to the
                  shrine, knelt and made the accustomed signs and prayer. She then rose, and raising
                  the little roll to her lips, kissed it fervently, and then, as if asking pardon
                  for this involuntary weakness, again dropped on her <choice>
                     <sic>kness</sic>
                     <corr>knees</corr>
                  </choice>, and depositing the roll, withdrew. It would seem, she had entered
                  completely into the tender regrets of the young saint she impersonated, for a tear
                  she had dropped on the last bequest of the lover was seen, as it caught and
                  reflected the lamp's rays. Immediately, through an open window in the ceiling, a
                  dove entered, the symbol of the Holy Spirit. It was not uncommon, in these
                  mysteries, to bring the sacred persons of the Trinity upon the scene. The bird
                  descended, and took the roll in his bill. As he rose with it, it unfolded, and the
                     <emph>white silk scarf,</emph> given to poor Violette, represented the last
                  earthly treasure of Saint Thérèse. The dove made three evolutions in his ascent,
                  and disappeared. While the cries of "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Bravo! Bravissimo!
                     Petit oiseau! Jolie colombe!</foreign>" were resounding through the house, the
                  Duchess de Berri whispered to Valentine, "See your compatriot! he looks as if he
                  would spring upon the stage! how deadly pale! and his eyes! blessed Mary! they are
                  like living fires! Surely he is going mad!"</p>
               <p>"Heaven help him!" replied the gentle Valentine. "I erred in counselling him to
                  come hither! Would I could speak with him."</p>
               <p>"Never mind him now, cousin; the scene is changing;—tell me, what comes next?"</p>
               <p>"Next you will see St. Thérèse praying before her crucifix,—ah, there she is!
                  there is the coffin in which she sleeps at night,—there the death's-head she
                  contemplates all day."</p>
               <p>"Shocking! shocking! I never would be a nun."</p>
               <p>"It is but for the last days of her penitence. After her vows are made, she, like
                  all her order, will be devoted to nursing the sick, and succouring the wretched,—a
                  happier life than ours, my cousin!"</p>
               <p>"Think ye so? Methinks the next world will be soon enough to be a saint, and do
                  much tiresome good deeds. But why has she that ugly mantle drawn over her head, so
                  that one cannot see her hair, or the form of her neck and shoulders?"</p>
               <p>"Be not so impatient. You see the door behind her. The Devil is coming into her
                  cell under the form of her lover. Ah, there he is!"</p>
               <p>"Bless my heart, if I were the Devil, I would never leave that goodly form again.
                  Now she'll turn! now we shall see her face! Pshaw! she has pulled that ugly mantle
                  over, for a veil."</p>
               <p>"Pray be still, cousin;—this is her last temptation. I would not lose a word.
                  Listen,—hear how she resists the prince of darkness."</p>
               <p>The pretended lover performed his part so as to do honour to the supernatural
                  power he represented. At first, he would have embraced the saint; but she shrunk
                  from him, and, reverently placing her hand on the crucifix, stood statue-like
                  against the wall. He then knelt and poured out his passion vehemently. He reminded
                  her of their early<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7726-00000165"/> love,—of the home,
                  where he had wooed and won her; he besought her to speak to him,—once to withdraw
                  her veil, and look at him. She was still silent and immovable. He described the
                  wearisome and frigid existence of a conventual life, and then painted, in
                  passionate words, the happiness that awaited him, if she would but keep her first
                  vow, made to him. He told her, that horses awaited them at the outward gate. The
                  force of the temptation now became apparent. The weak, loving girl, was triumphing
                  over the saint. Her head dropped on her bosom, her whole frame trembled, and was
                  sinking. Her lover saw his triumph and sprang forward to seize her. But her virtue
                  was re-nerved; she grasped the crucifix, and looking up to a picture of the
                  Virgin, shrieked, "Mary, blessed mother! aid me!"</p>
               <p>The Evil One extended his arm to wrest the crucifix, when, smitten by its holy
                  virtue, he sunk through the floor, enveloped in flames. The saint again fell on
                  her knees, the dove again descended and fluttered around her, and the curtain
                  fell.</p>
               <p>In those days, when conventual life had lost nothing of its sacredness, and men's
                  minds were still subjected to a belief in the visible interference of good and
                  evil spirits in men's concerns, such a scene was most effective. The spectators
                  were awed; not a sound was heard, till the Duchess of Berri, never long abstracted
                  from the actual world, whispered, "Valentine, did you see your Italian when she
                  shrieked; how he struck his hand upon his head! and see him now, what a colour in
                  his cheek! He will certainly go mad, and, knowing you, he may dart hither before
                  we can avoid him. Will ye not ask Orleans to order those men at arms to conduct
                  him out?—you know," in a whisper, "I have such a horror of madmen."</p>
               <p>"You need have none, believe me, in this case. My poor countryman is suffering
                  from watching and exhaustion, and his imagination is easily excited. The next
                  scene will calm him. The saint, victorious over the most importunate of mortal
                  passions, will resolutely make her vows, and receive the veil."</p>
               <p>"Oh, then we shall see her face, after all?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and with all the factitious charm that dress and ornament can lend it; for,
                  to render her renunciation of the world more striking, she is to appear in a
                  bridal dress, decked with the vanities that we women cling last to;—but hush! the
                  curtain is rising!"</p>
               <p>The curtain rose, and discovered the chapel of a convent. The nuns and their
                  superior stood on one side, a priest and attendants on the other. A golden
                  crucifix was placed in the centre, with a figure of the Saviour, as large as life.
                  Before this, St. Thérèse was kneeling. Her dress was white silk, embroidered with
                  pearls, with a full sleeve, looped to the shoulder with pearls. A few symbolical
                  orange-buds drooped over her forehead, certainly not whiter than the brow on which
                  they rested. Her hair was parted in front, and drawn up behind in a Grecian knot
                  of rich curls, and fastened there with a diamond cross. She was pale as monumental
                  marble; her eyes not raised to Heaven, but riveted to earth, as if she were still
                  clinging to the parting friend. The priest advanced to cut off her hair, the last
                  office previous to investing her with the gray gown and fatal veil. As he
                  unfastened the diamond cross, her bright tresses fell over her neck and shoulders,
                  and, reaching even to the ground, gave the finishing touch to her beauty, and
                  called forth a general shout of "Beautiful! beautiful! most beautiful!"</p>
               <p>Over every other voice, and soon stilling every other, was heard the King's, and,
                  seized with an access of madness, he<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7726-00000166"/>
                  rushed upon the stage clapping his hands and screaming, "She is mine! my bride!
                  Out with ye, ugly nuns! She is mine! mine!" Each reiteration was followed by a
                  maniac yell.</p>
               <p>"Nay, she is mine! my own Violette! my betrothed wife!" interposed Montano,
                  springing forward and encircling Violette with one arm, while he repelled Charles
                  with the other.</p>
               <p>A general rising followed. The stage was filled with the nobles, rushing forward
                  to chastise the stranger who had presumed to lay his hands on sacred majesty. A
                  hundred weapons were drawn, and pointed at Montano. There was a Babel confusion of
                  sounds. At this crisis, Valentine penetrated into the midst of the <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">mêlée,</foreign> whispering, as she passed Montano, "Be quiet—be
                  prudent—leave all to me."</p>
               <p>The lords, who had more than once seen her power over the madness of their
                  sovereign, fell back. She placed herself between the King and Montano, and putting
                  her hand soothingly on Charles, she said, with a smile, "Methinks, my lord King,
                  we are all beside ourselves with this bewitching show,—we know not who or what we
                  are. Here is a churl hath dared to come between the King and his subject, and you,
                  my sovereign," (in a whisper), "have strangely forgotten your Queen's presence.
                  Unhand that maiden, sir stranger. Kneel, my child, to your gracious sovereign, and
                  let him see you loyally hold yourself at his disposal." Violette mechanically
                  obeyed.</p>
               <p>"Nay, my pretty one, kneel not," said Charles, still wild, but no longer violent.
                  "Ah, I had forgot! here are the bridal orange-buds. Come, come, you lazy
                  priest,—come marry us!" Violette looked as if she would fain again take refuge in
                  Montano's arms.</p>
               <p>"To-morrow, my lord King, will surely be soon enough," whispered Valentine with a
                  confidential air, and, pointing to Isabel, she added, "it would not seem well to
                  have the rites performed in her presence!" The Queen, with characteristic
                  nonchalance, had remained quietly in her place, where she seemed quite absorbed in
                  devouring a bunch of delicious grapes.</p>
               <p>"You are right, <emph>dear sister,</emph>" replied the King,—thus, in his softened
                  moods, he always addressed Valentine,—"it is not according to church rule to marry
                  one wife in presence of another!" He then burst into a peal of idiotic laughter,
                  which, after continuing for some moments, left him in a state of imbecility, so
                  nearly approaching to unconsciousness, that he was conveyed to his palace without
                  making the slightest resistance.</p>
               <p>A general movement followed the King's departure, and cries rose, that the
                  stranger must be manacled and conveyed to prison. The Duchess of Orleans
                  interposed. "My lords," she said, "I pray ye give this youth into my charge. He is
                  my countryman. I will be responsible for him to our gracious sovereign." There
                  were murmurings of hesitation and discontent. "In sooth, my lords," added
                  Valentine, "ye should not add an injustice to a stranger to our usages, to the
                  error you have already committed this night, in bringing our royal master, but
                  half recovered from his malady, into this heated atmosphere and exciting scene;—it
                  were well, if we can avoid it, to preserve no memorials of this night's
                  imprudence." This last hint effected what an appeal to their justice had failed to
                  obtain, and the lords permitted Montano unmolested to withdraw with the Duchess of
                  Orleans.</p>
               <p>Intent on making those happy, who <emph>could</emph> be happy, Valentine bade
                  Montano and Violette attend her to her carriage. After weeping with joy on her
                  lover's bosom, Violette's first<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC7726-00000167"/> words
                  were, "My father,—my brothers, Montano, can ye tell me aught of them?"</p>
               <p>"They are safe,—safe and well, in all save their ignorance of you, dear Violette,"
                  replied Montano; "and by this time are they arrived in my happy country."</p>
               <p>"Thank God!—and my dear old grandmother?"</p>
               <p>"Nay, ask no farther to-night."</p>
               <p>"Better it is, my good friend," said Valentine, "to satisfy her inquiry now, while
                  her cup is full and sparkling with joy;—you can bear, my child, patiently a single
                  bitter drop?"</p>
               <p>"She was murdered, then?"</p>
               <p>"She is at rest, my child,—you may weep,—we should weep for the good and
                  kind."</p>
               <p>Before the little party separated for the night, Violette explained, that in
                  consequence of having been seen at the window on the day of Montagu's execution,
                  she had been sought out by the managers of the mystery, and compelled, in the
                  King's name, to obey their behests.</p>
               <p>"And to-morrow," said Valentine, "ye shall obey mine. I, too, will be the manager
                  of a mystery, and real espousals shall be enacted by Montano and Violette; then,
                  ho! for my happy country."</p>

                  <p>INVENTION need not be taxed for incidents fitted to touch the heart, nor need
                     they be heightened with the dyes of romance. The daily life of our own cities
                     abounds in events over which, if there be tears in heaven, surely the angels
                     weep. It is not to draw tears, which flow too easily from susceptible young
                     readers, that the following circumstances are related, but to set forth dangers
                     to which many are exposed, and vices which steep the life God has given as a
                     blessing, in dishonour, misery, and remorse.</p>
                  <p>A few years since, there lived on the east side of our city, where cheap and
                     wretched residences abound, one Sara Hyat. Sara was a widow, not young, nor
                     pretty, nor delicate, with none of the elements of romantic interest; but old,
                     tall, angular, and coarse, with a face roughened by hardship, sharpened by
                     time, and channeled by sorrow. Her voice was harsh, and her<pb n="336-337"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000168"/> manner ungracious. There was one, and but one
                     sign, and that a faint one, that she might once have partaken the weaknesses of
                     her sex. She wore that hideous supplement to the hair which women call "a
                     foretop," and not being very exact in the adjustment of her cap, the
                     juxtaposition of the foxy auburn exotic and the indigenous silver hairs set off
                     this little lingering of vanity rather strikingly.</p>
                  <p>But as all is not gold that glitters, and beauty is but skin deep, and under a
                     rough shell is often found excellent meat; so under Mrs. Hyat's rough exterior,
                     there were strong common sense, a spirit of rectitude, a good conscience, and
                     affections that the rough usage of the world had not abated. These had attached
                     her with devotion and self-sacrifice to one object after another, as the
                     relations of life had changed, first binding her in loving duty to her parents
                     and sisters, then to her husband and children, and finally, when, one after
                     another, they had dropped into the grave, settling on the only one in whose
                     veins a drop of her blood ran, a little orphan grandniece.</p>
                  <p>"A sweeter thing they could not light upon." Go with us up a crazy staircase,
                     at the extremity of Houston Street. If you chance to look in at the door of the
                     rooms you pass, you will see,—it being Sunday,—an entire Irish family, father,
                     mother, half-a-dozen children, more or less, with a due allowance of cousins,
                     all plump, rosy, and thriving (in the teeth of the physical laws) on plenty of
                     heterogeneous food, and superfluity of dirt. On entering Mrs. Hyat's rooms, you
                     are in another country; the tenants are obviously Americans: it is so orderly,
                     quiet, and cleanly, and rather anti-social. There are only an old woman and a
                     little girl; the bud of springtime, and the seared leaf of autumn. The only
                     dirt in the room (you almost wonder the old woman tolerates it there) is in two
                     flower-pots in the window, whence a white jessamine, and a tea-rose diffuse
                     their sweet odours.</p>
                  <p>A table is decently spread for the mongrel meal that our people call supper,
                     which blends the substantial food of dinner, with the aromatic tea, and its
                     sweet accompaniments of pastry, cake, or preserves. The tea-kettle is hissing
                     on the stove, and a pie is warming there. The old woman sits in her
                     rocking-chair, weaving backwards and forwards, reading a time-discoloured
                     letter, while a little girl (the only thing in harmony with the rose and
                     jessamine in the window), laying aside a tract she is reading, says, "Aunt
                     Sara, don't you know every word in that letter by heart? I do."</p>

                              <p>"I am clean discouraged. It seems as if Providence crowded on me.
                                 There is black disappointment, turn which way I will. I have had an
                                 offer to go to Orleans, and part pay beforehand, which same I send
                                 you herewith.</p>
                              <p>"Selina's time draws near, and it is the only way I have to
                                 provide; so dear Aunt Sara, I think it my duty to go. I can't
                                 summon courage to bid you good-bye. I can't speak a word to her. I
                                 should not be a man again in a month if I tried. You have been a
                                 mother to me, Aunt Sara, and if God spares my life, I'll be a
                                 dutiful son to you in the place of them that's gone. If any thing
                                 happens to my poor wife, you will see to my child, I know,</p>

                  <p>"I declare Fanny, you have said it right, date and all, and what a date it was
                     to me, that 25th of September:—that<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC7726-00000169"/>
                     day your father sailed—that very day you were born—and that very day, when the
                     tide went out, your mother died;—life coming—life going—and the dear life of my
                     last boy launched on the wide sea. <emph>My</emph> boy I always called your
                     father; he was like my own sons to me. He lived just one week after he got to
                     Orleans, and the news came Evacuation Day. We have always been, that is, the
                     Rankin side, a dreadful family for dying young—all but me. I've lived to follow
                     all my folks to the grave. My three boys I have seen laid in the ground; full
                     grown, six feet men, and here I am, my strength failing, my eyes dim, working,
                     shivering, trembling on."</p>
                  <p>Poor little Fanny shivered too, and putting some more wood into the stove, she
                     asked her aunt if it were not time for supper; but Mrs. Hyat, without hearing
                     her, went on, rather talking to herself, than the child. "There has always been
                     something notable about times and seasons, with our folks. I was born the day
                     the revolutionary war was declared—my oldest was born the day Washington died;
                     my youngest sister, your grandmother, Fanny, died the day of the Total Eclipse;
                     my husband died the day that last pesky little war was declared; your father
                     saw your mother the first time 'lumination night, and as I said, it was
                     Evacuation Day, we got the news of his death; poor Jemmy! what a dutiful boy he
                     was to me! half my life went with his! How that letter is printed on your
                     memory, Fanny! But you have better learning than ever I had, and that makes the
                     difference! Learning is not all though, Fanny; you must have prudence. Did I
                     not hear you talking on the stairs yesterday with some of them Irish
                     cattle?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, aunt, I was thanking Mrs. O'Roorke for bringing up my pail of water for
                     me."</p>
                  <p>"That was not it, 'twas a racket with the children I heard." Fanny made no
                     reply. "I won't have it, Fanny; you're no company for Irish, and never shall
                     be; the Lord made 'em to be sure, that is all you can say for 'em—you can
                     scarce call them human creturs."</p>
                  <p>"They are very kind, Aunt Sara."</p>
                  <p>"So are dogs kind, Fanny. I have moved, and moved, and moved to get into a
                     house free of them, but they are <emph>varmint,</emph> and there is no getting
                     away from them. It's the Lord's will that they should overrun us like frogs and
                     locusts, and must be; but I'll have no right-hand of fellowship with them.
                     There I have set down my foot. Now, child, tell me what was all that hurry
                     skurry about."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Hyat gave Fanny small encouragement to communicate a scene in which the
                     banned Irish were the principal actors. But after a little struggle, her sense
                     of justice to them overcame her dread of the old woman's prejudices, and she
                     told the true story.</p>
                  <p>"The overseer at the new buildings gave me leave to bring my basket again for
                     kindlings. Pat and Ellen O'Roorke were there before me, and they picked out all
                     the best bits and put them into my basket, and it was pretty heavy, and Pat
                     would bring it home for me; he was so kind, how could I huff him, Aunt Sara?
                     but I was afraid you would see him, that was the truth, and I wanted to take
                     the basket before we got to the house; so I ran across the street after him,
                     and there was a young gentleman driving a beautiful carriage, with a servant
                     beside him, and another behind, and one of the horses just brushed against me
                     and knocked me over. Pat and Ellen were frightened, and mad too, and Pat swore,
                     and Ellen screamed, and the gentleman stopped, and the man behind jumped off
                     and came to us, and Pat kicked him, and he struck Pat, and the gentleman got
                     out and stopped<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC7726-00000170"/> the fight, and said
                     he was very sorry, and offered Pat money, and Pat would not touch it. The Irish
                     have some high feelings, aunt, for all; and I am sure they are kind as kind can
                     be."</p>
                  <p>"Well, well, go on; did the gentleman say any thing to you?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, aunt; he saw there was a little blood on my cheek, and he took off my
                     bonnet and turned off my hair; it was but a little bruised—and—and—"</p>
                  <p>"<emph>And, and,</emph> and what, child?"</p>
                  <p>"Nothing, aunt, only he wiped off the place with his pocket handkerchief,
                     and—kissed it."</p>
                  <p>"It's the last time you shall stir outside the door, Fanny, without me."</p>
                  <p>"Aunt Sara! I am sure he meant no harm, he was a beautiful gentleman."</p>
                  <p>"Beautiful, indeed! Did he say any thing more to you?"</p>
                  <p>"He said something about my hair being—looking—pretty, and he cut off a lock
                     with my scissors that you hung at my side yesterday, and he—he put it in his
                     bosom." As Fanny finished, there was a tap at the door, and on opening it, she
                     recognized the liveried footman of her admirer. In one hand he held a highly
                     ornamented bird-cage containing a canary, and in the other a paper parcel.</p>
                  <p>"The gentleman as had the misfortune to knock you down yesterday, sends you
                     these," he said, smiling at Fanny; and setting them down on the table, he
                     withdrew.</p>
                  <p>Fanny was enchanted. "The very thing I always wanted," she exclaimed. The
                     little singing bird began at once to cheer her solitude, to break with its
                     sweet notes the heavy monotony of her day, to chime in harmony with the happy
                     voice of her childhood. While Fanny, forgetting her supper and the paper
                     parcel, was trying to quiet the frightened fluttering of the timid little
                     stranger, Mrs. Hyat, lost in a reverie of perplexity and anxiety, was revolving
                     Fanny's adventure and its consequences; a world of dangers that must beset the
                     poor girl, when, as in the course of nature it soon must be, her protection was
                     withdrawn, were all at once revealed to her.</p>
                  <p>Fanny was just thirteen, and the extreme beauty that had marked her childhood,
                     instead of passing away with it, was every day developing and ripening. Her
                     features were symmetrical, and of that order which is called aristocratic, and
                     so they were, of nature's aristocracy; if that be so which is reserved for her
                     rarest productions. Her completion was fair and soft as the rose-leaf, and the
                     colour, ever varying on her cheek, ever mounting and subsiding, with the flow
                     and ebb of feeling; her hair was singularly beautiful, rich and curling, and
                     though quite dark, reflecting, when the light fell on it, a ruddy glow.</p>
                  <p>"If she looked like other children," thought Sara Hyat, as her eye rested on
                     Fanny, "she might have been thrown down and had both her legs broken, and that
                     young spark would never have troubled himself about her. If it had but pleased
                     God to give her her grandfather's bottled nose, or her father's little gray
                     twinkling eyes; or if she had favoured any of the Floods, or looked like any of
                     the Rankins—except her poor mother. But what a picture of a face to throw a
                     poor girl with, alone, among the wolves and foxes of this wicked city. Oh, that
                     men were men, and not beasts of prey!</p>
                  <p>"Fanny—Fanny—child"—the old woman's voice trembled, but there was an
                     earnestness in it that impressed each word as she uttered it, "mark my words,
                     and one of these days,<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC7726-00000171"/> when I am
                     dead, and gone, you will remember them; God gives beauty, Fanny, for a trial to
                     some, and a temptation to others. That's all the use I could ever see in it; to
                     be sure, its a pretty thing to look upon, but its just like a rose; by the time
                     it is blowed out it begins to fade. Now do leave that bird-cage one minute and
                     listen to me. This is what I want you to remember," proceeded the old woman,
                     with more earnestness and stronger emphasis, "when men follow you, and flatter
                     you, turn a deaf ear, Fanny; pay no kind of attention to them, and if they
                     persevere, fly away from them as you would from rats."</p>
                  <p>"Aunt Sara! I don't know what you mean?"</p>
                  <p>"The time will come when I can make my meaning plainer; for the present it is
                     enough for you to know, that you must not listen to fine <choice>
                        <sic>dressde</sic>
                        <corr>dressed</corr>
                     </choice> men; that you must not take presents from them; that you must go
                     straight to school and come straight home from it, and say nothing to nobody.
                     If ever I get the money that good-for-nothing Martin owes me for work done four
                     years ago, I'll buy you a bird, Fanny; but if you can get a chance, you must
                     send this back where it came from."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Aunt Sara! must I?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes. What is in that paper? Untie it."</p>
                  <p>Fanny untied it. It enveloped a quantity of bird seed, and a dainty basket
                     filled with French bonbons. Fanny involuntarily smiled, and then looked towards
                     her aunt, as if to ask her if she might smile. The cloud on the old lady's brow
                     lowered more and more heavily, and Fanny said timidly—</p>
                  <p>"Must I send these back too, aunt, or may I give them to Pat and Ellen? I won't
                     eat any myself."</p>
                  <p>"You are a good child, Fanny, and docile. Yes, you may go down and hand them
                     in, and don't stay talking with them; and mind again, if ever an opportunity
                     comes, the bird goes back."</p>
                  <p>Fanny could not, for her life, see the harm of keeping the bird; it seemed to
                     her that the gentleman was very kind, but the possibility of disobedience to
                     her aunt, or of contending with her, did not occur to her. She knew, and that
                     was enough to know, that her aunt indulged her whenever she thought indulgence
                     right, and that she strained every nerve for her. Her wishes were not as easily
                     subdued as her will, and each day as she grew more in love with her canary,
                     they became stronger and stronger, that the opportunity might never come to
                     send them away.</p>
                  <p>But come it did. The following Thursday was Christmas day, a holiday of course
                     to Fanny, but none to Mrs. Hyat, who, having been strictly bred a Presbyterian,
                     held in sectarian disdain even this dearest and most legitimate of
                     holidays.</p>
                  <p>She was doing the daily task by which she earned her bread, making coarse
                     garments for a neighbouring slop-shop. Fanny had done up the house-work, and
                     put the room into that holiday order which is to the poor what fine furniture
                     and fancy decorations are to the rich. She had fed her canary bird, and talked
                     to it, and read through the last tract left at the door, and she was sitting
                     gazing out of the window, thinking how happy the people must be who rode by in
                     their carriages, and wondering, as she saw dolls, baby-houses and hobby-horses,
                     carried by, where all the children could live who got these fine presents.
                     "There is nobody to send me one," she thought. As if in answer to her thought,
                     there was a tap at the door, and the well-known liveried footman appeared with
                     a huge paper parcel.</p>
                  <p>Fanny's rose-coloured cheek deepened to crimson. Mrs.<pb n="344-345"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000172"/> Hyat surveyed the lad from head to foot, and
                     nodding to Fanny, asked, "Is it he?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, aunt."</p>
                  <p>"It's something for you, miss," said the footman, advancing, and about to
                     deposit a parcel on the table before Mrs. Hyat; "it's Christmas day, old lady,"
                     he added pertly; "a nice day for young people as has red cheeks and bright
                     eyes."</p>
                  <p>"Hum! you need not take the trouble to set that thing down here."</p>
                  <p>"We'll ma'am, here will do just as well," he said, placing it on the
                     bureau.</p>
                  <p>"Nor there, either, young man;" but he, without heeding her, had already untied
                     the parcel, and displayed to Fanny's enraptured eyes a rosewood work-box, with
                     brilliant lining of crimson velvet, and fittings of steel and silver utensils.
                     It was but a single glance that Fanny gave them, for she remembered the goods
                     were contraband, and she averted her eyes and cast them down.</p>
                  <p>"Tie the thing up, and take it where it came from," said Mrs. Hyat. "What is
                     your master's name?"</p>
                  <p>"The gentleman as employs me is Mr. Nugent Stafford, Esquire."</p>
                  <p>"Where does he live?"</p>
                  <p>"At the Astor House."</p>
                  <p>"Give him the bird, Fanny."</p>
                  <p>Poor little Fanny obeyed, but with a trembling hand and tearful eye. The little
                     bird had been a bright spirit in her dead daily life. "Take them all back,"
                     continued Mrs. Hyat, "and tell Mr. What's-his-name? that such fine things are
                     for fine people: that we are poor and honest, and plain-spoken, and if he is a
                     real friend to us, he'll leave us to eat the bread of our own earning, without
                     disturbing our minds with things that's no way suited to us."</p>
                  <p>The footman and Fanny stood a little behind Mrs. Hyat, and he taking advantage
                     of her deafness, shrugged his shoulders, saying, "Crusty, crusty"—and adding,
                     with a diabolical prescience fitting the school in which his master bred him,
                     "if ever you hear a whistle under your window, three times repeated, come
                     down."</p>
                  <p>"What are you waiting for? you've got your message, man."</p>
                  <p>"I was waiting for your second thoughts, old lady."</p>
                  <p>"I've given you my first thoughts, and I'm not one that thinks my thoughts
                     twice over, so you may go to Mr. What-do-you-call-him? as quick as you please."
                     The man departed, bowing and kissing his hand to Fanny, as he shut the door.
                     "What said the fellow to you?" asked her aunt, who had heard, as deaf people
                     generally hear, what is meant not to reach their ears.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, aunt," replied Fanny, "he said something about your being crusty."</p>
                  <p>Most unfortunately, and for the first time in her life, she dealt unfairly by
                     her aunt. Sincerity is the compass of life; there is no safe sailing without
                     it. The poor child was perplexed. Stafford's gifts had charmed her. She did not
                     see clearly why they were rejected. She was already filled with vain longings
                     for some variation of her dull existence; and she was but thirteen years old!
                     Seldom have thirteen years of human life passed with a more stainless record.
                     To do her duty, to be quiet, industrious, and true, from being Fanny's
                     instinct, had become her habit. The fountain of her affections had never yet
                     been unsealed. Was that well-spring<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC7726-00000173"/>
                     of everlasting life to be poisoned? She had committed her first deceit, poor
                     child!</p>
                  <p>We have gone too much into detail, we must limit ourselves to the most striking
                     particulars of our story.</p>
                  <p>A year passed. Christmas came again, and the day wore drearily away. "Mr.
                     Stafford has forgotten me," sighed Fanny in her inmost heart, as she remembered
                     her last Christmas gift.</p>
                  <p>"That flushy fellow, with his yellow cape and cuffs, won't trouble us again,
                     I'm thinking," said Mrs. Hyat. The day deepened into twilight;—Fanny heard a
                     whistle—she started—it was repeated, and again repeated. She drew near to her
                     aunt as if for defence, and sat down by her, her heart throbbing. After a few
                     minutes, there were again three whistles, still she sat resolutely still.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Hyat laid down her slop-sewing, wiped her spectacles, and heaving a deep
                     sigh, said, "I grow blinder and blinder, but I won't murmur as long as it
                     pleases God that I may earn honest bread for you and me, Fanny." Fanny looked
                     up, and her aunt saw there were tears in her eyes. "Poor child," she continued,
                     "it is not a merry Christmas you are having." The whistle was again repeated.
                     "Go to the baker's, Fanny, and buy us a mince-pie—it won't break us; I can pay
                     for it, if I work till twelve to-night, and it will seem more like Christmas to
                     you."</p>
                  <p>Again Fanny heard the whistle; the opportunity was too tempting to be resisted,
                     and Fanny threw a shawl over her head and ran down stairs. A man wrapped in a
                     cloak had just passed the door; he turned back at the sound of her footsteps,
                     threw his arms around her, and kissed her cheek. She sprung up the door-step,
                     but he gently detained her, and she, looking up in his face, saw that it was
                     Stafford himself, and not, as she supposed, his servant.</p>
                  <p>"Why do you run away from me?" he said, in a low, sweet voice; "how have I
                     frightened you? Am I not your friend? None can feel a greater interest in you.
                     I will prove it in any way that I can."</p>
                  <p>Fanny's instincts directed her aright, and fixing her beautiful eyes on him,
                     she said, "Come up, then, and say to my aunt what you say to me."</p>
                  <p>She did not understand the smile that lurked on Stafford's lips as he replied,
                     "No, your aunt, for some reason, I am sure I cannot tell what, has taken a
                     dislike to me; you know she has, for she will not permit you to receive the
                     slightest gift from me. Come, you were going out, walk along, and let me walk
                     by you." He slid his arm around her waist; she shrunk from him, and he withdrew
                     it. "How old are you, Fanny McDermot? You perceive I know your name; and I know
                     much more concerning you, that you would not suspect."</p>
                  <p>"Oh! Mr. Stafford, how should you know about me? I am fourteen, and a little
                     more."</p>
                  <p>"Only fourteen? Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen will soon come, and each year, each
                     month, you are growing more and more beautiful. Fanny, I dream of you every
                     night of my life; and when I wake, my first thought of you is, 'I cannot see
                     her—I cannot speak to her.'"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Stafford?"</p>
                  <p>"It is true, Fanny, true as that the beautiful moon is shining on us. Why
                     should it not be true? It is unnecessary, it is cruel, that you should be shut
                     up in that forlorn old house with that old house with that old woman,"—the 'old
                     woman' grated on Fanny's ear, but she did not interrupt Stafford, and he
                     continued, "Do you like riding, or sailing?"</p>
                  <pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7726-00000174"/>
                  <p>"I never rode but once, and that was to Uncle Ben's funeral, and I was never in
                     a boat in my life."</p>
                  <p>"Come then on Monday, Fanny, at twelve o'clock, to the corner of Grand and
                     Essex streets. I will be there, in a hackney coach, and I will take you a ride
                     just as long, or as short as you please; and when spring comes, you shall go
                     out with me in my boat by moonlight. I often pass an evening in rowing about
                     the harbor, and I should take such pleasure in pleasing you."</p>
                  <p>"But, Mr. Stafford, Aunt Sara would never give me leave—never in the
                     world."</p>
                  <p>"Do not ask her: how is she to know?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, I must tell her. I tell her every thing, and I never leave her but to go
                     to school."</p>
                  <p>"And how is she to know that you are not at school?"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Stafford, do you think I would deceive my Aunt Sara? No,
                     never,—never."</p>
                  <p>They had arrived at the baker's shop. Fanny turned to enter it, and faltered
                     out a "good night, sir."</p>
                  <p>"Stop and listen to me one moment," he said, detaining her. That one moment he
                     prolonged till he had repeated, again and again, his professions of admiration
                     and interest, and his entreaties that she would meet him. She remained true to
                     herself, and to her aunt. She offered to tell her aunt of his kindness, and to
                     ask her leave to take the ride. This he declined, saying "it would be useless,"
                     and finally, he was obliged to leave her, with only a promise from her, that
                     she would not always disregard the whistle.</p>
                  <p>He kissed her hand, and thrust into it a purse. She would have followed him,
                     and returned it, but at that moment two persons crossed the street, and
                     interposed themselves between her and Stafford; and fearing observation, she
                     reluctantly luctantly retained it. On examination, she found in it several gold
                     pieces, and a small locket, with a very beautiful miniature of Stafford on one
                     side, and a lock of his hair on the other. She had the resolution, after
                     examining the features again and again, to 'tie it up with the purse of
                     untouched money; certainly not without many a pang, as she slowly and
                     hesitatingly did it, and directing the parcel to "Nugent Stafford, Esquire,"
                     she secretly gave it to her devoted thrall, Pat O'Roorke, a clever and honest
                     boy, to convey it to that gentleman, at the Astor House.—Pat returned with the
                     information, that there was no such gentleman there, and Fanny, without having
                     any suspicion of foul play, concluded he was out of town. She hid the parcel
                     from her aunt's eye, thinking it would uselessly disturb her, and still
                     resolving to return it at the first opportunity.</p>
                  <p>She had thus far obeyed her conscience, and it "sat lightly on its throne."</p>
                  <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>Two years glided away. Fanny's beauty, instead of passing with her childhood,
                     had become so brilliant that it could not be unobserved. She shunned the
                     street, where the vultures, that are abroad for prey, seeing she was young, and
                     ascertaining that she was unprotected, had more than once beset her. A mine had
                     long been working under her feet. The dreary companionship of the petulant old
                     woman became every day more wearisome to her; still, she was gentle and
                     patient, and for many a heavy month, endured resolutely a life that grew sadder
                     and sadder, as she contrasted it with the world of beauty, indulgence and love,
                     that had been painted to her excited imagination. For the last six months,<pb
                        n="350-351" xml:id="VAC7726-00000175"/> her aunt had been paralytic, moving
                     from her bed to the chair with difficulty, supported by Fanny, whose slight
                     figure tottered under the superincumbent weight of the massive old woman. Her
                     faculties had decayed one after another; still the paramount affection of her
                     being remained; the last lingering of daylight on the darkening night. She
                     fancied herself still capable of earning their daily sustenance, and hour after
                     hour, she would move the only arm she could move, as if she were sewing, and at
                     evening take the same garment, on which she had thus cheated herself for
                     months, to Fanny, and falter out, "take it to Ray's, dear, and bring the pay."
                     Fanny favoured the illusion, took the garment, and <emph>always brought the
                        pay.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>The O'Roorke's were still tenants of a room below, and since the old woman's
                     illness, Fanny had often accepted the kind offers of their services. Ellen went
                     on her errands, and Pat brought up her wood and water; and whenever she had
                     occasion to go out (and such occasions recently came often, and lasted long),
                     Mrs. O'Roorke would bring her baby, to tend in the "ould lady's room." Though
                     Fanny, without any visible means of subsistence, was supplied with every
                     comfort she could desire for her aunt or herself, Mrs. O'Roorke, from stupidity
                     or humanity, or a marvellous want of curiosity, asked no questions.</p>
                  <p>On some points, she certainly was not blind. One day, Mrs. Hyat, after an ill
                     turn, had fallen asleep, Mrs. O'Roorke was sitting by her, and Fanny appeared
                     deeply engaged in reading. Ellen O'Roorke looked at the volume, and exclaimed,
                     "Why, your book, Fanny, is bottom side up." Fanny burst into tears, and flung
                     it from her.</p>
                  <p>"God help the child!" said Mrs. O'Roorke; "take the baby down stairs," she
                     added to Ellen, "and stay by it till I come. Now Fanny, darlint, spake out—what
                     frets you. The mother that bore you, is not more tinder to you than Biddy
                     O'Roorke; and have I not seen your eyes this three months always unquiet-like,
                     and red too, and your cheek getting paler and paler?" Fanny buried her face in
                     the bed-clothes. "Ah, honey dear, don't fret so; it's not to vex you, I'm
                     speaking; the words have been burning on my tongue this six weeks gone, but the
                     old lady jealoused us; and though I am old enough to be your mother, or
                     grandmother for that, you looked so sweet and innocent-like I was afeard to
                     spake my thought."</p>
                  <p>"I have no word to speak," said Fanny, in a changed and faltering voice, and
                     the bed trembled with the ague that shook her.</p>
                  <p>At this moment Mrs. Hyat threw her arm out of bed, opened her eyes, and for the
                     first time in many days, looked about her intelligently, and spoke distinctly,
                     "Fanny."</p>
                  <p>Fanny sprang to her side, and Mrs. O'Roorke instinctively moved round to the
                     head of the bed, where she could not be seen.</p>
                  <p>"Fanny," continued the old woman, slowly, but with perfect distinctness, "I am
                     going—you will follow soon—you will, dear. Be patient, be good." The blood
                     coloured again her faded and withered cheek as she spoke, and mounting to her
                     brain, gave her a momentary vigour. "Trust in God, Fanny, trust in God, and not
                     in man. I go—but I do not leave you alone, Fanny,—not alone,—no—no—not alone."
                     The utterance grew fainter and fainter, a slight convulsion passed over her
                     whole frame, and her features were still and rigid. Fanny gazed in silent fear
                     and horror. Her eye turned from her aunt to Mrs. O'Roorke, with that
                        question<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC7726-00000176"/> she could not utter. The
                     kind woman said nothing, but gently closed the staring, vacant eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! she is dead!" cried Fanny, throwing herself on the bed in a paroxysm of
                     grief. "My last friend; oh! I am alone—alone. God has left me—I have left him.
                     I deceived her. Oh dear—oh dear!"</p>
                  <p>In vain Mrs. O'Roorke tried to calm and comfort her, she wept till she fell
                     asleep from utter exhaustion. Nature did the kind work it does so well to
                     elastic youth, and she awoke in the morning calm, strengthened, and refreshed.
                     She seemed, as Mrs. O'Roorke said, changed from a helpless girl to a woman. She
                     sent for her aunt's clergyman, and by his intervention, and the aid of an
                     undertaker, she made provision for burying her beside her husband and children;
                     and attended by the clergyman, she followed her last and faithful old relative
                     to the grave; and returned to her desolate apartment, a dreary world behind
                     her, and fearful clouds hovering around her horizon—poor young creature!</p>
                  <p>She paid the charges of the funeral; those charges that always come, a sordid
                     and vexing element, with the bereavements of the poor; and late the following
                     evening, Mrs. O'Roorke, hearing, as she fancied, a footstep descending the
                     stair, and soon after a carriage rolling away, mounted to verify or dismiss her
                     suspicions. There was no answer to her knock; the door was not locked, she
                     opened it; a lamp was burning on the table, and a letter, the wafer yet wet,
                     lying by it.</p>
                  <p>"Ellen," she called. Ellen came. "Who is this letter for, Ellen?"</p>
                  <p>"Why! for you, mother, and Fanny's writing!"</p>
                  <p>"Read it, Ellen; she knows I cannot read, and if there's e'er a secret in it,
                     keep it as if it were your own."</p>

                     never a little something of a sacret shoved in betwixt the other words?"</p>

                  <p>"You've got the whole, mother, every word."</p>
                  <p>"Sure it's not of myself I'm thinking; but the time may come, when she'll wish
                     for as rough a friend as I am. God help her and guide her, poor child! in this

                  <p>It was some time before Ellen clearly comprehended that Fanny was gone from
                     them, probably for ever; and it was some time longer, before these generous
                     creatures could bear to consider themselves in any way gainers by her
                     departure. They turned the key of Fanny's door, and went to their own
                     room—Ellen to brood over what seemed to her an insolvable mystery, and her
                     mother to 'guess and fear.'</p>

                  <p>Our readers must now follow her to an isolated house in the upper part of the
                     city. There she had two apartments, furnished with more finery than elegance,
                     or even neatness. The rose-coloured curtains were faded, the gilded furniture
                     tarnished, and from the vases of faded artificial flowers Fanny's sickening
                     thoughts now often turned to the white jessamine and rose, types of her lost
                     purity, that blossomed in her Aunt Sara's window.</p>
                  <p>Fanny was not the first tenant of these apartments, which, with others in the
                     same house, were kept, furnished and supplied, by a certain Mrs. Tilden, who
                     herself occupied the basement rooms. Fanny, now by courtesy called Mrs.
                     Stafford, was but little more than seventeen, just on the threshold of life!
                     That fountain of love which has power to make the wilderness blossom, to fill
                     the desert places of life with flowers and fruits, had been poisoned, and there
                     was no more health in it. The eye, which should have been just opening to the
                     loveliest visions of youth, was dull and heavily cast down, while tear after
                     tear dropped from it on a sleeping infant, some few months on its pilgrimage
                     "between the cradle and the grave." The beautiful form of Fanny's features
                     remained, but the life of beauty was gone; her once brilliant cheek was pale,
                     and her whole figure shrunken. Health, self-respect, cheerfulness, even hope,
                     the angel of life, were driven away for ever—and memory, so sparkling and sweet
                     to youth, bore but a bitter chalice to poor Fanny's lips. She sat statue-like,
                     till she started at a footstep approaching the door. A slovenly servant girl
                     entered, in a pert and noisy manner, that expressed the absence of all
                     deference, and took from a handkerchief, in which it was wrapped, a letter
                     addressed to Nugent Stafford, saying, "I've been to the Astor House, and the
                     American, and the City Hotel, and all them boarding-houses down town, and
                     there's no such person there, and nowhere else, I expect."</p>
                  <p>"What do you mean, Caroline?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, nothing, only them as hangs out false colours must expect others to do the
                     same by them. I suppose there's no more a Mr. Stafford than a Mrs.
                     Stafford."</p>
                  <p>"Hush, my baby," said Fanny to the infant, stirred by her tremor.</p>
                  <p>"I want to have my wages paid to-day," continued Caroline, "as I am expecting
                     to leave."</p>
                  <p>Fanny took out her purse, and paid the girl's demand. Caroline eyed it
                     narrowly; there were but a few shillings left in it, and she changed the
                     assault she had meditated, from the purse to a richer spoil.</p>
                  <p>"It's always rulable," she said, "when a girl lives in such a house as this,
                     and serves the like of you, that she shall have extra pay, for risking
                     character and so forth. I see your purse is rather consumptive, and I am
                     willing to take up with your silk gown, spotted with pink and trimmed with
                     gimp."</p>
                  <p>"Oh hush, my baby!" cried Fanny to the child, who, opening her eyes on the
                     distressed countenance of her mother, was crying as even such young children
                     will, from the instinct of sympathy. "The gown hangs in the closet," she
                     replied steadily, "take it and go."</p>
                  <p>Caroline took it, and while she was deliberately folding it, she said, half
                     consolingly, half impertinently, "It an't worth while grieving for nothing in
                     this world, for it's a kind of confused place. Why it always comes to this
                     sooner or<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC7726-00000178"/> later. Your fine gentleman
                     likes variety! You'll be as handsome as ever again if you'll leave off sighing
                     and crying, and you may get as much of a husband as Stafford, and as good."</p>
                  <p>"Leave me, pray leave me," cried Fanny; and when Caroline shut the door, she
                     threw herself on the bed with her baby, saying, amidst tears and shiverings.
                     "Oh, has it come to this? deserted; lost! Am I such a thing that I cannot
                     answer that cruel, bad girl? Oh God, have mercy! He will not hear me, for I
                     only come to him when I have none other to go to. Hush, my baby. I wish we were
                     in the grave together. Come, now—hush—do." She wiped away her tears, and
                     catching up the child, rushed, half distracted, up and down the room,
                     attempting to smile and play to it; and the poor little thing cried and smiled
                     alternately.</p>
                  <p>The following are some extracts from the hapless letter which Caroline had
                     brought back to her:</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Nugent Stafford, am I never, never to see you again! It is two months
                     since you were here; two <emph>months!</emph> it seems two <emph>years;</emph>
                     and yet when you were last here, and spoke those icy, cruel, insulting words, I
                     thought it would be better never to see you again than to see you so. But come
                     once more, and tell me if I deserved them from you.</p>
                  <p>"Remember, I was thirteen years old, an innocent, loving child—loving, but with
                     little to love—when you first stole my heart. Did you then mean this ruin? God
                     knows—you know—I don't. Did you plot it then? to steal away my innocence, when
                     I should be no longer a child? You say you never promised to marry me, and you
                     say that I knew what was before me. No, you never said one word of marrying me;
                     but did you not swear to love, and cherish me so long as you lived? And did you
                     not tell me, over and over again, that that was all that marriage was in God's
                     sight? Did you not say that I did not love you half as well as you loved me,
                     and again and again reproach me with it? Were you not angry, so angry as to
                     frighten me, because I would not desert my dear, good, old, faithful aunt, to
                     go with you? And how have I loved you? I have given up my innocence for you, my
                     good name, and the favour of God. I have loved only you, never have had a
                     thought beyond you. I wore only the fine things to please you; and truly now I
                     hate to look on them, for they were, in your eyes, the price of what I never
                     sold, but <emph>gave.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>"But for my poor baby, I would not send to you again; for her I will do any
                     thing, but sin. Mrs. Tilden has twice told me I must leave this house. Six
                     months' rent is due. I have ten dollars in my purse. Tell me where I am to go?
                     What am I to do? I would not stay here if I could—the house has become hateful
                     to me. I cannot bear the looks of Mrs. Tilden and Caroline. I cannot endure to
                     have them touch my baby, for it seems to me as if their touch to my little
                     innocent child were like a foul thing on an opening rosebud. The very sound of
                     their voices disgusts and frightens me. Oh! it was not human to put me among
                     such creatures. If you have deserted me for ever, I will earn food if I can to
                     keep my baby alive. If I cannot earn, I will beg; but I will live no longer
                     among these bad people. I had rather perish with my baby in the street. Oh! Mr.
                     Stafford, how could you have the heart to put me here? and will you not now
                     give me a decent home—for the baby's sake—for a little while—till I am
                     stronger, and can work for her?"</p>
                  <p>There was much more in the letter than we have cited; but it was all of the
                     same tenor, and all showed plainly, that<pb n="358-359"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000179"/> though betrayed and deserted, poor Fanny was not
                     corrupted. Bold, and hardened indeed, must have been that human creature who
                     could have cast the first stone at her.</p>
                  <p>For some months after Stafford took her under his protection (the
                        <emph>protection</emph> the wolf affords the lamb!) he was passionately
                     devoted to her. He made her world, and made it bright with such excess of
                     light, that she was dazzled, and her moral sense overpowered. There was no true
                     colouring or proportion to her perception; she was like one, who, having
                     imprudently gazed at the sun, sees every object for a time in false and
                     brilliant colouring. But these illusions fade by degrees to blackness; and so,
                     as Fanny recovered from the bewilderment of passion, the light became
                     shadow—ever deepening, immovable shadow. She lost her gayety, and no twilight
                     of cheerfulness succeeded to it. The birth of her child recalled her to
                     herself—the innocent creature was God's minister to her soul—her pure love for
                     it made impure love hateful to her. She became serious, then sad, and very
                     wearisome to Stafford. He was accustomed to calling forth the blandishments of
                     art. Fanny had no art. Her beauty was an accident, independent of herself. The
                     unappreciable treasure of her immeasurable love she gave him, and for this
                     there is no exchange but faithful, pure love; so her drafts were on an empty
                     treasury. Passion consumes, sensuality rusts out the divine quality of love.
                     Fanny's character was simple and true—elemental. She had little versatility,
                     and nothing of the charm of variety which comes from cultivation, and from
                     observation of the world. What could she know of the world, whose brief time in
                     it had been passed between her school and Dame Hyat's room in Houston
                     street!</p>
                  <p>Stafford was extremely well read in certain departments of romantic literature.
                     He had a standing order with a Paris publisher for such books as "George Sand,"
                     "Paul de Kock," and all their tribe produce. But this was a terra incognita to
                     Fanny. Her reading was confined to the Bible and the tracts left at her aunt's
                     door. He delighted in those muses who have come down from the holy mount of
                     inspiration and sacrificed to impure gods. Poetry, beyond that of her aunt's
                     hymn-book, was unknown to Fanny; and when Stafford brought her Beppa, and Don
                     Juan, she understood but little of them, and what she understood she loathed.
                     Stafford loved music. It was to him the natural language and fittest excitement
                     of passion, and poor Fanny had no skill in this divine art beyond a song for
                     her baby. He gave her lascivious engravings; she burst into tears at the sight
                     of them, and would not be moved by his diabolical laugh and derision to look a
                     second time at them. The natural dissimilarity and opposition between them came
                     soon to be felt by both. He was ready to cast her—no matter where—as a burden
                     from him; and she had already turned back, to walk through the fires her sin
                     had kindled, to the bosom of infinite love and compassion.</p>
                  <p>Stafford's vices were expensive, and like most idle, dissipated young men of
                     fortune, he soon found his expenditures exceeding his income. He had no thought
                     of sacrificing his vices to his wants, but only the objects of them. He had of
                     late felt his mode of life to be so burdensome, that he resolved on reforming
                     it, or rather, on reducing his pleasures, by marrying a young woman whose large
                     fortunes would be a relief to him, whose beauty and elegance would adorn his
                     establishment, and whose character would fill up certain awkward blanks in his
                     own.</p>
                  <p>A person so gifted, and attainable, as he flattered himself,<pb n="360-361"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000180"/> he had discovered in Augusta Emly. Miss Emly's
                     mother was a leading woman of fashion in the city, and she had received his
                     first demonstrations with unequivocal indications of favour.</p>
                  <p>He deliberately determined to leave Fanny as he had done others, to shift for
                     herself, quieting his conscience—it was easily pacified—with the reflection
                     that he left her rather better off than he found her! As if simplicity,
                     contentment, and a good name, were marketable articles, to be trafficked away
                     for a few jewels, laces and silks, and a few months of luxurious life.</p>

                  <p>FANNY MCDERMOT might have lain down and died in the extremity of her despair at
                     finding herself finally deserted, or in her self-condemnation she might have
                     done violence to her life; but her child was God's argument to reason,
                     patience, calmness, and exertion.</p>
                  <p>She sat herself to consider what could be done. In all this great city, Mrs.
                     O'Roorke was her only acquaintance, and though poor and ignorant, she was too
                     her friend, and Fanny was in a strait to know the worth of that word
                        <emph>friend.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>"She can, perhaps, tell me where to find employment," thought Fanny, "and
                     certainly she will be kind to me." And to her she determined to go. She laid
                     aside all her fine clothes, which were now unfit for her, and had become
                     disgusting to her, and putting on a gingham dressing-gown, and over it a black
                     and white plaid cloak, which, with a neat straw bonnet (her aunt's last gifts),
                     seemed, as she looked at herself in them, in some degree to restore her
                     self-respect, "Dear, honest old friends," she exclaimed, "would that I had
                     never laid you aside!" It was with a different feeling that she took up and
                     laid down, one after another, the pretty frocks she had delicately made and
                     daintily trimmed for her baby. "She looks so pretty in them," she thought; "and
                     I am sure there is no sin in her looking pretty!" But after a little shrinking,
                     she dressed the baby in a cotton night-gown, and took off her coral necklace,
                     bracelets, and bells. She then wrapped her warmly in shawls, and left the
                     house, and after walking two squares, she reached a railroad car. There were
                     several persons in the car when she entered, and as usual, they turned their
                     eyes on the new comer, but not, as usual, turned them away again. Those
                     exquisite features arrested the dullest eye, and there was something in the
                     depth of expression on that young face, to awaken interest in the dullest soul.
                     One man touched his neighbour, who was absorbed in his newspaper, and directed
                     his eyes to Fanny. Two young women interchanged expressions of wonder and
                     curiosity with their eyes fixed on her. A good little boy, feeling an
                     instinctive sympathy with something, he knew not what, expressed it by offering
                     her some pea-nuts, and when she looked up to thank him, she became for the
                     first time conscious of the general gaze; and thankful she was, when, at the
                     intersection of Houston-street, the car stopped to let her out. "Have a care,"
                     said a Quaker woman at her side, as she rose, "thee art young, child, to be
                     trusted with a baby." Fanny, overcome with emotion and fatigue—for it was long
                     since she walked out—was ready to sink, when, after having walked nearly a mile
                     down Houston-street, she came to her former home. The O'Roorke's were not
                     there. "They had moved many months since," her informer said, "down into
                     Broome-street, near the North River." "Was it far?" Fanny asked. "Faith! it
                     was!" "Might she come in and rest herself?"<pb n="362-363"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000181"/> "Indeed isn't she welcome; and a shame it is for
                     any lady to send such a delicate cratur out with a baby in her arms."</p>
                  <p>When Fanny entered and saw the stairs she had so often, in her childhood,
                     trodden, the tears started to her eyes; and, when her baby waked, and would not
                     be quieted without food from her breast, she perceived the women exchanging
                     significant nods and looks, and overcome by weakness and a gush of emotion, she
                     burst into hysterical sobbings. "Poor young cratur! poor young cratur! God help
                     you!" exclaimed the woman, with a true Irish gush of feeling: "and what is't
                     you're wanting? Here's a drink of milk; take it, honey dear; it will strengthen
                     you better than whiskey. We've done with that, thank God and Father
                     Matthew."</p>
                  <p>Fanny made a violent effort, calmed herself, drank the milk, and asked if a cab
                     could not be got for her. There was one passing, and at the next instant she
                     was in it, and driving to Broome-street. She found the house, but the O'Roorkes
                     had flitted, and in another and distant quarter of the city, she found the
                     second dwelling to which she was directed. Again they had moved, and whither,
                     no one could tell; and feeling as if the last plank had gone from under her
                     feet, she returned to her home. Home! alas, that sacred word had now no meaning
                     to poor Fanny. She had scarcely entered her room and thrown herself on the sofa
                     with her baby, when Mrs. Tilden, her remarkably red-faced landlady, threw open
                     the door and said—</p>
                  <p>"Are you back? I did not expect you alone."</p>
                  <p>"Not expect me alone? What do you mean?"</p>
                  <p>"Why it's customary for some kind of folks, you know, when they lose one
                     husband, to take another."</p>
                  <p>Fanny looked up; a sickening feeling came over her; the words she would have
                     answered died away on her lips.</p>
                  <p>"I suppose you are sensible," continued Mrs. Tilden, "that honest folks must be
                     paid just debts, and as there's no finding that Mr. Stafford of yours, I have
                     'strained upon your wearing apparel, that being answerable for rent as well as
                     furniture; and all the furniture belonging to me already, except the sofa and
                     the Psyche, and the vases and the dressing case,—them things will help out, but
                     the whole quarter's rent, and eight days over, is due."</p>
                  <p>Fanny said nothing.</p>
                  <p>"I am never ungenerous to nobody. So I have taken out enough baby linen to
                     serve you, and a change for yourself—the rest is under my lock and key, and I
                     shall keep it, may be, a month or more before I sell it; and if Mr. Stafford
                     pays me in that time—and I don't misdoubt he will, sooner or later—but them
                     kind of fine gentlemen are slow coaches in paying, you know, but I don't
                     question his honor; he has always been highly honourable to me; and I have been
                     highly honourable to him; he is a real gentleman, there's no mistake—as I was
                     saying, as soon as he pays me, you shall have your things—or——the worth of them
                     again; you shall have it all, bating some little reward for my trouble—the
                     Psyche, or dressing-case—or so."</p>
                  <p>"Well," said Fanny, perceiving Mrs. Tilden had paused for an answer.</p>
                  <p>"Well," that's all—only if you and I can agree, you can stay down stairs, as a
                     boarder——till"</p>
                  <p>"No—not a moment—only let me remain in the room to-night, and to-morrow I will
                     try to find a service place."</p>
                  <p>"A service place! My service to you!" said Mrs. Tilden, with a sort of ogress
                     grin.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, don't look so at me! Mrs. Tilden, do you think, that, after all, I have
                     any pride?"</p>
                  <pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC7726-00000182"/>
                  <p>"Pride, pride! Why, you foolish child, don't you know that '<emph>after
                        all,</emph>' as you call it, there is but one kind of service left for you?
                     Ladies won't take the like of us into their houses."</p>
                  <p>"The like of us," thought Fanny, and shuddered.</p>
                  <p>"They are dreadful partic'lar about any little false step of their own sex. If
                     you but dampen the soles of your feet, it is as bad as if you are up to your
                     neck in the mire; but men may plunge in over their head and ears, and they are
                     just as welcome to their houses, and as good husbands for their daughters, as
                     your Josephs—"</p>
                  <p>"Is it so? Can it be? I do not know what will become of me! Oh, baby, baby! But
                     may I stay here to-night?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, yes; but you must be off pretty early, for there's a lady coming to look
                     at the rooms at ten."</p>
                  <p>Poor Fanny, left alone, sank on her knees, with one arm round her sleeping
                     baby, and sent out from her penitent and humble heart, a cry for forgiveness
                     and pity, that we doubt not was heard by Him whose compassions fail not. She
                     then threw herself on the bed and fell asleep. Thank God, no degree of misery
                     can drive sleep away from a wearied young creature.</p>
                  <p>The next morning she laid her plans, and strengthening her good resolutions by
                     prayer, she went forth feeling a new strength; and having paid the fee with two
                     of the only four shillings left to her,<ref rend="super" target="#note_008"
                        xml:id="return_008">*</ref>
                      to the master of an intelligence office, who stared curiously at her,
                     she received references to three ladies—"the very first-rate of places, all,"
                     as the man assured her. She first went to a lady who wanted a wet nurse as a
                     supplement to her own scanty supplies. She met a young lady in the hall, whom
                     she heard say to her mother, "Oh, mamma! such a pretty young creature has come
                     for wet nurse to sis—do take her." Fanny was called in, and having given
                     satisfactory answers as to her supplies, she was asked for references. She
                     immediately did what she had before purposed, and confessing she had no
                     references to give, told truly so much of her sad story as explained her
                     present position. The lady heard her through, possibly not believing a word she
                     said, but the fact of her transgression; and when she had finished, she said to
                     her, "Did you really expect that such a person as you could get a place in a
                     respectable family?" She rung the bell, and added coolly, "Thomas, show this
                     person out. This is the last time I go to an intelligence office."</p>
                  <note place="foot" xml:id="note_008">
                     
                     <p><ref target="#return_008">*</ref>For the honour of human nature, and especially the most generous of human
                        natures, Irish nature, we should have told, that on the preceding day,
                        Fanny's cab-driver seeing the meagreness of her purse, refused to take
                        pay from her.</p>
                  </note>
                  <p>Poor Fanny sighed as she left the door, but pressing her baby to her bosom, she
                     said softly, "We'll not be discouraged with one failure, will we, baby?" The
                     child smiled on her, and she went on with a lighter step. Her next application
                     was to a milliner, whom the master of the intelligence office had told her "was
                     a very strict religious lady, who says she is very particular about the
                     reputation of her girls." It is close by, thought Fanny. "I have but little
                     hope, but I must save my steps, and I will go to her." Again, bravely and
                     simply she told the truth. The milliner heard her with raised brows. "I am
                     sorry for you, if you tell the truth, young woman," she said. "I know this city
                     is a dreadful place for unprincipled girls, and I make it a rule never to take
                     any such into my establishment. I hope you do mean to reform, but I can do
                     nothing for you; I advise you to apply to the Magdalen Society."</p>
                  <pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC7726-00000183"/>
                  <p>Again Fanny went on. She had now to go from William-street to the upper part of
                     the city; and precious as her sixpences had become, she felt it was utterly
                     impossible for her to walk. She, therefore, on reaching Broadway, got into an
                     omnibus, and was soon at the door of Mrs. Emly's fine house in Waverley Place,
                     and was shown into a room where that lady was sitting in her <choice>
                        <sic>peignior</sic>
                        <corr>peignoir</corr>
                     </choice>, looking over with her sister some dresses that were to be trimmed
                     for a party the following evening. A very elegant young woman was sitting at a
                     table drawing.</p>
                  <p>"A sempstress, ma'am, from the intelligence office," said the servant,
                     announcing Fanny.</p>
                  <p>"A sempstress, with a child!" exclaimed Mrs. Emly.</p>
                  <p>The young lady looked up at Fanny as she entered; she was struck by her beauty,
                     with her excessive delicacy, and with the gushing of the blood to her pale
                     cheek at Mrs. Emly's exclamation. She rose, handed Fanny a chair, and saying
                     most kindly, "What a very pretty child, mamma;" she offered to take it. The
                     little creature stretched out its hands in obedience to the magnetic influence
                     of beauty, youth, and a countenance most expressive of cheerful kindness. If,
                     as is sometimes said, a voice may be "full of tears," this lovely young
                     creature's was "full of smiles." Fanny looked up most gratefully, as the young
                     lady took her infant, saying to her, "You must be very tired—is it not very
                     tiresome to carry a baby?"</p>
                  <p>"The baby does not seem to tire me; but I am not very strong," replied Fanny,
                     wiping away the tears that were gathering at the gentleness addressed to
                     her.</p>
                  <p>"You do not look strong, nor well," said the young lady, and she poured out a
                     glass of wine and water, and insisted on Fanny taking that, and some more solid
                     refreshment, from the waiter on which a servant had just served lunch. It was
                     well for poor Fanny that she accepted the hospitality, for she needed to be
                     fortified for what followed. Fanny had been so thoroughly drilled in sewing by
                     her aunt, who, it may be remembered, was a tailoress, that she answered very
                     confidently, as to her abilities as a sempstress. She should be content, she
                     said, with any wages, or no wages, for the present, if Mrs. Emly would put up
                     with the inconvenience of her child."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, the child will not be in my way, said Mrs. Emly;" you'll be up in the
                     attic, and I shan't hear it; so, if you will give me a satisfactory reference,
                     I will try you."</p>
                  <p>"I have never lived out," answered Fanny. Discouraged by the rebuffs she had
                     already received, she shrunk from a direct communication of her position.</p>
                  <p>"Well, where do your parents live? If I find you have decent parents, that will
                     be enough."</p>
                  <p>"My parents died—long ago—I lived with my aunt—and she is dead—and I
                     am——friendless."</p>
                  <p>"Aha!" said Mrs. Emly," with an emphatic nod of her head to her sister, who
                     screwed up her mouth, and nodded back again. The young lady walked up to her
                     mother, and said to her in a low voice, and with an imploring look—</p>
                  <p>"Mamma, for Heaven's sake don't say any more to her; I am sure she is
                     good."</p>
                  <p>"Ridiculous, Augusta; you know nothing about it," replied Mrs. Emly aloud. And
                     turning to Fanny, she said, "How comes it that you are friendless and alone in
                     the world? Have you not a husband?"</p>
                  <p>"No," answered Fanny, some little spirit mounting with her mounting colour. "I
                     never had a husband, I have been<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC7726-00000184"/>
                     betrayed and forsaken—I am no farther guilty,—no more innocent."</p>
                  <p>"Quite enough! quite enough! I can't of course take any such person into my
                     house."</p>
                  <p>"Then my baby and I must die, for nobody will take us in," said Fanny, bursting
                     into tears, and gathering her cloak about her.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, mamma," said Augusta Emly, "for pity's sake let her stay. I will answer
                     for her."</p>
                  <p>"Pshaw! Augusta, how very absurd you are! No respectable lady would take a
                     person of that kind into her house."</p>
                  <p>"Then what is their respectability worth, mamma, if it cannot give help to a
                     weak fellow-creature?"</p>
                  <p>"Miss Augusta," said a servant, opening the door, "Mr. Sydney is below."</p>
                  <p>"Tell Mr. Sydney I am engaged, Daniel."</p>
                  <p>"Augusta," said her mother, "you are not going to send away Russel Sydney in
                     that nonchalant manner. What do you mean? Give the child to its mother, and go
                     down. "It's a lucky moment for her," she said, in a whisper to her sister. "She
                     has such a beautiful glow on her cheek."</p>
                  <p>It was a beautiful glow—the glow of indignant humanity.</p>
                  <p>"I cannot go down, mother. Daniel, say I am engaged."</p>
                  <p>In another instant, Daniel returned with a request from Mr. Sydney, that Miss
                     Emly would ride with him the following day; 'he had purchased a charming lady's
                     horse, and begged she would try it.'</p>
                  <p>"Oh, what shall I say, mamma? I cannot go."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Emly, without replying to Augusta, opened the door, and brushing by Fanny,
                     who had risen to depart, she called from the head of the stairs, "Mr. Sydney,
                     excuse me; I am in my dressing-gown and cannot come down. Will you come to the
                     staircase? We are so up to our eyes arranging with the dressmaker for Mrs.
                     Davies', that you must excuse Augusta this morning. She is a little timid,
                     since her accident about riding. Are you sure of your horse?"</p>
                  <p>"Perfectly. Lord bless me! would I ask Miss Emly, if I were not?"</p>
                  <p>At the sound of the responding voice, Fanny sprang forward, and then staggering
                     back again, leaned against the door.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! very well, then," said the compliant mamma, "she will be ready for you at
                     twelve. Good morning!"</p>
                  <p>"Good morning!" was answered, and Mrs. Emly turned towards her apartment,
                     elated with having settled the matter according to her own wishes. Fanny
                     grasped her arm,—"For God's sake, tell me," she said, in a voice scarcely
                     audible, "where does Mr. Sydney live? he it is that has deserted me. Where can
                     I find him?"</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Emly's spirit quailed before Fanny's earnestness—her unmistakable truth;
                     but after a single moment's hesitation, she discreetly said—"I don't know; he
                     lives somewhere at lodgings. You have probably mistaken the person."</p>
                  <p>"Mistaken,—oh Heaven!" exclaimed Fanny, and glided down stairs as if there were
                     wings to her feet; but before she could reach the pavement, Sydney had mounted
                     into his very handsome new phaeton, and was driving proudly up the street,
                     gallantly bowing to some ladies at their balcony windows, and poor Fanny crept
                     on she knew not why nor whither.</p>
                  <p>"What did that poor girl say to you, mamma? Did she mention Sydney's name?"
                     asked Augusta Emly.</p>
                  <p>"Sydney's name? Why should she mention it? I did not hear her. She might,
                     perhaps—she muttered something. She is a little beside herself, I think."</p>
                  <pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC7726-00000185"/>
                  <p>"Do you, mamma?"</p>
                  <p>There could not be a stranger contrast, than Miss Emly's earnest tone and her
                     mother's flippant one.</p>
                  <p>"Poor—poor girl—how very beautiful she is! She reminded me of Ophelia. I think
                     she has her senses now, but with that deep dejectedness, I should not wonder if
                     she soon lost them. May God be more merciful to her than we have been. But,
                     mamma, how could you say to Russel Sydney, that I would ride with him?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, are you going to stay at home and sigh over this lost damsel? You will
                     ride with Sydney, unless you prefer to hurt my feelings, and displease me
                     seriously."</p>
                  <p>"That I should be very sorry to do; but I cannot ride with Mr. Sydney."</p>
                  <p>"Cannot! and why?"</p>
                  <p>"How can you ask, mamma? How can you wish me to associate intimately with the
                     sort of man he is?"</p>
                  <p>"What windmills are you fighting now, Augusta? For a sensible girl, you are the
                     silliest I ever met with. What do you mean?"</p>
                  <p>"You surely know what I mean, mamma! You know that Russel Sydney has been one
                     of the most dissipated men in the city."</p>
                  <p>"So have forty other men been who are very good husbands now, or whose wives
                     are too prudent to make a fuss about it if they are not. Really, Augusta, I do
                     not think it very creditable to a young lady, to be seeking information of this
                     sort about young men."</p>
                  <p>"I have not sought it. I never dreamed," Augusta looked steadfastly in her
                     mother's face, "that my mother would introduce a man to me who, as we both have
                     heard, on good authority, has kept a mistress since he was eighteen, and
                     changed her as often as suited his caprice; but having heard this, I surely
                     will not disregard it."</p>
                  <p>"You are absurdly scrupulous and very unjust, my dear. Sydney has entirely
                     given up all this sort of thing—he assured me he had."</p>
                  <p>"And you relyingly took his assurance, mamma, and would not listen, for one
                     moment, to that poor penitent girl's assurance."</p>
                  <p>"Oh that's quite a different thing;"</p>
                  <p>"I see no difference, excepting that the one is the strong party, the other the
                     weak,—the one the betrayer, the other the betrayed. The fact of the girl
                     seeking honest employment is <foreign xml:lang="LAT">prima facie</foreign>
                     evidence in favour of her truth."</p>
                  <p>"You talk so absurdly, Augusta! And, to speak plainly, I do not think it over
                     delicate," continued Mrs. Emly, with a pharisaical curl of her lip, "for an
                     unmarried lady of nineteen to be discussing subjects of this nature—though it
                     may be quite often your Aunt Emily's fashion to do so."</p>
                  <p>"It is very much my Aunt Emily's fashion to strip off the husk, and look for
                     the kernel—to throw away the world's current counterfeit, and keep the real
                     gold. Probably she would think it far more indelicate to receive a notoriously
                     licentious man into her society, than to express her opinion of his vices: and
                     I know she thinks it not only indelicate, but irrational and unchristian, to
                     tolerate certain vices in men, for which women are proscribed and hunted
                     down."</p>
                  <p>"Mercy on us, what an oration for nothing! Truly, you and your Aunt Emily, with
                     your country-evening morals, are very competent judges of town society. It
                     seems to my poor common-sense perceptions, that you are rather a partial
                     distributor of your charities. You are quite willing to receive this equivocal
                     young woman, with her confessedly illegitimate<pb n="372-373"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000186"/> child, and you would doubly bar and bolt the
                     door against a very charming young man, who has sown his wild oats."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, surely mamma, this is not the true state of the case. The one party is a
                     man of fashion, received and current, the other a poor young outcast, who seems
                     more sinned against than sinning—probably the victim of some such 'charming'
                     young man as Sydney. As women, as professed followers of Christ, my dear
                     mother, ought we not to help her out of the pit into which she has fallen? May
                     we not guard her from future danger and misery?"</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Emly stood for a moment silent and rebuked before the gentle earnestness
                     of her daughter; but after a moment, she rallied and said with a forced
                     laugh,—"You had best join the Magdalen Society at once, Augusta; they will give
                     you plenty of this fancy-missionary work to do; I confess it is not quite to my
                     taste."</p>
                  <p>Augusta made no reply; she was too much pained by her mother's levity, and she
                     took refuge in writing the incidents of the morning to that "Aunt Emily," in
                     whose pure atmosphere she had been reared.</p>
                  <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>Sickening with fatigue and disappointment, Fanny, helped on her way by an
                     omnibus, returned to the intelligence office where she had left her bundle. The
                     official gentleman there, on hearing the story of her failure, said, "Well,
                     it's no fault of mine—you can't expect a good place without a good
                     reference."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, I expect nothing," replied Fanny, "I hope for nothing, but that my baby
                     and I may lay down together and die—very soon, if it please God!"</p>
                  <p>"I am sorry for you, I declare I am," said the man, who, though his sensibility
                     was pretty much worn away by daily attrition, could not look, without pity,
                     upon the pale, beautiful young creature, humble and gentle, and trembling in
                     every fibre with exhaustion and despair. "You are tired out," he said, "and
                     your baby wants taking care of. There's a decent lodging-house in the next
                     street. No. 35, where you may get a night's lodging for a shilling. To-morrow
                     morning you'll feel better,—the world will look brighter after a night's sleep.
                     Come back to me in the morning, and I will give you some more chances. I won't
                     go according to rule with you."</p>
                  <p>Fanny thanked him, kissed her baby, and again, with trembling, wavering steps,
                     went forth. She had but just turned the corner, when, overcome by faintness,
                     she sat down on a door-step. As she did so, a woman coming from the pump turned
                     to go down into the area of a basement-room. She rested her pail on the step,
                     and cast her eye inquisitively on Fanny.</p>
                  <p>"God save us!" she cried, "Fanny McDermot, darlint! I've found you at last—just
                     as I expected! God punish them that's wronged you! Can't you spake to me,
                     darlint? Don't you know Biddy O'Roorke?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh yes," replied Fanny, faintly, "my only friend in this world! Indeed I do
                     know you."</p>
                  <p>"And indeed, and indeed, you cannot come amiss to me—you are welcome as if you
                     were my own, to every thing I have in the world. Rise up, darlint, give me the
                     babby. God's pity on it, poor bird;" and taking the infant in one arm, and
                     supporting and nearly carrying the mother with the other, she conducted Fanny
                     down the steps and laid her on her bed. With discreet and delicate kindness,
                     she abstained, for the present, from inquiries, and contented herself with
                     nursing the baby, and now and then an irrepressible overflow of her heart<pb
                        n="374-375" xml:id="VAC7726-00000187"/> in expression of pity and love to
                     Fanny, and indignation and wrath against "bad craters, that had neither soul,
                     nor heart, nor feelings, nor any such thing in them!"</p>
                  <p>In the course of the day Fanny so far recovered as to tell her friend her
                     short, sad story, and to learn that affairs had mended with the O'Roorkes; that
                     the drunken husband was dead, Pat and Ellen were out at service, and that the
                     good mother, with a little help from them, and by selling apples and nuts, and
                     now and then a windfall, got bread for herself and three little noisy, thriving
                     children. The scantiness of her larder was only betrayed by her repeated
                     assurances to Fanny that "she had plenty—plenty, and to spare, oceans—oceans,"
                     and when Fanny the next morning manifested her intention of going out again to
                     seek a place, she said, "Na, na, my darlint, it's not that ye shall be after.
                     Is not the bit place big enough for us all? It's but little ye're wanting to
                     ate. Wait, any way, till ye's stronger, and the babby is old enough to wane,
                     and then ye can lave it here to play with Anny and Peggy."</p>
                  <p>Fanny looked round upon the "bit place," and it must be confessed that she
                     sickened at the thought of living in it, even with the sunny kindness of its
                     inmates, or of leaving her little snowdrop of a baby there. The windows were
                     dim with dirt, the floor was unwashen—a heap of kindlings were in one corner,
                     potatoes in another, and coals under a bed, none of the tidiest. Broken
                     victuals on broken earthen plates stood on the table, and all contrasted too
                     strongly with the glossy neatness of her aunt's apartment. Surely Fanny was not
                     fastidious.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no, Mrs. O'Roorke," she said, "I can never, never leave my baby. I am
                     better; and you are so kind to me, that I'll wait till to-morrow." And she did
                     wait another day, but no persuasion of Mrs. O'Roorke could induce her to leave
                     the infant fant. She insisted that she did not feel its weight,—and that
                     "looking on it was all that gave her courage to go among strangers,"—and "that
                     now she felt easier, and more in heart, knowing she had such a kind friend to
                     come to at night."</p>
                  <p>Finding Fanny solved, Mrs. O'Roorke said,—"Now don't be after telling them your
                     misfortunes; just send them to me for your charackter. It's ten to one they'll
                     not take the trouble to come; and if they do, I'll satisfy them
                     complately."</p>
                  <p>"And how?" asked Fanny, with a faint smile.</p>
                  <p>"Why, won't I be after telling them just the truth—how the good old lady
                     brought you up like a nun, out of sunshine and harm's way; how you were always
                     working with your needle, and quiet-like and dove-like—and how the ould lady
                     doted on you, and that you were the best and beautifullest that ever crossed a
                     door-sill."</p>
                  <p>"But oh, dear Mrs. O'Roorke, how will you ever come to the dreadful truth?"</p>
                  <p>"And I'll not be after just that. If they bother with questions, can't I answer
                     them civilly, Fanny McDermot? How will it harm a body in all the world just to
                     be tould that ye's married your man, what died with consumption or the like of
                     that?"</p>
                  <p>Fanny shook her head.</p>
                  <p>"Now what's the use, Fanny McDermot," continued Mrs. O'Roorke, "of a tongue, if
                     we can't serve a friend with it? Lave it all to me, darlint. You know I would
                     not tell a lie to wrong one of God's craters. Would I be after giving you a
                     charackter if you did not desarve it?"</p>
                  <p>"I know how kind and good you are to me, Mrs. O'Roorke," said Fanny; "but I
                     pray you say nothing for me but<pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC7726-00000188"/> the
                     truth. I have asked God's forgiveness and blessing on me and my baby, and we
                     must try to earn it. Promise me, will you?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, be aisy, darlint, be aisy, and I'll be after doing what you wish." She
                     wrapped the baby in its blanket, carried it up the steps, and put it in the
                     mother's arms. "There, God guide you, Fanny McDermot. The truth!" continued
                     Mrs. O'Roorke, as her streaming eyes followed Fanny; "and what's truth good for
                     but to serve the like of her that's been wronged by a false-hearted villain,
                     bad luck to him!"</p>
                  <p>It would take a very nice casuist to analyze the national moral sense of good
                     Mrs. O'Roorke. The unscrupulous flexibility of the Irish tongue is in curious
                     contrast with the truth of the Irish heart—a heart overflowing with enthusiasm,
                     and generosity, and often instinctively grasping the best truth of life.</p>
                  <p>"I am thinking," said the master of the intelligence office, as he was doling
                     out two or three references to Fanny, to families residing in different and
                     distant parts of the city, "I am thinking you don't know much of the world,
                     young woman?"</p>
                  <p>"I do not," replied Fanny, mournfully.</p>
                  <p>"Well then, I do, and I'll give you a hint or two. It's a world, child, that's
                     looking out pretty sharp for number one; where each shows their fairest side,
                     and looks all round their fellow <emph>creturs</emph>—where them that have the
                     upper hand—you understand—them what employs others—thinks they have a right to
                     require that they shall be honest and true and faithful, and so on to the end
                     of the chapter of what they call good character; and not only that they be so,
                     but that they have been so all their lives. The man that holds the purse may
                     snap his fingers, and be and do what he likes. Now, there can't be friendship
                     in this trade, so what are the weak party to do but to make fight the best way
                     they can? But I see you don't altogether take my idees," he continued,
                     perceiving Fanny was but half attentive, and replacing his spectacles, which he
                     had taken off in beginning his lecture on the social system; "you'll see my
                     meaning in the application. Now, 'I've asked no questions, and you've told no
                     lies,' as the saying is, but I know pretty much what's come and gone—you see I
                     understand all sorts of advertisements—by your beauty, by your cast-down eyes,
                     with the tears standing on the eaves—by the lips that, though too pretty for
                     any thing but smiles, look as if they would never smile again; by the—"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, please, sir, give me the papers and let me go."</p>
                  <p>"Wait—I have not come to it yet—to the pith. I feel like a father to you,
                     child—I do. Now, my advice is, hold up your head; you've as much right, and
                     more, I can tell you, than many a mistress of a fine house. Look straight
                     forward, speak cheery, and say you're a widow."</p>
                  <p>Fanny looked up, with a glance of conscious integrity; and he added, with a
                     slight stammer—</p>
                  <p>"Why should you not say so? You are <emph>left,</emph> and that is the main
                     part of being a widow—left to provide for yourself and your young one, and
                     that's the distressing part of being one. Every body pities the widow and
                     orphan. And I should like to have any body tell me which is most complete a
                     widow, a woman whose husband is dead, or you?—which the completest orphan, a
                     child whose father lies under ground, or yours?"</p>
                  <p>Fanny stretched out her hand for the references, and took them in silence; but
                     when she reached the door, she turned, and said, with a voice so sweet and
                     penetrating that it was oil to the wounded vanity of the man, "I thank you,
                     sir, for<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC7726-00000189"/> wishing to help us; but
                     baby," she added, mentally, straining her little burden to her bosom, "we will
                     be true—we will keep our vow to God—won't we? He is merciful; Jesus was
                     merciful, even to that poor woman that was brought before him by cruel men; and
                     if nobody will take us in on earth, God may take us to Himself—and I think He
                     will soon."</p>
                  <p>She walked on slowly and perseveringly, turning many streets, till she reached
                     the first address to which she had been referred. There, she was received and
                     dismissed as she had been on the previous day, and she went to look for the
                     next; but she soon began to feel sensations she had never felt before, a pain
                     and giddiness in the head, and a general tremulousness. She dragged on a little
                     way, and then sat down. Gradually her mind became confused, and she determined
                     to turn back at once, and make the best of her way to Mrs. O'Roorke, but to her
                     dismay, she could not remember the name of the street where she lived nor that
                     of the intelligence-office. "Oh, I am going mad," she thought, "and they will
                     take my baby from me!" and making an effort to compose herself, she sat down on
                     a door-step, and, to test her mind, she counted the panes in the windows
                     opposite. "All is right yet," she thought, as she went steadily on and finished
                     her task; "but why cannot I remember the name of that street? Do you know," she
                     asked timidly of a man who was passing, and who looked like one of those
                     persons who know every thing of the sort,—"do you know any street beginning
                     with Van?"</p>
                  <p>"Bless me, yes, fifty. There's Vandam, and Vandewater, and"—</p>
                  <p>"Oh, stop there—it's one of those. Are they near together?"</p>
                  <p>"As near as east and west—one is one side of the city, and one the other." And
                     he passed briskly on.</p>
                  <p>Poor Fanny sat down, and repeated to herself the names till she was more at a
                     loss than ever. The passers-by looked curiously at her, and two or three
                     addressing insolent words to her, she could endure it no longer, and she went
                     slowly, falteringly on. Her head throbbed violently, and she felt that her lips
                     were parched, and her pulse beating quick and hard. Her baby began to cry for
                     food, and seeing some upright boards resting against a house, she crept under
                     them to be sheltered from observation while she supplied her child's wants.
                     There were two little girls there before her, eating merrily and voraciously
                     from an alms-basket.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, my baby!" said Fanny aloud, "I am afraid this is the last time you will
                     find any milk in your mother's breast."</p>
                  <p>The little beggar-girls looked at her pitifully, and offered her bread and
                     meat.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, thank you," she said, "but I cannot eat. If you would only get me a drink
                     of cold water."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, that we can as easy as not," said one of them; and fishing up a broken
                     teacup from the bottom of her basket, she ran to a pump and filled it, and
                     again and again filled it, as Fanny drank it, or poured it on her burning,
                     throbbing head.</p>
                  <p>"It's beginning to rain," said one of the girls, "and I guess we had all better
                     go home. You look sick—we'll carry your baby for you, if your home is our
                     way."</p>
                  <p>"<emph>My home!</emph> No, thank you; my home is not your way."</p>
                  <p>The children went off slowly, looking back and talking in a low tone, and
                     feeling as they had never quite felt before.</p>
                  <p>It was early in February, and the days of course were short. The weather had
                     been soft and bright, but as the evening approached, the sky became clouded and
                     a chilling<pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC7726-00000190"/> rain began. Fanny crept
                     out of her place of shelter, after most anxiously wrapping up her baby, and at
                     first, stimulated by the fever, walked rapidly on. Now and then she sat down,
                     where an arched doorway offered a shelter, and remained half oblivious, till
                     urged on again by her baby's cries.</p>
                  <p>It was eleven o'clock, when she was passing before a brilliantly lighted house.
                     There was music within, and a line of carriages without. A gentleman was at
                     this moment alighting from his carriage. Fanny shrunk back, and leaned against
                     the area-railing till he should pass. He sprung quickly up the step to avoid
                     the dropping eaves, and when in the doorway, turned to say, "Be punctual, at
                     one o'clock." Fanny looked up: the light from the bright gas lamps beside the
                     door shone in the speaker's face. "Oh, mercy, it is he!" she exclaimed, and
                     darting forward, mounted the step. It was he! Sydney! He left the door ajar as
                     he entered, and Fanny followed in; and as she entered, she saw Sydney turn the
                     landing of the staircase. Above, was the mingled din of voices and music. Fanny
                     instinctively shrunk from proceeding. Through an open door she saw the ruddy
                     glow of the fire in the ladies' cloak-room. It was vacant. "I might warm my
                     poor baby there," she thought, "and it's possible,—it is possible I may speak
                     with him when he comes down,"—and she obeyed the impulse to enter. Her reason
                     was now too weak to aid her, or she would not have placed herself in a position
                     so exposed to observation and suspicion. When she had entered, she saw, to her
                     great relief, a screen that divided a small portion of the room from the rest.
                     She crept behind it, and seated herself on a cushion that had been placed there
                     for the convenience of the ladies changing their shoes.</p>
                  <p>"How very fast you are sleeping, my baby," she said, "and yet," she added,
                     shivering herself, "how very cold you are!" And wrapping around it a velvet
                     mantle that had fallen over the screen, she leaned her head against the wall,
                     and partly stupefied by the change from the chilling street to the warm
                     apartment, and partly from exhaustion, she fell asleep. What a contrast was
                     she, in her silent, lonely desolation, with fever in her veins, and enveloped
                     in cold, drenched, dripping garments, to the gay young creatures
                     above,—thoughtless of any evil in life more serious than not having a partner
                     for the next waltz! She, a homeless, friendless wanderer; they, passing from
                     room to room amidst the rustling of satins, and soft pressure of velvets, and
                     floating of gossamer draperies, with the luxury of delicious music, and an
                     atmosphere sweet with the breath of the costliest exotics, and crowding to
                     tables where Epicurus might have banqueted.</p>
                  <p>And such contrasts, and more frightful, are there nightly in our city,
                     separated, perhaps, by a wall, a street, or a square; and knowing this, we
                     sleep quietly in our beds, and spend our days in securing more comforts for
                     ourselves, and perhaps complaining of our lot!</p>
                  <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>More than an hour had passed away, when Fanny was awaked to imperfect
                     consciousness by the murmuring of two female voices outside the screen. Two
                     ladies stood there in their cloaks, waiting.</p>
                  <p>"How in the world," asked one, "did you contrive to make her waltz with
                     him?"</p>
                  <p>"By getting her into a dilemma. She could not refuse without rudeness to her
                     hostess."</p>
                  <p>"And so you made her ride with him yesterday? And so you hope to decoy her into
                     an engagement with him?"</p>
                  <pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC7726-00000191"/>
                  <p>"No, no. I merely mean to <emph>decoy</emph> her—if you choose that word—into
                     an intimacy, and then I will leave them to make out the rest between them. He
                     is really irresistible! Stamford Smith's wife was over head and ears in love
                     with him; and you know poor Ellen Livermore made no secret of her attachment to
                     him."</p>
                  <p>"Why did she not marry him?"</p>
                  <p>"Lord knows," replied the lady, shrugging her shoulders. "She did not play her
                     cards well; and I believe, the truth is, he has been a sad fellow."</p>
                  <p>"Do you believe there was any truth in that girl's story yesterday?"</p>
                  <p>"Very likely; pretty girls in her station are apt to go astray, you know. But
                     here is Augusta. Come in, Mr. Sydney, there is no one here but us. Are you
                     going so early?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes. After I shall have seen you to your carriage, I have no desire to stay."
                     There was a slight movement behind the screen, but apparently not noticed by
                     the parties outside. "Oh, Miss Emly, allow me," he said, dropping on his knee
                     before Augusta, who, the dressing-maid not being at her post, was attempting to
                     button her overshoe,—"allow me?"</p>
                  <p>"No, thank you; I always do these things for myself."</p>
                  <p>"But I insist."</p>
                  <p>"And I protest!" And Augusta Emly sprang behind the screen.</p>
                  <p>Sydney, with a sort of playful gallantry, followed her. Between them both the
                     screen fell, and they all stood silent and aghast, as if the earth had opened
                     before them. There still sat Fanny, beautiful as the most beautiful of
                     Murillo's peasant-mothers. The fever had left her cheek—it was as colorless as
                     marble; her lips were red, her eyes beaming with a supernatural light, and her
                     dark hair hung in matted masses of ringlets to her waist. She cast one
                     bewildered glance around her, and then fixing her eyes on Sydney, she sprang to
                     him and laid her hand on his arm, exclaiming, "Stafford! Stafford!" in a voice
                     that vibrated on the ears of all those who heard her, long after it was silent
                     for ever!</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Emly locked the door. Truly the children of this world <emph>are</emph>
                     wise in their generation! Sydney disengaged his arm, and said, in a scarcely
                     audible voice, for his false words choked him as he uttered them, "Who do you
                     take me for? The woman is mad!"</p>
                  <p>"No—I am not mad yet—but oh, my head, it aches so! it is so giddy! Feel how it
                     beats, Stafford. Oh, don't pull your hand away from me! How many times you have
                     kissed these temples, and the curls that hung over them, and talked about their
                     beauty. What are they now? What will they soon be? You feel it throb, don't
                     you? Stafford, I am not going to blame you now. I have forgiven you; I have
                     prayed to God to forgive you. Oh how deadly pale you are now, Stafford! Now you
                     feel for us! Now, look at our poor little child!" She uncovered the poor little
                     infant, and raised it more from stupor than from sleep. The half-famished
                     little thing uttered a feeble, sickly moan. "Oh God! oh God—she is dying! Is
                     not she dying?" She grasped Augusta Emly's arm. "Can't something be done for
                     her? I have killed her! I have killed my baby! It was you that were kind to us
                     yesterday—yes—it was you. I don't know where it was. Oh—my head—my head!"</p>
                  <p>"For God's sake, mamma, let us take her home with us," cried Augusta, and she
                     rushed to the door to look for her servant. As she opened it, voices and
                     footsteps were heard descending the stairs. She heeded them not,—her mother
                     did.</p>
                  <pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC7726-00000192"/>
                  <p>"Go now—go instantly, Sydney," she said.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no—no—do not go," cried Fanny, attempting to grasp him; but he eluded her,
                     and unnoticed by them, passed through the throng of servants at the door, threw
                     himself into the first hackney coach he saw, and was driven away.</p>
                  <p>Fanny uttered one piercing shriek, looked wildly around her, and passing
                     through the cluster of ladies pressing into the cloak-room, she passed,
                     unobserved by her, behind Miss Emly, who stood, regardless of the pouring rain,
                     on the doorstep ordering her coachman to drive nearer the door. When she
                     returned to the cloak-room, it was filled with ladies; and in the confusion of
                     the shawling, there was much talk among them of the strange apparition that had
                     glided out of the room as they entered.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Emly threw a cloak around her daughter. "Say nothing, Augusta!" she
                     whispered, imperatively, "they are both gone."</p>
                  <p>"Gone! together?"</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Emly did not, or affected not to hear her. The next morning Miss Emly was
                     twice summoned to breakfast before she appeared. She had passed a sleepless and
                     wretched night, thinking of that helpless young sufferer, ruined, and in her
                     extreme misery, driven forth to the stormy elements.</p>
                  <p>There is not a sadder moment in life than that in which a young, hopeful,
                     generous creature discovers unsoundness, worldliness, and heartlessness in
                     those to whom nature has most closely bound her,—than that, when, in the
                     freedom of her own purity and love of goodness, and faith in truth, she
                     discovers the compromising selfishness, the sordid calculations, the
                     conventional falsehood of the world. Happy for her, if, in misanthropic
                     disgust, she does not turn away from it; happy, if<emph>use</emph> does not
                     bring her to stoop from her high position; most happy, if like Him who came to
                     the sick, she fulfil her mission, and remain in the world, not of it!</p>
                  <p>Augusta went through the form of breakfast, and taking up the morning paper and
                     passing her eye listlessly over it, her attention was fixed by the following
                     paragraph:</p>
                  <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Committals at the Tombs—Fanny McDermot, a young woman so calling
                     herself, was taken up by a watchman during the violence of the storm last night
                     with a dead infant in her arms. A rich velvet mantilla, lined with fur, was
                     wrapped round the child. Nothing but moans could be extracted from the woman.
                     She was committed for stealing the mantilla. A jury of inquest is called to sit
                     upon the child, which they have not yet been able to force from the mother's
                     arms."</p>
                  <p>"Good Heavens, Augusta, what is the matter? Are you faint?" asked the
                     mother.</p>
                  <p>Augusta shook her head, and rang the bell, while she gave Mrs. Emly the
                     paragraph to read. "Daniel," she said to the servant who answered the bell, "Go
                     to Dr. Edmunds, and ask him to come to me immediately. Stop, Daniel—ask Gray as
                     you go along to send me a carriage directly."</p>
                  <p>"What now, Miss Emly? Are you going to the Tombs?</p>
                  <p>"Yes."</p>
                  <p>"Not with my permission."</p>
                  <p>"Without it then, ma'am, unless you bolt the doors upon me. The doctor will go
                     with me. There is no impropriety, and no Quixotism in my going, and I shall
                     never be happy again if I do not go. Oh, my dear mother," continued she,
                     bursting into tears, "I have suffered agonies this night thinking of that poor
                     young woman; but they are nothing—nothing to the misery of hearing you last
                     night defend that bad man, and bring me reason upon reason why 'it was to be
                        expected,'<pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC7726-00000193"/> and 'what often
                     happened,' and 'what no one thought of condemning a man for.' That he, loaded
                     with God's good gifts, should make a prey and victim of a trusting, loving,
                     defenceless woman; and she should be cast out of the pale of humanity—turned
                     from our doors—driven forth to perish in the storm. Oh, it is
                     monstrous!—monstrous!"</p>
                  <p>Augusta was too strong for her mother. She made no further opposition, but
                     merely murmured, in a voice that did not reach her daughter's ear, "There does
                     seem to be inconsistency, but it appears different when one knows the
                     world!"</p>
                  <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>The door of Fanny McDermot's cell was opened by the turnkey, and Miss Emly and
                     the physician were admitted. It was a room twice the size of those allotted to
                     single occupants, and there were already two women of the most hardened
                     character in it, besides a young girl, not sixteen, committed for infanticide.
                     She, her eyes filled with tears, was bathing Fanny's head with cold water,
                     while the women, looking like two furies, were accusing one another of having
                     stolen from Fanny, the one a handkerchief, the other a ring.</p>
                  <p>Fanny's dead infant was on her arm, while she, half raised on her elbow, bent
                     over it. She had wrapped her cloak and the only blanket on the bed around it.
                     "She is so cold," she said; "I have tried all night to warm her. She grows
                     colder and colder."</p>
                  <p>"Cannot this young woman be moved to a more decent apartment?" asked Miss Emly
                     of the turnkey.</p>
                  <p>Fanny looked up at the sound of her voice. "Oh, you have come—I thought you
                     would," she said. "You will warm my baby, won't you."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, indeed I will. Let me take her."</p>
                  <p>"Take her away? No—I can't—I shall never see her again! They tried to pull her
                     away from me, but they could not—we grew together! Bring me a little warm milk
                     for her. She has not sucked since yesterday morning, and then my milk was so
                     hot, I think it scalded her—I am sure it did not agree with her."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, pray," said Augusta, to the turnkey, who had replied to her inquiry, "that
                     the next room was just vacated, and could be made quite comfortable, "pray
                     procure a bed and blankets, and whatever will be of any use to her. I will pay
                     you for all your expense and trouble."</p>
                  <p>"Nothing can be of use," said the physician," whose fingers were on Fanny's
                     pulse; "her heart is fluttering with its last beats."</p>
                  <p>"Thank God!" murmured Augusta.</p>
                  <p>"Put your hand on her head. Did you ever feel such heat?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh dear, dear! it was that dreadful heat she spoke of in all her mental misery
                     last night."</p>
                  <p>A quick step was heard along the passage; a sobbing voice addressed the
                     turnkey, and in rushed Mrs. O'Roorke. She did not, as her people commonly do at
                     the sight of a dying creature, set up a howl, but she sunk on her knees, and
                     pressed her hand to her lips as if to hold in the words that were leaping from
                     her heart.</p>
                  <p>Fanny looked at her for a moment in silence, then, with a faint smile on her
                     quivering lips, she stretched her hand to her. "You have found me. I could not
                     find you. I walked—and walked." She closed her eyes and sunk back on her
                     pillow; her face became calmer, and when she again opened her eyes it was more
                     quiet. "Mrs. O'Roorke," she said, quite<pb n="388-389"
                        xml:id="VAC7726-00000194"/> distinctly, directing her eyes to Augusta, "this
                     lady believed me—tell her about me."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, I will—I will—I will."</p>
                  <p>"Hush—not now. Come here,—my baby is dead. I—God is good. I forgive—God is
                     love. My baby—yes—God—is—good."</p>
                  <p>In that unfailing goodness the mother and the child repose for ever.</p>
