IT is a melancholy fact, that this book is somewhat larger&#xD;
than the mould into which most of the fluid fiction material is&#xD;
poured in this degenerate age. You perceive, good reader, that&#xD;
it has run over.&#xD;
Doubtless the Procrustean critic would say, "Cut it of,"--&#xD;
0-&#xD;
which point we waive.&#xD;
The book is really of very moderate limits-considering that&#xD;
two women had to have their say in it.&#xD;
- It is pleasant to wear a glove when one shakes hands with the&#xD;
Public; therefore we still use our ancestors' names instead of&#xD;
our own,-but it is fair to state, that in this case there are a pair&#xD;
of gloves !--Which is the right glove, and which the left, the&#xD;
Public will never know.&#xD;
A word to that "dear delightful" class of readers who believe&#xD;
everything that is written, and do not- look at the number of the&#xD;
last page til they come to it-nor perhaps even then. Well&#xD;
they and the author know, that if the heroine cries-or laugls-.&#xD;
too much, it is nobody's fault but her own! Gently they quarrel&#xD;
with him for not permitting them to see every Jenny happily&#xD;
married and every Tom with settled good habits.  Most lenient&#xD;
readers!-when you turn publishers, then will such books doubt..&#xD;
les b written! Meantime, hear this.&#xD;

CHAPTER I.&#xD;
&#xD;
T HE street was broad, with sidewalks, and wide grass-&#xD;
grown borders, and a spacious track of wheels and&#xD;
horses' feet in the centre. Great elms, which the early&#xD;
settlers planted, waved their pendent branches over the&#xD;
peaceful highway, and gave shelter aid nest-room toy&#xD;
numerous orioles, killdeer, and robins; putting off their&#xD;
yellow leaves in the autumn, and, bearing their witer&#xD;
weight of snow, in seeming quiet assurance that spring&#xD;
would make amends for all. So slept the early settlers in&#xD;
the churchyard !&#xD;
Along the street, at pleasant neighbourly intervals-not&#xD;
near enough to be crowded, nor far enough to be lonely-.&#xD;
stood the houses,--comfortable, spacious, compact,-- "with&#xD;
no nonsense about them." The Mong lay like a mere blue&#xD;
thread in the distance, its course often pointed out by the&#xD;
gaff of some little sloop that followed the bends of the river&#xD;
up toward Suckiaug. The low rolling shore was spotted&#xD;
with towns and spires: over all was spread the fairest blue&#xD;
sky andlotinig specks of white.&#xD;
.kand     sounds were astir,-the robins Whistled, thief-&#xD;
like, o    e cherry-trees; the killdeer, from se  igh&#xD;
twi       north his sweet clear note; and now arnda E' a&#xD;
pair    wheels rolled softly "along the smooth road: e&#xD;
rush4the wind filled up the pauses. )Anybody we -was&#xD;

blue waters,--any one by the light-house might have heard&#xD;
the harsher dash of the salt waves.:&#xD;
I might go on, and s'ay that if anybody biad been looking&#xD;
out of Mrs, Derrick's window he or she might have seen-&#xD;
what Mrs. Derrick really sawI' For she was looking out&#xD;
of the window (or rather through the blind) at the critical&#xD;
moment that afternoon. It would be too much to say that&#xD;
she .placed herself there on purpose,.-let the reader sup-&#xD;
pose what he likes.&#xD;
At the time, then, that the village clock was striking four,&#xD;
when meditative cows were examining the length of their&#xD;
shadows, and all the geese were setting forth for their&#xD;
afternoon swim, a stranger opened Mrs. Derrick's little&#xD;
gate and walked in. Stretching 9it one hand to the dog&#xD;
in token of good fellowship, (a classical mind might ave&#xD;
fancied him breaking the cake by whose help Quickear got&#xD;
past the lions,) he went up the walk, neither fast nor slow,&#xD;
ascended the steps, and gave what Mrs. Derrick called "con-&#xD;
siderable of a rap" at the door.. That done, he faced about&#xD;
and looked at the fy off blue Mong.&#xD;
Not more intently did he eye and read that fair river;&#xD;
not more swiftly did his thoughts pass from the Mong to,&#xD;
things beyond human ken; than Mrs. Derrick eyed and&#xD;
read-his back, and suffered her ideas to roam into the far&#xD;
off regions of speculation. - The light summer coat, the&#xD;
straw hat; were nothing uncommon ; but the ,silk umbrella&#xD;
was too good for the. coat-the gloves and boots altogether&#xD;
extravagant!&#xD;
rvHeain't a bit like the .Pattaquasset folks, Faith,"&#xD;
she skid, in a whisper thrown over her, shoulder to her&#xD;
daughter.&#xD;
aMoth er-"&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick replied by an inarticulate sound of inIerro-'&#xD;
gation.&#xD;
gI wish you wouldn't stand just there:i Docome&#xD;
away!"'&#xD;
La, child,' said Mrs. Derrick, moving back about half&#xD;
an inch, "he's looking off into space."&#xD;
"But he'll be in.-"&#xD;
"Not till somebody goes to the door," said Mrs. Derrick,&#xD;
"and there's not a living soul in the house but' us tWo).n .&#xD;
&#xD;
'Why didn't you say so before ?  Must I go, m  her ?"&#xD;
"He didn't seem in a harry," said her mother,-."'d I&#xD;
wasn't. Yes, you can go if you like, child-and if you&#xD;
don't like, I'l go.&#xD;
With a somewhat slower step than usual, with a slight&#xD;
hesitating touch of her hand to the smooth brown lair&#xD;
which lay over her temples, Miss Faith moved through the&#xD;
hall to the front door, gently opened it, and stood th re,&#xD;
in the midst of the doorway, fronting the stranger. By no&#xD;
means n uncomely picture for the frame; for the face- was&#xD;
good, tie, figure trim, and nit only was the rich hair&#xD;
smooth, but a little white ruffle gave a dainty setting to&#xD;
the throat and chin whieh rose above it, both themselves&#xD;
rather on the dainty order.&#xD;
I say fronting the stranger,-yet to speak truth the&#xD;
stranger was not fronting her. For having made one more&#xD;
loud appeal to the'knocker; having taken off his hat, the&#xD;
better to feel the soft river breeze, he stood as before&#xD;
looking off into space ;" but with one hand resting more&#xD;
decidedly upon the silk umbrella.&#xD;
Faith. took a minute's view of decidedly pleasant outlines&#xD;
of shoulders and head-or what she thought such-glanced&#xD;
at the hand which grasped the umbrella handle,-and then&#xD;
lifting her own fingers to the~ knocker of the door, caused&#xD;
it gently to rise and fall.&#xD;
A somewhat long breath escaped the stignger-as if the&#xD;
sound chimed in with his thoughts-nothing more.&#xD;
Faith stood still and waited.&#xD;
Perhaps that last sound of the knocker had by degrees&#xD;
asserted its claim reality; perhaps impatience .bgan to&#xD;
assert its claim; perhaps that lopg elm-tree shadow which&#xD;
was 'creeping softly on, even to hf&amp;amp; very feet, broke in upon&#xD;
the muser's vision. Certainly he turned with a very quick&#xD;
motion towards the door, and a gesture of the hand which&#xD;
said that this time the 'knocker should speak out. The&#xD;
door however stood open,-the knocker beyond his reach ;&#xD;
and Miss Faith so nearly within it, that he dropped his&#xD;
hand even quicker than he hd raised it.&#xD;
"I beg your pardon !" he said, with a grave inclination&#xD;
of the head. -"I believe I knocked."&#xD;
"Yes, sir-I. thought you had forgotten," said Faiths&#xD;

not with perfect demureness, which she would like to have&#xD;
achieved. "Will you please to come in ?" And somewhat&#xD;
regardless.of consequences, leaving the hall door where it&#xD;
stood, Faith preceded her guest along the hall and again&#xD;
performed for-him the office of door-opener at the parlour,,&#xD;
ushering him thus into the presence of her mother.&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick was seated in the rocking-chair, at the&#xD;
furthest corner from the window, and perfectly engrossed&#xD;
with the last monthly magazine. But she came out of&#xD;
them'all with wonderful ease and promptness, shook hands&#xD;
very cordially with the new comer; seated 1im in her corner&#xD;
and chair before he could make much resis  e, and would&#xD;
also have plunged him into the magazine-but there he&#xD;
was firm.&#xD;
"If you would only make yourself comfortable while I'&#xD;
see where your baggage is !" said the good lady.&#xD;
"But I can tell you where it is, ma'am," said he looking&#xD;
up at her,-'"it is at the station, and will be here in half&#xD;
an hgur."&#xD;
"Well when did you have dinner ?" said Mrs. Derrick,&#xD;
resolved upon doing something..&#xD;
"Yesterday," was his quiet reply.. "To-day I have been&#xD;
in the cars."&#xD;
"0 my ! my !" said Mrs. Derrick,-"then of course we'll&#xD;
have tea at once. Faith !"&#xD;
"I'm here, mother. I'll go and see to it, right away."&#xD;
But in some mysterious manner the stranger reached the&#xD;
doorway before either of the ladies.&#xD;
"Mrs. Derrick-Miss Faith-I told you that I had had&#xD;
no dinner, and that was true. It is also true that I am&#xD;
in not the least hurry for tea. Please do not have it until&#xD;
your usual time." And he walked back to his seat.&#xD;
But after the slightest possible pause of hesitancy, Faith&#xD;
had disappeared. Her mother followed her.&#xD;
"Child," she said, "what on ear is his name ?"&#xD;
"Mother,-how should' I kno ? I didn't ask him."&#xD;
"But the thing is," said Mrs Derrick, "I did know,-.-&#xD;
the Committee told me all. about it. And of course he&#xD;
thinks I know, and I don't-no more than I do my gf-eat-&#xD;
grandmother's name, which I never did remember yet." -&#xD;

Ii&#xD;
&#xD;
"Mother-shall I go and ask him? or wait till after&#xD;
supper ?"&#xD;
"0 you shan't go," said her mother. "Wait till after&#xD;
supper and we'll send Cindy. He won't care about his&#xD;
name till he gets his tea, I'll warrant. But w hai .made&#xD;
you so long getting the door open, child ? Does it-stick ?"&#xD;
"Why," said Faith, baring her arms and entering upon&#xD;
sundry quick movements about the room; "it was open and&#xD;
he didn't know it."&#xD;
"Didn't know it 1" said .Mrs. Derrick,-"iny! I hope he&#xD;
ain't short-sighted, Now Faith, I'm not going to have&#xD;
you burn your face for all the school teachers in Connecti-&#xD;
cut. Keep away, child,--I'll put on the kettle myself.&#xD;
Cindy must have found her beau again--it's as tiresome'as&#xD;
tiresome can be."&#xD;
"It's just as well, mother; I'd rather. do it myself. Now&#xD;
you go in and find what his name is, and I'll have every-&#xD;
thing together directly. The oven's hot now."&#xD;
"I'll go in presently," said Mrs. Derrick; "but as to ask-&#xD;
ing him what his name is-la, child, I'd just as soon ask&#xD;
him ,where he came from."'. And in deep thought on the&#xD;
subject, Mrs. Derrick stepped briskly about the kitchen.&#xD;
"Faith;" she said, "where shall I ask him to sit?7"&#xD;
"Will you pour out tea-or shall I, mother ?"&#xD;
"What's that to do ?"&#xD;
"Why I was thinking-but it don't matter where you&#xD;
put him. There's four sides to the table."&#xD;
"Don't talk of my putting him anywhere, child-I'm as&#xD;
afraid of him as can be."  And Mrs. Derrick went back&#xD;
to see how time went with her guest.&#xD;
It went fast or slow, I suppose, after all, somewhat&#xD;
according to the state of his appetite. One hour and ten&#xD;
minutes certainly had slipped'away-if he was hungry he&#xD;
knew that another ten minutes was following in train.-&#xD;
when at length the parlour door opened again and Faith&#xD;
stood there, with a white apron on and cheeks a good deal&#xD;
heightened in colour since the date of their last appearance.&#xD;
"Mother, tea's ready. Cindy hasn't got back." ,And&#xD;
having made-this gentle announcement, Faith disappeared&#xD;
again, leaving it' to her mother to nhew the way to the&#xD;
supper-room.&#xD;

SAY AND SEAL.             13&#xD;
&#xD;
This was back of the parlor and communicated with the&#xD;
kitchen, from which Faith came in as they entered, bearing&#xD;
a plate of white biscuits, smoking hot, in her hand. The&#xD;
floor was painted with thick yellow paint,' smooth and&#xD;
shining; plenty of windows let in plenty of light and the&#xD;
sweet evening air; the table stood covered with a clean&#xD;
brownish table-cloth,-but. what a.supper covered that!&#xD;
Rosy slices of boiled ham, snowy rounds of 'milk empty-&#xD;
ings' bread, strawberries, pot-cheeses, pickles, fried pota-&#xD;
toes, and Faith's white cakes, with tea and coffee!&#xD;
Now as Faith had laid the clean napkin for the stranger&#xD;
at the foot of the table, opposite her mother, it cannot be&#xD;
thought presumption in him. that he at once took his seat&#xD;
there; thus relieving Mrs. Derrick's mind of an immense&#xD;
responsibility. Yet something in his manner then made&#xD;
her papse and look at him; though she did not expect to&#xD;
see him bow his head and Isk for a blessing on thelmeal be-&#xD;
fore them. If that was presumption, neither of his hearers&#xD;
felt it so,-the little flush on the mother's cheek told rather&#xD;
of emotion, of some old memory now quickened into life.&#xD;
Her voice even trembled a little as she said,--&#xD;
"Will you have-tea or coffee, sir ?"&#xD;
And Faith offered her biscuit.&#xD;
"Or there's bread, if you like it better, sir."&#xD;
"The biscuits.are best," said her mother,.-"Faith's bis-&#xD;
cuits are always good."&#xD;
And he took a biscuit, while a very slight unbending of&#xD;
the lines of his face said that the excellence of faith's&#xD;
handiwork was at least not always so apparent.&#xD;
"Miss Faith, what shall.I give you in return that is be-&#xD;
yond your reach and (comparatively) within mine ?"&#xD;
Possibly-possibly, the slight grave opening of two rather&#xD;
dark eyes.confessed that in her apprehension the store thus&#xD;
designated, from which he might give her, was very large&#xD;
indeed.. But if that was so, her lips came short of the&#xD;
truth, for she answered,--&#xD;
"I don't want anything, thank you."&#xD;
"Not even butter ?"-with his hand on the knife.&#xD;
Faith seemed inclined+not to want butter, but finally&#xD;
submitted and held out her plate. Whereupon, having&#xD;
&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
helped her and himself, the stranger diverged a little, with&#xD;
the rather startling question,-...&#xD;
"What sort of a Flora have you in this neighbourhood ?"&#xD;
"There isn't any, mother ?" said Faith, with a doubtful&#xD;
appeal towards the tea-tray.&#xD;
A pleasant look fell upon her while her look went away---&#xD;
a look which said he would like to tell her all about the&#xD;
matter, then and there; but merely taking another of the&#xD;
white biscuits, he weft on to ask whether the roads were&#xD;
good and the views fine.&#xD;
"The roads are first-rate," said Mrs. Derrick. "I don't&#xD;
know much of views myself, but Faith thinks they're won-&#xD;
derful.&#xD;
 "I don't suppose they are wonderful," said Faith; "but&#xD;
it is pretty up the Mong, and I am sure, mother, it's'pretty&#xD;
down on the shore, towards the sunsetting.'&#xD;
"And how is it towards the sunrising ?"&#xD;
"I never saw it---we never go down there then,P Faith&#xD;
said, with a very frank smile.&#xD;
"Faith always stays by me," said Mrs. Derrick; "if I&#xD;
can't go, she won't. And of course I never can at that&#xD;
time of day. It's quite a way down to the shore."&#xD;
"What shore ?"&#xD;
"It's the sea-shore-that is, not the real-sea-shore-it's&#xD;
only the Sound," said Faith; "but there is the salt-water,&#xD;
and it;{pas good as the sea.&#xD;
"How far off ?" said  he stranger, bestowing upon Faith&#xD;
a saucer of strawberries.&#xD;
Faith would have asked him to help himself, but taking&#xD;
notice mentally that he was extremely likely to do so, she&#xD;
contented herself with relying, "It's about two miles."&#xD;
"And what are some of the 'good' things there ?"&#xD;
"Perhaps you wouldn't think it much," said Paith&#xD;
modestly ;--"but the water is pretty, and I like to see the&#xD;
ships and vessels on it going up and down; and the points&#xD;
of the shore and the wet stones look such beautiful colours&#xD;
when the sun is near set."&#xD;
"I like stones--whether wet or dry," said her ques-&#xD;
tioner.&#xD;
'Most people here don't like them," said Faith. "But&#xD;

there are plenty down by the sea-shore.-And plenty on&#xD;
the farm too," she added.&#xD;
"Ah, people like and dislike things for very different&#xD;
reasons, Miss Faith," he answered ; "so perhaps your&#xD;
neighbours and I are not so far apart in our opinions as you&#xD;
may think. Only I believe, that while there is 'a time to&#xD;
cast away stones,' there is also 'a time to gather stones&#xD;
together'-and therein perhaps they would not agree with&#xD;
S me."&#xD;
Faith looked up, and her lips parted--and if the thought&#xD;
had been spoken which parted them, it would probably f&#xD;
have been a confession that she did not understand, or a&#xD;
request for more light. But if her face did not say it for&#xD;
her, she did not say it for herself.&#xD;
If anybody could have seen   s. Derrick's face while&#xD;
these little sentences went back aid forth, he would have&#xD;
acknowledged it was worth the sight. Her awe and ad-&#xD;
miration of every word uttered by the stranger-the intense&#xD;
interest with which she waited for every word spoken by&#xD;
Faith-the slight look of anxiety changing to one. of per-&#xD;
fect satisfaction,-was pretty to see.&#xD;
"Faith," she said when tea; was over, and her guest had&#xD;
walked to the front door 'to take another look at 'space&#xD;
"Faith, don't you think he liked his supper ?"&#xD;
"I should think he would-after having no dinner," s id&#xD;
Faith.&#xD;
"But it was such a mercy, child, that you hadn't gone&#xD;
out to supper anywhere-I can't think what I shou14 have&#xD;
done. There's Cindy this minute !.Lrun and tell her to go&#xD;
right away and find out, what his name is-tell her I want&#xD;
to know,-you can put it in good words."&#xD;
"Mother !-I'd rather ask Ihim myself."&#xD;
But that did not suit Mrs. Derrick's ideas of propriety.&#xD;
And stepping.out into the kitchen she despatched Cindy&#xD;
on her errand. Cindy presently came back from the front&#xD;
door, and went into the dining-rooni, but not finding Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick she handed a card to Faith.&#xD;
"It's easy done," said Cindy. "I just asked him if he'd&#xD;

his eyes at me and 'said no. -Then I said,'says I, Mis'&#xD;

Faith took the card and read,-&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
THE next day was Saturday. The morning opened with&#xD;
T grey clouds, covering the sky, but which were light&#xD;
and light-broken and promised to roll away entirely as&#xD;
soon as the sun should reach a commanding position in the&#xD;
heavens.  The sun however was still quite distant from&#xD;
such a position; in fact was not much more than an hour&#xD;
high, when Lucinda, who was sweeping the front door&#xD;
steps, was hailed, from the front door by a person not one&#xD;
of, the party of the preceding eve ing, and very unlike&#xD;
either of them. It was a lady, no young, of somewhat&#xD;
smell fire, trim, and nicely dres ed. Indeed she was&#xD;
rather handsomely dressed and in somewhat French taste;&#xD;
she had showy gold earrings in her ears, and a head much&#xD;
more in the mode than either Mrs. Derrick's or her&#xD;
meughter's. The face of this lady was plain, decidedly; but&#xD;
redeemed by a look of sense and shrewdness altogether un-&#xD;
mixed with ill nature. The voice spoke alertiand pleasantly.&#xD;
"So Lucindy, you had company last night, didn't you ?"&#xD;
"May be we did and may be we didn't," said Lucindy,&#xD;
brushing away with great energy at an imaginary bit of&#xD;
lint at the end of the upper step. " I do' knowbtw'&#xD;
just" as good call him one of, the family."&#xD;
"So much at home already ?  I missed seeing him last&#xD;
night-.--I couldn't get home.. What's he like, Cindy? and&#xD;
what'has he done ?"&#xD;
"'Done ?" said Cindy-" well he's went out a'most afore&#xD;
.I was up. And as to like, Miss Dilly-just you look at him&#xD;
when lie comes in. - He looks dome like folks, and yet he&#xD;
don't; neither."&#xD;
"He's out, is he ?"&#xD;
"Yes," said Cindy, reducing a large family of spiders to&#xD;
temporary starvation and despair,--" he's out--if he ain't&#xD;
gone in nowheres. Miss Dilly, if you'll stand just inside&#xD;
the door I can wash the steps just as well. ..&#xD;

"What's the gentleman out so early for ?  Maybe he'&#xD;
missed some of his luggage, Cindy."&#xD;
"Hope he ha'n't got no more-without its lighter, said&#xD;
Cindy.  "However, he carried it upstairs himself; 'r free&#xD;
to confess. I guess'twarn't for luggage he went put,'ause&#xD;
he asked about breakfast time, special."&#xD;
"If he means to be out till then he'll have a good walk&#xD;
of it."&#xD;
It wantedfive minutesof breakfast time, and Mrs. Det'&#xD;
rick--what with stepping into the kitchen to oversee Cindy,&#xD;
and stepping to the front window to oversee the street--&#xD;
was warm enough for a cooler morning.&#xD;
"Faithshe said, referring as usual to her daughter,&#xD;
"Faih.   htshall we do if he don't come ?"&#xD;
"I guess he'll come, mother ;--he knows the time. The&#xD;
things won't hurt much by waiting a little."&#xD;
As she spoke, the little front gate swung softly to, and&#xD;
the person in question came leisurely up the steps and into&#xD;
the hall. Then having just glanced into the parlor, he at&#xD;
once-with a promptitude which bespoke.him too punctual&#xD;
himself to doubt the punctuality of others--advanced to&#xD;
the dining-room door and walked in.&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick's face shewed gratification mingled with&#xD;
her good nature. Faith smiled ; and Miss Dilly was duly&#xD;
introduced as Miss Delia Danforth, Mrs. Derrick's aunt,&#xD;
then on a visit at Pattaquasset.&#xD;
"You've taken an early stroll this morning, sir," said&#xD;
this last lady. 1"View the country ?f1&#xD;
"tNo," said Mr. Linden, "I have been viewing the&#xD;
town."&#xD;
" Ah! Well I call that viewing the country. Town and&#xD;
country, all's one here; and it makes a very pleasant sort&#xD;
of place. But .what do you call the town, sir ?.-Doyyon&#xD;
drink coffee "&#xD;
The town,", said Mr. Linden, in. answer to the first&#xD;
question.---receiving his coffee-cup from Mrs. Derrick by&#xD;
way of answer to the second,-"means in 'this instance,&#xD;
Miss Danforth, that spot of country which is most thickly&#xD;
settled. Yes, ma'am--I.. drink coffee."&#xD;
"Very bad for you, sir ;y don't you know it ?n&#xD;

<pb  n="18-19" xml:id="VAC8219-00000009"/>&#xD;
18                 SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
"Bad for ime as one of the human race ? or as an indi-&#xD;
vidual specially marked out not to drink it ?"&#xD;
"Dear me 1" said Miss Danforth sipping her, own tea,-&#xD;
"I don't know what you are 'marked out' for. I think it's&#xD;
a mistake for everybody to think he is 'marked' for some-&#xD;
thing special.-they set the mark themselves, and generally&#xD;
it'don't fit."&#xD;
"But the fact that a man often gets the wrong mark, by&#xD;
no means proves that there is no right one which belongs&#xD;
to him' said Mr. Linden, looking gravely at Faith as if he&#xD;
meant'she should smile.&#xD;
Faith seemed' to look at the question however rather&#xD;
seriously, for dropping her knife and fork she asked,&#xD;
"How shall a man know his mark ?"&#xD;
"By earnest consideration and prayer," he answered,&#xD;
really grave this time. " I know of no other way, Miss&#xD;
Faithn"&#xD;
What a remark that was i it silenced the whole table.&#xD;
Knives and forks and spoons had it alone, with only words&#xD;
of necessity; till Faith asked Mr. Linden Wf he would not&#xD;
have another cup of coffee.&#xD;
"ICertainly 1" he said, handing her his cup. "There is&#xD;
so much to be saidon both sides of that little bit of china--&#xD;
I must not be partial in my attention."&#xD;
"But you can't study both sides of a subject at once,"&#xD;
said the coffee-hater.&#xD;
"Then take them alternately--and (figuratively) walk&#xD;
rounA your coffee-cup, surveying its fair proportions from&#xD;
different points of view. If the coffee is strong and you&#xD;
are neryous-that's one thing. Again, if the coffee be&#xD;
weak and you be phlegmatic-that's another."&#xD;
"The coffee's not strongg to-day," said Mrs. Derrick with&#xD;
a regretful shake of the head.&#xD;
" Nor am I phlegmatic,"-with the slightest possible&#xD;
indication of a smile.&#xD;
"Do you think," said Miss Danforth, "a man is better&#xD;
able .to decide questions of common judgment for having&#xD;
studied a great deal ?.--learned a great many things, I&#xD;
mean:"                                      .     .&#xD;
" That depends very much upon what effect his studies&#xD;
have had upon his judgment. Mrs. Derrick--are you trying&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.             19&#xD;
&#xD;
to break me off from coffee by degrees ? this cup has no&#xD;
sugar in it,"&#xD;
"0 my " said Mrs. Derrick, colouring up in the greatest&#xD;
confusion. "I do beg your pardon, sir 1 Faith, take the&#xD;
sugar-bowl, child, and pick out some large lumps."&#xD;
"You will get more praise from Miss Danforth, than&#xD;
blame from me, ma'am," said Mr. Linden, submitting his&#xD;
cup to Faith's amendment and watching the operation.&#xD;
"I don't know," said Miss Danforth goodhumouredly.&#xD;
"Maybe he can stand it.-If he takes two cups I should&#xD;
say he can. How do you like the profession of teaching,&#xD;
sir ?"&#xD;
Now to, say truth, Mr. Linden did not know--not by&#xD;
actual practice, but it was also e truth which he did not&#xD;
feel bound to disclose. He therefore stirred his coffee with&#xD;
a good deal of deliberation, and even tasted it, before he&#xD;
replied,&#xD;
" What would you say to me, Miss Danforth, if I pro-&#xD;
fessed to be fond of teaching some ,people some things ?&#xD;
Miss Faith, that lash lump of sugar was potent."&#xD;
"What sort of people, and what sort of things, for in-&#xD;
tance ?" said the lady.&#xD;
" The things I know best, and the people who think they&#xD;
know least-for instance" he replied.&#xD;
"I should say -you know definitions," was Miss Dan-&#xD;
forth's again goodhumoured rejoinder.&#xD;
"What did you say was the matter with the sugar, sir ?"&#xD;
said Faith.&#xD;
"I said. it was potent, Miss Faith,-or I might have&#xD;
said, powerful. . But indeed it was not the sugar's fault.-..&#xD;
the difficulty was, there was not enough coffee to counter-&#xD;
balance it."&#xD;
" I put in too much 1" said Faith, making ,a regretful&#xD;
translation of this polite speech.&#xD;
"Yes"-said Mr. Linden with great solemnity s he set&#xD;
down the empty cup,--"but too much sugar is at east not&#xD;
a common misfortune. With what appreciation I shall&#xD;
look back to this, some day when I have not nough!&#xD;
What did you think of the sunrise this morning ?"L&#xD;
" Do you mean, because the sky was covered with e ouds 7"&#xD;
said Faith. " But there was enough--the sun looked&#xD;

them ?"&#xD;
J   I wonder when you did, child 1" said Miss Danforth;&#xD;
--."up to your elbows in butter !"&#xD;
"Yes, I saw them. Then you are true to your name,&#xD;
Miss Faith, and find 'enough' in a cloudy sky ?--Pray, Miss&#xD;
Danforth, what depth of- butter does a churning yield in&#xD;
this. region?"&#xD;
"I guess," said Miss Danforth laughing, "you never&#xD;
saw much.of farmer's work-did you,?"&#xD;
"Is butter-making farmer's work ?" said Mr. Linden&#xD;
with a face of grave inquiry.&#xD;
"Here's the trustys"--said Cindy opening. the door;&#xD;
"at least that's what they said they be, but I'm free to&#xD;
confess 'tain't nobody but Squire Deacon and Parson&#xD;
Somers."&#xD;
"])Po they want me ?" said Mr. Linden looking round.&#xD;
"I guess likely"-said Cindy. "The Squire does come&#xD;
here to see Miss Faith, but I guess 'tain't her he wants this&#xD;
time."&#xD;
And Cindy vanished.&#xD;
"What do the trusteeswant ?" said Miss Danforth.&#xD;
"Upon the testimony of Cinderella, they want me," said&#xD;
Mr. Linden. "Miss Faith, may I have a glass of water ?&#xD;
What they want to do with me, Miss Danforth, is a little&#xD;
uncertain."&#xD;
"uWell," said Miss Danforth, " I think you'll be able to&#xD;
prevent them I"&#xD;
IHe rose to take the glass from Faith's hand, and then&#xD;
merely inquiring whether the ladies were coming to second&#xD;
him, left the room.&#xD;
Parson Somers was a young-looking, good-looking, affa-&#xD;
ble gentleman, who pressed the ladies; hands very cordially&#xD;
and was very happy to see them. Squire Deacon was&#xD;
younger, and likewise good looking, but affability he had&#xD;
never been charged with. r Over the handsome cut of face,&#xD;
the strong well-built figure, he wore a manner as rough&#xD;
as a bear's great-coat ; only at some times and fCor some&#xD;
people the roughness was brushed down. It never would&#xD;
stay, any more than the various elegant phrases with which&#xD;

Squire Deacon sometimes seasoned his speech, would take&#xD;
root there and spread.&#xD;
"Quite an agreeable variation,"said Mr. homers,---"ha..&#xD;
insuch a place as Pattaquasset-...-to have a new. arrival&#xD;
among us. Mr. Linden-I hope you will like our little&#xD;
town. You have a pleasant experience of us to begin&#xD;
with."&#xD;
"Yes but, Parson, don't make him think we're all like&#xD;
some," said Squire Deacon,-and as he turned towards&#xD;
h     the beaming of his face seemed almost reflected in&#xD;
hithbassbuttons.  "Dreadful gloomy morning, Miss&#xD;
"Mr. Linden has probably seen too much of the world,"&#xD;
said Mr. Somer,-." not to know that---ha !--too great a&#xD;
preponderance of good is not to be looked for."&#xD;
"May as well look for as much as you can find," sai&#xD;
Miss Danforth. ".A good deal's lost by not looking fo&#xD;
"Ah," said the Squire, with another glance at Faith,&#xD;
it's not so hard to find things, neither, Miss Danforth,&#xD;
You remember Sinbad the sailor lookin' down into the vale&#xD;
of diamonds ?"&#xD;
"Don't remember him a bit. What did he see there ?"&#xD;
"Nothin' but diamond jewelry," said Squire Deacon in&#xD;
a sentimental tone. "Miss Faith, you doubtless recollect&#xD;
the tale ?"&#xD;
"I hope," said Mr. Somers,-...." ha !-friendDeacon-.you&#xD;
don't mean that Mr. Linden should look for a valley of&#xD;
diamonds in Pattaquasset ?"&#xD;
"dWhereabouts does the valley lie, sir ?" said Mr. Lin.&#xD;
den.&#xD;
But the Squire, as if a new idea had struck him, replied&#xD;
somewhat brusq ely,&#xD;
It don't lie nowheres, sir, nowheres but in fancy's field."&#xD;
"I suppose," said Mr. Somers smiling blandly, "Mr.&#xD;
Linden's peculiar course of business don't lead him much&#xD;
into that field."&#xD;
"You can strike into it 'most anywhere," said Miss Dan-&#xD;

'Miss Faith told me there were stones enough here,"&#xD;
he said, "but she did not hint that aff them were pre-&#xD;

"We shall expect," said Mr. Somers, "to seeasome of&#xD;

that he was a 'trusty' "what do you consider the best&#xD;

"I think sir, if the boys are very rough I should first&#xD;
teach th~'m' manners. If they are smoother boys, I should&#xD;
teach them spelling,-.if they have already learned spelling,&#xD;
I shqp4d let them read."&#xD;
The Squire bowed   i&#xD;

Mr. Linden would like to visit our little temple of lit-&#xD;
I should be very gratified to accompany Mr. Linden&#xD;
in vIew shouch of Pattaquasset. I trust, Mr. Linden,.&#xD;
in viewinghsoemtha--the moral and religious teaching, of&#xD;
the youth here, will no be quite overlooked in your system."&#xD;
The reply that first rose to Mr. Linden's lips came not&#xD;
forth. He checked himself-rather perhaps  i deference&#xD;
to the subject than anything else, and simply answered,&#xD;
'Itrust not,si.&#xD;
And with many low bows from the Squire, the two gen-&#xD;
tlemen went into the hall, Mr. Linden following. But he&#xD;
comeback the next moment to ask the diner hour.&#xD;
cmWe are as apt to have it at noon as any time," said&#xD;
Faith. "Will that do, Mr. Linden? we could have it&#xD;
later."&#xD;
"That will do perfectly. Only if the temple of litera-&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
11ONDAY morning came, with its hands full of' work.&#xD;
vi  They were willing hands that were outstretched to&#xD;
receive the load,--strong hands too, and skilful; but: it&#xD;
may be, better suited to other work. Cer.tainly as the&#xD;
days passed Endecott's gravity took a deeper tinge, and&#xD;
his words became fewer.' Still maintaining his morning.&#xD;
walk, and a like tasting of the air at night,-ever punctual&#xD;
at meals, and when there displaying an unruffled equanim--&#xD;
ity and cheerfulness,-the even tones of his voice shewed&#xD;
sometimes a little weariness, and his step grew more&#xD;
thoughtful. And so the week rolled on, and the afternoon&#xD;
sun of Friday began to near the horizon.&#xD;
It was a warm afternoon, soft and balmy; a little haze&#xD;
on the sky, the least veil uponsthe Mong's further shore;-&#xD;
the summer roses hanging their heads, heavy with sleep&#xD;
and sweetness. The' honeysuckles on the porch grew&#xD;
sweeter and sweeter as the sun went down, and the hum-&#xD;
ming-birds dipped into those long flagons, or poised them-&#xD;
selves in mid-air for a survey.&#xD;
In the porch sat the three ladies. Each had been busy,&#xD;
influences.. The warm breeze was softly rubbing Faith's&#xD;
cheek with its rouging fingers, and her mother gazed--nor&#xD;
could give one look to humming-birds or roses.&#xD;
Her thoughts however, took greater range---or the low&#xD;
chiming of the village clock sent them off; for she pres-&#xD;
ently said,&#xD;
"Faith, my dearwhat have we got for tea ?"--.that meal&#xD;
being under Faith's special superintendence.&#xD;
" Very good blackberries, mother, and beautiful. rasp-&#xD;
berries; and I cut my cream-cheese; and Cindy is ready&#xD;
bake the bannoeks. Butter's as sweet as it can bethis&#xD;
churning.  Will that do ?--Mr. Linden likes raspberri&#xD;
an  ream," she added a little lower.&#xD;
rs. Derrick~ gave 'a comprehensive "Yes, chid, dq&#xD;

both parts of Faith's reply, and then stopped and looked&#xD;
away up the street. For down the street at that moment&#xD;
came Mr. Linden, walking leisurely, his head bent towards&#xD;
one of his older scholars who had both hands clasped&#xD;
round his arm. The boy's upraised eager face shewed&#xD;
even at a distance how earnestly he was talking.&#xD;
"There he comes !" said Miss Danforth.&#xD;
"Who is that with him ?" said Faith.&#xD;
"Reuben Taylor, child," her mother answered.&#xD;
Then as they came near the gate, and stopped and&#xD;
shook hands, Reuben cried out (in answer to words which&#xD;
they did not hear)&#xD;
"Let me go I do, please, Mr. Lipden !".--and went ; while&#xD;
his teacher opened the gate, picked one of the drooping&#xD;
roses, came up the steps and taking off his hat bowed to&#xD;
the assembled ladies.&#xD;
"Well, Mr. Linden," said Miss Danforth, "how do you&#xD;
find the Pattaquasset diamonds ?"&#xD;
"I find, madam, that they shine-as is the custom of&#xD;
diamonds."&#xD;
"IAre you going to let Reuben Taylor go ?"&#xD;
"Whither ?" said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"Why, where he asked you. Is he one of Mr. Somers'&#xD;
precious stones ?"&#xD;
"1He has gone," was the smiling reply. "Precious ?.&#xD;
..-..yes,-everybody is precious in one sense."&#xD;
"You haven't been to college for nothing," said Miss&#xD;
Danforth, who would talk about anything. "I should like&#xD;
you to find-out in what sense I am precious. I've a good&#xD;
many friends-but there isn't one of 'em that wouldn't eat&#xD;
and drink just as well with me out of the world a1 in it."&#xD;
He smiled a little-though rather soberly, and stood&#xD;
watching the changing colours of clouds and sky for a&#xD;
minute or two without speaking. Then, half to himself&#xD;
-as it were, low but very distinctly, he repeated--&#xD;
"'And they shall be mine, saith the Lord, in the day&#xD;
. when I make up my jewels.'"&#xD;
The answer to this was only in pantomime, but striking.&#xD;
Miss Danforth did not speak, and instead thereof turned&#xD;
her head over her shoulder and looked away steadily over&#xD;
the meadows which stretched north -of the house into the&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
distance. Faith's eyes fell to the floor and the lids drooped&#xD;
over them ; and as plain a veil of shadow fell upon her face;&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick's eyes went from one to the other with a lodk&#xD;
which was not unwonted  with her, and a little sigh which&#xD;
said she thought everybody was good but herself.&#xD;
"Bain't ye never comin'in to supper ?" said Cindy, framy&#xD;
ing herself in the doorway. "I want to get out after&#xD;
supper, Miss Faith," she said dropping her voice,.-.- "I do,&#xD;
real bad."&#xD;
"Is all ready, Cindy 7"&#xD;
"Yes marm," said Cindy. "I'm free to confess-there's&#xD;

"Miss Faith, when do you mean to shew me the shore ?"&#xD;
said Mr. Linden turning round.&#xD;
"You have been so busy all the week," said Faith,.-..&#xD;
"and then you didn't speak. of it, Mr. Linden--I can go&#xD;
any time."&#xD;
"My dear," said Mrs. Derrick, "there comes Squire&#xD;
Deacon. Maybe he'll stay to supper. I'll go and. put on&#xD;
another cup."&#xD;
Mr. Linden gave one glance at the opening gate, and&#xD;
followed Mrs. Derrick into the house.&#xD;
"Miss Faith," said the Squire, " do you think the night&#xD;
dews conducive to-to your comfort ?"&#xD;
"When they are falling," said Faith 'abstractedly&#xD;
"Why not, Mr. Deacon ?r                         d&#xD;
" To be sure !" said the Squire gallantly,......"honeysuckles&#xD;
and such things do. But what I mean is this. Cilly's&#xD;
going' to get up a great shore party to-morrow, and she&#xD;
says she couldn't touch a mouthful down there if you didn't&#xD;
go. And like enough some other folks couldn't neither."&#xD;
"Mother's gone in to tea. Will you come in and ask&#xD;
her, Squire ?"&#xD;
"Couldn't stay, Miss Faith-Cilly's lookin' out for me&#xD;
now. But you can tell-..your mother 'll go if you -do.,-o&#xD;
you can go if she don't, you and Miss.D'anforth. It's&#xD;

Faith hesitated, and pulled a leaf or two from the honey-&#xD;
suckle; then she spoke boldly.&#xD;
But you forget we have a gentleman here, Squire;--&#xD;
we can't go without Mr. Linden."&#xD;
"I don't want his help to drive my horse," said the&#xD;
Squire, with a little change of tone,-.-."but whoever hin-&#xD;

Squire, relapsing, into his former self.&#xD;
"1We'll come down then some time in the course of the&#xD;
afternoon," said Faith, "and see what you are doing."&#xD;
"Then.I sha'n't drive you down, sha'n't I ?" said $quire&#xD;
Deacon. " Never mind-it's no matter, come when you&#xD;

the Squire closed the little gate after him energetically..&#xD;

could you keep Squire Deacon so long, and then send him&#xD;
home to supper !" .&#xD;
"It's all your fault, sir," said Miss Danforth cheerfully.&#xD;
"And I guess the Squire has got his supper."&#xD;
"He must be a man of quick despatch," said Mr. Lin-&#xD;

" Mother, there's a shore party to-morrow."&#xD;
"Who's going, child ?"&#xD;
"Squire Deacon and Cecilia-and I don't know who,&#xD;
else--nd he came. to ask us. Will you go and take tea&#xD;
with us at the shore, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"Does that mean that my tea is to be transported to the&#xD;
shore, and that I am to go there to find it, Miss.Faith ?"&#xD;
"You have a very puzzling way of putting things," said&#xD;
Faith laughing, though her look bore out her words. "I&#xD;
dcn't think it means that. Your tea won't be there before&#xD;
you are, Mr. Linden. Wouldn't you like to go ?"&#xD;

I, think I will go. Is not that your advice, Miss Faith?&#xD;
What are-the pros and cons.--if you were to state them&#xD;
fairly ?"&#xD;
"Well," said Faith, "you \Vill have a pleasant ride, or&#xD;
walk, down-whichever you like;-I think it is very pleasa-&#xD;
ant. You can go in the water, if you like, which every-&#xD;
body does; there's a beautiful shore ; and I suppose that&#xD;

"I said we would come after, mother"&#xD;
"The Squire only said there was ro m on the shore,"&#xD;
added Miss Danforth.&#xD;
" Is the shore wide enough for us to drive down there ?&#xD;

Mr. Linden made no comment upon that, and finished&#xD;
his tee in comparative silence. Then went forth, as was&#xD;
his custom, to the post-office, and-as was not his custom--&#xD;
returned very soon. Mrs. Derrick and Miss Danforth had&#xD;
gone out to see a neighbour, and Faith sat alone in the&#xD;
twilight parlour. It was very twilight there, but he walked&#xD;
in and stood waiting for his eyes to discover what there&#xD;
might be.&#xD;
"There is nobody here but me, Mr. Linden," said a&#xD;
very soft and clear voice. "Do you want anything ?"&#xD;
"I wanted to see you--and am foiled by the darkness.&#xD;
Are you tired, Miss Faitli ?"&#xD;
"Never. I wasn't sitting in the dark for that."&#xD;
"Would you object t9 coming into the light ?"&#xD;
"Not at all," said Faith laughing. "Which way ?"&#xD;
"There is to be a fine illumination to-night, which I&#xD;
should like to have you see."&#xD;
"An illumination !  Where is' it?  Shall I want my&#xD;
bonnet ?"&#xD;
"You will be better illuminated without it,--but you may&#xD;
perhaps take cold."&#xD;
"How do you makeyour scholars understand you ?"&#xD;
said Faith. "I am sure I must need illuminating.-,--So&#xD;
much, that I had better leave my bonnet, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
" I think you may--if you will take some light substi-&#xD;
tute. Why my, scholars are my scholars, Mist Faith."&#xD;
"What then ?" said Faith stopping short.&#xD;
"Why then I am their teacher."&#xD;
"I half wish I was a scholar too," said Faith with a&#xD;
tone which filled up the other 'half'-"I don't know&#xD;
much, Mr. Linden."&#xD;
"About illuminations?  I will promise you some light&#xD;
upon that point."&#xD;
With which encouragement, Faith fetched the scarf which&#xD;
was to do duty for a bonnet if desired, and they set out.&#xD;
"Now Miss Faith," said her companion as he closed&#xD;
the gate, "if you will shew me the road, I will sh6w you&#xD;
the shore.-=Which will not at all interfere with your shew-&#xD;
ing it to me to-morrow.&#xD;
"The .shore !" said Faith. " To-night ? Are you in&#xD;
earnest ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
S   "Very much in ea~rnest. You prefer some other road ?"&#xD;
"No indeed-it's beautiful, and I like it very much.&#xD;
-indy," she said to that damsel whom they opportunely&#xD;
pissed at the entrance of the lane-"you tell my mother&#xD;
I am gone to take a walk."  And so they passed on.&#xD;
The way was down a lane breaking from the high road&#xD;
of the village, just by Mrs. Derrick's house. It was a&#xD;
quiet country lane; passing between fields of grass or&#xD;
grain, with few trees near at hand. , Here and there a&#xD;
house, small and unnotable like the trees. Over all the&#xD;
country the moon, near full though not high, threw a gen-&#xD;
tle light; revealing to the fancy a less picturesque land-&#xD;
scape thin the sun would have shewn ; for there were no&#xD;
strong lines or points to be mademore striking by her&#xD;
partial touches, and its greatest beauty lay in the details&#xD;
which she could not light up. The soft and rich colours of&#xD;
grain and grass, the waving tints of broken ground and&#xD;
hillside, were lost. now ; the flowers in the hedges had&#xD;
shrunk into obscurity; the thrifty and well-to-do order of&#xD;
every field and haystack, could hardly-be noted even by&#xD;
bne who knew it was there... Only the white soft glimmer&#xD;
on a wide pleasant land; the faint lighting of one side of&#xD;
trees and fences, the broader salutation to a house-front,-&#xD;
and the deeper shadow which sometimes told of a piece of&#xD;
woodland ,or a slight hilly elevation.&#xD;
Then all that was passed; and the road descended a lit-&#xD;
tle steep to where it crossed, by a wooden bridge, a small&#xD;
stream or bed of a creek. Here .the moon, now getting&#xD;
up- in the sky, did greater execution; the little winding&#xD;
piece of water glittered in silver patches, and its sedgy&#xD;
borders were softly touched out; with the darke' outlines of&#xD;
two or three fishing-boats.&#xD;
And so on, towards the shore. Now the salt smell met&#xD;
and mingled with the perfume of woods and flowers, and&#xD;
the road grew more and more sandy. But still/the fields&#xD;
waved with Indian-corn, were sweet with hay, o furrowed&#xD;
with potatoes. Then'the outlines of sundry frame bathing-&#xD;
houses appeared in the distance, and near them the road&#xD;
came to an end.&#xD;
The shore was improved by the -moonight,-its great&#xD;
rocks, slippery with sea-weed, glittered with a wet sheen.&#xD;

The Sound wore its diamonds royally, and each tiny wave&#xD;
broke in a jewelled light upon the sand. Far in the dis-&#xD;
tance the dim shore of Long Island lay like a black line&#xD;
upon the water; and sloops and schooners sailed softly&#xD;
On their course, or tacked across the rippling waves, a&#xD;
fleet of "Black spirits and white."&#xD;
"What do you think of the illumination, Miss Faith ?"&#xD;
said her companion, when they had sat still for five min-&#xD;
utes.&#xD;
"What do you think of it, I think I should say. Mr.&#xD;
Linden, I have chewed you the shore !"&#xD;
"You!"-&#xD;
"Who else ?"&#xD;
"Were you ever here before by moonlight ?"&#xD;
"I don't know-No, I think not. Were you ever here&#xD;
before at all ?n"&#xD;
" Is it owing to you hat I am here now&#xD;
"sYou couldn't h got here without me," said Faith,&#xD;
stooping to turn-over some of the glittering pebbles at her&#xD;
feet ;-"and I couldn't have got here without you. I am&#xD;
willing to allow that we are square, Mr. Linden. I must !&#xD;
--for you will .turn a corner faster than I ean -catch&#xD;
you."                  2&#xD;
" If you really suppose that first proposition to be true,"&#xD;
said Mr. Linden-raising 4is eyebrows, "why of course there&#xD;
is' no more to be said. Miss Faith, how would you like to&#xD;
be sailing about in one of those phantom ships?"&#xD;
"I should like it very well," said Faith, "in a good&#xD;
time. I went to Pequot in one once. It was very pleas-&#xD;
ant. Why do you call them phantoms ?"&#xD;
"Look at that one standing off across' the moonlight&#xD;
towards the other shore,-gliding along so silently with her&#xD;
black sails all' set,--does she look real ?.--You cannot even&#xD;
hear the creaking of a rope."&#xD;
Faith looked, and drew an interrupted deep breath,&#xD;
She had lived in a world of realities. Perhaps this was&#xD;
the first 'phantbm' that had ever suggested itself-or been&#xD;
suggested-to her imagination. Possibly something of&#xD;
the same thought passed her r mind; for she drew her&#xD;
breath again a little short as she poke..&#xD;
"Yes !-.it's beautiful !-But I live in such a different&#xD;
&#xD;
world, Mr. Linden,-I never thought of such a thing be.&#xD;
fore."&#xD;
He smiled-pleasantly and thoughtfully. "How came&#xD;
you to see the sunrise colours the other day, Miss Faith ?"&#xD;
"0 I see them always. And that puts me in mind&#xD;
of something I have been wanting to say to you every day&#xD;
all the week ! and I could never find a chance. You asked&#xD;
me that morning, Mr. Linden, if I was true to my name,&#xD;
finding enough in acloudy sky. What did you mean?&#xD;
What did you mean by being 'true to my name'? "&#xD;
"I shall have to use your. name a little freely, to tell&#xD;
you," he said. "It is faith's privilege to be independent&#xD;
of-ircumstances. Faith always finds something wherein&#xD;
to rejoice. If the sky be clear,&#xD;
'Far into distant worlds she pries,&#xD;
And brings eternal glories ne%.'&#xD;
If cloudy, faith uses her glass as a prism, and none little&#xD;
ray of light finds all the colours of the rainbow."&#xD;
"I don't know what a prism is," said Faith somewhat&#xD;
sadly.&#xD;
"A prism, in strictness, is a piece of glass cut in a para&#xD;
ticular way, so that the colourless sunbeams which pass&#xD;
through it are divided into their many-coloured members.&#xD;
But pther things act as prisms,-the rain-drops in a show-&#xD;
er----the lustres upon your church chandelier. You have&#xD;
seen the colours there ?"&#xD;
" Well, how do they do that ?"&#xD;
"I must takesome other time to tell you,-it would be&#xD;
too long a matter to-night. And I doubt whether you&#xD;
ought to sit here any longer."&#xD;
"1But this Faith don't do as you say," she said, as she&#xD;
slowly and rather unwillingly rose from her seat. "And&#xD;
I don't understand how any faith can."&#xD;
"This Faith must study the Bible then, and do what&#xD;
that says."  The tone was encouraging though the voice&#xD;
was grave.&#xD;
He was not answered; and the homeward walk was be-&#xD;

"I am  in no hurry," Mr. Linden said,-" take your&#xD;
own time-only do not take cold."&#xD;
Faith turned away silently again, and began trudging&#xD;
along the sandy road which led back to. the lane. The&#xD;
moonlight shewed the way better now. Passing. on, as&#xD;
they neared home one- house after another shewed its&#xD;
glimmer of light and gave forth its cheerful sound of&#xD;
voices. From one, however, the sound was not cheerful.&#xD;
It was Squire Deacon's.&#xD;
"Well, you'll see to-morrow, Cilly-if the sky don't fall,-&#xD;
you'll see. Folks thinks the water down to! the shore's&#xD;
mighty deep-'way over their heads--till they've made its&#xD;
acquaintance; and then. they find out they can wade round&#xD;
in it 'most anywheres. "-.&#xD;
"What's the matter with the Squire ?" said Faith with&#xD;
a slight laugh, as these strange statements reached her&#xD;
ears..&#xD;
" I should think-to use his own phraseology-he must&#xD;
be 'over his head' somewhere," replied Mr. Linden.&#xD;
Whereat Faith's laugh deepened, but the low sweet&#xD;
tone of it only sounded an instant.&#xD;
" My dear !" said Mrs.-,Derrick, running fut as they en-&#xD;
tered the gate, "ain't you very imprudent? Wasn't she&#xD;
very imprudent, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"Very prudent, ma'am for she wore a shawl.&#xD;
"And didn't want tha4 mother," said Faith.&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE illumination lasted throli the night-until&#xD;
"Night's candles were burnt out, and jocund day&#xD;
Stood tip-toe on the misty mountain tops."&#xD;
Very jocund she looked, with her light pink veils wreath-&#xD;
Ingabout the horizon, and the dancing white clouds which&#xD;
hurried up as the sun rose, drivel by a fresh wind. Mr.&#xD;
Linden declared, when he came in to breakfast,, that the&#xD;
x:  day promised to equal the preceding night.&#xD;
"And whoever wants more," he added, "must wait; for&#xD;
I think it will not surpass it."&#xD;
With which, Mr. Linden stirred his coffee, and told Miss&#xD;
Danforth with a little look of defiance, "it was particularly&#xD;
good-she had better try a cup."&#xD;
Miss Danforth instituted a fierce inquiry as to the direc-&#xD;
tion of the g$eceding evening's walk ; to which Faith gave&#xD;
an unsatisfactory answer.&#xD;
"Did you ever look at coffee in eonnexion with the&#xD;
fatigues of life ?" pursued Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"JI shall, probably, in future,"- said Miss Danforth.&#xD;
"Now Mr. Linden, I ask you; you're a nice man to give&#xD;
a straight answer;-where did you and Faith go ?"&#xD;
"I am glad I am a nice man," said Mr. Linden,' "but I&#xD;
can scarce'give a straight answer to that question."&#xD;
"Why not, for pity's-sake ?".&#xD;
"It must needs travel a crooked road."&#xD;
"Did you ?"&#xD;
"It has left a meandering sort of recollection in my&#xD;
mind."&#xD;
"Where did it lead to ?"&#xD;
"It led to another."&#xD;
"What I want to know is," said Miss Danforth "where&#xD;

home."&#xD;

"Let me shew you," said he. "Suppose your plate to&#xD;
be a rock, and this tumbler of radishes a tree, and the&#xD;
table-cloth grass,-the moon over your head, crickets under&#xD;
your feet. Miss Faith walks round the rock, I follow her,-.&#xD;
and we both follow the road. On the way, the still night&#xD;
air is enlivened with owls, grasshoppers, family secrets.&#xD;
Our attention is thus divided between the moon and sub-&#xD;
lunary affairs. Miss Faith-what shall I give you ?"&#xD;
Miss Danforth's curiosity seemed for once willing to be&#xD;
satisfied with fun; and Faith's hunger was in the same&#xD;
predicament.&#xD;
"But child," said Mrs. Derrick, who had bent her atten-&#xD;
tion upon the diagram at the other end of the table; " I&#xD;
don't recollect any such place !"&#xD;
"Mother 1" said Faith,-and her gravity gave way hope-&#xD;
lessly.&#xD;
"Squire Deacon sends his best compliments of the&#xD;
season," said Cindy opening the door a while later, "and&#xD;
he says they'll be to take supper percisely at four. I'm&#xD;
free to confess he do4't look much sweeter than common,"&#xD;
added Cindy.&#xD;
"Pray Miss Faith," said Mr.aLinden as they left the&#xD;
table; "what is the precise depth of water down at the&#xD;
shore ?"&#xD;
Faith had very nea  roke down again, for she laughed&#xD;
and blushed, a good deal more than her wont; and at last&#xD;
replied that "it depended on how far people went in-.-she&#xD;
never went very far herself."&#xD;
"1I was naturally curious," said he.&#xD;
After a dinner somewhat more hasty than usual, Mr.&#xD;
Linden and two of the ladies set off for the shore. The&#xD;
blackberry jam, og some other hindering cause, kept Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick at home.&#xD;
The country by daylight looked rich and smooth. At&#xD;
hot a very great distance a slight. hilly elevation bounded&#xD;
the horizon line, which nearer seen would have been found&#xD;
bristling with stern grey rock, itself a ridge of rock, one of&#xD;
the ribs of the rigid soil. But where the lane led down to&#xD;
the water, fair fields and, crops extended on every side,&#xD;
spotted very picturesquely with clumps of woodland. All&#xD;
looked genial in th~smmrlight. If the distant rocks&#xD;
&#xD;
spoke a stubborn soil, the fine growth between said that&#xD;
man had overcome it; and the fine order everywhere ap-&#xD;
parent said too that the victory had been effectual for man's&#xD;
comfort and prosperity. The stone walls, in some places&#xD;
thin and open, told of times when they had been hurriedly&#xD;
put up; moss on the rail fences said the rails had been long&#xD;
doing duty; within them no fields failed of their crops, and&#xD;
no crops wanted hoeing or weeding. No straw lay scat-&#xD;
tered about the ricks; no barrack roofs were tumbling&#xD;
down; no gate-posts stood sideways;. no barnyards shewed&#xD;
I rickety outhouses or desolate mangers. No cattle were&#xD;
poor, and seemingly, no people. It was a pretty ride the&#xD;
party had, in the little wagon, behind an old horse that&#xD;
knew every inch of the way and trotted on as if he were a&#xD;
part of it.&#xD;
.aiHow do ypu like Pattaquasset, Mr.Linden ?" said&#xD;
Faith, leaning forward to reach him where he sat alone on&#xD;
the front seat.&#xD;
"I like. it--well," he answered a little musingly.&#xD;
They cme to the, bridge and stream; and now they&#xD;
could see that 4wasee. River did not fill its sometime&#xD;
channel, but flowed in a bottom of alluvial soil, rich in&#xD;
bright-coloured marsh grass, which stretched up the country&#xD;
between two of those clumps of woodland they had seen&#xD;
from a distance. A little further on, just where the sandy&#xD;
road branched off to the shore, there stood a farm hose,&#xD;
with a conglomerate of barn\ and outhouses, all painted to&#xD;
match, in bright yellow picked out with red.&#xD;
"Do you see that settlement of farm-houses ?" said Faith&#xD;
leaning forward again,-" of all sizes, in uniform ?"&#xD;
" Is it the fashion here to put 'earmarks' on buildings?"&#xD;
he answered with a smile.&#xD;
"Mt. Linden! .You should ask Mr. Simlins that. I see&#xD;
his wagon there--he'll be down at the shore very likely&#xD;
He's a characters He lives a mile and a halt further on,&#xD;
just where the road turns off to Mrs. Somers."&#xD;
" Simlins !" was the only reply.&#xD;
" He's a good sort of man, but he's funny.'&#xD;
" Whait is a good sort of man, Miss Faith ?"&#xD;

things."&#xD;

looking round with a little smile he said, " You ought to&#xD;

sFaith looked serious and as if she felt half rebuked.&#xD;
"But," she said, "you would not call that a bad sort ?"&#xD;
"Then you mean that he is in the same road with what&#xD;
you call the best people, only not so far advanced ?"1&#xD;

Faith sat back in her place with a face exceedingly un-&#xD;
like a young lady who was going to a merry-making.&#xD;
But they were near the shore now ; not only the salt&#xD;
Anell proclaimed it, but they could see the various bathing&#xD;
and other houses collected at the place, and the flag which&#xD;
floated high from the flag-staff, telling all who were not&#xD;
concerned that it was a gala day. A piece of ground im-&#xD;
mediat.ely surrounding these buildings was feiced in; as&#xD;
they neared the gate, it was opened for them, and a tall&#xD;
farmer-looking man, whose straw hat shaded a sensible&#xD;
face, nodded as they passed.&#xD;
"1That is Mr. Simlins 1" said Faith.&#xD;
Mr. Simlins seemed for the present to be king of the&#xD;
castle.. Horses there were, and wagons, standing here and&#xD;
there, and one or two oldish faces looked out from the&#xD;
windws of one long shanty; but the rest of the birds had&#xD;
flown--into the water ! It was the time of low tide, and&#xD;
the long strips of rippling water,which lay one beyond the&#xD;
other, were separated by sand banks nearly as long. In&#xD;
these little tide lakes were the bathers,-the more timid&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
near shore, taking almost a sand bath; the more adven-&#xD;
torous going further and further out, till the last party&#xD;
bathed beyond the list sand bank. Not dressed in the latest&#xD;
Cape May fashion, nor the latest fashion of any kind; for&#xD;
each had brought some dress too old to be hurt with salt&#xD;
water. Calico frocks, of every hue and pattern,-.-..caps, hand-.&#xD;
kerchiefs, sun-bonnets,-s-gave additional force to the cries&#xD;
and shouts and screams which were wafted inshore.&#xD;
But when they began'to come in !---and when the bathing&#xD;
dresses were hung on the fence to dry !--and when mermaid&#xD;
visions appeared at the windows !--who shall describe the&#xD;
scene then ? Over all, a blue smoke now began to curl&#xD;
and float, rising from the stove-pipe of the eating-house.&#xD;
Mr. Linden had driven up to one of the fenceposts, and&#xD;
fastening his horse stood a while watching the show, till&#xD;
the bathers began to draw in from the water. Then helped&#xD;
the ladies out.&#xD;
"Which of these baskets contains my tea, Miss Faith ?"&#xD;
he said. "I feel a particular interest in that basket."&#xD;
"Perhaps your tea is in some other basket," said Faith;&#xD;
"but both of these must come into the eating-house. 0,&#xD;
takyou, Mr. Linden !"&#xD;
The eating-house was a long shanty, built for the express&#xD;
purpose of feasting picnic and other parties. At one end&#xD;
of it, within the house, was a well of excellent water; at&#xD;
the other end a door opened into a cooking-house, which&#xD;
held a stove ; and through the lengtlif the apartment a&#xD;
narrow table of boards was erect , ready to be covered&#xD;
with any description and any succession of table-cloths. In&#xD;
this room Mr. Linden with Faith's help .deposited her&#xD;
baskets; while Miss Danforth looked on. At the door of&#xD;
the shanty coming out they met Mr. Simlins. Faith made&#xD;
the introductions.&#xD;
"Happy to have your acquaintance," said Mr. Simlins.&#xD;
This is a piece of Pattaquasset, sir, that we all of us&#xD;
rather cord'ally like. You haven't seen it before ?"&#xD;
"Yes, I don't wonder you like it," said Mr. Linn{&#xD;
"The sea-shore is no novelty to 'me, sir-such   are&#xD;
party is."&#xD;
Ihope you'll enjoy it, as the rest of us do. .We all do&#xD;

Mr. Linden looked up at the stars and stripes, with an&#xD;
acknowledging smile for the benefits thereby conferred.&#xD;
"Faith ! Faith Derrick !" called out half a dozen mer-&#xD;
maids from the bathing house ; and 'Faith was obliged to&#xD;
go,-while her companions walked up the green slope,&#xD;
and entered into a deep discussion of the crops and the&#xD;
weather.&#xD;
A while after, when Faith was busy about the supper&#xD;
table-twenty young voices chiming around her, another&#xD;
voice that she did not know spoke close at her elbow.&#xD;
"'Miss Faith-I am Reuben Tay*r     Mr. Linden told&#xD;
me to come to you and make myself useful. Is there any-&#xD;
thing I can do ?--would you like some round clams ?&#xD;
.-Father's out there in the boat."&#xD;
The earnest eyes said how gladly he would do 'any-&#xD;
thing.'&#xD;
"Who is your father ?" said Faith, a little surprised.&#xD;
'My father's a fisherman."&#xD;
"The very thing !" said Faith-" if you'll help me roast&#xD;
'em, Reuben. I guess nobody else'll want to do it, but I'd&#xD;
just hs lieve. Can~ you have 'em here quickly? and I'll&#xD;
see and have the stove ready."&#xD;
" O I'll fetch 'em-and roast 'em too, Miss Faith. I'm&#xD;
used to it," he added, with a half bashful half admiring&#xD;
glance at her face.&#xD;
Faith had, the fire ready by the time Reuben returned&#xD;
with the clams. The kettle was on to hoil, and nothing&#xD;
else was wanted of the fire, as it happened, by anybody;&#xD;
least of all to roast clams, that neessarily making a kitchen&#xD;
prisoner of the roaste{; so Fait and her new c adjutor&#xD;
had the field-i.e. the cooking house-all to the selves.&#xD;
Miss Danforth was to leave Pattaquasset in a day or tvwo,&#xD;
and was busy talking to everybody. Readily the clams&#xD;
opened their shells on the hot stove-top ; savourily the&#xD;
odour of steaming clam juice spread itself abroad; but&#xD;
Faith and Reuben were 'in' for it, and nobody else cared&#xD;
to be in.&#xD;
So when Miss Cecilia Deacon had finished her toilet,&#xD;
which was somewhat of the longest, as it had been one of&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND S AL.39&#xD;
the latest, she found nobody but her brother to apply to on&#xD;
the score of her hostess duties.&#xD;
"Sam !" said the young lady pinching  er bro her's&#xD;
arm,-"I haven't been introduced to Mr. Lind  "&#xD;
"He'll keep," was the encouraging reply.&#xD;
"Yes, but supper won't. See, Sam !-I haven't een in-&#xD;
troduced to him, and I must."&#xD;
The Squire nodded his head politely, and began to&#xD;
whistle.&#xD;
" Come !-you' Sam--you've got to, and in a hurry. I&#xD;
can't find Faith, or I'd make her."&#xD;
" Well--I can't find him," said the Squire pettishly. "I&#xD;
haven't got neither of 'em in my pocket-nor the crown of&#xD;
my hat," he added, taking off that useful article of dress for&#xD;
the express purpose of looking int it. "My deliberate&#xD;
judgment is to have supper."&#xD;
"Don't be a, goose, Sam! What's the use of asking him&#xD;
if you didn't mean to conduct yourself ?"&#xD;
"Didn't ask him."&#xD;
"XWho did ?"&#xD;
"I didn't hear anybody," was the Squire's reply.&#xD;
"Don't you mean to introduce me, Sam Deacon ?" said&#xD;
his sister in a tone which was rather over the verge of&#xD;
patience.&#xD;
"Jem Williams !" said the Squire, calling up a spruce&#xD;
embodiment of blue cloth, brass buttons, and pink cravat,-..&#xD;
" I say ! here's Cilly off the hooks to get hold of the new&#xD;
teacher. Whereabouts do you s'pose he is ?"&#xD;
- "Really Squire !" said Jem Williams, with a silly little&#xD;
laugh, "I couldn't testify !- Reckon he knows Miss Cilly&#xD;
'd keep hold on him ef she got a chance !"&#xD;
"Sha'n't speak to you in a month, Jem !" said the&#xD;
lady with a toss of her head and some heightening of&#xD;
the really pretty colour in her cheeks. "You may fix it as&#xD;
you've a mind tq, among you, and let anybody that likes&#xD;
bring him in to supper ! I'm going in, out of the way,&#xD;
myself."&#xD;
Whither she went, on the spur, as good as her word;-&#xD;
nor shewed her pretty face again outside.&#xD;
Meanwhile Reuben and Faith had worked on through&#xD;
their basket of clams, and now the last were sputtering on&#xD;

the stove. The work had been done almost in silence, for&#xD;
though the excitement now and then made Reuben break&#xD;
into a low whistle of some tune or other, he always checked&#xD;
himself the next moment with a very apologetic look. For&#xD;
the rest, if he had not done all the work himself, it cer-&#xD;
tainly was not his fault. Now, watching quietly the open-&#xD;
ing shells of that last dozen of clams, Reuben remarked,&#xD;
"I hope Mr. Linden won't forget about supper !"&#xD;
" Why what about it ?" said Faith. "Why should he&#xD;
forget ? or what if he does ?.&#xD;
The-last sentence seemed to puzzle Reuben.&#xD;
"I don't know, ma'am," he said,-" it's better before&#xD;
everybody eats it up."&#xD;
" Who's going to. eat it up ?" said Faith. "Where is&#xD;
h4 ?"&#xD;
" He went down on the sands witl me," said Reuben,&#xD;
"but he didn't come up again. Maybe he has now. He&#xD;
liked it down there, real well."&#xD;
Faith went, to the shutter windowgnd flung it open, and&#xD;
looked to see whether or no the missing gentleman had&#xD;
returned to the shore. It was a fair view that lay spread&#xD;
before her. The low beams of the sun gave a cool after-&#xD;
noon look to everything ; the sloop sails shone and gleamed&#xD;
in the distance.; down by the muscle rocks one little boat&#xD;
lay rocking on the advancing tide, which was fast covering&#xD;
the sand banks and connecting the strips of water ; and the&#xD;
freshening breeze curled the little waves as they came danc-&#xD;
ing in, and brought a low sweet murmur to the shore.&#xD;
One or two gulls sailed floatingly about, and ,a brown&#xD;
mink--perceiving that the company had retreated to higher&#xD;
ground-came out and aired himself on one of the rocks.&#xD;
But Faith saw none of these things,-.-for in swinging&#xD;
open her shutter (which the wiod caught and clapped up&#xD;
against the house) she so nearly swung it against Mr.&#xD;
Linden that her first look was a startled one.&#xD;
"Miss Faith1" he said, turning round, "what can you&#xD;
possibly be about !"&#xD;
" I beg your pardon, Mr. Linden !"-said Faith.&#xD;
"Is that all you are ahout ?",&#xD;
"You were anxious about -your. supper, Mr. Linden--&#xD;
Are you ready for it 7"&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
41&#xD;
&#xD;
"Much more ready than anxious, Mids Faith."&#xD;
"How do you like the shore to-day ?" said Faith, drop-&#xD;
ping her voice, and giving a glance of her eye to the fair,&#xD;
cool sunlight colors on the water and shore and ship-&#xD;
ping-fresh as the fery sea-breeze itself, and glittering as&#xD;
the water's thousand mirrors could make them.&#xD;
He turned and looked again, drawing in the breeze with&#xD;
a deep breath that more than answered her question.&#xD;
" How do you like this ?" he said, handing her through&#xD;
the window a little miniature tree of red sea-weed. Then,&#xD;
while she examined it, he repeated,-.&#xD;
"'When descends on the Atlantic&#xD;
The gigantic&#xD;
Storm-wind of the equinox,&#xD;
Lhndward in his wrath he scourges&#xD;
The toiling surges,&#xD;
Laden with sea-weed from the rocks;&#xD;

"'From the tumbling surf that buries&#xD;

"'Ever drifting, drifting, drifting&#xD;

Faith's eye was ujon the sprig of sea-weed while these&#xD;
verses were repeating,-then she looked up at the speaker&#xD;
with an intenseness in which oddly mingled some strong&#xD;
feeling of sorrow or regret.&#xD;
"It's beautiful!"-.she said,.-" beautiful !-l-both the one&#xD;

there was time -but there isn't. -Mr. Linden, Reuben&#xD;
and I have been roasting. clams."&#xD;
"Yes, Miss Faith," he said answering the smile and&#xD;
stepping nearer the window. "So one of my senses informed&#xD;
me. Do you know what that is in your hand ?"&#xD;
"It's sea-weed, isn't it ?"&#xD;
"Yes. And moreover-Miss Faith, that is part of your&#xD;
marine Flora. Now what about the clams ?"&#xD;
"1My what ?" said Faith. "First tll me, please, what&#xD;
you said."&#xD;
"Your marine Flora.'"&#xD;
"What is that ?"&#xD;
"The particular department of life in the sea, of which&#xD;
this is a specimen."&#xD;
Faith looked puzzled, and amused.&#xD;
"You don't mean to enlighten me more than you can&#xD;
help," she said. "But why do you call it Flora? you&#xD;
used that word before. And oh Mr. Linden-You can't&#xD;
tell me now, for supper's all ready."&#xD;
Hiseyes looked amused too, and laying a clover head&#xD;
on-the window, he said,&#xD;
"That is part of your land Flora,"-then pushed the&#xD;
shutter to rather quick, but softly; and Faith heard the&#xD;
reason thereof as follows.&#xD;
"Wal sir--ef this be you, I've looked all over for you."&#xD;
"How was it that you overlooked me then, sir ?" was&#xD;
Mr. Linden's reply.&#xD;
"Don't jes know," laughed Jem Williams,-" but Miss&#xD;
Cilly Deacon wants you the Worst kind."&#xD;
"And where shall I go to receive her commands ?" said&#xD;
Mr. Linden.&#xD;
Faith heard their retreating steps, and turning to take&#xD;
off her apron saw the dish of hot clams still on, the stove,&#xD;
.and that Reuben had removed himself outside the door,&#xD;
quite beyond the conversation but not beyond call. He&#xD;
.stood looking thoughtfully out towards the muscle rocks.&#xD;
"Oh Reuben! there you are. Come!" said Faith; "you're&#xD;
going in with me. You're going to have some' supper tO-&#xD;
night, whoever el does. You open the .door; and Il&#xD;
take in this dish You keep by me, Reuben,"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Please let me take the dish, then, Miss Faith,-I can&#xD;
open the door first."&#xD;
.    But Faith had her own way, and followed by.Reuben&#xD;
I carried the clams into the supper room, where some of the&#xD;
company were already seated, and others stood waiting.&#xD;
Squire Deacon had not only given the desired eintroduc-&#xD;
tion, but had (self-denyingly) placed Mr. Linden next Miss&#xD;
Cilly at the table,-where he stood.&#xD;
"Here's a contribution," said Faith,-."if somebody ?ll&#xD;
make a place for it. Thank you, Mr. Deacon. Now&#xD;
Reuben,-come here."&#xD;
And refusing more than one offer of a place at the&#xD;
table, Faith made .her way down to the 'well end' where&#xD;
there was room for two--at a remote distance from the tea&#xD;
and coffee.&#xD;
What else was there not, upon that table !&#xD;
- "Won't you take a seat, Mr. Linden ?" said Miss Ceci-&#xD;
lia. "I hope you've got room there. Jerushy, can't you&#xD;
shove down a little? .I hope my coffee-pot's not disagree-&#xD;
able:"&#xD;
"I hope not !" said Mr. Linden, surveying the coffee-&#xD;
pot. "How long does it take to declare itself, Miss Dea-&#xD;
con?"&#xD;
"0! it won't do anything, but. spout coffee," said the&#xD;
young lady,-" if you don't mind that. Won't you be helped&#xD;
to what you like, Mr. Linden ? I hope you have enjoyed&#xD;
our shore party this afternoon."&#xD;
" Thank you"-said Mr. Linden, feeling perhaps that it&#xD;
was nqt their pqrty he had enjoyed,--." there has been a&#xD;
combination of leasant things. As far as I could judge&#xD;
the bathers enjoyed their particular expedition."&#xD;
" 0 yes, it was delightful - invigorating.. Mr. Sim-&#xD;
lins, I think Mr. Linden will like a piece of that cherry-&#xD;
pie with his clams. Do you take cheese, Mr. Linden? Is&#xD;
your coffee agreeable ? There is the cold' tongue by you,&#xD;
Jerushy.-I hope you like Pattaquasset."&#xD;
" Ask Mr. Linden whether Pattaquasset ain't a good place&#xD;
for handsome gals," said Mr Simlins, as he handed over the&#xD;
piece of cherrypie. "He knows by this .time. T say&#xD;
there's a con-cateination of beauty now here this arternoon.&#xD;

&#xD;
If you look from the top to the bottom of the table, now,&#xD;
ain't it true, sir?"&#xD;
Mr. Linden certainly looked from the top to the bottom&#xD;
of the table, and then, setting the plate of cherry-pie as far&#xD;
from his clams as he could, he said,&#xD;
"Miss Deacon-let me .help you,-tell me where these&#xD;
cups belong, and I will convey them to their destination."&#xD;
"I thought they'd shove down somehow," said the young&#xD;
lady. "Jerushy, do pass-the coffee ! They're for anybody&#xD;
down there who'll take coffee. Tea'll be along presently,"&#xD;
added Miss Cecilia, raising her -voice a little to give the&#xD;
information. "Don't you trouble yourself, Mr. Linden "&#xD;
But Mr. Linden secured one, and carrying it down to&#xD;
Taith, requested her to stir it and taste it, and not give&#xD;
him the trouble of coming back with the sugar-bowl.&#xD;
"What will you have ?" he said while she obeyed his&#xD;
directions. "Here are all the pies that can be thought of&#xD;
except the t'nusical one recorded in history."&#xD;
"And so," said Faith with a laughing flash  f her usu-&#xD;
ally soft eye, "you immediately give me a  desire for the&#xD;
one not here I It's like you, Mr. Linden. No, thank you-&#xD;
I'll 'have none of these. I believe Reuben has a desire for&#xD;
some of the-clams he and I have roasted."&#xD;
, "I'm afraid I cannot get them away from Squire Dea-&#xD;
con 1" he said, "but I'll try."&#xD;
The Squire however held fast to the dish, and rising&#xD;
from his place midway at the table, insisted upon taking it&#xD;
to Faith himself.&#xD;
"Miss Faith," he said, "you have ruined my supper by&#xD;
sitting down here. My appetite has quite forsaken me,"&#xD;
(whereupon Jem Williams observed, "that warn't strange.")&#xD;
:..-"and the worst is," added the Squire, "I can't maintain&#xD;
the constant supervision of your plate which my feelings&#xD;
prompt. I am too far off"- -he concluded in a melancholy&#xD;
tone.&#xD;
"I say, Squire !" said Jem Williams, "you bain't mor'n&#xD;
as far agin as he"-with a nod towards the upper end of&#xD;
the table.&#xD;
Squire Deacon lowered, but for the present his feelings&#xD;
were restrained.&#xD;
" Mr. Simlins," said Endecott, when he had resumed his&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL. 45&#xD;
seat, "I ask you-.--as one who knows the country-where-&#xD;
abouts does the concatenation you spoke of reach a climax ?"&#xD;
"The star:you look at is always the brightest," said the&#xD;
farmer. " However, I think the clams is the best thing at&#xD;
table-or near the best,"' with a slight glance towards&#xD;
Squire Deacon and the dish at- the 'well end.' "I've a,&#xD;
legendary attachment to beauty, .sir; my father married&#xD;
the three prettiest wives in the country."&#xD;
"I say, Squire;" said Jem Williams, "Mr. Simlins says&#xD;
your hot."&#xD;
" Hot ?" said Squire Deacon, flushing up very much, and&#xD;
setting down the clams,-" that dish is. I'm as cool as all&#xD;
these cucumbers accumulated into a heap."&#xD;
"Hope you'll stay where you are, then," said Mr. Sim-&#xD;
lins. "I'm cool too. Don't come near me, or we shall be&#xD;
in a state of concentration."&#xD;
Mr. Linden remarked that that was an excellent point&#xD;
when reached.&#xD;
"What point ?" said Squire Deacon, who had returned&#xD;
to his seat with the strong impression that everybody was&#xD;
laughing at him, under the special guidance of the new&#xD;
teacher. You know mighty little of the points round here,&#xD;
I tell you.,'&#xD;
"The point of concentration is found in various places,&#xD;
sir," said Mr. Linden; "though I grant you it is rare."&#xD;
"What do you know about Pattaquasset points ?" re-&#xD;
peated the Squire,-" or Pattaquasset people-or Patta.&#xD;
quasset water either, for that matter? Just you go down&#xD;
here when the tide's in--and afore you know where you are&#xD;
you'll find yourself wading round over your head."&#xD;
"No sir-never,". said Mr. Linden with great assur-&#xD;
ance.&#xD;
"Why not? how're you goin' to help it ?" said Squire&#xD;
Deacon.&#xD;
" When I reach that point," said Mr. Linden,'"I shall&#xD;
swim."&#xD;
And Faith heard Reuben Taylor's smothered laugh of&#xD;
great gratification.&#xD;
"RHope you haven't spoiled your own supper, Squire,"&#xD;
said Mr. Simlins, "by your complacency in carrying about&#xD;
them hot clams. Have somethin' this way ?"&#xD;

&#xD;
While this question was getting its answer, Faith sat&#xD;
back in her chair and looked up and down the length of&#xD;
the table. It presented a distinguished 'after-supper'&#xD;
view, but the demands of the company had not yet ceased.&#xD;
Mr. Simlins was still discussing cheese and politics; Jem&#xD;
Williams was deep in cherry pie; plum cake was not out&#xD;
of favour with the ladies.- The Squire was hard at work at&#xD;
his supper, which had been diversely and wickedly inter.&#xD;
rupted.. He was making up for lost time now; while his&#xD;
sister, much disengaged, was bending her questions and&#xD;
smiles on Mr. Linden. Faith tried to see Mr. Linden, but&#xD;
she couldn't; he was leaning back from the table; and her&#xD;
eyes went out of doors. It was too fair and sweetthere&#xD;
to be cooped up from it. The sun had just set. Faith&#xD;
could not see the water; the windows of the eating house&#xD;
looked landward; but the air which came in at them said&#xD;
where it had come from, and breathed the salt freshness of&#xD;
the seat into her face.&#xD;
Kt presently every chair was pushed back. And now&#xD;
there was no more silence, nor quiet The busy swarm&#xD;
poured out of the supper room; the men to .lounge or&#xD;
tackle their horses, the women to gather up the bathing&#xD;
dresses from the fence, to look round, laugh, and go in&#xD;
again to pack up the dishes. It would seem that this last&#xD;
might be a work of time, each had to find her own through&#xD;
such a maze of confusion. There was a spoon of Miss&#xD;
Cecilia's providing, in a cup of Mrs. Derrick's, beside a'&#xD;
plate of Mrs. David's, and, before a half-eaten cherry pie&#xD;
which had been compounded in the distant home and by&#xD;
the fair fingers of Miss Jerusha Fax. However, most&#xD;
people know their own at least; and as on the present oc-&#xD;
casion nobody had any particular desire to meddle with&#xD;
what was not her own, the difficulty was got through with.&#xD;
The baskets and hampers, were packed again and stowed&#xD;
in their respective wagons; and everybody was bidding&#xD;
good bye to everybody. Noisy thanks and praises fell lib-&#xD;
erally to the share of Miss; Cecilia and her brother, and the'&#xD;
afternoon was declared to have been "splendid."&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
}OR some weeks the little town of Pattaquasset held&#xD;
on its peaceful way as usual. Early summer passed&#xD;
into harvest, and harvest gave way to the first blush of&#xD;
autumn, and still the Mong flowed quietly along, and the&#xD;
kildeers sang fearlessly. For even tenor and happy spirits,&#xD;
the new teacher and his scholars were not unlike the smooth&#xD;
river and its feathered visiters. Whatever the boys were&#xD;
taught, they certainly learned to be happy; and Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den's popularity knew no bounds in his own domain.&#xD;
Neither did it end there: those fair members of the Patta-&#xD;
quasset society who thought early wdlks good for their&#xD;
health, felt their sleepy eyes well paid, for keeping open&#xD;
when they met Mr. Linden. Those who were fond of even-&#xD;
ing expeditions, declared that his figure in the twilight was&#xD;
'quite a picture,' and made them feel 'so safe,'-a great&#xD;
slander, by the way, on Pattaquasset. Mr. Simlins was&#xD;
his firm friend, and many another-known and unknown.&#xD;
Squire Deacon, I regret to say, was an exception.&#xD;
Squire Deacon declared (confidentially) that he never&#xD;
had thought the newiteacher fit for his business, no how.&#xD;
As far as he could hear, Mr. Linden had never taught&#xD;
school before, and in that case what could you expect?&#xD;
"Moreover," said the Squire, "I am creditably informed,&#xD;
that the firstday he kep' school here, he begun by asking&#xD;
the boys who made them !--as if that had anything to do&#xD;
with geography. Of course it's nat'ral for a man to ask&#xD;
what he knows he can answer if the boys don't," added&#xD;
Squire Deacon in the way of kind explanation.&#xD;
Whereupon, Jonathan Fax, the Squire's right hand man,&#xD;
requested to be informed, "why ef a man was poor didn't he&#xD;
dress as though he felt so,-and why ef he warn't rich did&#xD;
he act as though he war ?" And thus, by degrees, there&#xD;
was quite an opposition party in Pattaquasset-if that&#xD;
could be opposition which the object of it never opposed.&#xD;
By degrees too, the murmurs became more audible.&#xD;

"Faith, child," said Mrs. Derrick in- a cautious whisper;&#xD;
coming out where Faith sat on the porch, bathed in the&#xD;
late September light: "Faith, child, where's our Linden&#xD;
tree ?" (Mrs. Derrick thought she had concealed her mean-&#xD;
ing now, if anybody did overhear.)&#xD;
Faith started, more than so gentle a question seemed to&#xD;
call for.&#xD;
"He's gone down to the post-office, mother."&#xD;
Her motherstood still and thought.&#xD;
"Child," she said, ".I never thought we had any fools in&#xD;
our town before."&#xD;
"I didn't know there were so many," said Faith. "What&#xD;
new, mother ?"&#xD;
"Child," she said, "you know more than I about some&#xD;
thingswhat do you s'pose fools can do? Isn't he a whole&#xD;
tree of knowledge ?"&#xD;
"There is no fear of him, mother !" Faith said with a&#xD;
smile, which if the subject of it valued any faith in the&#xD;
world but his own it would have gratified him to see.&#xD;
" They can't touch him. They may vex him."&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick shook her head, softly, behind Faith's&#xD;
chair, then turned and went back into the house; not&#xD;
caring,. as it seemed, to spread the vexation. Then after&#xD;
a little interval of bird music, the gate opened to ad-&#xD;
mit Reuben Taylor. He held a bunch of water lilies-&#xD;
drooping -their fair heads from his"hand; his own head&#xD;
drooped a little too. Then he raised it and came firmly&#xD;
on.-&#xD;
"Is Mr. Linden home, Miss Faith ?"&#xD;
"No,, Reuben-He will be directly, I guess. Do you&#xD;
want to see him ?"&#xD;
" No"-said Reuben,-" I don' know as I do, more&#xD;
than usual. I have seen him all day. He wanted some&#xD;
pond lilies, Miss Faith-at leastNhe told me to bring 'em.&#xD;
Maybe it was you wanted 'em."&#xD;
"I'll give them to him, Reuben. What's the matter&#xD;
with you ?"&#xD;
But Reuben stood silent,--perhaps from the difficulty of&#xD;
speaking,     .&#xD;
" Miss Faith," he said at last, "is Squire Deacon all the&#xD;
trustees of our school, besides Mr. Somers. "&#xD;

&#xD;
"No. Why?     What about it ?"&#xD;
"He 's doin' all the mischief he can," said Reuben con-&#xD;
WThat mi cjf has he done, Reuben ?" said Faith,&#xD;
waiting upon the oy's answer with an anxious face.&#xD;
"Well"-said Reuben, as if he could not put it in plain&#xD;
words,-" he's tryin' to turn'folks' heads-and some heads&#xD;
is easyturned."&#xD;
" How did you know this ?-and whose head has he&#xD;
turned, Reuben ? Not yours ?"&#xD;
"They'd have to turn my heart, Miss Faith," was Reu-&#xD;
ben's subdued answer. Then he looked up and listened-.&#xD;
hearing a step he well knew. Nor that alone, for a few&#xD;
pow notes of a sweet hymn tune, seemed to say there were&#xD;
pleasant thoughts within reach of at least one person. Then&#xD;
Reuben broke forth.&#xD;
"They can't keep him out of heaven, anyway!-nor me,&#xD;
neither," he added softly. But he ran down the:steps and&#xD;
out of the gate, passing his teacher with only a bow;. and&#xD;
once beyond the fence, Reuben's head dropped in his hands.&#xD;
" Reuben! I want you.!"--said Mr. Linden.-. But Reu-&#xD;
ben was out of sight. Faith stood between the house and&#xD;
the gate.&#xD;
"Where is he ? can't you make him hear ? I Want that&#xD;
boy !" she said.&#xD;
"I can run after him-with doubtful success."&#xD;
"The foolish fellow brought these for you, Mr. Linden,"&#xD;
said Faith, giving the lilies where they belonged.&#xD;
"Complimentary, Miss Faith !" said "Mr. Linden, taking&#xD;
the lilies and smelling them gravely.&#xD;
"He is," said Faith, "and you speak as if I wasn't."&#xD;
" Will it redeem my character-or Reuben's-if I bestow&#xD;
the lilies upon you, Miss Faith? I think that was their&#xD;
destination."&#xD;
Faith .took the lilies back again, with a slight smile and&#xD;
flush, and stood attentively turning them over for a while.&#xD;
Then suddenly said "Thank you."&#xD;
"What did you want of Reuben Taylor?" said Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den. "Cannot I do as well ?"&#xD;
"I should 'be sorry to think you wanted, Mr. Linden,&#xD;

"That sounds terrific!- But Reuben is under my juris..&#xD;
dictin-I don't allow anybody to scold him but myself.&#xD;
So deliver it to me, Miss Faith, and I will give it to him-..&#xD;
duly pointed and sharpened up."&#xD;
No," said Faith smiling, "you couldn't do it so well as&#xD;
I. I wanted to say two words to him to put nonsense out&#xD;
of his head."'&#xD;
"Nonsense !" said Mr. Linden, looking grave,-" I am&#xD;
as anxious on that point as you can be. What nonsense&#xD;
has he got in his head?"&#xD;
Faith hesitated, flushed and paled a little, and looked at&#xD;
her lilies.&#xD;
"I don't know whether I ought to speak of it," she be.&#xD;
gan,' with much less than herusual composure of speech.&#xD;
"Perhaps it is not my business. Please forgive me if I&#xD;
speak wrong. But I half think you ought to know it. "-&#xD;
"I'll try to bear the knowledge," he said smiling-" if&#xD;
you will promise to speak' the cabalistic two words that were&#xD;
to have such effect upon Reuben. So you want to put&#xD;
nonsense into my head, Miss Faith?"&#xD;
"Perhaps you know it. already?" said Faith. "At any&#xD;
rateI think I should feel better satisfied if you did know&#xD;
it. Mr. Linden," she said speaking low-" do you know&#xD;
that Squire Deacon has been trying to do you mischief?"&#xD;
"Just suppose for a moment that you are one of my&#xD;
scholars, and give me a definition of mischief."&#xD;
To judge by the unbent lines of Faith's brow, there was&#xD;
nothing very disagreeable to her in the supposition. Yet&#xD;
she had a look of care for the 'definition,' too.&#xD;
'When a man is meaning toodo harm, isn't he doing&#xD;
mischief?"&#xD;
"Only to himself."&#xD;
"But do you mean that one can't .do harm to others in&#xD;
this world ?"&#xD;
"You said 'when a man is meaning to do harm."'&#xD;
"Ah," said Faith laughing, "I should want a great deal&#xD;
of teaching before I could give a definition that would suit&#xD;
you ! Well then, isn't harm mischief ?"&#xD;
"I'm afraid I must yield that point."et&#xD;
" Then,". said Faith simply, but very modesly,-" w&#xD;
come back to where we started from.?.&#xD;
&#xD;
"What shall we do there ?" said he smiling.&#xD;
"Nothing, perhaps," said Faith with the same simplicity.&#xD;
"I only thought it right to put you there, Mr. Linden."&#xD;
"Thank you, Miss Faith. Now will you please pro-&#xD;
nounce over me the two words intended for Reuben ?"&#xD;
Faith laughed a little, but then said gravely, "Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den, I should be very sorry to think you needed them."&#xD;
"It's impossible always to avoid being very sorry: I&#xD;
want them, at all events. Haven't you just been putting&#xD;
nonsense into my head ?"&#xD;
"1Have I ?"1 said Faith.&#xD;
',"Do you suppose there was any there before ?"&#xD;
"I-don't-:-think,"---said Faith, surveying his face,...-..&#xD;
"there is much there now. I guess you don't need the&#xD;
two words, Mr. Linden. I was going to tell Reuben he&#xD;
was a goose for thinking that that man could hurt you."&#xD;
His face changed a little.&#xD;
"Poor Reuben !" he said-then with the former look-.--&#xD;
"On the whole, perhaps it was well he did not come back.&#xD;
If you put those in water they will open their eyes to-&#xD;
morrow. Fresh water-not salt," he added as he followed&#xD;
her into the house,-" they are not part of the marine&#xD;
Flora."&#xD;
Tea was ready, with its usual cheer of eatables and&#xD;
pleasant faces; not quite with its usual flow of talk. Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick certainly had something bewildering on her mind,&#xD;
for she even looked at her guest two or three times when&#xD;
he was looking at her. The pond lilies were alone in the&#xD;
twilight parlour.&#xD;
That was probably the reason why Lucinda introduced&#xD;
Parson Somers into the tea-room, the parson happening to&#xD;
call at this identical time.&#xD;
Parson Somers was always in a genial state of mind ;--&#xD;
always, at least, whenever he came into Mrs. Derrick's&#xD;
parlour; by the testimony of numbers it was the same in&#xD;
manyother parlours. He came in so now ; gave a smile&#xD;
all round ; and took an empty chair and place at the table&#xD;
like one who found it pleasant.&#xD;
"Well, I declare, Mrs. Derrick," said Mr. Somers when&#xD;
he was seated,.-" I don't think there's-a-a more cheer-&#xD;
ful room in Pattaquasset than this one ; why, you always&#xD;

didn't expect it."&#xD;
"Why we always do have tea, Mr. Somers," said Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick, "but it don't seem strong to-night. Lucindy-.&#xD;
take the teapot and make some fresh."&#xD;
"These baked apples are strong-in numbers at least,"&#xD;
said Mr. Linden, as he bestowed one upon Mr. Somers.&#xD;
"Thank you !-it's all strong enough, Mrs. Derrick-&#xD;
thank you !-very good. And Mr. Liiden-...how are you-&#xD;
a--getting along with your juvenile charge? Confining&#xD;
work, sir,-isn't it ?"&#xD;
"Rather, sir-to the body."&#xD;
"Not to the mind, eh ?  Well-I should have thought&#xD;
ghat to a gentleman like you it would prove---a-rnore&#xD;
deleterious to the mental faculties. But I suppose you&#xD;
find yourself rewarded by your pupils' improvement and-&#xD;
regard!~"&#xD;
"Yes sir-their regard is very precious to me," was the&#xD;
quiet reply.&#xD;
"I should think so ! Why there's that boy Reuben Tay&#xD;
lr-strange fatlPer that boy has-fisherman ;-.I met that&#xD;
boy this evening, in the street, and he was crying,-down&#xD;
a little below here-he was going home. I asked him-&#xD;
ha-if Mr. Linden had bee dealing hardly with him ?-and&#xD;
I declare !--I didn't know  ut Reuben would have attacked&#xD;
me on the spot."&#xD;
"Has Mr. Linden a character in the village for cruelty?"&#xD;
said Faith.&#xD;
"I-I declare -not t at I know of,, Miss Faith.  I&#xD;
should think it could not lie deserved. That boy's attach-&#xD;
ment is certainly-ha-ve y warm. My dear Mrs. Derrick,&#xD;

but to-night--ha-the colpur of her cheeks is.-to be re-&#xD;

"You will get a charter for cruelty, Miss Faith,"&#xD;
said Mr. Lindep, "if you ask about my character before&#xD;
my face.n"                        ,.&#xD;
Faith looked up as if she would willingly have asked a&#xD;
question ;. but that being in present circumstances impos-&#xD;
sible, she merely uttered a quiet little 'no,' and went on&#xD;
with her tea and with a colour still fur-ther improved A&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
quiet little 'yes,' of about equal prominence, did not divert&#xD;
the attention of Mr. Somers from his own remarks.&#xD;
"It's delightful to see-really," said that gentleman.&#xD;
"But Mr. Linden-ha---.I am sorry to find that you haven't&#xD;
the good will of our neighbour, Squire Deacon. The&#xD;
Squire's a valuable min--very !-the Squire's a 4alable&#xD;
man in the town. I am sorry. Do you know,    r. Lin-&#xD;
den-ha-how it has happened ?"&#xD;
"Have you asked the Squire himself, sir ?" said Mr.&#xD;
Linden.&#xD;
tWhy-no, sir, I haven't. I-ha-wanted to get at,&#xD;
the truth of it, that I might, if possible, do something to&#xD;
heal the breach. Now you are doing a valuable work&#xD;
in Pattaquasset, sir.-I should be sorry to see it inter-&#xD;
rupted--very-and I thought the best way would be to try&#xD;
to find out what the matter was, in order if possible to&#xD;
its being removed. And to get at the truth it is often best&#xD;
to hear both sides."&#xD;
"But I have no side to tell, sir," said Mr. Linden-..-&#xD;
smiling in spite of himself. "I cannot deny that Squire&#xD;
Deacon seems to withhold his good will-I think it is for&#xD;
him to tell his reasons."&#xD;
"Then you really have no idea what it can be about ?&#xD;
and I may tell him so ? Because that would be a great&#xD;
point."&#xD;
"No sir, you may not tell him that."&#xD;
"Then you have an idea what t  matter is ?" said Mr.&#xD;
Somers eagerly. " Then, sir, if yo will b so good as to&#xD;
let me know what it is-I have no d  bt I entertain no&#xD;
doubt-we shall be able to smooth it a I away, and have&#xD;
peace."&#xD;
"You cannot prove one man's ideas by another man's,"&#xD;
said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"Then you can give me no help ?" said Mr. Somers re-&#xD;
gretfully. "But Mr. Linden-ha-it strikes me that it&#xD;
would be useful for me to know your view of the cause of&#xD;
offence--whatever it is-before I know his. One may cor-&#xD;

" There has been no offence given sir," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;

CHAPTER&#xD;
W   HILE    Mr. Somers was enjoying his cup of unex-&#xD;
pected tea at Mrs. Derrick's, Squire Deacon and&#xD;
Miss Cilly had a sociable tete-a-tete over theirs; for Joe&#xD;
Deacon, who was in the full enjoyment of some fourteen&#xD;
years of boyhood, scarcely made a third in the conversation&#xD;
itntiL his appetite was satisfied.&#xD;
Conversation indeed hardly existed during the first por-&#xD;
tion of the meal. Miss Cily poured out her tea and&#xD;
broke her biscuit with a certain prim sort of elegance&#xD;
which belonged to that young lady.-as at least she be-&#xD;
lieved. But sipping tea and nibbling biscuit went on in&#xD;
company with thoughts.&#xD;
"Sam, what are you bothering yourself about Mr. Lin-&#xD;
Sden for ?"&#xD;
"How long since you was made a trustee ?" said the&#xD;
Squire, beginning his sentence with an untranslatable sort&#xD;
of grunt, and ending it in his teacup.&#xD;
"Give us the sugar bowl down this way, Cilly," said&#xD;
Joe,---" this apple sarce is as sour as sixty."&#xD;
"I've been your trustee ever since you was up to any-&#xD;
thing," said his sister. "Come Sam-don't you begin&#xD;
now. What's made you so crusty ?"&#xD;
"It aint the worst thing to be crusty,," said the Squire,&#xD;
while Joe started up and seized the sugar bowl. "Shews&#xD;
a man's more'n half baked, any how."&#xD;
Miss Ciily vouchsafed a rather sour smile to these inani-&#xD;
festations of disposition on the part of both her brothers.&#xD;
"Well, what has he done ?"&#xD;
"Sure enough," said the Squire, (he kept his small stock&#xD;
of big words for company) " what has he done ? That's&#xD;
just what I can't find out."&#xD;
"What do you want to find out f'or ? What ails him ?'&#xD;
."Suppose he hasn't done nothing"-.--.said the Squire,-.--&#xD;

"Lit-what ?" said his sister with an arch of her head,.&#xD;
"Anything you've a mind to," said the Squire sulkily.&#xD;
"I wouldn't say anything against Mr. Linden's litera-&#xD;
ture, if I was you; because it's my belief, Sam, it'll stand&#xD;
any pecking 'you make at 'it. What's given you such a&#xD;
spite at him? You're a goodnatured fellow enough in&#xD;
general."&#xD;
"The whole temperature of Pattaquasset's come about&#xD;
since he come," replied the Squire comprehensively.&#xD;
" He's a gentleman !" said Miss Cilly brilling again.&#xD;
"He won't hurt anybody's manners-not the best-if they&#xD;
was to copy him."&#xD;
" He didn't hurt mine," said Joe patronizingly. " To be&#xD;
sure I didn't go to him long."&#xD;
" Do the boys like him, Joe ?"&#xD;
" Well I daresay they wouldn't if they could help it,"&#xD;
said Joe, "if that's any comfort. Some other folks likes&#xD;
him too,-besides Sam."&#xD;
"Aint he a good teacher ?"&#xD;
" Firstrate--" said Joe,-" taught me all I ever learned.&#xD;
I didn't go but four weeks, and Sam thought 'twarn't no use&#xD;
for me to hold on any longer. My! Cilly-he'd make you&#xD;
roll up your eyes in arithmetic 1"&#xD;
"Now Sam Deacon, whpt do you expect to do by all&#xD;
this fuss you're making ?" said his sister judicially.&#xD;
"What's the use of'cross-examining a man at that rate ?".&#xD;
said the Squire restlessly. " When I do anything, you'll&#xD;
know it."&#xD;
"You'll make yourself a fool, one of these fine morn-&#xD;
ings ; that's what I count upon," said Miss Cecilia. "He's&#xD;
a match for you, I have a presentiment, Sam."&#xD;
"He won't be for you," said the Squire with some heat.&#xD;
"There's Mr. Simlins goin' along," said Joe, who having&#xD;
finished his supper was gazing out of the window. " 0 my !&#xD;
if he was cut up into real -simlinses, what a many there'd&#xD;
be!"&#xD;
"You hush, Joe !" said his sister wrathfully. "He's&#xD;
coming' in."&#xD;
And Mr. Simlins' tall figui-e did indeed come through th&#xD;
gate and up the walk, from which a very few more steps&#xD;
and minutes brought him to the tea table.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well, Mr. Simlins !" said Miss Cecilia as she gave him&#xD;
his cup,-you've got back.. I heard you were returned."&#xD;
"Yes !" said the farmer deliberately stirring his tea,-.&#xD;
"I've got back! And I'm glad; for one. I've been visit-&#xD;
ing my relations in New Jersey; and I've made up my&#xD;
mind that the Simlinses made a good, move when they&#xD;
come to Connecticut."&#xD;
"You found then all well ?" said Miss Cecilia po-&#xD;
litely.&#xD;
"Well, no, I didn't," said Mr. Simlins. ,"How's a man&#xD;
to find five hundred and fifty people all well? 'Taint&#xD;
nature. How's things with you, Squire ?"&#xD;
"Wheat's done well-corn middlin'," replied the Squire,&#xD;
while Joe got behind his sister's chair and whispered,&#xD;
"There's another name in the diction'ry sounds like&#xD;
your'n, though they aint spelled just alike."&#xD;
"Goin' to school, Joe?" growled Mr. Simlins.&#xD;
"No sir," said Joe. "'Mr. ILinden teached me all he&#xD;
knowed in a jiffy,-and all I know, too."&#xD;
" Well-are the other boys learnin' yet ?" said Mr. Sim-&#xD;
lins, as he spread a slice of bread pretty thick with butter.&#xD;
" S'pose so "-said Joe,-" all they kin."&#xD;
"It's hard work !" said Mr. Simlins.  "i feel it now!&#xD;
Never ploughin' made my back ache like learnin'. I wonder&#xD;
whatever they made me school trustee for, seeing' I hate it&#xD;
like pison. But I s'pose we mustn't quarrel with onerous&#xD;
duties," said the farmer, carrying on sighing and bread&#xD;
and butter and tea very harmoniously together.    "I&#xD;
shouldn't mind takin' a look at your last copy-book, Joe,&#xD;
if it would be agreeable."&#xD;
"0 Mr. Linden kep' that," said Joe unblushingly,&#xD;
"'cause it was so good lookin'."&#xD;
"He way so fond of you ?" said. Mr. Simlins. "How&#xD;
come he to let you go ?"&#xD;
"I staid away;" said Joe, drumming on the back of Miss&#xD;
Cecilia's chair. "Cilly's got the rest of the copy-books--&#xD;
she' likes the writin' too."&#xD;
"Joe, behave yourself!" said his sister.., "Mr. Simlins&#xD;
knows better than to believe you."&#xD;
"Did you ever get flogged, Joe, for bad writin'?" said&#xD;
the farmer.&#xD;

"You write your name for me there-the best you kin-..&#xD;
and 'Pattaquasset, Connecticut'-I want to see what the&#xD;
new school's uip to."&#xD;
"No "-said Joe-" I aint agoin' to do it. You ask one&#xD;
of the other boys. It wouldn't tell you nothin' if I did,&#xD;
'cause I learned writin' afore,-and I didn't go to him but&#xD;

"Is it workin' as straight with all the rest of 'em as it is&#xD;
with him ?" said Mr. Simlins. "You and me's got to see to&#xD;
it, you know, Squire-seem' we're honorary individuals."&#xD;
"Yes," said Squire Deacon,. rousing up now, Joe was&#xD;
gone-he had a wholesome fear of Joe's tongue-"Yes,.,&#xD;

"Joe,"-said Mr. Sinlins.  "Ne-ver fear--he'll see to&#xD;

"Here's some of his' ritin'," said Joe, returning with a&#xD;
spelling book. "All the boys gets him to write in their&#xD;

final departure.&#xD;
"What do the boys want him to write in their books for ?"&#xD;
growled Mr. Simlins, surveying the signature.&#xD;
"I believe," said Miss Cecilia, "he is very popular in the&#xD;
school."&#xD;
"Well, Squire," pursued .Mr. Simlins, "can Joe clinch&#xD;
this ?"&#xD;
"He aint with me-if that's what you mean," said Squire&#xD;
Peacon. "A man's writing don't prove much."&#xD;
"Don't go no furder," said Mr. Simlins assentingly.&#xD;
"Well Squire-if you'll go furder I shall be wiser."&#xD;
And freed from the fear of contradiction, the Squire&#xD;
had not the least objection to going further.&#xD;
"He's not the man to have here," said Squire Deacon,--&#xD;
"I saw that the first, day I saw him. I tried him,-and he&#xD;
didn't toe the mark."&#xD;
" How did you try him?" growled Mr. Simlins. " I'd&#xD;
like to know how much he's up to. I haint found it out&#xD;
yet."&#xD;

"I tried him, sir," said the Squire, "I tried him with a&#xD;
classical story. Now Miss- Faith gave in at once, and&#xD;
said she didn't know what it was ; but 'tother one made&#xD;
believe as though he knew all about it. And if a man&#xD;
aint classical, Mr. Simlins, what is he?"&#xD;
"I aint classical," growled Mr. Simlins again, "but then&#xD;
I don't set up for to be. I s'pose that makes difference,&#xD;
Squire; don't it?"&#xD;
Some people 's more than they set out to be, and some&#xD;
people 's less," replied the Squire.&#xD;
Well,-does he set up for to be classical in school?&#xD;
What does he teach 'em?"&#xD;
.I reckon he sets up for 'most everything he ever heard&#xD;
spoke of, Mr. Simlins. Teach 'em ? why he .teaches 'em&#xD;
out of all sorts o' superflus books !"&#xD;
"Does !"-said Mr. Simlins with a surprised look. "Our&#xD;
boys don't want none o' your superficies. Th y've got&#xD;
their bread to make. Give us an invoice o' them books,&#xD;
Squire."&#xD;
"Just you look at 'em for yourself, Mr. Simlins-then&#xD;
you'll know. Step down there some day in school time&#xD;
and look over the boys. Now I can understand figures&#xD;
with any man, but what 's the use o' crosses and straight&#xD;
lines and Vs turned wrong side up ?"&#xD;
Mr. Simlins pushed back his chair and rubbed his chin.&#xD;
" Well Squire-you and me are trustees-what in your&#xD;
judgment and opinion had we ought to do, in these pre-&#xD;
cedents ?"&#xD;
" Get rid on him-I say," replied the Squire promptly.&#xD;
Then here he is, leadin' all the girls round town, and for&#xD;
all any one of 'em knows he's a. married man."&#xD;
" Humph ! think so ?--What do the folks say of him?"&#xD;
said Mr. Simlins. "There's Mrs. Derrick - what does&#xD;
she say of him--he's in her house, she ought to have an&#xD;
idee. And Faith=-now I'd take that gal's judgment on&#xD;
almost anything-What do they think about him, Squire ?"&#xD;
"Never asked 'em a word," said the Squire stoutly.-&#xD;
nor heard 'em say one, neither. But he gets fur'n letters&#xD;
al the time, Widow Stamp says-and female writiri' too.&#xD;
Wh nows but he's got a wife in some fur'n country ?--or.&#xD;
two"--added the Squire, without specifying where the&#xD;

and this shouldn't be let-go on."&#xD;
Mr. Simlins looked.   from  under his brows with a&#xD;
queer look at his hos&#xD;
"If he has two, he must want the school-bad !"-said&#xD;
he. "Well Squire, I'll go along and see what can be&#xD;
done. If I was you, mean time, I'd not say much to no&#xD;
one. There's Judge Harrison, you know ;-we can't act&#xD;
without him. Good night t'ye ! Squire, I guess he haint&#xD;
two?-Anyhow, I wouldn't let fly no warrants till I saw&#xD;
my bird sitting somewhere. It's bad to have 'em hit in a&#xD;
wrong place."&#xD;
And it was well it was darkish and nobody to look at&#xD;
him; for Mr. Simlins went grinning pretty much all the&#xD;
way between Squire Deacon's house and the house of Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick, where Mr. Linden was entertaining his shadow in&#xD;
the moonlit porch.&#xD;
"Good even to you !" growled Mr. Simlins as he came&#xD;
up. The grin was gone, and the farm r stood with his&#xD;
wonted solemnity of face and manner. ' Where's the rest&#xD;
o' your folks ?"&#xD;
"The rest of my folks are a good way off, Mr. Simlins,"&#xD;
said the person addressed, giving the questioner his hand;&#xD;
while his shadow exchanged civilities with the shadow of&#xD;
Mr. Simlins. "When did you come back? I am glad to&#xD;
see you?"&#xD;
"I'm glad to see myself," said Mr. Simlins. " There's&#xD;
no State like Connecticut, sir. Where's your bringin' up&#xD;
place ?"&#xD;
"No one place has had that honour, Mr. Simlins,-I have&#xD;
been brought up from one to an her."&#xD;
"Not Connecticut, eh ?"&#xD;
"Not altogether .-I am here just now, as you see,-&#xD;
getting a part of my education. I am  one of the Say&#xD;
and Seal people in a way. Won't you come in, Mr. Sin-&#xD;
lins ?"&#xD;
Well-I'd as lief see Faith and Mrs. Derrick as a'most&#xD;
any other two folks in Pattaquasset,-but they're a long&#xD;
ways off, you say ?"                            .a&#xD;
"No further than the parlour, I believe."&#xD;
Mr. Simlins was willing to go as far as the parlour, and&#xD;
&#xD;
so the party on the porch adjourned thither. A bright&#xD;
lamp lit the room, by which -Faith was mending stockings ;&#xD;
while Mrs. Derrick sat in an easy chair a little further off,&#xD;
rocking and knitting.&#xD;
"Well," said Mr. Simlins, "when the sun goes down I&#xD;
think it is time to' knock off work; but womenkind don't&#xD;
seem to think so."&#xD;
"I guess when the sun goes down your work's knocked&#xD;
off, Mr. Simlins," said Mrs. Derrick.&#xD;
"Fact, Mrs. Derrick, when I'm to home; but when a&#xD;
man's visiting he has to work night and day. Moonlight's&#xD;
moonlight now. I declare, in Jersey I thought it was&#xD;
broad sunshine.-You haven't been down to my place yet,&#xD;
Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"No sir, not within the gate."&#xD;
"The Simlins' have held that place, sir, off and onffor&#xD;
nigh three hundred years. We're a good many Simlins'--.&#xD;
and we're a good set, I'll say it ! a pretty good set. Not&#xD;
thin-skinned, you know,-we can take a scratch without&#xD;
being' killed-.---but we never would stand being' trampled on.&#xD;
We're soft-hearted too ; plenty o' what I may call tendrils,&#xD;
ready to take hold of anything; and when we take hold we&#xD;
do take hold. ie cover a good deal of ground in the&#xD;
country, here and elsewhere--in the various branches. My&#xD;
mother was a Mush; and my' grandmother was a Citron ;&#xD;
good families those, sir; can't do better than take a wife&#xD;
from one. of them, Mr. Linden, if you are so disposed ;--.&#xD;
you haven't got one already, have you ?"&#xD;
"What, sir ?" said Mr. Linden, with more sharpness&#xD;
than he often showed, and which made Mrs. Derrick drop&#xD;
her knitting and look up.&#xD;
" I, thought you wasn't a married man--are you ?" ,said&#xD;
Mr. Simlins, the grin just showing itself again on his face.&#xD;
"Is that one of the charges brought against me ?" said&#xD;
Mr. Linden, a little too roused himself to pay much heed&#xD;
to Mr. Simlins' questions.&#xD;
"Well I didn't know as you'd think it a 'charge,'" said&#xD;
Mr. Simlins with an unchanged tone. "I guess you mean&#xD;
to make it true sorg day, don't you ?"&#xD;
The question fell unheeded-.the charge did not; it&#xD;

touched him deeply; touched the proud sense of character;&#xD;
though no words gave evidence of the fact.&#xD;
"Faith, child," sdid Mrs. Derrick in that moment of&#xD;
silence, her whisper as low- as she thought would reach&#xD;
across the table, "ought we to be here ?"&#xD;
But a very emphatic "Yes !" from the window, prevented&#xD;
the need of Faith's answer.&#xD;
"I was only recommnding," said Mr. Simlins, "in case&#xD;
you wanted help to make up your mind. The Citrons are&#xD;
all gone to New Jersey-there's a few of the Mushes&#xD;
ramblin' round Connecticut yet. Well Mr. Linden-.I&#xD;
hope you and your boys get on commodiously together ?"&#xD;
"Just look into that basket on the table, and see what&#xD;
one of 'em brought him to-night," said Mrs. Derrick.&#xD;
"Those are Stoutenburgh Sweetings, Mr. Simlins."&#xD;
Mr. Simlins looked at the Sweetings and then looked&#xD;
towards the window.&#xD;
" I'd like to hear you speak a little on that point," he said.&#xD;
"Fact is, there's been some winds blowin' about Pattaquas-&#xD;
set that aint come off beds o' roses ; and I'd like to find-&#xD;
where the pison is and clap a stopper on it for the future.&#xD;
It's easy done.".&#xD;
Mr. Linden looked up with his usual expression, only&#xD;
the smile was grave and a little moved, and answered,&#xD;
"I could say a good deal on that point, Mr. Simlins.&#xD;
Yet I had rather you should ask the boys than me."&#xD;
"Don't want to ask the boys nothin, bless you I'" said&#xD;
Mr. Simlins. "What I want to say is this ;-what's the&#xD;
matter between you and the Squire ? I've been askin' him,&#xD;
and he says you learn the boys to make a V wrong fide up.&#xD;
ward-I can't make nothin' of that," said Mr. Simling, with&#xD;
again the'approach to a grin ;-" 'taint over easy to tell&#xD;
whether his V's are one side up or 'tother. Now I'd like&#xD;
to know from you where the hitch is. The Squire aint&#xD;
likely to set the Mong in a configuration just yet-but if&#xD;
he's swingin' a torch round, I'd jest as lief put it out afore&#xD;
the sparks fly."&#xD;
But Mr. Simlins, don't you think it is rather hard&#xD;
measure to ask me why people dislike me 7"?&#xD;
" Well--I don't see) as I do," said Mr. Simlfrhs placidly;&#xD;
.--" 'cause I know pretty well it's some chymistry idee of&#xD;
&#xD;
his own; and if I could get hold of it, you see, I should&#xD;
have a better handle. I guess the school never went on&#xD;
better than it's going ; he don't know beans."&#xD;
" How do you know that I do ?" said Mr. Linden smil-&#xD;
ing. " Why dou't you ask him? I think at least half his&#xD;
ill will arises from a mistake."&#xD;
"Have asked hin," said Mr. Simlins-"just come from&#xD;
there;-but he's pretty much like them V's we were speak-&#xD;
in' about; don't spell nothin'. What's his mistake about&#xD;
then? if I knowed that, I could bring things to a con-&#xD;
cert."&#xD;
"Why," said Mr. Linden with grave deliberation, "sup-&#xD;
pose he wants to buy your house? and takes a walk up&#xD;
that way to set forth his terms."&#xD;
"Well-- suppose he does"-said Mr. Simlins atten-&#xD;
tively.&#xD;
"He finds you and Judge Harrison in the porch, you&#xD;
talk about the crops and the weather, and he tells you he&#xD;
wants your house. What do you say to him ?"&#xD;
"I tell him I don't sell it to no one but a Simlins-nor&#xD;
that neither till I can't live in it no longer myself."&#xD;
" Is that your fault-or Judge Harrison's ?" said Mr.&#xD;
Linden, setting the basket of Stoutenburgh' Sweetings on&#xD;
'the little table in the full light of the lamp. "Miss Faith,&#xD;
if thole are 'sweetenings,' they may as well do their&#xD;
office."&#xD;
The farmer sat with his elbows oh his knees, touching&#xD;
the tips'of his fingers together in thoughtful fashion, and&#xD;
softly blowing the breath through his lips in a way that&#xD;
might have reached the dignity of a whistle if it had had&#xD;
a trifle more of musicalness.&#xD;
"Is them the sort of lessons you give in school ?" he&#xD;
said at length without stirring.&#xD;
"Why ?" said Mf. Linden with a little bit of a smile.&#xD;
"Ingen-uousgs s4id Mr. Simlins. "It's as good as a&#xD;

chair, "is Squire D acon wantin' to buy your house ?"&#xD;
"My I" said Mrs. Derrick, again laying downher kn't-&#xD;

"Miss Faith," said Mr. Linden, "do you think if I gave&#xD;
you an apple you would give me a knife ?"&#xD;
"I hope he don't," growled Mr. Simlins as he rose up.&#xD;
I never heerd that he did. Miss Faith-them Stouten-&#xD;
burgh Sweetings is good eatin'. " Faith after setting a&#xD;
pile of plates and knives on the table, had taken up her&#xD;
stocking again.&#xD;
"Yes Mr. Simlins-I know they are."&#xD;
"Then why don't you eat one ?"&#xD;
"I don't want it just now, Mr. Siiilins-I'd rather finish&#xD;
my work."&#xD;
"Work !" said the farmer taking an apple. "Well-&#xD;
good evening! I'll go and look after my work. I guess&#xD;
we'll fix it. There's a sight o' workin the world I"&#xD;
With which moral reflection Mr. Simlins departed.&#xD;
"There'll be more work than sight, at this rate," said&#xD;
Mr. Linden when he came back from the front door.&#xD;
"Mrs. Derrick, how many stockings does Miss Faith abso-&#xD;
lutely require for one day ?"&#xD;
"Why I don't know sir-and I don't believe I ever did&#xD;
know since she was big, enough to run about," said Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick, her mind still dwelling upon the house. d&#xD;
"Miss Faith, my question stands transferred to you."&#xD;
"Why you know," said Faith, intent upon the motions&#xD;
of her needle,--"I might require to mend in one day&#xD;
what would last me to wear a good many-and I do."&#xD;
"But,&#xD;
'The day is done-and the darkness&#xD;
'Falls from the wing of night.'"&#xD;
"I never mend stockings till then," said Faith smiling&#xD;
over her work. "Are Sam's apples good ?"&#xD;
"By reputation."&#xD;
"I thought you were trying them! Why you asked me&#xD;
for a knife, Mr. Linden-and I brought it."&#xD;
"I'm sure I gave you an apple. Perhaps you thought&#xD;
it was a ball of darning cotton."&#xD;
"No, I didn't," said Faith laughing. "But what use is&#xD;
my apple to your knife, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"Not much-it has served the purposes of trade."&#xD;
"But what is the purpose of trade, Mr. Linden, if the&#xD;
articles aren't wanted ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"I see you are dissatisfied with your bargain," he said.&#xD;
"Well, I will be generous-you shall have the, knife too;"&#xD;
and Mr. Linden walked away from the table and went up-&#xD;
stairs.&#xD;
The parlour was very still after that. Faith's needle,&#xD;
indeed,:worked with more zeal than ever, but Mrs. Derrick&#xD;
rolled up her knitting and put it in her basket, sighing&#xD;
a little as she did so : then sat and thought.&#xD;
"Faith, child," she said after a long pause, "do you&#xD;
think the Squire would ever take our house ?"&#xD;
Faith hesitated, and the answer when it came was not&#xD;
satisfactory.&#xD;
"I don't know, mother."&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick sighed'again, and leaned back in her chair,&#xD;
and rocked ; the rockers creaking in rather doleful sympa-&#xD;
thy with her thoughts. Then an owl on a tree before the&#xD;
door hooted at the world generally, though Mrs. Derrick&#xD;
evidently thought his remarks personal.&#xD;
"I can't think why he should do that to-night, of all&#xD;
nights in the year !" she said, sitting straight up in her&#xD;
chair. "It never did mean good. Faith-what should&#xD;
we do if he did ?"-this time she meant the Squire, not the&#xD;
owl. p&#xD;
"Mother !"-said Faith, and then she spoke in her usual&#xD;
tone.--" We'd find a way."&#xD;
"Well !-2-" said Mrs. Derrick, rocking back and forth.&#xD;
Then she started up. "We've got to have biscuits for&#xD;
breakfast, whether or no ! It's good I remembered 'em !"&#xD;
And she hurried out of the room, coming back to kiss&#xD;
Faith and say,&#xD;
"Don't fret, pretty child, whatever happens. Go to bed&#xD;
and to sleep,-I'll make the bli"y' And alert and busy&#xD;
she left the parlour.&#xD;
Faith's sleep was quiet, but not unbroken. For at that&#xD;
time when all well-disposed people, young or old, are gene-&#xD;
rally asleep (in such a well-ordered community as Patta-&#xD;
quasset) it pleased the younger portion of said community&#xD;
to be awake. Yet they were well-disposed-and also ill !&#xD;
For repairing in a body to Mrs. Derrick's house they gave&#xD;
her nine cheers for her Iodger,-thence departing to Squire&#xD;
Deacon's, they gave him as many groans as he could rea-&#xD;

sonably want for himself. After which the younger part&#xD;
of the community retired in triumph.&#xD;
It was said, by one adventurous boy, that falling in with&#xD;
Mr. Simlins they impressed him-that his voice helped on&#xD;
the cheers, but not the groans: and indeed-the whole story&#xD;
needs confirmation.&#xD;
Faith heard the groans but faintly, owing to the dis.&#xD;
tance, but the cheers were tremendous.&#xD;
It is painful to add that Joe Deacon was vociferous in&#xD;
both parties.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
T   HOPE your rest was disturbed last night," said&#xD;
T Faith rather gaily, as she came in to the breakfast-&#xD;
table with a plate of biscuits and set them down' before&#xD;
Mr. Linden.&#xD;
" Thank you ! you have reason to be quite satisfied in&#xD;
that respect."&#xD;
"But did you hear them after theft left our house ."&#xD;
"I heard them-really or in imagination-all night, thank&#xD;
you again, Miss Faith-and am 'as sleepy this morning as&#xD;
you can desire."&#xD;
"It wasn't I," said Faith. "Now what notice, Mr.&#xD;
Linden, will you think it proper to take of such a proceeding?"&#xD;
"That was one thing which kept me awake."&#xD;
"But as you are sleepy now, I suppose the point is de-&#xD;
cided ?"&#xD;
"You are as quick at conclusions 'as Johnny Fax," said&#xD;
Mr. Linden smiling, "who always supposes that when I am&#xD;
not using my pen myself I am quite ready to let him have it."&#xD;
"Does he get it ?"&#xD;
"What should you advise ?"&#xD;
"0 Mr. Linden!1" said Faith,-" I should advise you to&#xD;
do-just what you do,!"&#xD;
"Unsound !" he said,-"I thought you were a better&#xD;
adviser. But about this matter of the boys-I shall pro-&#xD;
bably read them a lecture, wherein I shall set forth the risk&#xD;
they run of- getting sick by such exposure to the night air;&#xD;
also the danger I am in of being sent away from my pre-&#xD;
sent quarters, because ladies prefer sleep to disturbance.&#xD;
Having thus wrought up their feelings to the highest pitch,&#xD;
I shall give them a holiday and come home to dinner."&#xD;
Faith laughed her little low laugh of pleasure; at least&#xD;
it always sounded so. It might be pleasure at one thing&#xD;
or at another; but it was as round and sweet a tone of&#xD;
merry or happy acknowledgment, as is ever heard in this&#xD;
world of discordances.&#xD;

"But are you really sleepy, sir.?" said Mrs. Derrick.&#xD;
"I'm so sorry ! I thought they were doing nothing but&#xD;
good. I never once thought of their waking you up."&#xD;
Mr. Linden laughed too,,a little.&#xD;
"I shall get waked up"- he said,-" in the course of the&#xD;
day. Unless somebody has drugged my coffee."&#xD;
" fudge Harrison was here this morning, Mr. Linden,&#xD;
.with a message for you," said Faith} "Mother, will you&#xD;
tell Mr. Linden what Judge Harrison said ?"&#xD;
" I'd rather hear you, child, by half," said her mother,&#xD;
with a smile whereon the house cast a little shadow. "Tell&#xD;
him yourself, Faith."  And Mrs. Derrick sighed, and took&#xD;
her napkin and rubbed off a spot on the coffeepot.&#xD;
"Judge Harrison came--" said Faith, and paused.&#xD;
"And went away"-said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"Yes," said Faith. " He stopped on his way some-&#xD;
where, and came into the kitchen to talk to us.  He said&#xD;
he would like, if' you would like it, he would like to have a,&#xD;
great exhibition of the boys-he knows about the school,&#xD;
he says, and there hasn't been such a school in Pattaquas-&#xD;
set since he has been here himself; and he would like to&#xD;
shew it up to the whole town.' So if Mr. Linden approved&#xD;
of it, Judge Harrison said, he would have a gathering of&#xD;
all the countryside in some nice place-the Judge has&#xD;
plenty of ground and can get anybody else's besides; and&#xD;
the boys should have a great examination, and after that&#xD;
there should be an entertainment .under the trees, for boys&#xD;
and all. And he wanted mother to speak to Mr. Linden,&#xD;
and see whether he would like it. And mother wouldn't,"&#xD;
said Faith as she finished.&#xD;
Mr. Linden raised his eyebrows slightly-then let them&#xD;
fall and likewise his eyes. Then sent his cup to be re- 2&#xD;
plenished, gravely remarking to Faith that if she had any&#xD;
drugs, she might -put them in now!-&#xD;
"What kind of drugs would you like, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
said Faith.&#xD;
"Any that are deeply sedative."&#xD;
"Sedative ?" said Faith, with that look which he often&#xD;
drew from her, .-. very earnest, half wistful, half sorrow-&#xD;
ful,-" I don't know what it means, Mr. Linden." -&#xD;
"It means," said he, his face relaxing a little, "'such as&#xD;
&#xD;
diminish the physical energy, without destroying life,'--such&#xD;
in short, as might qualify a man for the situation of a tame&#xD;
monkey on a pole."&#xD;
Faith's look changed to a sort of indignant little glance,&#xD;
and her lips parted ; but they closed again and her eyes&#xD;
went down to her plate.&#xD;
"What were you going to remark, Miss Faith?"&#xD;
Faith blushed a good deal, however the answer came stea-&#xD;
dily. "I don't think any drugs would do that for you."&#xD;
"I am in a bad way, then," said Mr. Linden with un-&#xD;
moved gravity.  "Because if I survive this trial of what I&#xD;
can bear, I intend to advertise for the afore-named situa-&#xD;
tion.. Have you heard of any vacant pole, Miss Faith?"&#xD;
Faith looked at him with a grave, considering wonder,&#xD;
j which gradually broke into a sense of 'fun; and then she&#xD;
laughed, as she did not often laugh.&#xD;
Apparently Mr. Linden was well enough pleased with&#xD;
such answer to his words, for he not only made no attempt&#xD;
to stop her, but even remarked that it was good to be of a&#xD;
sympathizing disposition.&#xD;
The day passed as usual; only of lite it had got to be.&#xD;
Faith's habit to spend a good deal of time shut up in her&#xD;
room. It had never been her habit before. But now&#xD;
after going through her early household duties, of whie&#xD;
Faith had plenty, she used to be out of sight often for an&#xD;
hour before dinner; unless when the dinner required just&#xD;
that hour of her attention. Nothing was left behind her&#xD;
to call her down. Her dairy, her bread and cake, her pies&#xD;
and cream-cheeses, her dinner preparations-.-whatever the&#xD;
things might be-.-.were all ready for the day's wants; and&#xD;
then Faith was gone. After dinner it was sti] more surely&#xD;
the same. Yet though all this was true, it wa so quietly&#xD;
and unobtrusively true that Mrs. Derrick had h rdly ob-&#xD;
served it.&#xD;
It happened this afternoon that Faith lingered upstairs,&#xD;
-not until teatime, but until she heard her mother 'call.&#xD;
Reuben Taylor wanted to see her. He was at the gate.&#xD;
" I didn't want to disturb you, Miss Faith. I told Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick so. It's only some clams,-which I thought maybe\&#xD;
you'd like," said Reuben modestly.- "I left 'em in the&#xD;

"Thank you, Reuben-I like them very much. Do you&#xD;
feel better than you did yesterday ?"&#xD;
"Yes, ma'am-" said Reuben rather slowly,-" I felt a&#xD;
great deal better last night."&#xD;
"And to-day-don't you ?"&#xD;
"Yes, ma'am," Reuben answered as before.&#xD;
"But not so well as last night?  What's the matter,&#xD;
Reuben ?"&#xD;
"Didn't you hear what they did last night, ma'am ?"&#xD;
"To be sure I did, but what has made you feel worse to.&#xD;
day ?"&#xD;
"Why you know, ma'am," said Reuben, "last night I&#xD;
forgot all about everybody but Mr. Linden. But oh Miss&#xD;
Faith! I just wish you could have been in school to-day&#xD;
for one rainute !-when Mr. Linden came in! You see,"&#xD;
said Reuben, excitement conquering reserve, "the boys&#xD;
were all there-there wasn't one of 'em late, and every one&#xD;
had a sprig of basswood in his hat and in his buttonhole.&#xD;
And we all kept our hats on till he got in, and stood up to&#xD;
meet him (though that we do always) and then we took off&#xD;
our hats together and gave him such a shout !--You know,&#xD;
Miss Faith," added Reuben with a smile both expressive&#xD;
and sweet, "basswood's a kind of linden."&#xD;
" And what did Mr. Linden do ?" said Faith with a&#xD;
smile of her own that very well reflected Reuben's.&#xD;
"He didn't say much," said Reuben,--" he looked a good&#xD;
deal."&#xD;
"Well, you foolish boy," said Faith gently, "don't you&#xD;
feel well now, after all that ? What's the matter ?"&#xD;
A heavy, shoe-leathery step came down the street--it&#xD;
was Squire Deacon. Reuben knew who it was before the&#xD;
Squire came near, for he flushed up, and for a moment&#xD;
stood with his back resolutely turned towards the gate;&#xD;
then with an air as resolute, but different, he turned round&#xD;
and bowed as courteously as he knew how-far more so&#xD;
than the Squire did to him; for the combination of Faith&#xD;
and Reuben did not seen to fall pleasantly upon Squire&#xD;
Deacon's organs. of vision; nor indeed could he have quite&#xD;
forgotten last night.&#xD;
" Reuben, come ini," said Faith -touching his shoulder&#xD;
and smiling,-." I want to speak' to you. But* first answer&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.                   'I&#xD;
h my question-why don't you feel quite well now?  You&#xD;
i ought, Reuben."&#xD;
"Yes, Miss Faith---I know I ought,-at least I oughtn't&#xD;
to feel just as I do," Reuben answered.  " Mr. Linden&#xD;
told me so to-day."&#xD;
"Then why do you feel so ?" Faith asked with increased&#xD;
earn stress.&#xD;
X4uben coloured and hesitated.&#xD;
"Folks vex me--" he said in a low voice. "And.-and&#xD;
Mr. Linden ays I love him too well if I'm not willing to&#xD;
let him g    n God pleases. And I know it's true.-.&#xD;
but-." an Reuben followed Faith into the house without&#xD;
another word.&#xD;
"What do you mean about Mr. Linden's going ?"&#xD;
"Just that, ma'am," said Reuben simply. "Because we&#xD;
can't make ourselves feel well by thinking things are going&#xD;
just as we want 'em to.-he says that's not strong enough&#xD;
ground to rest on."&#xD;
j ."But does he talk of going away, Reuben ?"&#xD;
"0 no ! Miss Faith I never heard him,--he only talked&#xD;
so to me because of what other folks said."&#xD;
"Well," said Faith with a change of tone, "you're a&#xD;
foolish boy. You come and see me whenever you-get feel-&#xD;
ing bad again. Folks can't hurt Mr. Linden. Now look&#xD;
here---Wait a niinute, will you !".&#xD;
Faith ran upstairs ; speedily came down again with a&#xD;
little bluecovered book in her hand.&#xD;
"Is this the arithmetic you study ?" she said softly,&#xD;
coming close to him.&#xD;
Reuben took the book with some  . rise in his face.&#xD;
"Yes, m&amp;amp;'am, this is the one." An he looked up at&#xD;
her as if to ask, what next.&#xD;
"How far have you gone ?"&#xD;
"I am through thi now," said Reuben, "but some of&#xD;
the others are here-nd here."&#xD;
"Then you can tell me," said Faith. She turned over to&#xD;
a certain page, far on in the book too, and putting it into&#xD;
Reuben's hands, said quietly,&#xD;
"I am studying it, and I cannot make anything of this.&#xD;
Do you remember how it was explained ?"&#xD;
"The book's wrong," said Reuben, after a glance at it,--&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="72-73" xml:id="VAC8219-00000036"/>&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
'I remember, Miss Faith.  See-it ought to be so-and&#xD;
so-" Reuben went on explaining. "All the books we&#xD;
could get here were just like it, and Mr. Linden said if&#xD;
tie found any more mistakes he would send to Quilipeak&#xD;
nd get good ones. He chewed us how this ought to&#xD;
"That's it !" said Faith. "Thank you, Reuben. And&#xD;
you needn't tell anybodyI asked you about it."&#xD;
Reuben looked a little surprised again, but he said "No,&#xD;
ma'am," and made his bow.&#xD;
It was Faith's turn, to be surprised then, for stepping&#xD;
into the tea-room to look at the clek, she found not only'&#xD;
the clock but Mr. Linden,-the former ticking sundry&#xD;
minutes past teatime, the latter enjoying the sunset clouds&#xD;
and his own reflections, and (possibly) his book. Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick, favouring the atmosphere of the little wood fire,&#xD;
which had burnt itself out to coals and ashes, sat at one&#xD;
coiner of the hearth; taking up the stiches round the heel&#xD;
of her stocking ; which precarious operation engrossed her&#xD;
completely. Mr. Linden however looked up, and took in&#xD;
the whole of the little picture before him. Apparently the&#xD;
picture was pleasant, for he smiled.&#xD;
Faith's look was startled.&#xD;
"I am late !" she said with a compunctious glance at the&#xD;
clock. And as soon as it could be made the tea came in&#xD;
smoking. As Faith took her seat at the table she put&#xD;
her question.&#xD;
"When did you come in, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"About a quarter of an hour before you did."&#xD;
"By which way?"&#xD;
"Why !-by the door. It is simpler than the window."&#xD;
The next few seconds seemed to be employed by Faith&#xD;
in buttering -bread and eating it, but in reality they were&#xD;
used for carrying on a somewhat hurried calculation of&#xD;
minutes and distances which brought the colour in her&#xD;
cheeks to a hue of pretty richness.&#xD;
" Did I run over anybody in my way ?" asked Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"What gives the question its interest ?"&#xD;
"I had thought7 you were out," said Faith quietly.&#xD;
"I know a shorter way to the store than you do," said&#xD;
Mr. Linden with equal quietness.&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.                    73&#xD;
"To the store !" Isaid Faith, eye and lip quite putting&#xD;
quietness out of the question.&#xD;
"Yes, I found your footprints there the other day, and&#xD;
I have been wanting to tell you ever since that it is not&#xD;
anything like so far up to my room. Let me recommend&#xD;
that way to you for the future."&#xD;
Faith's colour was no matter of degrees now, for it&#xD;
rushed over temples and cheek in a flood. And seemed&#xD;
inclined to be a permanency.&#xD;
" There you may take what you like," he went on, with&#xD;
a smile that was both amused and° encouraging, "and I&#xD;
shall be none the wiser-unless you tell me yourself. If&#xD;
you do tell me, I shall be very glad. lIow Miss Faith.-.&#xD;
what shall we do about Judge Harrison ?"&#xD;
Faith hesitated, and struggled perhaps, for it did not&#xD;
seem very easy to speak with that deep flush on her brow;&#xD;
and then she said rather low,&#xD;
"I am not ungrateful, Mr. Linden."&#xD;
"Neither am I-but this proposal of his gives me some&#xD;
trouble. I think if he would have all the fun, without any&#xD;
of the shewing off, it would answer every good purpose&#xD;
and avoid all the bad ones. And if you will intimate as&#xD;
much to your mother, Miss Faith, and persuade her to&#xD;
convey the information to Judge Harrison, it will perhaps&#xD;
be the best way of reply. Of course as trustee he has&#xD;
still the right of doing as he likes.",&#xD;
"Mother, do you hear ?" said Faith, "or do you want&#xD;
me to repeat it ?"&#xD;
"No, child,"-sail her mother abstractedly; "I didn't&#xD;
hear, to be sure,  ow should I?   Faith-what do you&#xD;
suppose makes Cindy break the noses 'off all our milk&#xD;
pitchers ?"&#xD;
This was an irresistible question. Faith's own face came&#xD;
back, and during the rest of supper-time she was like her-&#xD;
self, only with a shade more than was usual upon her brow&#xD;
and manner.&#xD;
The short September -day had little twilight to lengthen&#xD;
it out. .The cool westrn horizon still outshone the setting&#xD;
stars with its clear light, but in the east and overhead&#xD;
others came out, 'silently, one by one.' Mr. Linden went&#xD;

the parlour, watched and gazed at by her mother the&#xD;
while.&#xD;
"Child," said Mrs. Derrick, "what makes you stay up.&#xD;
stairs so ? I never thought of it till I went to call you to&#xD;
see Reuben-but seems to me you are up there a great,&#xD;
deal."&#xD;
Faith smiled a little and also looked grave, as she was&#xD;
putting on the shade of the lamp.&#xD;
"Yes, mother "-she said,-" I am."&#xD;
"What for, pretty child ?" said her mother fondly.&#xD;
Faith was pretty, in the look with which she answered&#xD;
this appeal. Her smile dropped its gravity, and only love&#xD;
came in to make the confession.&#xD;
"Mother, I am trying to learn. I want to be wiser."&#xD;
"Learn 1" said Mrs. Derrick in utter astonishment, and&#xD;
rousing out of her resting position. "Trying to learn,&#xD;
child ?"&#xD;
" Yes, mother-what about it ? I don't know anything;&#xD;
and I want to know-a great deal1-&#xD;
"Why you know everything now !" said Mrs. Derrick.&#xD;
"What don't you know, Faith1?-1 should like to 1"&#xD;
Faith smiled.&#xD;
"Mother, I don't know anything !"-and then she added&#xD;
more brightly, "I've begun with arithmetic, for one thing."&#xD;
" Arithmetic I" said Mrs. Derrick; and she paused, and&#xD;
leaned back in 'her chair, rocking gently to and fro, with a&#xD;
shade of soberness stealing over her face.&#xD;
"You never did have .much chance,"-she said at length,&#xD;
"because I couldn't give it to you then. My heart was&#xD;
broke, Faith, and I couldn't bear to have you out of my&#xD;
sight for a minute. But somehow I thought you knew&#xD;
everything." And she sat still once more, looking at Faith&#xD;
as if trying to reinstate herself in her old opinion. Nor&#xD;
altogether without success ; for with a little smile coming&#xD;
over her face, Mrs. Derrick added,&#xD;
"You won't be any sweeter-learn as much as you will,&#xD;
child,-you needn't think, it ;" and the rockers would have&#xD;
certainly come into play again if Cindy had not opened&#xD;
the door and claimed attention. -&#xD;
"I s'pose likely you don't want to go down to Widder&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.                , 75&#xD;
Stamp's ? she said.  Cause she wants you to come. I'm&#xD;
free to confess she's got the high-strikes wonderful."&#xD;
"Mother," said Faith, giving her one or two kisses as&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick rQse to prove the contrary of Cindy's supposi-&#xD;
tion, "I shall be a great deal happier;-and I am getting&#xD;
along nicely.&#xD;
Which sent Mrs. Derrick off in triumph. But when she&#xD;
was gone, Faith did not take her basket of stockings nor&#xD;
yet her arithmetic; but sat down by the 'table with her&#xD;
head in her hands and sat very still. Still, until Mi. Lin-&#xD;
den came in, laid one paper on the table at her side, and&#xD;
sat down to read another. -Faith's darning-needle came&#xD;
.:into play'then, and worked quick and silently  Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den glanced towards it as he laid down his paper.&#xD;
L "I see you evaded my question last night," he said,.--&#xD;
"there could not be such a constant supply, if there were&#xD;
not also a constant demand."&#xD;
"Mr. Linden," said Faith, her colour a little raised and&#xD;
her voice changing somewhat,-."I want to ask you some-&#xD;
s  thing--if you are not busy about anything."&#xD;
"I am not-but you might ask just as freely if I were."&#xD;
F {  "I couldn't," said Faith. She drew' her hand out of&#xD;
her stocking and put her thimble on the table.&#xD;
Mr. Linden," she said without looking at him,-." a&#xD;
while ago, when you were speaking of faith and a cloudy&#xD;
day, and I told you I wasn't like that,-you said I must&#xD;
read the Bible their, and do what that said. I have been&#xD;
tyng to do it."--.Z&#xD;
Shading his eyes with his hand, he looked at her-as if&#xD;
waiting to hear more.&#xD;
"And I don't understand it," she said.-" I don't know&#xD;
how to get on."&#xD;
"Do you mean, with the Bible ? Is it that you do not&#xD;
understand ?"&#xD;
"I don't understand some things-I don't know exactly&#xD;
what I ought to do."&#xD;
"In what respect ?--where is the difficulty ?' Some&#xD;
things in the Bible you never will understand, perhaps, in&#xD;
this world, and others you must learn by degrees."&#xD;
"I don't understand exactly what makes a Christian---.&#xD;
and I want to be one."&#xD;

SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
It was spoken i  and timidly; but Faith was in earnest.&#xD;
Mr. Linden sat silen a minute, without changing his posi..&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"A Christian is one, who trusting in Christ as his only&#xD;
Saviour, thenceforth obeys him as his only King."&#xD;
Faith hesitated and thought. "I don't understand," she&#xD;
said folding her hands,-"about the trusting."&#xD;
"Suppose there was s mething you wanted done---too&#xD;
hard for your strength but not for mine,---would you know&#xD;
how to trust it in my hands ?"&#xD;
She bowed her head and said, "Yes !"&#xD;
"Suppose I consented to do it only upon condition that&#xD;
for the rest of your life myawill and pleasure should be your&#xD;
only rule of action,-would the great work still be yours&#xD;
or mine ?"&#xD;
"Why, yours," she said, still looking at him.&#xD;
"Cannot you see Christ-standing between God .and&#xD;
man, offering his own bloo where justice demands ours,&#xD;
and with his perfect righteo sness covering our imperfect&#xD;
obedience ? So 'that God may be just, and yet the justifier&#xD;
of him that believeth in Jesus.' Can you apply any wor s?&#xD;
Can you see that Christ only is 'mighty to. sav&amp;amp;.-Are&#xD;
you willing to trust yourself in his hands ?"&#xD;
Faith dropped her eyes for a minute or two, but the lines&#xD;
of her face were changing.&#xD;
"I know what you mean now," she said slowly. "I&#xD;
couldn't see it before." Then with a little smile she went&#xD;
on-"Yes, Mr. Linden, I am willing. But what must I&#xD;
do ?"&#xD;
"'Only believe-"'he answered. "Do what you say you&#xD;
are willing to do."&#xD;
"But," said Faith, looking at him with a face which&#xD;
certainly spoke her near the 'little child' character which&#xD;
Christians do bear,-" there must be something else. I&#xD;
must not be like what I have been. I want to know vhat&#xD;
I ought to do."&#xD;
"Christ's own words tell you better than I can,-' My&#xD;
sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow&#xD;
me'-Mthat is the description of a Christian on earth. And&#xD;
then it follows-' I give -unto them eternal life, and they&#xD;
&#xD;
shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of&#xD;
my hand."&#xD;
There was silence; and then Faith said,&#xD;
"But how am I to follow him ?"&#xD;
"How did the people do'to whom he said those words&#xD;
when he was on earth ?"&#xD;
"I don't know!"&#xD;
"'They arose, and left all, and followed him.&#xD;
"Well, Mr. Linden ?"-&#xD;
"It is just such a following that we are called to now-..&#xD;
only that it must be in heart and life instead of actual foot-&#xD;
steps. Just so must we rise up from doing our own will&#xD;
and pleasure, fix our eyes upon Christ, and follow him !"&#xD;
"But how are we to know-how am I to know," said&#xD;
Faith, "what Iought to do ?"&#xD;
"Study Christ's summing up of the ten commandments,-&#xD;
does not that cover the whole ground ?  And then-do&#xD;
every little duty as it comes to hand. If we are truly&#xD;
ready to do God's will, he will-send us work,-or if not-&#xD;
They also serve, who only stand and wait."'&#xD;
Faith looked an earnest, wistful, sorrowful look at him.&#xD;
"But then," she said,-" I don't do anything well-how&#xD;
can I know that I am right? You know what you said-&#xD;
of the two roads only one led to the shore. I keep think-&#xD;
ing of that-ever since."&#xD;
"A traveller in the right road," said Mr. Linden, "may&#xD;
walk with very weak 0and unsteady pace,-yet he knows&#xD;
which way his face is set. Which way is yours ?"&#xD;
Faith's face was in her hands. But Mrs. Derrick's step&#xD;
just then sounding at the front door, she sprang away&#xD;
before it could reach the parlour.&#xD;

CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
T HE decision of Mr. Linden on the school question was&#xD;
duly communicated t9 Judge Harrison ; and the time.&#xD;
fixed was Thursday, the jfifth of October. The place&#xD;
chosen, after much care, was the Judge's own house and&#xD;
grounds adjoining, which were spacious enough, and af-&#xD;
forded good opportunity for setting tables and also for&#xD;
spreading them. So all that was fixed; and all Pattaquas-&#xD;
set was a tip-toe; and Mr. Linden submitted to what he&#xD;
could not help, with as good a grace as he might. And&#xD;
September was sliding off into October with the gentlest,&#xD;
sunniest, softliest grace.&#xD;
With much the same sort of grace Faith Derrick walked&#xD;
up and down in her mother's household; from the dairy&#xD;
where she made her butter, to Mr. Linden's room which it&#xD;
was her care to keep in order ; and where she might if she&#xD;
chose amuse herself with Mr. Linden's books. If she did,&#xD;
it was unknown to their owner; he surely found every vol-&#xD;
ume lying where he left it. There was chance enough for&#xD;
Faith, in his long absences from the house; and the books&#xD;
offered temptations. There were a good'many of them,&#xD;
stowed in old-fashioned corner and window cupboards;&#xD;
good editions, in good bindings, and an excellent very&#xD;
choice selection of subjects and authors. There were books&#xD;
in various languages of which Faith could make nothing-&#xD;
but sighs; in her own mother tongue there were varieties of&#xD;
learning and literature "enough to distract her. All how-&#xD;
ever that the owner could know of other hands about his&#xD;
books, was that there was no dust upon them.&#xD;
Perhaps he had a mind, to know more-or that there&#xD;
should be more to be known; for about this time. two re-&#xD;
markable things happened. One was, that Faith found a&#xD;
little French book ensconced among the stockings in her&#xD;
basket,-and the very next morning as Mr. Linden was&#xD;
setting off for school, he stopped at the threshold and&#xD;
inquired-&#xD;
(78)&#xD;
&#xD;
"Miss Faith-whereabouts are you in Prescott ?"&#xD;
That sane colour flushed in Faith's face; it did not rise&#xD;
to her temples this time, but glowed richly in her cheeks.&#xD;
She looked down and up, and down; words seemed con-&#xD;
_t. founded in their utterance.&#xD;
"You do not mean that you have finished it already ?"&#xD;
he said with an excellent look of astonishment.&#xD;
"I have almost,"-said Faith. "Mr. Linden, how could&#xD;
you tell ?-I don't know what makes me do so !" she said&#xD;
putting both hands to her cheeks,-"there's no shaug in&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"I didn't suppose there was," he said smiling, and&#xD;
closed the door.&#xD;
= 'Very oddly, in spite of morning duties, Faith's next&#xD;
move was to go to her basket; pull out that little French book&#xD;
and examine it all over inside and out. Not one word of&#xD;
it could she read, not one sign of it did she know; what&#xD;
was the meaning of its place in her basket?  Faith pon-&#xD;
dered that question probably while her cheeks were coming&#xD;
back to their usual tint; then the book was slipped back&#xD;
again and she hurried away to help her mother with the&#xD;
dishes.&#xD;
do"You needn't come, child," said Mrs. Derrick,-" whatY&#xD;
do you think I'll make of such a handful of things as that ?&#xD;
To be sure Cindy's cleaning up to-day, but I'm pretty&#xD;
smart, yet. Go off and study arithmetic if you want to.&#xD;
Have you got through that yet ?"&#xD;
"Almost through, mother," Faith answered smiling.&#xD;
"Well why don't you go and finish ?" said her mother.&#xD;
"Mayn't I finish these first ?" said Faith, through whose&#xD;
fingers and the towel the, cups and saucers slipped with a&#xD;
dexterity that was, to say the least of it, pretty. "Why&#xD;
Mother, you were not, so keen after arithmietic the other&#xD;
day."&#xD;
"Keen after it !" said Mrs. Derrick,-" la, child, I don't&#xD;
pretend to be keen. But I never could bear to see a thing&#xD;
half done,-I'd rather do it 'twice over."&#xD;
There was something else running in Faith's mind; for&#xD;
after abstractedly setting down one after another several&#xD;
saucers, polished from the hot water and huckaback, she&#xD;

dropped her towel and flung both aims round her mother's&#xD;
neck.'&#xD;
"Mother !.-.-there is one thing I want you to do-I want&#xD;
you to be 6 Christian !"&#xD;
There was persuasion in the soft head th  estled against&#xD;
her, if Faith's words lacked it.&#xD;
To the words her mother gave no ans    r, but she re-&#xD;
turned the caress with interest; wrappin   ith in her&#xD;
arms, and drawing her down to the next chair, as if liter.&#xD;
all she could not stand that..&#xD;
retty child !" she said-and more than onear fell&#xD;
upon Faith's bright hair,-"you're the best child that ever&#xD;
was !-and always were 1"&#xD;
"No, mother," said Faith kissing her.-"But will&#xD;
you ?"&#xD;
"I don't know !" said Mrs. Derrick,-" that's what your&#xD;
father used to say, Faith,-and I used to think I'd like to,&#xD;
to please him,-but somehow I never did."&#xD;
"Never wished it for your own sake, deKmother ?"&#xD;
"Yes-sometimes-when I saw him die-" said Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick. "Hush child-don't say another word to me&#xD;
now, for I can't bear it." And giving Faith an embrace&#xD;
which took off all thought of roughness from her words,&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick rose up and went about her dishes again.&#xD;
And Faith tried to do as much; but the dropping tears&#xD;
were too fast for her towel; her hand sought in vain to&#xD;
forbid their coming; she laid down her work and went&#xD;
away.&#xD;
Truth however is always at one with itself, and so is right&#xD;
feeling, and so is duty. Faith as well as her mother had&#xD;
plenty of business on hand that morning; and it was not&#xD;
long before she was as hard at work in the kitchen as if&#xD;
there were no other interests in the world. There was&#xD;
bread to make. That was done.: There was an elaborate&#xD;
chicken pie to concoct for dinner, which Faith would not&#xD;
leave to her mother to-day. There was a certain kind of&#xD;
muffins which Mrs. Derrick suggested Mr. Linden would be&#xD;
apt to like, and which they had never had since he was in&#xD;
Pattaquasset. To hear was to obey, and Faith compounded&#xD;
the muffins. Then fresh yeast must be made, and Faith&#xD;
always did that. Let it not be thought that Mks. Derrick&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
was idle while thus indicating floury fields of exertion to&#xD;
her daughter. Very far from it. There wasallth  house&#xD;
and all the rest of the dinner to see to; besides'Cindy; who&#xD;
was one woman's work. The butcher was to be met, and&#xD;
farm questions settled with the farmer; and Mrs. Derrick&#xD;
was still deep in vegetables when Faith quitted the kitchen.&#xD;
How much time she had left for study before dinner it&#xD;
doesn't appear.&#xD;
After dinner, this day, there was small study chance-or&#xD;
at least small chance to get books; for it was Wednesd&#xD;
and Wednesday was in every Pattaquasset sch o -'alf&#xD;
holiday. Indeed that arrangement of thing    ex nded&#xD;
beyond the schools; and on this particular Wednesday, Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick.devoted the holiday time to a far-off neighbour-.&#xD;
declaring that she "felt like a good long walk." And after&#xD;
her departure the dreaminess of a warm fall afternoon set-&#xD;
tied down upon the house and its inhabitants. Faith sat&#xD;
sewing by the parlour window, or reading-stealthily; for&#xD;
Mr. Linden with his book sat in the porch not three feet&#xD;
from her; but it is not too much to say that neither made&#xD;
great progress. Who could read or work-or think-vigi--&#xD;
lantly, in that hazy sunshine ?-the very bees took a siesta&#xD;
on the wing, and rocked to and fro in the soft air.&#xD;
About the middle of the afternoon a small white-headed&#xD;
boy was seen revolving down the main street of Pattaquas-&#xD;
set. I say revolving-for the slight suggestion of a small&#xD;
stone in the road-or a spot of particular dustiness--was&#xD;
enough to make the boy break the monotony ofr his walk&#xD;
with a somerset ; by which style of progress he at last ar-&#xD;
rived at Mrs. Derrick's door, entered the gate and came up&#xD;
the steps. There he paused and gazed at Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"What is your name ?" inquired that gentleman, with&#xD;
the benevolent ides of setting the boy's thoughts in motion&#xD;
in a straight line.&#xD;
"Charles twelf'" replied the boy promptly.&#xD;
"Charles twelfth 1" said Mr. Linden. "Are there eleven&#xD;
tnore of you ?"&#xD;
The boy put his finger in his mouth but brought forth no&#xD;
answer.&#xD;
"Miss Fait "aid Mr. Linden, "are you the planet&#xD;
which has attract this small star out of its usual orbit ?"&#xD;

Faith came to the door.&#xD;
"Who are you, little fellow ?" said she, eyeing the dusty&#xD;
white head.&#xD;
"Who ly you ?" said the boy.'&#xD;
"The c ntre of your solar system at present," said Mr.&#xD;
Linden. "Is that the way satellites generally ask ques-&#xD;
tions ?"&#xD;
" What a queer man !" said the boy looking at Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den.&#xD;
" What a queer boy-" said that gentleman gravely.&#xD;
"iWhat do you want ? ' aid Faith, biting her lips and&#xD;
laughing at both of them.&#xD;
The boy gazed at hpr, but he also gazed at the scraper !-..&#xD;
and the attraction of that was irresistible. Down went his&#xD;
white head, and over went his dusty feet, and then Charles&#xD;
twelfth was himself again.&#xD;
"My ma's kep' your ma to supper," he said. "And she&#xD;
says you may come too, if you want ter-and bring him.&#xD;
We've got lots o' pies." And stimulated by this recollec-&#xD;
tion, the boy turned without delay and began his revolu-&#xD;
tions homeward. Faith ran down the two or three porch&#xD;
steps and laid hold of the little invader.&#xD;
"Here! You Charles twelfth !-who are you, and where&#xD;
does your ma' live?"&#xD;
"She lives down to our house."&#xD;
"Where's that ?"&#xD;
"Down the woody road-" said the boy,.-"nekt after&#xD;
you come to Capting Samp's' blackberry field. There's&#xD;
sunflowers in front."&#xD;
"Then you are Mrs. Seacomb's boy ?  Very well," said&#xD;
Faith, letting him go. "Mr. Linden, there is an invitation&#xD;
for you."&#xD;
"Is there a carriage road into Sweden ? or do we walk ?"&#xD;
he replied&#xD;
"Sweden ?"-said Faith, - "it is in the woods, two&#xD;
or three miles from here. A woman lives there -the&#xD;
widow of a man that used to sail with my father. My&#xD;
father was captain of a ship, Mr. Linden. Mr. Seacomb&#xD;
was one of his mates, and very fond of him; and we go to&#xD;
see Mrs. Seacomb once in a while, I don't think, perhaps,&#xD;
you would like it. It's a pretty ride."&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
That is a kind of ride I do like."&#xD;
&#xD;
83&#xD;
&#xD;
"But I don't know whether you would like it all. If&#xD;
you say so, I will have up the wagon."&#xD;
"Thank you-that I should not like.  I prefer to have&#xD;
it up myself, Miss Faith-if you will have up your bonnet."&#xD;
Faith's face gave way at that, and the bonnet and the&#xD;
wagon were up accordingly.&#xD;
The way led first down the high road, bordered with gardens&#xD;
and farms and the houses of the village-if village it were&#xD;
called, where the neighbours looked at each other's distant&#xD;
windows across wide tracts of meadow, orchards and grain&#xD;
fields. The road was reasonably dusty, in the warm&#xD;
droughts of September; nevertheless the hedgerows that&#xD;
grew thick in many places shewed gay tufts of autumn&#xD;
flowering; and the mellow light lay on every wayside object&#xD;
and sober distance like the reflection from a butterfly's&#xD;
wing. Except the light, all changed when they got into the&#xD;
woody road.&#xD;
It was woody indeed !-except where it was grassy; and&#xD;
woods and grass played hide and seek with each other.&#xD;
The grass-grown road, its thicker grass borders-where&#xD;
bright fall flowers raised their proud little heads; the old&#xD;
fence, broken down in places, where bushes burst through&#xD;
and half filled the gap; bright hips on the wild rosebushes,&#xD;
tufts of yellow fern leaves, brilliant handfuls of red and&#xD;
yellow which here a maple and there a pepperidge held out&#xD;
over the road ; the bushy, bosquey, look which the uncut&#xD;
undergrowth gave the wood on either hand ; the gleams of&#xD;
soft green light, the bands of shadow, the deeper thickets&#xD;
where the eye looked twice and came back unsatisfied,-.&#xD;
over all the blue sky, with forest leaves for a border. Such&#xD;
was the woody road that afternoon. Flocks of little birds&#xD;
of passage flitted and twittered about their night's lodging,&#xD;
or came down to feast on wintergreen or cedar berries; and&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick's old horse walked softly on, as if he knew&#xD;
no one was in a hurry.&#xD;
"'With what a glory comes and goes the year'!" Mr.&#xD;
Linden said.&#xD;
"And stays all the while, don't it ?" -said Faith rather&#xD;
timidly and after an instant's hesitation.&#xD;
"Yes, in a sort--.though to my fancy the other seasons&#xD;

&#xD;
have rather beauty and splendour, while autumn keeps the&#xD;
glory for itself."&#xD;
"I think it is glorious all the year round," said Faith;.&#xD;
"though to be sure," she added with a sudden check, "per-&#xD;
haps I don't use the word right."&#xD;
"Yes, it is glorious, - but I think 'glorious' and&#xD;
'glory' have drifted a little apart upon the tide of human&#xD;
speech. Glory, always seems to my mind a warm, glowing,&#xD;
effulgent thing,-but ice-peaks may be glorious. The old&#xD;
painters encircled the hpads of their saints with a 'glory '&#xD;
and you could not imagine that a cold light."&#xD;
Faith listened, with the eyes of one first seeing into the&#xD;
world of wonder and beauty hidden from common vision.&#xD;
She did not answer, till her thoughts came back to the&#xD;
road they were travelling, and catching her breath a little&#xD;
she said,&#xD;
"This isn't a cold light."&#xD;
"No, truly. And just.so far as the saints on earth walk&#xD;
in a cold light, so far, I think, their light is less glorious."&#xD;
"I don't see how they can,"-said Faith timidly.&#xD;
"They do-sometimes,-standing aloof like those ice-&#xD;
peaks. You can see the white garments, but no glory&#xD;
transfigures them. Such a face as Stephen's, Miss Faith,&#xD;
is worth a journey to see."&#xD;
Faith thought so; wondered how many such faces he&#xD;
had seen. Her meditations plunged her too deep for&#xD;
words.&#xD;
"What are you musing about ?-if I may ask," Mr&#xD;
Linden. said presently.&#xD;
She coloured but answered, "I was thinking what one&#xD;
must be, to have a face like Stephen's."&#xD;
"That is the promise, you know-' from. glory to glory.'&#xD;
'From grace to glory' must come first. 'What one must&#xD;
be'-yes, that is it. But it is good to measure the promises&#xD;
now and then."&#xD;
Faith laid that last remark up in her heart, enshrining&#xD;
it in gold, as it were. But she said nothing.&#xD;
"How is it with you ?" he said turning his eyes full upon&#xD;
her,-L"you have not told me lately. Are the clouds all&#xD;
gone ?" ,&#xD;
Her look met his, wistful, and simple as her answer.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I see the light through."-&#xD;
"'Unto the perfect-day'!" Mr. Linden said; his smile-&#xD;
slight as it was-bringing, a sort  illumination with it.&#xD;
4 After a few minutes he t rned to er again.&#xD;
"Miss Faith, one w o  Christ has called into his army&#xD;
should wear his uniform.&#xD;
"What, sir ?"-.she sai  e colour starting readily.&#xD;
"With the private v   of allegiance, there should be&#xD;
also a public profession."&#xD;
"Yes,"'-she said, "LI suppose so..---I am willing-I am&#xD;
ready."&#xD;
Timid, modest, even shrinking as she was, more in view&#xD;
of the subject than of her adviser, her face was as frank as&#xD;
the day. His hand quitted the reins a moment taking&#xD;
hers and giving it a sort of 'right-hand-of-fellowship'&#xD;
clasp, glad and warm and earnest, as was his look.&#xD;
"I am not going to ask you any more questions," he&#xD;
said,-"you will tell eme if there are any you wish an-&#xD;
Sswered."&#xD;
Her " Thank you" was a little breathless.&#xD;
For a while the old horse jogged on in his easy way,&#xD;
through the woods and the fall flowers and the sunny glow;&#xD;
and the eyes of the two travellers seemed to be busy there-&#xD;
with. Then Faith said with a little timid touch upon her&#xD;
voice,&#xD;
"Mr. Linden-I suppose it was y u that put a little&#xD;
green book in my basket last night ?"&#xD;
S"Jumping at conclusions again !" he said. "What sort&#xD;
Sof a little green book was it ?"&#xD;
"I don't'kow ! I suppose you can tell me."&#xD;
[i"Do'you suppose I will ?"&#xD;
S"Why noti What did you expect me to do with it,&#xD;
Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
S"Find out what sort of a book it is."&#xD;
S"You know I can't~ read a word of it," said Faith&#xD;
rather low,&#xD;
S"Look at that old house," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
They were passing a cleared field or two, one of which&#xD;
seemed yet under cultivation and shewed corn stalks and&#xD;
pumpkin vines, but the other was in that poverty-stricken&#xD;
state described by the proverb as'I once had.' The house&#xD;

was a mere skeleton. Clapboards, indeed, there were still,&#xD;
and shingles ; but doors and windows had long since been&#xD;
removed-by man or Time,-and through the open spaces&#xD;
you could see here a cupboard door, and there a stairway,&#xD;
and there a bit of partition wall with its faded high-coloured&#xD;
paper. No remnant of furniture-no rag of old clothes or&#xD;
calico ; but in the dooryard a few garden flowers still strug-&#xD;
gled to keep their place, among daisies, thistles and bur-&#xD;
docks.  The little field was bordered with woodland, and&#xD;
human voice or face there was none. The sunbeams which&#xD;
shone so bright on the tinted trees seemed powerless here;&#xD;
the single warm ray that shot through one of the empty&#xD;
window frames fell mournfully on the cold hearthstone.&#xD;
"Yes," said Faith.-" I don't know who ever lived there.&#xD;
It has stood so a good while."&#xD;
The road grew more solitary still after that, passing on&#xD;
where the trees came close upon either hand, and arched&#xD;
their branches overhead, casting a deep and lonely shadow,&#xD;
.The flowers dwindled, the briars and rank grass increased.&#xD;
"'  "As to 'Le Philosophe sous les toits,' Miss Faith," said&#xD;
Mr. Linden, touching the horse with his whip, "there are&#xD;
just two things to be said. In the first place-with the&#xD;
help of another book or two which are not beyond reach--&#xD;
you may make his acquaintance quite comfortably by your-&#xD;
self., In the second-no, I shall not tell you the second,--&#xD;
that you may find out by yourself too. There is Charles&#xD;
twelfth-and all his subjects one might judge."&#xD;
For on Captain Samp's blackberry hill-albeit black-&#xD;
berries were bygone things-a troop, a flock of children&#xD;
were scattered up and down, picking flower poden rod&#xD;
and asters and 'moonshine,' filled the little  teo-clean&#xD;
hands, and briars and wild roses combed the 'unkempt'&#xD;
hair somewhat roughly. Whiteheaded youngsters all of&#xD;
them, looking (but for small patterns of blue calico and&#xD;
nankeen) not unlike a drove of little pigs. .Next, appeared&#xD;
an imposing array, of sunflowers, below which prince's&#xD;
feather waved in crimson splendour, and the little brown&#xD;
capital of 'Sweden' stood revealed. Or I should say, par-.&#xD;
tially; for the house stood in the deepest corner of the&#xD;
shade, just where the road took a sharp turn towards the&#xD;
sunlight.; and Mr. inden alighted and tied his horse to&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.                   8T&#xD;
a tree, with little fear that anything woigd happen to him&#xD;
unless the darkness put him to sleep.&#xD;
" Charles twelfth has the best of it just now,1YIiss Faith"&#xD;
he said as he opened the gate for her. "Why do people&#xD;
build houses where they cannot see the sun !"&#xD;
They were met at the door by Mrs. Seacomb.&#xD;
"Do tell !" she said-" why if this aint you ! But what&#xD;
made you come so late ? and how slow your horse did come&#xD;
when he was' about it. I've been watchin' you this age.&#xD;
Well Faith-I declare-you're as pretty as a posie!  And&#xD;
this is the. teacher I s'pose-Guess likelyyou haint been down&#xD;
this way afore, sir,-it's a good ways, and the road's lone-&#xD;
some, but it's a fine place when you're here-so retired and&#xD;
shady."&#xD;
All Mr. Linden's command of countenance only enabled&#xD;
him to answer the last remark 'with a strong affirmative.&#xD;
"Yes sir," said Mrs. Seacomb, "it is; and there's a&#xD;
good many of the trees is evergreens, so the shade never&#xD;
goes off. I do s'pose, if I could keep the children more to&#xD;
home they wouldn't get nigh so brown as they do; but if&#xD;
I was to run out in the lot and whip 'em home every half&#xD;
hour they'd be back again afore I could count one. Now&#xD;
Genevievy-she does stay round under the trees a good&#xD;
deal, but then she's fond of flowers. She'll be real glad to&#xD;
see you Faith, and so'll your mother"-and Mrs. Seacomb&#xD;
at last got her visiters into the parlour.&#xD;
The parlour was as brown as the rest of the house. The&#xD;
visiters had not time to remark more particularly; for their&#xD;
attention wa claimed by a tall girl of about Faith's age,&#xD;
with a loo built, strong jointed frame, in as marked&#xD;
contrast as possible to the (lean outline and soft angles of&#xD;
the other. She shook hands very cordially with Faith, but&#xD;
made a reverence to the 'teacher.'&#xD;
"Won't you take a chair, sir," she said, setting one for&#xD;
the gentleman. "Aint-it an age since we've looked at you,&#xD;
Faith! Your mother's been here a long spell. Ma' was&#xD;
proud to see her come it. You haint been here, seems to&#xD;
me, ever before 1"&#xD;
"How do you do, Genevieve ?"&#xD;
"I'm respectable well. Can't do nothin' uncommon, you&#xD;
know, down in this 'eclusion., I guess it's as good to see&#xD;

company as blackberries. We don't get it though.-I hope&#xD;
you don't mind a lonely sitiwation, sir?" The last words&#xD;
with deep gravity and a bending head.&#xD;
"It agrees well with a contemplative mind," replied the&#xD;
gentleman, resolving that the young lady should not talk&#xD;
'high english' alone.&#xD;
"It does !" said Genevieve admiringly, taking him all&#xD;
in with her eyes. "There is always something to look at&#xD;
to make you contemplate.--Then you don't think it an&#xD;
objection, sir, to4ive so far away from society as this ?"&#xD;
"I have lived further away from society than this," said&#xD;
Mr. Linden. "I have seen regions of country, Miss Sea-&#xD;
comb, where you could not even hear of anybody but your.&#xD;
self."&#xD;
"I declare !--And war'u't it awful still, sir ?"&#xD;
" It was beautiful, still," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"1 reckon it was !"           .1&#xD;
At this juncture Charles twelfth made his appearance,&#xD;
and Mr. Linden at once turned to him-&#xD;
"Well sir-how are the Turks ?"&#xD;
To which Charles twelfth, being taken much by surprise,&#xD;
replied,&#xD;
"They're pretty well."&#xD;
"Genevievy," said her mother, "if you'll make your-&#xD;
self agreeable, I'll go hurry tea afore the rest of the chil-&#xD;
dren comes. They will all come to table, and there's so&#xD;
many." And Mrs. Derrick as in duty bound, followed her&#xD;
to help.&#xD;
"I'll go tell 'em1" said Charles twelfth as Mrs. Seacomb&#xD;
went out.                               .&#xD;
"No you will not"-said Mr. Linden,-"you will not&#xD;
go out of the house again till I give you leave. Why&#xD;
don't you come to Sunday school and learn to behave&#xD;
yourself ?"&#xD;
" What else ?"-said Charles twelfth.&#xD;
"What else 1" said Mr. Linden,-" that will take you&#xD;
some time. Afterwards you will learn all the lessons your&#xD;
teacher gives you."&#xD;
"Who'll he be ?" said Charles twelfth coming a little&#xD;
nearer. "You ?"..      ,&#xD;
"No indeed," said Mr. Linden, "I have quite enough&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL..&#xD;
&#xD;
88&#xD;
&#xD;
to do now. I dare say this lady will take you into her&#xD;
class-if you ask her politely."&#xD;
It was worth while to see Faith's face now, for the little&#xD;
stir and the flush and the sweet gravity that was in it.&#xD;
Not so much as a glance went to Mr. Linden, but leaning&#xD;
forward towards the young enemy of Peter the Great, she&#xD;
said in her sweet tones,&#xD;
"Will you come ?"&#xD;
Charles twelfth looked up at her rather earnestly, though&#xD;
his finger was in his mouth the while ; and then having&#xD;
ended his scrutiny gave a grave little nod of assent, and&#xD;
moved round and stood at her side.&#xD;
"Look here," said Faith,--" don't you want to shew me&#xD;
how the sunflowers grow in your garden ?"&#xD;
"They bain't mine-" said Charles twelfth.-" I'll shew&#xD;
you my house--if he'll let me go."&#xD;
That difficulty being got over, Charles twelfth trotted out&#xD;
of the front door, and on through the long grass, to a re-&#xD;
markable edifice of clam shells, broken earthenware, moss&#xD;
and corn cobs, which was situated close by the- fence.&#xD;
Faith commented and asked questions, till she had made&#xD;
herself slightly familiar to the young woodsman's mind ;&#xD;
and then it was agreed that he should come Sunday morn-&#xD;
ing bright and early to Mrs. Derrick's and he and Faith&#xD;
would go to Sunday school together. By the time this&#xD;
arrangement was thoroughly entered into, the summons&#xD;
came to tea.&#xD;
"Now do just set down and make yourselves at home,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Seacomb, "and eat as if you were 'home too.&#xD;
Faith," she added in a good sized whisper-" I did like to&#xD;
forgot all about it !--and your mother could have telled&#xD;
me, too, but you'll do just as well,-does he always take&#xD;
cold pork and potatoes toihis supper ?"&#xD;
Faith's eyes involuntarily opened ; then as the meaning&#xD;
of this appeal broke upon her she answered with a very&#xD;
decided "No, ma'am."&#xD;
"'Cause we've got some handy," Mrs. Seacomb said.&#xD;
"Now Mr. Simpson, he staid with us a spell, and he&#xD;
couldn't do without it-if I had pound cake and plum cake'&#xD;
and mince pie for supper, it made no differ-and if there&#xD;
warn't but one cold potato in the house it made none&#xD;

either ; he wanted that just the same. To be sure he was&#xD;
easy suited. And I didn't know but all school teachers&#xD;
was the same way. I never had much experience of 'em.&#xD;
Genevievy.-just lock the front door and then the children&#xD;
can't get in,-the back door is locked. I do take to peace&#xD;
and quiet !"&#xD;
"Is Charles twelfth much like his brothers and sisters,&#xD;
ma'am ?" said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"Well no-"said Mrs. Seacomb, dealing out blackberry&#xD;
jam,-" he always was an uncommon child. The rest's all&#xD;
real sponsible, but there's none of 'em alike but Americus&#xD;
Vespucus.-It's fresh, Faith -the children picked the&#xD;
blackberries in Captain Samp's lot.-.-Charles twelfth does&#xD;
act sometimes as if he was helped. I thought he took a&#xD;
turn awhile ago, to behave like the rest-but he's reacted."&#xD;
And having emptied the dish of jam Mrs. Seacomb began&#xD;
upon the cheese.&#xD;
"Which is Americus ?" said Faith. "Is he older or&#xD;
younger than Charles twelfth Mrs. Seacomb ?"&#xD;
"1Well he's older," said Mrs. Seacomb ;-"that's him,"&#xD;
she added, as a loud rattling of the back door was followed&#xD;
in an incredibly short space of time by a similar rattling at&#xD;
the front, after which came the clatter of various sticks&#xD;
and clods at the window.&#xD;
"I guess you won't care about seeing' him nearer," said&#xD;
Mrs. Seacomb, stirring her tea composedly. "Only don't&#xD;
nobody open the door-I- do love peace and quiet. They&#xD;
won't break the window, 'cause they know they'd catch it&#xD;
ifthey did."&#xD;
"1Children is a plague, I do s'pose,"remarked Genevieve.&#xD;
"Is your tea agreeable, sir ?"&#xD;
Which question Mr. Linden waived by asking another,&#xD;
and the meal proceeded with a peace and quietness which&#xD;
suited no, ideas but Mrs. Seacomb's. At last tea was&#xD;
over; the ladies put on their bonnets again, and the old&#xD;
horse being roused from his meditations, the party set for-&#xD;
ward on their pleasant way home.&#xD;
Doubly pleasant now, for the sun was just setting; the&#xD;
air was fresher, and the glow of the sunset colours put a&#xD;
new 'glory' upon all the colours of earth. And light and&#xD;
shadow made witching work of the woody road as long as&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
the glow lasted. Then the colours faded, the shadows&#xD;
spread; grey gathered where orange and brown had been;&#xD;
that glory was gone; and then it began to be shewn, little&#xD;
by little, as the blue also changed for grey, that there is&#xD;
"another glory of the stars." And then presently, above&#xD;
the trees that, shaded Mrs. Seacomb's retreat, the moon&#xD;
rose full and bright and laid her strips of silver under the&#xD;
horse's feet.&#xD;
Were they all exhausted with their afternoon's work? or&#xD;
was this shifting scene of colour and glory enough to busy&#xD;
their minds? Mr. Linden found his way along the road&#xD;
silently, and the two ladies behind him seemed each to be&#xD;
wrapped in her own thoughts; and moonlight and star-&#xD;
light favoured that, and so on they jogged between the&#xD;
shadowy walls of trees tipped and shimmering with light,&#xD;
and over those strips of silver on the road. Out of the&#xD;
woods at last, on the broad, full-lit highway; past one&#xD;
farm and house after another, lights twinkling at them&#xD;
from the windows ; and then their own door with its moon-&#xD;
lit porch.&#xD;
The old horse would stand, no fear; the reins were&#xD;
thrown over his back, and the three went in together. As&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick passed on first and the others were left be-&#xD;
hind in the doorway, Faith turfed and held out her&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
"Thank you, Mr. Linden !"-she said softly.&#xD;
le took the hand, and inquired gravely, "whether she&#xD;
was taking leave of him for the rest of his natural life ?"&#xD;
Faith's mood had probably not been precisely a merry&#xD;
one when she began; but her low laugh rung through the&#xD;
nall at that, and she ran in.&#xD;

of yellow grain concealed by those yellow clapboards, to&#xD;
the- yellow stubble-fields whence they had come; so that&#xD;
on the whole Mr. Simlins took rather a glowing view of&#xD;
things, considering that-it was not yet sunrise. The cloud.&#xD;
less October sky above his head suggested only that it&#xD;
would be a good day for digging potatoes,-the white frost&#xD;
upon the ground made Mr. Simlins 'guess it was about time&#xD;
to be lookin' after chestnuts.' The twitter of the robins&#xD;
brought to mind the cherries they had stolen,--the exquisite&#xD;
careering of a hawk in the high blue ether, spoke moun-&#xD;
fully of a slaughtered chicken: the rising stir of the morning&#xD;
wind said plainly as a wind could (in its elegant language)&#xD;
that 'if it was goin' to blow at that rate, it would be plaguey&#xD;
rough goin' after round clams.' With which reflection, Mr.&#xD;
Simlins turned about and went in to his early breakfast of&#xD;
pork- and potatoes,-only, as he was not a 'teacher,' they&#xD;
were hot and not cold.&#xD;
Thus pleasantly engaged-discussing his breakfast,-Mr,&#xD;
Simlins was informed by one of his 'help,' that a boy wanted&#xD;
to see him. Which was no uncommon occurrence, for all&#xD;
the boys about Pattaquasset liked Mr. Simlins.&#xD;
"just as lieves see him as not," said Mr. Simlins-"if he&#xD;
don't want my breakfast. Come in, there, you1"-&#xD;
And Dromy Tuck presented himself.&#xD;
"'Early bird catches the worm,'" said Mr. Simlima&#xD;
"Don't want my breakfast, Dromy, do you ?"&#xD;
"Had mine afore I started," replied Dromy. "But the&#xD;
things' here.  Mr. Linden says as how we wants your&#xD;
nuts off o' them trees over to Neanticut-and hie says if&#xD;
&#xD;
you don't want 'em, why it'll fit, he says. And if you do,&#xD;
why you may keep 'em-that's all."&#xD;
"What's Mr. Linden goin' to do with the nuts, s'pos'n&#xD;
he gets 'em ?"&#xD;
"He aint agoin' to get 'em," said Dromy -"it's us&#xD;
us and him. You see we did somethin' to please him, and&#xD;
so now he said as how he'd like to do somethin' to please&#xD;
us, if he only knowed what it was. And there wasn't a boy&#xD;
of the hull on 'em as didn't say he'd rather go after nuts&#xD;
B than any other livin' thing whatsomedever."&#xD;
"And now I s'pose you're asking' for them particular&#xD;
nuts to please me. It's a round game we're on," said Mr.&#xD;
Simlins. "How're you goin' to get to Neanticut ? same&#xD;
way Jack went up his bean ?-won't pay."&#xD;
He didn't tell-"said Dromy. " He don't say every-&#xD;
thing to-oncet, commonly."&#xD;
"When 'you goin'?"&#xD;
"Don' know, sir. Mr. Linden said as how we'd better&#xD;
go afore the nuts did. And Saturday aint fur off."&#xD;
Saturday-well ! You tell Mr. Linden, if he'll send&#xD;
Reuben Taylor here Saturday morning, he can take the big&#xD;
wagon; it'll hold the hull on ye, and I guessJ'll do with-&#xD;
out the team ; and if he wants ,to go into the old house&#xD;
and make a fire in case you want something to eat afore&#xD;
you get home, there's not a soul in it and no wood nother-..&#xD;
but you can pick -it up; and I'll give Reuben the key.&#xD;
Now don't you splice the two ends o' that together by the&#xD;
way. "&#xD;
Great was the stir in a certain stratum of Pattaquasset&#xD;
that day ! Many and startling were the demands for pies&#xD;
cheese, and gingerbread, to be answered on the ensuing&#xD;
Saturday. Those good housewives who had no boys at&#xD;
school or elsewhere, thought it must be 'real good fun' to&#xD;
help them get ready for such a frolic,.-those who had&#xD;
boys-...wished they had none! As to the rest, the disturb-&#xD;
ance spread a little (as. disturbances are wont) from its&#xD;
proper sphere of action. Two boys even invaded Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick's peaceful dwelling, and 'called down Faith from&#xD;
Conquering Peru. These were Reuben Taylor and Joe&#xD;
Deacon; for Joe with a slight variation of the popular&#xD;
adage, considered that 'once a scholar, always a scholar.'&#xD;

&#xD;
Reuben seemed inclined on his part to leave the present&#xD;
business in Joe's hands,but a sharp nudge from that young&#xD;
gentleman's elbow admonished him not only to speak but&#xD;
to speak quickly. Reuben modestly preferred his modest&#xD;
request, guiltless of any but the most innocent arrangement&#xD;
of his words.&#xD;
"We boys are a'll going over to Neanticut nutting, next&#xD;
Saturday, Miss Faith," he said, "and we thought as Mr.&#xD;
Linden was going, maybe you'd like to go too-and we'd&#xD;
all enjoy it a great deal more."&#xD;
"There aint room in the wagon," put in Joe-"but I&#xD;
s'pose you kin fix that."&#xD;
"Joe !" said Reuben flushing up. "There's plenty of&#xD;
room, Miss Faith-there isn't one of us that wouldn't find&#xD;
it, somehow. I could walk easy enough, I know that."&#xD;
Faith flushed up'too on her part a little, unconsciously;&#xD;
and asked who else was going.&#xD;
"Sam aint "-said Joe, as if that was all he -cared&#xD;
about.&#xD;
"Only the boys, Miss Faith," said Reuben with another&#xD;
glance at his comrade. "But it's a pretty place over there,&#xD;
-and so's the ride. There's room for Mrs. Derrick too if&#xD;
she'd like it," Reuben added,-" I suppose we shall be gone&#xD;
all day."&#xD;
"It's very good of you to come and ask me, both of you,"&#xD;
said Faith, evidently in perplexity ;-"and I should like to&#xD;
go dearly if I can, Reuben-but I am afraid I can't, I am'&#xD;
glad if the wagon's big enough to hold you all without me.&#xD;
You'll have a great time."&#xD;
"You may say that !" said Joe-while Reuben looked&#xD;
down, disappointed.&#xD;
"We didn't know whether you would," he said-"but Mr.&#xD;
Linden said you wouldn't be displeased at our asking. We&#xD;
asked him first, Miss Faith-or we shouldn't have made so&#xD;
free. And you shall have some of the nuts, anyway !"&#xD;
A little cheered with which view of the subject, Reuben&#xD;
made his bow, and Joe Deacon whistled after him out of&#xD;
the gate.&#xD;
Faith looked after them, disappointed too. There was a&#xD;
grave set of the lines of her mouth, and it was with rather&#xD;
a thoughtful face that she looked down the road for ami-&#xD;
&#xD;
ute. Then remembering the volume of Prescott in her hand,&#xD;
which her finger still kept open, she went up stairs again and&#xD;
set herself down to finish her treasure.  Faith's reading-&#xD;
place, it must be known, was no other than a deep window-&#xD;
3 seat in Mr. Linden's room. That was a large, old-fashioned&#xD;
room, as has been said, with brown wainscottings and corner&#xD;
and window cupboards; and having on two sides a pleasant&#xD;
exposure, the light generally made it a winsome place to&#xD;
look at. Now, in this October weather, it came in mellow&#xD;
and golden from a softened sun and changing foliage; the&#xD;
brown wood and white walls and dark old furniture and&#xD;
rich bindings of books, all mingled in the sunlight to make&#xD;
a rich sunny picture.&#xD;
There were pictures outside too and pleasant ones. Film&#xD;
the south window, straht down the'street, the houses and&#xD;
4 trees and the brown spire of the Methodist church stretched&#xD;
away-roofs and gable ends and the enormous tufty heads&#xD;
of the elm trees that half hung over them. At the back&#xD;
of these houses, the eye went uninterruptedly over meadows&#xD;
and fields to the belt of woods which skirted at a little dis-&#xD;
tance the line of the shore from the Lighthouse to Barley&#xD;
Point-here and there a break through which a schooner&#xD;
might be seen standing up or down the Sound; elsewhere&#xD;
only its topsails might be discerned above the woods. The&#xD;
western window took in the break where Barley Point lay;&#xD;
and further on in the southwest a distant glimpse of the&#xD;
Sound, with the little brown line of Monongatesak Point.&#xD;
The lane leading to the shore ran off due west, with houses,&#xD;
gardens, orchards, bordering it and spotting the country&#xD;
generally. A fair country-level and rich-all the range&#xD;
west and northwest was uninterrupted smooth fields.; the&#xD;
eye had full sweep to the wide horizon; the dotting of trees,&#xD;
barns, and houses, only enriched it, giving the sweet air of&#xD;
peaceful and happy occupation.&#xD;
Faith's place was the deep low sill, or seat, of that west-&#xD;
ern window. There often Faith's book rested, while on the&#xD;
floor before it the reader sat. This time the book was near&#xD;
finished, and a few more leaves- turned over changed the&#xD;
'near' into 'quite'. Faith stood then considering the books.&#xD;
The name of Prescott on another volume had tempted her,&#xD;
for she had taken it down and .considered the title page ;&#xD;

96                 SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
before settling to it, Faith laid her hand on one of another&#xD;
set not yet much examined; a set of particular outside&#xD;
beauty. But what was the inside ?  For Faith stood by&#xD;
the cupboard door, not looking here and there, but leaf by&#xD;
leaf walking into the middle of the book. Faith rested the&#xD;
volume on the shelf and turned over more leaves; and at&#xD;
last dropped down by her window seat, laid the book there,&#xD;
put her cheek on her hand as usual, a cheek already flushed,&#xD;
and lost herself in the very beams of the afternoon sun.&#xD;
It might have been a dream, it might have been a vision&#xD;
(only that vision it was not)-it might have been reality;&#xD;
wrapped up in her book, what should Faith know? Yet&#xD;
when some crisis was turned over with the leaf; and the real&#xD;
world began to supplant the unreal, Faith started up and&#xD;
looked round. Had she heard a step? a rustling of paper&#xD;
on the table ? The door was firmly shut, the shadowy cor-&#xD;
ner near by had lost the sunbeams, but was else unchanged;&#xD;
the table looked just as before-unless-'Had there been a&#xD;
letter lying there when she came in ?.-Faith never could tell.&#xD;
The door opened now, however, and Mrs. Derrick en-&#xD;
tered-peering in somewhat anxiously.&#xD;
"Why here you are, pretty child 1" she said, " I began to,&#xD;
think you were lost ! Mrs. Somers has been here, and so's&#xD;
Miss Harrison, and they wanted to see you ever so much.&#xD;
I don't think that's a good cheese we cut last night, Faith,-&#xD;
I guess I'll cut another."&#xD;
Faith wag an image of innocent guilt; and without&#xD;
daring to ask if it was tea-time, she ran down stairs. Her&#xD;
mother followed and stood by, not with any thought of&#xD;
overseeing but for the pleasure thereof.&#xD;
"Well child," she said, "are you learning all the world&#xD;
up ? What's in the oven now?"-&#xD;
"Don't you think that is good ?"- -&#xD;
The question had reference to the freshly cut cheese, of&#xD;
which Faith presented her mother with 'a smallemorsel.&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick tasted-critically, but the first topic was the&#xD;
most interesting.&#xD;
" What's made your cheeks burn ?" she said laying her&#xD;
hand softly against the rose-colour. " If you're going to&#xD;
study yourself into a fever, Faith, i'm not going to stand&#xD;
by and see it."&#xD;
&#xD;
*t&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.                   97&#xD;
"No fear, mother. I forgot myself. Is Mr. Linden come&#xD;
in ?"&#xD;
" He must .be-he always is by this time. Miss Harrison&#xD;
says the Doctor's got back, Faith."&#xD;
Faith took up her cheese and walked in with it. The&#xD;
tea-table stood alone. But the tea hour being come, and&#xD;
Mr. Linden known to be surely there within five minutes&#xD;
of the tea hour, the te, was made-and not a minute too&#xD;
soon.&#xD;
Faith was not on this occasion talkative, nor anybody&#xD;
else. The meal proceeded rather silently. Spoons spoke&#xD;
in low tones, knives made themselves busy; and Cindy put&#xD;
her head in at the door and withdrew it with the mental&#xD;
ejaculation,&#xD;
"My ! if they baint settin' there yet !"&#xD;
At this point Mr. Linden spoke. "And so, Miss Faith,'&#xD;
you have no fancy for nuts to crack ?"&#xD;
Faith flushed a little and hesitated.&#xD;
"I didn't say so, Mr. Linden."&#xD;
"Have you any dislike to Neanticut ?"&#xD;
"Not the least," she said laughing.&#xD;
"I dare not go further, and inquire as to the company,&#xD;
Don't you know how to drive, Miss Faith ?"&#xD;
"And what if I do ?" said Faith.&#xD;
"Is there any insuperable objection to your driving Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick over to Neanticut Saturday morning ? It would be&#xD;
so comfortable to know there were people there-and fires--&#xD;
in case it was a cold morning," said Mr. Linden demurely.&#xD;
"I could send Reuben with you, and the key."&#xD;
" 0 that's good !" cried Faith clapping her hands.&#xD;
"Mother, will you go ?"&#xD;
"Why don't I always, just where you want me to, child ?"&#xD;
said her mother. "I should like to go to Neanticut, be-&#xD;
sides. I haven't been there this long while. But I guess&#xD;
you and I can open the house, Faith, without Reuben&#xD;
Taylor."&#xD;
"After all, Mr. Linden," said Faith, "there is a great'&#xD;
objection to my driving mother over there,-because she'll&#xD;
drive me."&#xD;
" There is a great objection to your opening the house--.&#xD;
for Reuben has the key-or will have it ; and keys you&#xD;

know, are matters of trust, and not transferable. I don't&#xD;
know but Mr. Simlins would make an exception in your&#xD;
favour,-but I shall not ask him."&#xD;
" I am glad to have Reuben along," said Faith. "And&#xD;
I suppose we must take our dinner with us, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"I have no doubt there will be dinner enough from other&#xD;
quarters," he answered, "but how much of it will be like&#xD;
Mrs. Seacomb's tea I cannot say. I think it would be safe&#xD;
to take a very little basket-such as would suffice for two&#xD;
ladies."&#xD;
"0 with'Reuben we can manage nicely," said Faith joy-&#xD;
ously. He looked at her--pleased with her pleasure.&#xD;
"Don't make any grand preparation for me," he said,-.&#xD;
"you know I must eat in commons-for the same reason that&#xD;
I cannot offer to drive you over."&#xD;
"Does that mean that you will have to take a piece out&#xD;
of everybody's basket ?"&#xD;
"As near as possible 1"&#xD;
Faith shook her head, but made no further remark.&#xD;
Early Saturday morning, before any other steps had&#xD;
brushed the dew from the grassy roadside, Reuben Taylor&#xD;
was on his way from the rocky coast point where he lived&#xD;
to the smooth well-ordered abode of Mr. Simlins. Recei-&#xD;
ing from that gentlemadi the key of the old house at Nean-&#xD;
ticut, and having harnessed the horses to4he big wagon&#xD;
under his special directions, Reuben drove down to the&#xD;
village, put horses and wagon in safe keeping, and reported&#xD;
himself at Mrs. Derrick's. All things there being in readi-&#xD;
ness, that small turnout was soon on its way; leaving Mr.&#xD;
Linden to look after his own much larger consignment.&#xD;
And despite the presence of Reuben Mrs. Derrick chose to&#xD;
drive; because, as she said, "when she had the reins in her&#xD;
own hands, she knew which way the horse was going."&#xD;
The road for awhile went on towards Mrs. Seacomb's, but&#xD;
passing the turn into the woods kept on its uneven way to&#xD;
the ferry. The natural hedges-all glittering with dew--&#xD;
shewed little colour but in the leaves. The fair clethra and&#xD;
the sweet clematis had ended their short -reign and were&#xD;
gone, and high-coloured sumachs flamed out in insurrection.&#xD;
Now the country became more hilly, and where the eastern&#xD;
portion of Pattaquasset lay close upon the Mong, the road&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.                   99&#xD;
went down by a succession of steep pitches to its shore.&#xD;
Then the road ran on through a sort of balf drained marsh&#xD;
-varied in its course by holes and logs and a little bridge,&#xD;
and then they were at the ferry.&#xD;
Now the ferry between Pattaquasset and Neanticut was--.&#xD;
and is, as I trust it will always be--propelled by wind power.&#xD;
No plodding horses to distract one's eyes from the surround-&#xD;
ing peace,-no puffing steam to break with its discord the&#xD;
sweet rush of the water,--but a large, flat-bottomed boat,&#xD;
a white saif, and a Yankee steersman. The only evil attend,&#xD;
ant upon these advantages is, that the establishment cannot&#xD;
be upon both sides at 'once-and'that the steersman, like&#xD;
other mortals, must take his dinner. This time it happened&#xD;
to be breakfast; for having been much interrupted and&#xD;
called for at the hour when he should have taken that refresh-&#xD;
ment, long Tim declared "he would have it now, and no&#xD;
mistake 1" The little fact that two ladies were waiting for&#xD;
him on the other side, did not in the least affect his appetite&#xD;
or his deliberation.&#xD;
"Faith," said her mother when they had waited about a&#xD;
quarter of an hour, "if 'tother wagon should catch up we&#xD;
shouldn't get there first !"&#xD;
Faith laughed and said, "Well, mother !"&#xD;
"Well, child," said her mother cheerfully, while Reuben&#xD;
waved fresh signals to the obdurate ferryman, "I'm sure I&#xD;
don't mind, if you don't."&#xD;
"He's coming out now !" -said Reuben,-"or his wife is&#xD;
---and that's just as good."&#xD;
And so it appeared; for a short vision of a red petticoat&#xD;
and blue jacket on the other bank, was followed by the ferry-&#xD;
man himself,-the white sail rose up above the little boat,&#xD;
and she floated smoothly over. Then Mrs. Derrick drove&#xD;
carefully across the boat bridge, and long Tim pushed off&#xD;
into the stream. How pretty it was ! the winding river&#xD;
above, with its woody banks, and villages, and spires; and&#xD;
its broader bends below, towards the Sound. They were&#xD;
about midway in the stream when Reuben suddenly cried&#xD;
out--6&#xD;
" Look, Miss Faith !"-&#xD;
And there came the great wagon, at not the slowest&#xD;
possible rate, over the long marsh road.&#xD;

The first sight of the ferryboat and her freight was the&#xD;
signal for a simultaneous shout from the whole wagon load&#xD;
-which long Tim took for a summons to himself.&#xD;
"'Taint no sort o' use hollering' ike that," he said, with a&#xD;
little turn of his steering oar, *"'h cause I paint a going' back&#xD;
till I get somewheres to go back from-nor then neither&#xD;
mabbe. I kin count dollars whar they kint count cents,&#xD;
neow."&#xD;
And 'neow' the little wagon was beyond pursuit,-up&#xD;
the hill from the ferry, on over the farm road, drove Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick-somewhat at the quickest; until the old unten-&#xD;
anted house rose just before them, and Reuben sprang down&#xD;
to take the reins and help the ladies out.&#xD;
It was a pleasant old farmhouse that, in spite of its de-&#xD;
serted condition. They went to the kitchen, bright with&#xD;
windows looking out to grass fields and trees. Mrs. Der-&#xD;
rick stood at open door and window, recalling scenes and&#xD;
people she remembered there, or watching for the big&#xD;
wagon to make its appearance; while Reuben and Faith&#xD;
went to the outhouses, and finally by dint of perseverance&#xD;
found a supply of wood in an old rotten tumbled-down&#xD;
fence. Mrs. Derrick proclaimed"that the wagon was com-&#xD;
ing, as the foragers returned ; but there was a splendid&#xD;
blaze going up chimney before the aforesaid conveyance&#xD;
drew up at the door, and the whole first party turned 'out&#xD;
to see it unload.&#xD;
The wagon was unloaded in the twinkling of an eye;&#xD;
then came rummaging for baskets ; then so many boys and&#xD;
so many baskets hopped and hummed round, like a little&#xD;
bevy of wasps-with nothing at -east of the bee business-&#xD;
character about them.&#xD;
" Mr. Linden, be we going to stop here ?"-&#xD;
"Is here where the trees be, Mr. Linden ?"-&#xD;
" Mr. Linden, Joe Deacon aint behaving nohow !"1&#xD;
"Mr. Lindnwill we leave our baskets and come back&#xD;
to the house ? or will they be to go along ?".-inquired a&#xD;
more sober tongue.&#xD;
While others were giving their opinion in little asides&#xD;
that it was 'prime'-and 'fust-rate'-and arguing the com-&#xD;
parative promise of chestnut and 'hickory trees. And one&#xD;
of the bigger boys of the party, not distinguished for his&#xD;
&#xD;
general good qualities, sidling up to Reuben, accosted him&#xD;
under breath with a sly,&#xD;
" So you druv Mr. Linden's sweetheart.  Aint you&#xD;
spry ."&#xD;
If Reuben had been in that line, he would probably have&#xD;
sent the offender head first down the bank,-as it was, he&#xD;
said quietly,   ,°&#xD;
"I wouldn't let Mr. Jinden hear me say that, Phil, if I&#xD;
was you."&#xD;
"Don't mean ter. Aint you great ! But I say,-Joe&#xD;
Deacon says you did."&#xD;
"Joe Deacon's made a mistake for once in his life," said&#xD;
Reuben rather contemptuously-'"and it isn't the first, by&#xD;
several."&#xD;
"Reuben," said Mr. Linden approaching the .group,&#xD;
"you may all go and find where the best trees are, and then&#xD;
come back and report to me. I put you in charge. Under-&#xD;
stand"-he added, raising his voice a little, "Reuben Tay-&#xD;
lor is leader of the search-whoever does not obey his&#xD;
orders, does not obey mine."--And in a minute. the court-&#xD;
yard was clear. Then Mr. Linden turned and walked up&#xD;
to the house.&#xD;
"Now what are you ladies going to do with yourselves ?"&#xD;
he said. " Will you come out and sit under the trees and&#xD;
look on-taking the chance of being hit by a stray nut now&#xD;
and then ?"&#xD;
".We can't-go wrong to-day," said Faith, with whom the&#xD;
spirit of enjoyment was well at play. "When mother feels&#xD;
in the mood of it we'll come. We can find you-we know&#xD;
where to look. Weren't you obliged to us for doing the&#xD;
waiting at the ferry ?"&#xD;
"And for looking so picturesque in the distance,-it was&#xD;
quite a thing to be grateful for. I think you will have no&#xD;
difficulty in finding where we are- there will be noise&#xD;
enough to guide you. I hope you have not brought a book&#xD;
along, Miss Faith."&#xD;
" Why, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"The 'running brooks' are good letter-press," he said--.&#xD;
"and the grey stones, and that white oak in the meadow.&#xD;
And is not that woodpecker a pretty illustration ?"&#xD;
"I have looked at thgm often," said Faith. "I don'V&#xD;

stood in the doorway.&#xD;
Faith smiled again, and shook her head a little at the&#xD;
same time as her eye went from the woodpecker to the&#xD;
green leaves above his head, then to the bright red of some&#xD;
pepperidge trees further off, to the lush grass of the&#xD;
meadow, and on-to the soft brownish, reddish, golden hues&#xD;
Hof distant woodland. Her eye came back as from a book&#xD;
it would take long to read thoroughly.&#xD;
" I am so glad it is such a day.1" she repeated.&#xD;
"I see my boys are doming back," Mr. Linden said, with&#xD;
a smile which hardly belonged to them,-" I must go and&#xD;
get their report. Au revoir, Miss Faith." 'And he went&#xD;
forward into the midst of the little swarm-so manageable&#xD;
in his hands, so sure to sting anybody else.&#xD;
"Child," said Mrs. Derrick, looking over Faith's head&#xD;
from her more elevated position of the door-sill (looking&#xD;
at it too); "Child, why 'don't you get-" and there, for&#xD;
the firs and last time in her life, Mrs. Derrick stopped&#xD;
shor   the middle of a sentence.&#xD;
" XV4'at, mother?"&#xD;
But Mrs. Derrick replied not.&#xD;
" What 4o you want me to get, mother ?"&#xD;
" I don't know as I want you to get anything, child-&#xD;
you've got enough now for me. Not that he wouldn't like&#xD;
it, either," said Mrs. Derrick musingly -" because if he&#xD;
wouldn't, I wouldn't give much for him. But I guess it's&#xD;
just as well not." .And Mrs. Derrick stroked her hand&#xD;
fondly over Faith's head, and told her that if she stood out&#xD;
there without a bonnet she would get sunburnt.&#xD;
"But mother !" said Faith' at this enigmatical speech,&#xD;
"what do you mean ? Who wouldn't like what?"&#xD;
"What does it signify, child ?-since I didn't say it ?"&#xD;
" But motherr" persi~ed Faith gently, " what had I&#xD;
better get that I haven't ?"  ---&#xD;
" I don't know as you had better get it, child-and I&#xD;
9*&#xD;
&#xD;
never said he wouldn't like it, I'm sure," said Mrs. Derrick&#xD;
with a little self-vindication.&#xD;
"Who, mother ?"&#xD;
"Why-nobody," said Mrs. Derrick,-' who's talking of&#xD;
anybody ?"&#xD;
"Dear mother," said Faith, "don't you mean to tell me&#xD;
what you mean ?"&#xD;
"I guess it's just as well not," her mother repeated.&#xD;
"The fact that he'd like it don't-prove anything."&#xD;
Faith looked at her, coloured .a little, laughed a little,&#xD;
and gave up the point.&#xD;
The morning passed on its pleasant way in quietness ;'at&#xD;
least with the old farmhouse and its two occupants. Mrs. *&#xD;
Derrick was not without her knitting, and having come&#xD;
from the door sat comfortably click-clacking her needles&#xD;
together-and her thoughts too perhaps-before the cheer-&#xD;
ful blaze of the.fence sticks. Faith had a book with her-&#xD;
a little one-with which she sat in the kitchen doorway,&#xD;
which looked towards the direction, the nut party had&#xD;
taken; and apparently divided her attention between that&#xD;
volume and the one Mr. Linden had recommended. For&#xD;
she looked down at the one and looked off at the other by&#xD;
turns, in a sort of peaceful musing and note-taking, alto-&#xD;
gether suited to the October stillness and beauty. Now&#xD;
and then she got up to replenish. the fire. And then the&#xD;
beauty and her musing got the better of the reading, and&#xD;
Faith sat with her book in her hand, looking out into the&#xD;
dream-provoking atmosphere. No sound came from the&#xD;
far-off nut trees ; the crickets and grasshoppers and katy-&#xD;
dids alone broke the stillness of the unused farm. Only&#xD;
they moved, and the -wind-stirred leaves, and the slow-&#xD;
creeping shadows.&#xD;
When these last were but an hour's length from the tree&#xD;
stems, Faith proposed an adjournment to the nut trees&#xD;
before the party should come back to lunch. The fire was&#xD;
inended, the pot of coffee put on to warm; and tkey locked&#xD;
the door and set out.&#xD;
It was not hot that day, even under the meridian sun.&#xD;
They crossed an orchard, and one .or two farm fields, on the&#xD;
skirts of which grew single trees of great beauty. White&#xD;
oaks that had seen hundreds of years, yet stood'in as fresh&#xD;

CHAPTER X.&#xD;
&#xD;
HE two ladies paused at a safe distance,..-there seemed&#xD;
e   to be nothing but boys astir  boys and nuts; and&#xD;
r.     these last not dropping from t/he tree, but thrown from hand&#xD;
st     to hand (hand to head would ;be more correct) of the busy&#xD;
d   throng. Some picking up, spme throwing stones to bring&#xD;
re      down, others at some flat stony 'shucking,' others still filling&#xD;
1e     their baskets. And four boys out of five, cracking and&#xD;
's     eating-whatever else they were about. The grass, trodden&#xD;
down by the many feet, lay iniprostrate shadow at the foot&#xD;
of the great tree; and the shadows of other trees fell and&#xD;
met in soft wavy outline. From the side of- one old tree a&#xD;
family of grey squirrels looked out, to see the besiegers lay&#xD;
waste the surrounding country; in the top of another-a&#xD;
tall hickory, full clad with golden leaves, Mr. Linden sat-.&#xD;
to view the same country himself; well knowing that he had&#xD;
given the boys full occupation for at least fifteen minutes.&#xD;
He was not very visible from below, so thickly did the gold&#xD;
leaves close him in ; but Faith heard one of the boys call&#xD;
out,&#xD;
"You Johnny Fax! if you throw stones in that tree,&#xD;
you'll hit Mr. Linden."&#xD;
"Trust Johnny Fax for not never throwin'so high as he&#xD;
is," said Joe Deacon.&#xD;
"I don't want to-" said Johnny Fax-" I don't want to&#xD;
fetch him down."&#xD;
Whereupon there was a general shout, and "Guess you'd&#xD;
better not, Johnny !"-" lie might come, if you didn't just&#xD;
hit him," vociferated from various quarters.&#xD;
" My !" Mrs. Derrick said, surveying the golden hickory,&#xD;
"how on earth did he ever get up ?-And how do you s'pose,&#xD;
Faith, he'll ever get down !"&#xD;
Faith's low laugh was her only answer ; but it would have&#xD;
told, to anybody who could thoroughly have translated it,&#xD;
Faith's mind on both points.&#xD;
Apparently. he was in no haste to come down--certainly&#xD;

meant to send the nuts first; for a sudden shower of hickory&#xD;
nuts and leaves swept away every boy from the tree near&#xD;
which Faith and her mother stood, and drew them all into&#xD;
its vortex. Drop, drop, the nuts came down, with their&#xD;
sweet patter upon the grass; while the golden leaves fell&#xD;
singly or in sprays, or floated off upon the calm air.&#xD;
"'Child," said Mrs. Derrick, "how pretty it is ! I haven't&#xD;
seen such a sight since-since a long while ago," she added&#xD;
with a sobering face.&#xD;
"I want to be there under the tree," said Faith looking&#xD;
on enviously. "No mother-and I haven't seen it before in&#xD;
a long time, either. It's as pretty as it can be !"&#xD;
"Run along then, child," said her mother,-".only take&#xD;
care of your eyes. Why shouldn't you?  I don't want to&#xD;
pick up nuts myself, but I'll go down and pick you up."&#xD;
Faith however kept away from the crowd under the hick-&#xD;
ory tree; and went peering about under some others where&#xD;
the ground was beaten and the branches had been, and soon&#xD;
found enough spoil to be hammering away with a stone on&#xD;
a rock like the rest. But she couldn't escape the boys so,&#xD;
for little runners came to her constantly.. One brought a&#xD;
handful of nuts, another a better stone-while a third told&#xD;
her of 'lots' under the other tree; and Reuben Taylor was&#xD;
ready to crack or climb as she chose to direct.&#xD;
"If you'll cone down the otier side, Miss. Faith," said&#xD;
Reuben, "down by the bank, you could see it all a great&#xD;
deal better."&#xD;
Faith seized two or three nuts and jumped up, and Reu.&#xD;
ben led the way through the leaf-strewn grass to the other&#xD;
side of the mob.  But mobs are uncertain things! No&#xD;
sooner was Faith seen approaching the hickory, though yet&#xD;
full three feet from the utmost bound of its shadow, than&#xD;
a sudden pause in the great business of the day was followed&#xD;
by such a tumultuous shout of "Three cheers for Miss&#xD;
Faith Derrick !-the prettiest girl in Pattaquasset !"-that&#xD;
she was well nigh deafened. And promptly upon that, Joe&#xD;
Deacon stepped up to Reuben and whispered,&#xD;
"That'll fetch him down1"&#xD;
Faith did not hear the words-she only heard Reuben's&#xD;
indignant,&#xD;
" Joe Deacon! behave yourself. What makes you&#xD;

always leave your manners home? that big basket of&#xD;
yours would have held 'em all, easy."&#xD;
"I didn't know but Sam might want 'em," replied the&#xD;
unabashed Joe, dashing back into the midst of his com&#xD;
panions, whije Reuben at last reached the pretty look-out&#xD;
at the edge of the woods where Faith could see the whole&#xD;
meadow and its scattered trees. And having placed .her&#xD;
there ran off again. Standing half hidden by the oaks and&#xD;
chestnuts, she could see the whole group clustering about&#xD;
the climber now, for he had come down from his high post.&#xD;
"Boys," he said, "I am going back to the house to din-&#xD;
ncr. Any boy who prefers nuts to dinner may stay and&#xD;
pick them up."&#xD;
A sudden recollection came over Faith that her fire was&#xD;
probably well down and coffee not in a state presentable)&#xD;
Taking a survey of the ground, and calculating that so&#xD;
large a company would want a little time to get under&#xD;
weigh, she slipped round to where her mother sat, and&#xD;
giving her a word, set off fleetly and skilfully under cover&#xD;
of some outstanding chestnuts across the fallow. If she&#xD;
had known it, Faith need not have shunned to shew her&#xD;
running, for prettier running could not be. She was soon&#xD;
hidden in the further woodland.&#xD;
The rest of the party took it more leisurely, so their&#xD;
outrunner easily gained her point; and having put the fire&#xD;
in order stood at the door to watch the progress of the&#xD;
coming invasion. It looked enough like that. For though&#xD;
excellent order of march had been kept for most of the&#xD;
way, the main body of the troops ~maintaining a proper&#xD;
position in the rear of their captain who was quietly escort-&#xD;
ing Mrs. Derrick over the meadows, no sooner did the&#xD;
whole band come in sight of the distant place of lunch&#xD;
baskets, than it became manifest for the hundred thousandth&#xD;
time that liberty too long enjoyed leads to license. Scat-&#xD;
tering a little from the direct line of march, the better to&#xD;
cover their purpose or evade any check thereto, as if by&#xD;
concert, first one and then another set off on a run,-..&#xD;
sprang the orchard .fence, - and by the time the mid-&#xD;
orchard was reached all of Mr. Linden's force with the&#xD;
exception 'of one or two of the very steadiest, were ahead&#xD;
of himn and straining in full run, if not in full cry, for the&#xD;

now near-at-hand farmhouse quaii'y. Beyond all call or&#xD;
hindrance. Standing at the kitchen door, Faith watched'&#xD;
their coming; but discerning beyond the runners the one&#xD;
or two figures that did pnot indeed 'bring up the rear' but&#xD;
that covered it, and supposing that the invaders' object was&#xD;
to storm the wagon in which the lunch baskets were hid,&#xD;
she stood her ground ; till she perceived that the foremost&#xD;
of the band were making straight for the kitchen door, and&#xD;
all the rest in their order. Faith gave back a little and&#xD;
the whole horde poured in. The fire was in a brisk blaze-&#xD;
the table had nice white cups and naperies on it; the nose&#xD;
of the coffee-pot was steaming. It looked altogether ani&#xD;
inviting place.,- Down went hats and caps on the floor,&#xD;
from some of the party, and the whole of them with&#xD;
flushed faces and open mouths took the survey.&#xD;
"Ain't itjplly here !"&#xD;
"I wonder if he'll let us take our dinner in here. There's&#xD;
lots o'.room.".--&#xD;
"It's good shady."&#xD;
"It's a long sight better under the trees."-.&#xD;
" Coffee !-mI'in blessed !"-said a+ fifth speaker bending&#xD;
over the fireplace; while a sixth began slyly to inspect&#xD;
what lay under Faith's napkins on the table.&#xD;
"Charley," said Mr. Linden's quiet voice from the door-&#xD;
way, "did Miss Derrick desire you to uncover her dishes ?"&#xD;
The hand slipped from what it touched, as stealthily the&#xD;
boy's eye went to the face of the speaker, in the one place&#xD;
if not in the other 'to see what there might be.'&#xD;
"I will bear witness that you have 'carried' the house,"&#xD;
Mr. Linden went on,-" now I should like to see you tarry&#xD;
the wagon. It will be a more useful enterprise than this.&#xD;
Only remember that one of the first duties of a surprise&#xD;
party is to go forth softly."&#xD;
"Where will we carry the wagon to, sir ?" inquired one&#xD;
of the party.&#xD;
"As far from the house as you can," said Mr. Linden,&#xD;
with a little glance at Faith. "Come ! be off !-great&#xD;
enterprises are never finished till they are begun."&#xD;
"I'd like to begin dinner, anyhow," said one,catching up&#xD;
his cap and leading~ off.&#xD;
As quick and more quick than. it had been filled, the&#xD;
&#xD;
room was cleared ; and laughing Faith watched the busy&#xD;
swarm as they poured towards their magazine. Then re-&#xD;
membered her own and came back to offer it.&#xD;
"You may as well rest, Mr. Linden," said Faith as she&#xD;
offered him a cup of coffee. "I'm sure they are all com-&#xD;
fortable. Besides, ,you particularly desired a fire and some-&#xD;
body in the house, you know."&#xD;
"Miss' Faith," he said, (taking the cup however) "I'm&#xD;
afraid your notions of duty are very slack ! What sort of&#xD;
a captain would you make to, a beleaguered city? I shall&#xD;
make you read the story of Catherine Douglass."&#xD;
"Will you ?" said Faith looking very pleased.' "And&#xD;
what is 'beleaguered,' Mr. Linden ? in the meantime."&#xD;
"'Beleaguered' means, to be beset with a swarm of in-&#xD;
vaders who want to come in and ought to be kept out."&#xD;
"I didn't know I ought to keep them out," said Faith&#xD;
laughing, "or I'd have done it."&#xD;
Mr.; Linden shook his head doubtfully. "I saw you give&#xD;
way !" he said,--"I 'doubt whether there was even a show&#xD;
of resistance. Now Catherine Douglass-But I must go.&#xD;
No, don't tempt me with apple pie-you have no idea of&#xD;
the pies in that wagon. Perhaps if I get successfully&#xD;
through them, I'll come back and dispose of yours. What&#xD;
are you reading to-day ?-.-'Le Philosophe' ?"&#xD;
A little soberness came over Faith's smile as she shook&#xD;
her head and said no.&#xD;
"I can't stay to ask a question upon that-but I'll ask&#xD;
you two by and by to pay for it."&#xD;
And he went out to that little cluster of life that hung&#xD;
about the great wagon, making himself at once the centre&#xD;
of pleasure and interest and even fun, as Faith's eye and&#xD;
ear now and then informed her.  It was pretty, the wyg&#xD;
they closed in about him-wild and untutored as they were,&#xD;
--pretty to see him meet them so easily on their own&#xD;
ground, yet always enticing them towards something better.&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick thought so too, for she stood in the doorway&#xD;
and smiled very pleasantly.&#xD;
"He's a real nice man, Faith," she said. "I don't won-&#xD;
der the boys like him."&#xD;
Faith did not wonder at it, but she did not answer,&#xD;
though she too stood looking.&#xD;

The ladies had finished their lunch, and Mr. Linden had&#xD;
perhaps not finished his, for he came in again to take&#xD;
another cup of coffee while the boys were disposing of that&#xD;
very ragged piece of time which the end of a boys' feast&#xD;
invariably is. So much peace and quietness he gave him.-&#xD;
self, if he did not give himself a sandwich-of which I am&#xD;
not certain.,&#xD;
"Mr. Linden," said Faith,   want to ask something-.&#xD;
will you tell me if you don't like it ?"&#xD;
"Don't like to have you ask me, do you mean? I do like&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"Then," said Faith half laughing, " will you tell me if&#xD;
you don't quite like what I mean ?".&#xD;
I'll see-" Mr. Linden replied with a smile. "It's not&#xD;
safefor teachers to commit themselves."&#xD;
"But I must commit myself," said Faith. "I want to&#xD;
go and pick up nuts with the boys under the trees-may I?"&#xD;
She looked for her answer with an eye that thought he&#xD;
might possibly find an objection where she saw none.&#xD;
He paused a little before he replied,   -&#xD;
"I hink you may-if I could be among them and&#xD;
answr for their good behaviour I should not need to think&#xD;
about it; but you know a man loses power when he is too&#xD;
far above the heads of his audience. Yet I think I may&#xD;
trust them-and you," he added with a little smile. "Espe-&#xD;
cially as the first tree touched this afternoon is yours."&#xD;
"What does that mean?" said Faith, her doubt all gone.&#xD;
"Do you think I shall so far forget my office as to let&#xD;
them pi   up nuts for nobody but themselves?  Therefore&#xD;
the first   this afternoon is for you-or if you please for&#xD;
your mother; the second for Mr. Simlins. If' that will&#xD;
take away your desire for 'the fun,' why I cannot help it."&#xD;
"I have no objection to pick up nuts for mother, nor&#xD;
even for Mr. Simlins," said Faith smiling. "And I am not&#xD;
afraid of the boys - I know half of them, you know.&#xD;
Thank you, Mr. Linden!"&#xD;
"You might, if I could take you up into the tree-top.&#xD;
There is fine reading on those upper shelves.?,&#xD;
Her eye showed instantly that she liked thatjhigher' fun&#xD;
best-not the tree-top, verily, but the reading, that she&#xD;
could not get at. Yet for Faith there were cirarms plenty&#xD;
&#xD;
below the tree-tops, in both kinds; and she looked very&#xD;
happy.&#xD;
"Well".-Mr. Linden said, "as the successful meeting of&#xD;
one emergency always helps us in the next,-and as it is&#xD;
quite impossible to tell what you may meet under those nut&#xD;
trees, -let me give you a little abstract of Catherine&#xD;
Douglass, before you read it and before I go. The said lady&#xD;
wishing to keep the door against sundry lords and gentle-&#xD;
men who came with murderous intent against her sovereign;&#xD;
and finding no bar to aid her loyal endeavours,--did boldly&#xD;
(thrust her own arm through the stanchions of the door.&#xD;
To be sure-'the brave lady's arm was soon broken,'-but&#xD;
after all, what did that signify ?"&#xD;
And with a laughing gesture of farewell, he once more&#xD;
left the house. With which cessation of murmuring voices,&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick awoke from her after dinner nap in the rock-&#xD;
ing chair. Faith was standing in the middle of the floor,&#xD;
smiling and looking in a puzzle.&#xD;
"Mother, will you go over to the nutting again?."&#xD;
"I'm a great deal more likely to go to sleep again," said&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick rubbing her eyes. "It's the sleepiest place I&#xD;
ever saw in my life-or else it's having nothing to do. I&#xD;
don't doubt you're half asleep too, Faith, only you won't&#xD;
own it."&#xD;
The decision was, that Mrs. Derrick preferred to sit&#xD;
quiet in the house; she said she would maybe run down by'&#xD;
and by and see what they were at. So Faith took her sun-&#xD;
bonnet, kissed her mother; and went forth with light step&#xD;
over the meadow and through the orchard.&#xD;
The nutting party she found a little further on in the&#xD;
same edge of woodland. It seemed that they had pitched&#xD;
upon a great chestnut' for her tree; and Faith was half&#xD;
concerned to see what a quantity of work they had given&#xD;
themselves on her account. However, the proverb of 'many&#xD;
hands' was verified here; the ground under the chestnut&#xD;
tree was like a colony, of ants, while in the capacious head&#xD;
of the tree their captain, established quite at his ease, was&#xD;
whipping off the burrs with a long pole.&#xD;
Faith to*a general view as she came up, and then fell&#xD;
upon ghe chestnut burrs like the rest of them; and no boy&#xD;
there worked more readily or joyously. There seemed&#xD;

little justification of Mr. Linden's doubts of the boys or&#xD;
fears for her. Faith was everywhere among them, and&#xD;
making Reuben's prophecy true, that 'they would all enjoy&#xD;
themselves a great deal better' for her being there; throw.&#xD;
ing nuts into the baskets of the little boys and pleasant&#xD;
words at the heads of the big ones, that hit softly and did&#xD;
gentle execution; giving sly handfuls to. Reuben, and then&#xD;
hammering out for some little fellow the burrs that her&#xD;
hands were yet more unfit to deal with than his; and doing&#xD;
it all with a will that the very spirit of enjoyment seemed&#xD;
to have moved. She in any danger of rude treatment from&#xD;
those boys! Nothing further from the truth. And so her&#xD;
happy face informed Mr. Linden, when he at last descended&#xD;
to terra firma out of the stripped chestnut tree.&#xD;
lie did not say anything, but leaning up against the&#xD;
great brown trunk of the chestnut took a pleased survey of&#xD;
the whole-then went to work with the rest.&#xD;
"Boys !" he said-"aren't there enough of you to open&#xD;
these burrs as fast as Miss Derrick cart pick out the nuts?&#xD;
You should never let a lady prick her fingers when you can&#xD;
prick yours in her place."&#xD;
There was a general shout and rush at this, which ma.&#xD;
Faith give way before it. The burrs disappeared fast; thf&#xD;
brown nuts gathered idto an immense heap. That tree&#xD;
was done.&#xD;
"Hurrah! for Mr. Simlins !"I shouted all the boys,'&#xD;
throwing up their caps into the air,-then turning somer-&#xD;
sets, and wrestling, and rolling over by way of further&#xD;
relief to their feelings.&#xD;
"The chestnut beyond that red maple for him," said&#xD;
Mr.. Linden, flinging a little stone in the right direction;&#xD;
at which with'nother shout the little tornado swept away.&#xD;
"Will you follow, Miss Faith? or are you tired ?"&#xD;
"No, I'm not tired yet. I must do something for Mr.&#xD;
Simlins."&#xD;
"Well don't handle those burrs-" he said. "They're&#xD;
worse than darning needles."&#xD;
"Have you seen Kildeer river yet, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"I have had a bird's eye view."&#xD;
Faith looked a little wistfully, but only said;,&#xD;
"We must look at it after the nutting is . done.9&#xD;

That's a bit of reading hereabout you ought not to pass&#xD;
over."&#xD;
"I mean to read 'everything I can,' too," he said with a&#xD;
Mile as they reached the tree.&#xD;
"Now Mr. Linden," said Joe Deacon, "this tree's a&#xD;
whapper ! How long you suppose it'll take you to go up ?"&#xD;
"About as long as it would you to come down---every-&#xD;
one knows how long that would be. Stand out of my way,&#xD;
boys-catch all the burrs on your own heads and don't let&#xD;
one fall on Miss Derrick." And amidst the general laugh&#xD;
Mr. Linden swung himself up into the branches in a way&#xD;
that made his words good; while Joe Deacon whistled and&#xD;
danced 'Yankee Doodle' round the great trunk.&#xD;
Half at least of Mr. Linden's directions the boys&#xD;
obeyed;-they caught all the burrs they well could, on&#xD;
their own heads.  Faith was too busy among them to&#xD;
avoid catching some on her own bright hair whenever her&#xD;
sunbonnet declined to stay on, which happened frequently.&#xD;
"he new object lent this tree a new interest of its own, and&#xD;
boys being an untiring species of animals the sport went&#xD;
on with no perceptible flagging. But when this tree too&#xD;
was about half cleared, Faith withdi'ew a little from the&#xD;
busy rush and bustle, left the chestnuts and chestnut burrs,&#xD;
and sat down on the bank to rest and look. Her eye wan-&#xD;
dered to the further woodland, softest of all in hazy veils;&#xD;
to the nearer brilliant vegetation; the open fallow; the&#xD;
wood behind her, where the trees closed in upon each&#xD;
other; ,oftenest of all, at the 'whapper' of a tree in which&#xD;
Mr. Linden still kept his place, and at the happy busy&#xD;
sight and sound of all under that tree.&#xD;
And so it happened, that when in time Mr. linden&#xD;
came down out of Mr. Simlins' chestnut, besides the boys&#xD;
he found nobody there but Mr. Simlins himself.&#xD;
"Well!"-said that gentleman after a cordial grasp of&#xD;
the hand,-."I reckon, in the matter of nuts you're going&#xD;
to reduce me to penur'ousness! How you like Neanticut ?"&#xD;
"It's a fine place," said Mr. Linden.-"And for the&#xD;
matter of nuts,.you need not take the benefit of the bank-&#xD;

"I might want to do it-and yet not be able," was the&#xD;
smiling reply; while one of the smallest boys, pulling the&#xD;
tail of the grey coat which Mr. Simlins wore 'on business,'&#xD;
and pointing to the heap of nuts, said s cinctly,&#xD;
"Them's yourn 1"&#xD;
"Mine !" said Mr. Simlins. "Well where's yourn? What&#xD;
have you done with Miss Faith Derrick ?"&#xD;
"Why we hain't done nothin' to her," said the boy.-&#xD;
"she's done a'heap to us."&#xD;
"What has she done to you, you green hickory ?"&#xD;
"Why-she's run round, firstrate," said little Rob,--"and&#xD;
she's helped me shuck."&#xD;
"So some o' you's 'thanked her. 'Twan't you. Here,&#xD;

con, "what have you been doing with Miss Fa'th Der-&#xD;

" bain't Sam," was Joe's rather cool rejoinde , with a&#xD;
slight relapsing into Yankee Doodle.&#xD;
"Hollo !" said Mr. Simlins-" I thought you'd learned&#xD;
all school could teach you, and give up to come?"&#xD;
" Only the last part is true, Mr. Simlins," said. Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den, who while Joe spoke had been himself speaking to&#xD;
one of the other boys.&#xD;
Mr. Simlins grunted. "School ain't all 'nuts to him,'&#xD;
he said with a grim smile. "Well which of you was it?--&#xD;
'twas a fellow about as big as you-here, you siF-!"-ad-&#xD;
dressing in a more assured tone another boy who was swag-&#xD;

Faith?  It was you."&#xD;
"'Twan't me, another !" said. the boy surlily; "nor I&#xD;
hain't done nothin'! but minded my own business." ,&#xD;
In a tone which implied that Mr. Simlins was not acting&#xD;
on the same laudable principle.&#xD;
"What has been done ?" said Mr. Linden. And cer-&#xD;
tainly his tone implied that he was minding his own busi-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
"Well," said Mr. Simlins, "I don't kno tas they've done&#xD;

"Where was she ?"&#xD;
"She was round yonder-not fur-There had been some&#xD;
sort of a scrimmage, I guess, between two of 'em, a little&#xD;
one and this fellow; and she parted 'em. She had hold o'&#xD;
this one when I see 'em first-you couldn't have done it&#xD;
better," said Mr. Simlins with a sly cast of his eye;-"you&#xD;
can set her to be your 'vice' when you want one. I was&#xD;
coming' up from the river, you see, and came up behind 'em,&#xD;
aid I couldn't hear what they said; but when she let him&#xD;
go, I see her give a kind o' sheer look round this way, and&#xD;
then she put up her hand to her cheek and cleared for home&#xD;
like-a gazetteer !"--said Mr. Simlins, who had given this&#xD;
information in an undertone. "Made straight tracks for&#xD;
the house, I tell ye!"&#xD;
"A little one and which one ?" was the next inquiry.&#xD;
Mr. Simlins went peering about among the crowd and&#xD;
finally laid hold on the identical shoulder of little Johnny&#xD;
Fax.&#xD;
"Ain't it you ?" said .Mr. Simlins. "Ain't that red&#xD;
basket yourn ?"&#xD;
Johnny nodded.&#xD;
"I knowed the basket," said Mr. Simlins returning.&#xD;
"That's about all that makes the difference between one&#xD;
boy and another! what sort of a basket he carries. "The&#xD;
other fellow is the one I was speakin' to first-I can swear&#xD;
to him-the big one."&#xD;
Mr. Linden took out his watch.&#xD;
"Thank you, Mr. Simlins," he said. "Boys-it is half&#xD;
past four,-get your nuts and baskets and bring them up, to&#xD;
the house. ReubeyTaylor-do you see that it is done."&#xD;
With which words Mr. Linden also 'made tracks' for the&#xD;
house-and 'straight' ones, but with not too much notice-&#xD;
taking of the golden leaves under his feet.&#xD;
The truth about Faith was this. While sitting on the&#xD;
grass, taking the pleasure of the place and time, the peace&#xD;
was at length broken by discordant sounds in her neighbour,&#xD;
hood; sounds of harsh voices, and scuffling. Looking round&#xD;
for the cause and meaning of all this, she found that the voices&#xD;
came from behind a thicket of sumach and laurel at her&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
back, and belonged to some of the boys. Faith went round&#xD;
the thicket. There were a big boy and a little boy tugging&#xD;
at a basket, both tugging; the little fellow holding to it&#xD;
with all his might, while the big boy, almost getting it&#xD;
from him with one hand, was laying the other very freely&#xD;
about his ears and shoulders. Faith 4ieard. the little one&#xD;
say, "I'll tell-"&#xD;
And the other, a boy whose name Faith had learned&#xD;
only that morning, shouted in answer,&#xD;
"You tell! You tell if you dare! You tell and I'll kill&#xD;
you !-Leave hold !"-&#xD;
A round blow was given with the words, which told, but&#xD;
the little boy still held on to his basket.,&#xD;
"For shame, Phil Davids! you a big boy !"-said Faith.&#xD;
There was a stay of proceedings while they looked at&#xD;
her, both parties keeping fast hold however, and both&#xD;
tongues at once combating for hearing and belief. The&#xD;
little boy, Johnny Fax himself, paid the nuts were his;&#xD;
which the elder denied.&#xD;
"Let him have his nuts, Phil," said Faith gently. "He&#xD;
must have them-they belong to him."&#xD;
"He aint a goin' ter, though," said Davids,-"and you&#xD;
can't do nothin,' if you air Mr. Linden's sweetheart. You&#xD;
air-Joe Deacon says you be. Leave hold, you1!-."&#xD;
Thinking Faith quelled perhaps, Phil began the struggle&#xD;
again fiercely, with grappling and blows. But Faith laid&#xD;
hold suddenly on the arm that was rising the second time,&#xD;
and bade the boy sternly behave himself and let the basket&#xD;
go. It was not immediately done. He had strength much&#xD;
more than hers, but something withheld him fromn exerting&#xD;
it. Nothing withheld his tongue.&#xD;
"Aint you 4Ir. Linden's sweetheart?" he said insolently.&#xD;
"Joe Deabon says you be."&#xD;
"No sir!" said Faith; "and you are a bad boy.';&#xD;
"Joe Deachn says you be.!"&#xD;
But Faith did not relax her hold, and spoke with a steady&#xD;
voice and for that time at least with a steady eye of com-&#xD;
mand which was obeyed.'&#xD;
"Let him go !-Johnny, run off with your basket and be&#xD;
quiet; that's a good boy. Davids, you'll be quiet the rest&#xD;
of the day for your own sake."&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.                  11&#xD;
The boys parted sullenly, Johnny to run off as she had&#xD;
bidden him; and Faith turned from the green bank, the nut&#xD;
trees, and the frolic, and laying one hand upon the cheek&#xD;
that faced that way, as if to hide its burning from eyes too&#xD;
far.off to see it, she went into the house.&#xD;
She put the brands together which had burnt out, and&#xD;
built the fire up on the strictest principles, though no fire&#xD;
was wanted at present; the day had mellowed into warmth.&#xD;
Perhaps Faith recollected that after she had got through,&#xD;
for she left the fire to take care of itself and sat down&#xD;
again on the doorstep looking towards the nut-tree field.&#xD;
For a good while her cheek wore its troubled flush; her&#xD;
hand went up to it once or twice as if to cool it off, and&#xD;
her brow bespoke her using other and more effectual&#xD;
measures. It cooled at last, ipto complete quietness and&#xD;
sweetness; and Faith's face was just like itself when the&#xD;
first of the party came back from the nut field.&#xD;
That first one, as we have seen, was Mr.-Linden. He&#xD;
found both the ladies in the farmhouse kitchen; Mrs. Der-&#xD;
rick very comfortably at her knitting. Faith was doing&#xD;
nothing; but she looked up, when she looked up, with just&#xD;
her own face; not certainly in the happy glow he had seen&#xD;
under the nut tree, nor with the sparkle of busy pleasure it&#xD;
had worn in the morning; but as it was every day at home.&#xD;
Mr. Linden arranged the fire and then stood considering&#xD;
it-or something-for a minute in silence; until Mrs. Der-&#xD;
rick inquired "if he had found as much as he expected ?"--.&#xD;
but upon his replying somewhat dryly, "Rather more"-the&#xD;
conversation dropped again.                         .&#xD;
"You ought to be tired now, Mr. Linden," Faith said&#xD;
gently.&#xD;
"I am afraid you are."&#xD;
"No,".she sai4,-1"I am not at all."&#xD;
"Well then-why show n't we have our look at Kildeer&#xD;
river? You said we must."&#xD;
"0, if you like it 1" said Faith, a bright Jittle tinge of.&#xD;
pleasure coming into her cheek, and her sunbonnet was in&#xD;
hand immediately. "But aren't you tired ?" she added&#xD;
doubtfully as they were passing out of the door. "You've&#xD;
been hard at work."&#xD;
"You -will have~ to pay for saying you are not, Miss&#xD;

&#xD;
Faith,-I mean to make you run all the way down to the&#xD;
bank."&#xD;
And holding out his hand to her, Mr. Linden half made&#xD;
his threat good; for though his own pace was not much&#xD;
more than a quick walk, by means of skilful short cuts and&#xD;
long steps, Faith had a gentle little run a good part of the&#xD;
way. Not down through the crowd of boys and baskets,&#xD;
but skirting the meadow-passing from the shelter of&#xD;
one great tree to another, till they reached the bank and&#xD;
saw the blue waters of Kildeer river at their feet. There&#xD;
she was permitted to sit down and rest. A little laughing&#xD;
and a little flushed, her happy look was almost brought back&#xD;
again. But she sat and gazed down at the pretty stream&#xD;
and its picturesque banks without saying anything; letting&#xD;
Mr. Linden take his own view of them. His own view&#xD;
was a peculiar one--to judge by his words.&#xD;
"Miss Faith, I suppose you are not much acquainted&#xD;
with law forms,-yet you perhaps know that an important&#xD;
witness in an important case, is sometimes put in prison&#xD;
until his evidence Is obtained."&#xD;
Faith looked up at him in pure astonishment, the corners&#xD;
of her mouth indicating that she expected another puzzle,&#xD;
or rather was, already engaged in one. The look made,&#xD;
his gravity give way a little.&#xD;
"I thought you might like to know your position at&#xD;
present," he said.&#xD;
"I don't know it yet, Mr. Linden."&#xD;
"   dIt is that of the unfortunate prisoner to whom I&#xD;
referred."&#xD;
"A prisoner 1-" said Faith looking up at him very much&#xD;
amused. "Well, Mr. Linden?"&#xD;
He looked amused too, yet with a difference.&#xD;
"Well, Miss Faith-You are a prisoner, for political&#xD;
purposes. There is no practicable way for you to get&#xD;
back to the house save through the witness-box."&#xD;
"Where is the witness-box ?" said Faith.&#xD;
"Are you in a hurry to be in.it ?"&#xD;
"No," said Faith with a very unshadowed smile, "I am&#xD;
not in a hurry for anything." -&#xD;
"Then tell me what you. have been reading to-day," heo&#xD;
said, throwing himself down on the grass beside -her.&#xD;
&#xD;
i ,; " Sf&#xD;

&#xD;
.&#xD;
&#xD;
She looked athim, hesitated, then said with a lowered&#xD;
tone,&#xD;
"I have been reading what you told me to read-and&#xD;
my testament."&#xD;
Mr. Linden lifted his hat a little, replaced it-rather&#xD;
more down over his brows than before, looking steadily&#xD;
down at Kildeer river the while.&#xD;
"Why did you look grave when I asked you if you had&#xD;
brought 'Le Philosophe'?"&#xD;
"I didn't know I did !" said Faith simply. "I had brought&#xD;
only my testament."&#xD;
" Only-" Mr. Linden repeated. "Well, from 'only' a&#xD;
testament and only such a scene-a skilful reader may get&#xD;
much." Then turning and looking her full in the face, he&#xD;
said, "Miss Faith - what have those boys done to vex&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
A sudden, painful, startled flush answered him. She&#xD;
did not look now; she said earnestly,&#xD;
"Please Mr. Linden, don't speak of it!"&#xD;
I must know-" was his only answer.&#xD;
" No," she said gently but troubled,-"you mustn't know,&#xD;
and there is no need you should. There is no need," she&#xD;
repeated eagerly.&#xD;
"There is another true little witness I can call upon-.&#xD;
but I would rather have your account."&#xD;
"How did you know ?-how did you know anything&#xD;
about it ?" said Faith, facing round upon him in her&#xD;
turn.&#xD;
"Gentlemen of what Miss Danforth is pleased to call&#xD;
'my profession' must know things occasionally," said Mr.&#xD;
Linden.&#xD;
"What do you think you know, Mr. Linden ?" she said a&#xD;
little timidly.&#xD;
His answer was gentle though resolute.&#xD;
"I don't think I know anything. What I know, I know&#xD;
----what I do not, I will."&#xD;
Faith'sA head half drooped for an instant, and the flush&#xD;
which had faded came back painfully. Then she looked&#xD;
at him again, and though the flush was there she spoke as&#xD;
usual.&#xD;

you not. It is nothing you need take up-it was nothing&#xD;
but-what perhaps I was foolish to mind. I don't mind it&#xD;
now-much-"&#xD;
But there was a grave falling off in the tone of that&#xD;
'much.' She felt it herself, for she rallied and said with&#xD;
her own quiet frank smile,&#xD;
"I shall not mind pit at all to-morrow."&#xD;
Mr. Linden looked at her while she spoke, gravely and&#xD;
intently enough; but then he looked away at the river&#xD;
again, and probably read problems in its soft rippling&#xD;
waters, for he spoke not. Overhead a hawk sailed noise-&#xD;
lessly to and fro, on spread wings,-in the trees close at&#xD;
hand a squirrel chattered and barked with his mouth full,&#xD;
The afternoon light left Kildeer river step by step, and the&#xD;
shadows crept after.&#xD;
Now the one white speck of cloud reflected in that peace-&#xD;
ful stream was no break in its beauty,-it marred nothing,&#xD;
nay, even brought ak little glow of its own to replace the&#xD;
sunbeams. Yet at that speck did Mr. Linden take aim-.&#xD;
sending his pebble so surely, so powerfully, that the mirror&#xD;
itself was shattered to the remotest shore! Then he stood&#xD;
up and announced that it was time to go.&#xD;
Faith stood up, but stood still, and waited somewhat&#xD;
anxiously upon the answer to her question.&#xD;
"Then, Mr. Linden, you will not speak of it any more ?"&#xD;
"The witness is discharged," he answered lightly, and&#xD;
walking on.&#xD;
She sprang after and placed herself directly in his way.&#xD;
"Mr. Linden-please give me your promise !"&#xD;
He looked down at her with eyes that were a little&#xD;
moved.                                         /&#xD;
"Miss Faith," he said, "please give me yours !"&#xD;
"For what ?" said Faith.&#xD;
"That you will trust me-and not ask what I do."&#xD;
"Yes,"-said Faith,-"but-You must trust me, Mr.&#xD;
Linden," she said smiling at him,-" and believe me that&#xD;
this is nothing for you to take up-mere nonsense;-&#xD;
nothing at all to-morrow,-it is nothing to me now. I&#xD;
want your word."&#xD;
She wanted it very much, it, was 'easy to see; but beyond&#xD;
that, her face dide4ot belie her words.&#xD;

"I don't suppose Mrs: Derrick ever called-you 'naughty&#xD;
child"'-said Mr. Linden,-" but if ever she did she might&#xD;
to-night. Look where the sun is-and where I am,-and&#xD;
guess where those boys are ! Come-" and it was not easy&#xD;
to resist the hand that again took hold of hers, nor the&#xD;
quick pace at which he went forward.&#xD;
And for some fields' length Faith yielded and went as&#xD;
fast as he pleased. Then as he stopped to put up a bar-&#xD;
place shy said again, very gently but firmly too, standing&#xD;
before him,&#xD;
"Mr. Linden, I think I have a right to ask this. I know&#xD;
what I ask, but you do not."&#xD;
"I never questioned your right, Miss Faith."&#xD;
"Then you'll not deny it to me ?"&#xD;
"What is your idea of trust ?" said Mr. Linden, replacing&#xD;
the last bar.&#xD;
"That it is something I ought to have just now," said&#xD;
Faith, smiling a little.&#xD;
He stood leaning on the bars and looking at her-a kind&#xD;
look, that she might well trust.&#xD;
"Child," he said,. "you don't know what you are talking&#xD;
about-and I do. And if .you will not trust me any&#xD;
further than you can see ine, you don't dc )erve to be called&#xD;
Miss Faith any longer ! Now don't you think I have a&#xD;
right to get home and attend to my duties-?"&#xD;
She yielded utterly at that, but with a set of her lip&#xD;
which he had never seen before; it was trembling. She was&#xD;
turning-to go on, when as if to make amends for that-or&#xD;
to .ask forgiveness generally-or to give assurance of the&#xD;
trust he had claimed,-she stretched out her hand to him&#xD;
and went by his help again until the orchard was reached&#xD;
and other eyes might be expected to be on the look-out for&#xD;
them.&#xD;
"Do you like to read letters written from other countries&#xD;
by people you have never seen ?" Mr. Linden said when&#xD;
they reached that point.&#xD;
Faith's eyes opened slightly as was their way when sud-&#xD;
denly astonished, and a little colour started too, of surprise&#xD;
or pleasure.&#xD;
"I never did read any," she said,-"I should like it."&#xD;

What a colour thanked him! what a rosy flush of plea-&#xD;

forgot. But it was said.&#xD;
There was no more delay of any kind after that.&#xD;
Wagons were ready, and baskets, and boys,; also Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick; and Faith was ready first of all. So the two&#xD;
parties, now getting under weigh, went fairly hpmewards,&#xD;
by an evening sky and a night full of stars. Only one&#xD;
incident need be recorded.&#xD;
The ferry-was passed, and four of the six miles between&#xD;
that and the central town of Pattaquasset, when Mr. Linden.&#xD;
suddenly checked his horses. Turning half round, and laying&#xD;
a pretty imperative hand on the collar of Phil Davids, he&#xD;
dropped him outside the wagon--like a walnut from its&#xD;
husk.-remarking that he had seen enough of him for one&#xD;
day, and did not wish to hear of him again till next&#xD;

in the morning-waited gnd hoped,--but was not greatly&#xD;
surprised to find that she had waited in vain. Charles the&#xD;
twelfth, whether or not he was to follow during life the&#xD;
erratic andwilful course of his namesake, was that day at&#xD;
least not to be led by her. So Faith went to church, medi-&#xD;
tating a sometime' descent upon Mrs. Seacomb's shady.&#xD;
domain, there to meet and recapture the heart of her little&#xD;
charge. For so he seemed to her now. But on her return&#xD;
from the morning service, she found Charles the twelfth,&#xD;
crest-fallen and repentant, in his turn waiting for her.,&#xD;
The -matter was, his brother Americus Vespucius had shut&#xD;
him up, so that he couldn't come; and as soon as he was&#xD;
set free Charles the twelfth had used his freedom and his&#xD;
legs in 'making tracks,' to use Mr. Simlins' expression,&#xD;
for Mrs. Derrick's abode; and on this occasion he had&#xD;
made many fewer 'tracks' than the afternoon, of his pre-&#xD;
viously recorded invasion ; as being somewhat burdened in&#xD;
spirit he had stopped for no somersets, and had been lured&#xD;
aside by no tempting invitations of a dusty place or a mud-&#xD;
puddle.&#xD;
Faith heard his story gravely and sympathizingly; com-&#xD;
forted him up; encouraged him to hope that the discoverer&#xD;
of America would not prove so adverse to his making dis-&#xD;
coveries another Sunday; gave him a little talk and a good&#xD;
dinner, and sent him home cheerful and determined. The&#xD;
very mood for success; accordingly the next morning after&#xD;
the return from Neanticut, being Sunday, Charles the twelfth&#xD;
presented himself at  the house in brave good time ; and&#xD;
Faith and her little charge, for the first time in their lives&#xD;
both of them, went to Sunday school.  The child very im-&#xD;
portant and expectant; the teacher very gentle and very.&#xD;
grave indeed.&#xD;

&#xD;
Faith had made her arrangements the Sunday before;&#xD;
so she and Charles twelfth proceeded at once to the place&#xD;
assigned her. At the opening services the king of Sweden&#xD;
stared mightily. Faith looked at nothing.   She had a&#xD;
feeling that other children and other teachers were nearer&#xD;
to her than she wished they were ; and she was a little un.&#xD;
certain how best to take hold of the odd little piece of&#xD;
humanity intrusted to her care. However, when the read-&#xD;
ing and the singing.were over Faith began a long low talk&#xD;
to him about some Bible story, diverging as she went on to&#xD;
an account of the other world, and the two ways that lead&#xD;
to it, and the two sorts of people that travel them. And&#xD;
becoming exceedingly interested herself, she fastened the&#xD;
eyes of Charles the twelfth in a way that skewed his&#xD;
thoughts were cleaving to hers. Faith's own thoughts&#xD;
were cleaving elsewhere. The things she said were simply.&#xD;
said; her words were the plainest; her illustrations just at&#xD;
his hand ; but the voice in which they were given would&#xD;
alone have won the ear of a child ;. and whatever other&#xD;
impression her words made upon his mind; the fixed conclu-&#xD;
sion in which he was left at the ending was, that whatever&#xD;
way she was travelling was the right one !&#xD;
It was a beautiful fair first of October; still and sunny;&#xD;
but if it had not, it would probably have been a fair day to&#xD;
Faith after that beginning of it., She.looked as if it was,&#xD;
in the church, and on the way home, and at the quiet din-&#xD;
ner table ; her face was a transcript of the day; still and&#xD;
sunny. It seemed to be true, her promise that the annoy-&#xD;
ance of yesterday would be nothing to her to-day. There&#xD;
was no shadow of it in sight. If there was a shadow any-)&#xD;
where at the table, it was upon Mrs. Derrick,- a half&#xD;
jealous fear that her child would be less hers by becoming&#xD;
a Christian-a half uneasy feeling of the new state of things,&#xD;
did cloud her heart a little, though almost unknown to her-&#xD;
self She would not have confessed to any such cloud-and&#xD;
practically it was not there: no straw of hindrance did she&#xD;
put in Faith's way; indeed she seemed rather fearful of&#xD;
touching the matter in any wise. It was rather from curio-&#xD;
sity than anything else, that she said-as they were both&#xD;
getting ready for afternoon church,&#xD;
"Well child, how did you like going to Sunday school?&#xD;
&#xD;
Faith's answer was subdued, but earnest. "I liked it&#xD;
very mugh, mother."&#xD;
" How many's in your class ?" said. Mrs. Derrick, tying&#xD;
her bonnet.&#xD;
"Only one yet-but 4Tt was enough for me to begin&#xD;
with.-I hope I shall gnome more soon."&#xD;
"Only one I" said M   Derrick-" besides you, do you&#xD;
mean, child ?"&#xD;
"Mother !"-said Faith.    Then smiling she added,&#xD;
"Yes, mother-only one besides me. That one is little&#xD;
Charley Seacomb-and I am trying to teach him."&#xD;
"Why I thought you were in Mr. Linden's class !" said&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick, facing round.&#xD;
But Faith's face flushed, and what was very uncommon&#xD;
with her, the tears came too.&#xD;
"So I am, mother," she said ;-" bub I am one that he&#xD;
teaches at home. I have learned all I know from him,"&#xD;
she said, covering her eyes with both hands.&#xD;
"Why child, hus !" said her mother softly-"I didn't&#xD;
mean to say anything,-how should I know ? So you're&#xD;
teaching Charley Seacomb, hey ?-well I'm sure he wants&#xD;
it bad enough. I guess I'd better go too, next Sabbath,-&#xD;
it was real lonesome with you all gone. And that makes&#xD;
me think, child-I wonder if you could go a little way for&#xD;
me after meeting ?"&#xD;
"Go to Sunday school, mother !" said Faith chewing&#xD;
her bright wet eyes. "Will you teach some children,&#xD;
mother?"&#xD;
Written letters don't give the intonation of these words.&#xD;
"I guess they could teach me, some of 'em," said her&#xD;
mother.. "But I thought maybe, Faith, you'd take Sally&#xD;
Loundes some medicine-she sent word for it, and I don't&#xD;
know as Ican get so far to-day. Mr. Linden does have a&#xD;
class, don't he ?"&#xD;
"I can go just as well as not, and like it very much,&#xD;
mother. 0 yes-he has a class of course-a class of some&#xD;
of the biggest boys-a large class."&#xD;
'I wonder what he does with himself after meeting,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Derrick. "Folks do say he goes strolling round&#xD;
but I don't believe it." 1&#xD;

"Mother ! Folks say everything, I believe. ie knows&#xD;
what he does."&#xD;
"Maybe you wouldn't like to be seen out on Sabbath ?"&#xD;
said Mrs. Derrick, with sudden thought. "Because if you&#xD;
wouldn't, Faith, I'll go myself to Sally's-can or no can."&#xD;
"No, mother-" she said brightly,.-" I would like to go.&#xD;
If I know I am doing right, I don't mind about being seen.&#xD;
I wish people had as good reason for telling tales about&#xD;
me, as they have for some others."&#xD;
"I guess your class 'll fill up,-" said her mother, with&#xD;
her fond, wistful look at the only thing she had in the&#xD;
world.&#xD;
It was the fairest, still, sweet afternoon, when after&#xD;
church Faith got the medicine for Sally Loundes and set&#xD;
out to take it to her. So fair and lovely, that Faith hardly&#xD;
considered much the features of the road she travelled; in&#xD;
that light, any piece of ground was beautiful. The road&#xD;
was very lonely after a little part of the village had been&#xD;
gone through. It left the main street, then bid farewell to&#xD;
a few scattering distant houses and approached what was&#xD;
called Barley Point;-a barren piece of ground from which&#xD;
a beautiful view of the Sound and the ocean line, and per-&#xD;
haps porpoises, could be had. But at the foot of this field&#xD;
the road turned, round the end of that belt of woods spoken&#xD;
of; and getting on the other side of it ran back eastward&#xD;
towards the Lighthouse point. Between the woods and&#xD;
the sea, on this side, was a narrow down that the farmers&#xD;
could make little of; and here the road, if desolate, had a&#xD;
beauty of its own.. On Faith's right was this strip of roll-&#xD;
ing downs, grown with nothing but short grass and low&#xD;
blackberry vines; and close at hand, just beyond its undu-&#xD;
lating line, the waves of the sea beating in. Very little&#xD;
waves to-day, everything was so quiet.&#xD;
At the Lighthouse point, a uile or more on, was a little&#xD;
settlement of fishermen and others; but only one house&#xD;
stood on-the way, and that hardly disturbed the monotony&#xD;
or the solitude ; it was so little, so brown, And looked so&#xD;
of a piece with the barren country. That  Sally Loun-&#xD;
des' house. Faith met nobody till she got  ere.&#xD;
When Faith came out of the house, the sun's place&#xD;
warned her she would have no time to spare to get home.&#xD;
&#xD;
She set off with quicker pace, though lowise concerned&#xD;
about it. There was no danger of anything in Pattaquas.&#xD;
set. But she had gone only a little part of her wild home.&#xD;
ward way when she met Mr. Simlins. Now Mr. Simlins&#xD;
was accustomed to take an afternoon Sunday stroll and&#xD;
sometimes a long one; so it was no matter of surprise to&#xD;
meet him, nor even to meet him there, for Mr. Simlins was&#xD;
as independent in his choice of a walk as in everything else.&#xD;
But he was surprised.&#xD;
"Hullo! my passenger pigeon," he exclaimed. "Why&#xD;
are you here all alone, in this unfrequent place ?"&#xD;
"It's a very nice place,".said with. "And it's not dis-&#xD;
agreeable to be alone-though I am willing to meet you,&#xD;
Mr. Simlins."&#xD;
"Haven't been quarrelling with anybody, have you?"&#xD;
"No," said Faith, giving an amused look to this view of&#xD;
the subject. "Do I look quarrelsome, Mr. Simlins ?"&#xD;
"I don't know how you look !" said the farmer. "I&#xD;
aint anything of an exposition. You'll have to ask some-&#xD;
body else. There's some words too hard for me to spell&#xD;
and pro-nounce. Where have you been ?"&#xD;
"Just to carry Sally Loundes some medicine mother had&#xD;
for her."&#xD;
"Where are you goin' now ?"&#xD;
"Home."&#xD;
"Goin' alone ?"&#xD;
"Why, yes. Why not ?"&#xD;
"Don' know," said Mr. Simlins,-"only I'm going part&#xD;
way, and I'll see nothin' happens to you as long as I'm in&#xD;
your consort."&#xD;
It was a wild place enough to make company pleas-&#xD;
ant. Dark clumps of forest-trees on one hand grew near&#xD;
together, and the spaces between, though cleared, looked&#xD;
hardly less wild; for vines and sumach and ferns had&#xD;
taken possession. The sun's rays yet lay warm on the&#xD;
rolling downs, the sere grass and the purplish blackberry&#xD;
vines, and sparkled on the waves beyond ; but when Mr.&#xD;
Simlins and Faith struck into the woods for a 'short cut,'&#xD;
the shadowy solitude closed'them in on all sides. Softly&#xD;
their steps moved over the fallen pine leaves, or rustled&#xD;
through the shreds of autumn finery that lay beneath oak&#xD;
&#xD;

S&#xD;
&#xD;
and maple, and nothing else but birds and squirrels broke&#xD;
the stillness till they were near the further edge of the wood,&#xD;
There they heard a soft murmur of voices.&#xD;
"Who lives here ?" said Mr. Simlins.&#xD;
But Faith held her breath.&#xD;
" There's mortality here, where I thought there was&#xD;
nothing but animals and vegetation," said Mr. Simlins step.&#xD;
ping softly and cautiously forward.  "Let's see-don't&#xD;
make no noise more'n the leaves 'll let you. I shouldn't&#xD;
think anything would come to a meetin' here but a wood-&#xD;
chuck-and they're skeered if they see a shadow."&#xD;
On that side the trees ceased abruptly, and the open&#xD;
sunshine of a little clearing replaced them; and there were&#xD;
the speakers.&#xD;
Tallest among the group sat Mr. Linden, and around&#xD;
him-in various attitudes of rest or attention-a dozen&#xD;
boys basked in the sunshine. Most of them were a size&#xD;
.or two smaller than his morning class at the Sunday&#xD;
school, though several of those were stretched on the&#xD;
grass at the outskirts of the circle,. as honorary members.&#xD;
Little Johnny Fax, established in Mr. Linden's lap, di-&#xD;
vided his attention pretty evenly between the lesson and&#xD;
the teacher; though indeed to his mind the separate in-&#xD;
terests did not clash.&#xD;
The little glade was very green still, but sprinkled&#xD;
with the autumn leaves which. came floating down at&#xD;
every breath; and the bordering trees stood some in&#xD;
deep green hemlock and. some in paler pine, and thrust&#xD;
out here and there a glowing arm into the sunlight. The&#xD;
boys-listening and looking,--some playing the part of&#xD;
young Nebuchadnezzars, some picking and breaking up the&#xD;
asters and golden rod within their reach,-giving little side&#xD;
nods of assent to each other, or bending a more earnest&#xD;
gaze on Mr. Linden; pushing back their caps-or pulling&#xD;
them down with a quick brush across the eyes;--the hand&#xD;
with which Johnny Fax stroked back from 'Mr. Linden's&#xD;
forehead any stray lock of hair which the wind displaced,&#xD;
or laid on his shoulder when there was nothing else to do;-&#xD;
mad altogether a picture the like of which Mt. Simlins&#xD;
hanot seen bef'ore-nor even Faith. The sun might leave&#xD;
clearing and betake itself to the tree-tops, and thence&#xD;
&#xD;
to the clouds,--there was light there which came from a&#xD;
higher source.&#xD;
Not Faith's silent attention was more silent and motion-&#xD;
less than that of her companion; he did not move or stir.&#xD;
But) er deep, deep, rapt gravity formed part of the subject&#xD;
is contemplations, for one or two keen sidelong glances&#xD;
fell upon it. Else, his eyes were busy uninterruptedly with&#xD;
the scene and took in the whole effect of it; hers hardly&#xD;
wavered from one point.&#xD;
A little stir among the boys roused both the lookers-on&#xD;
from their muse; but they stood still again at the first.&#xD;
notes of a hymn-as Mr. Linden's deep voice began, and&#xD;
the young choir with its varied treble chimed in.&#xD;
"I want to be an angel,&#xD;
And with the angels stand,&#xD;
A crown upon my forehead,&#xD;
Aharp within my hand;&#xD;
There, right before my Saviour,&#xD;
So glorious and so bright,&#xD;
I'd wake the sweetest music,&#xD;
And praise him day and night.&#xD;
"I never should e weary,&#xD;
Nor eve   ed a tear,&#xD;
Nor ever now a sorrow,&#xD;
Nor ever feel a fear;&#xD;
But blessed, pure, and'holy,&#xD;
I'd dwell in Jesus' sight,&#xD;
And with ten thousand thousand&#xD;
Praise him both day and night.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I know I'm weak and sinful,&#xD;
But Jesus will forgive,&#xD;
For many little children,&#xD;
Have gone to heavn to live.&#xD;
Dear Saviour, when I languish,&#xD;
And lay me down to die,&#xD;
Oh send a shining angel&#xD;
To bear me to the sky!&#xD;
"Oh there I'll be an angel,&#xD;
And with the angels stand !&#xD;
A crown upon my forehead,&#xD;
A harp within my hand.&#xD;

The two listeners stood still while the hymn was singing,&#xD;
still as the air; but Mr. Simlins got' no more sight of&#xD;
Faith's face. They stood still when the hymn was finished,&#xD;
as if they lingered where the last vibrations had been. But&#xD;
as a general stir among the hymn party proclaimed that&#xD;
they would soon be on the move, the twQ who had watched&#xD;
them, as if by consent, turned short about and. silently&#xD;
picked their way back through the darkening wood to the&#xD;
nearest point of road they could reach. It was far from&#xD;
home, and even out of the wood the light was failing; they&#xD;
walked with quick steps. Mr. Simlins could get glances&#xD;
now at Faith's face, but though it was quiet enough, he&#xD;
seemed for some reason or other in a disagreeable state of&#xD;
mind.  It made itself manifest at length in a grunt of con-&#xD;
siderable power.&#xD;
"Ugh !--this is a complexions sort of a world to live&#xD;
in !"--was his not very clear remark. The contrast of the&#xD;
tone of the next words was striking.&#xD;
"Dear Mr. Simlins, there is something better."&#xD;
"What do you call me 'dear' for ?" growled he. "You&#xD;
never did before."&#xD;
"I don't know," said Faith.  "Because I want you to&#xD;
be as happy as Iam."&#xD;
"Be you so happy ?"~said the farmer inquisitively..&#xD;
Faith said yes. It was a calm and clear yes; a confident&#xD;
yes; one that felt its foundations strong and deep; yet&#xD;
Faith's mother or dearest friend, if gifted with quick ap-&#xD;
prehensions, would hardly have been satisfied with it. Was&#xD;
Mr. Simlins so gifted?&#xD;
"Not so happy you couldn't be happier ?" he said in a&#xD;
tone that assumed it.&#xD;
"No," said Faith, looking at him with a sunshiny smile;&#xD;
I want to be better, Mr. Simlins."&#xD;
"Better 1"-growled Mr. Simlins. "You go hang your-&#xD;
self_!.-I wish you'was better.  If you aint happy.-.I wish&#xD;
the Simlins' may be--an extant race In"          -&#xD;
The extraordinary combination of wishes in this speech&#xD;
&#xD;
took away Faith's breath for an answer. She waited for&#xD;
imething more.&#xD;
"What was that fellow doing there ?" growled the&#xD;
farmer after a while.&#xD;
"I suppose he was teaching Sunday school," Faith said&#xD;
after a little hesitation.&#xD;
"Why, is one to be forever teaching Sunday school ?"&#xD;
said the farmer in a discontented tone.&#xD;
"Why not ?" said Faith,-"as long as there are people&#xD;
to be taught ?"&#xD;
"Don't you want to take hold and teach me now ?" said&#xD;
Mr. Simlins.&#xD;
Faith did not know at all what to make of this question;&#xD;
and before she had found an answer that would do, she was&#xD;
saved making any. For Mr. Linden, with even brisker&#xD;
steps than theirs, came up behind them; and after a bright&#xD;
"Good evening, Mr. Simlins," uttered a somewhat sur-&#xD;
prised "Miss Faith !"&#xD;
"Yes," said Mr. Simlins, "here she is; and I'm goin'.&#xD;
along to see that nothing happens to her. She goes to&#xD;
take care o' somebody else,--and I come after to take care&#xD;
o' her; so we go. We all give each other a deal o' trouble&#xD;
in this world !"&#xD;
"Am I expected toy take care of you, Mr. Simlins, by&#xD;
the same rule ?--I came after."&#xD;
"Well ! -I don't know," said the farmer "I guess&#xD;
there'll be nobody to take care of me. I'm past' taking&#xD;
care of."&#xD;
"What does-that mean ?" said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"How would you like the job ?" said Mr. Simlins.&#xD;
"Think it 'ud be easy?"&#xD;
"Why I should like to know a little more about the job&#xD;
before I express any opinion."&#xD;
"I have an opinion," said Mr. Simlins,"that you don't&#xD;
know much o' farming. Ghess it's correct, aint it ?"&#xD;
"What kind of farming ?" inquired Mr. Linden again.&#xD;
"I don't know more'n one kind. Tillin' the earth, to&#xD;
bring out the produce of it."&#xD;
"I have seen something of another kind,"'said Mr. Lin.&#xD;
den; "it is this :-' Sow to yourselves in righteousness,&#xD;
reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time&#xD;

to seek the Lord, till he return and rain righteousness upon&#xD;
you.'".&#xD;
Mr. Simlins wasn't quick to answer that, and there was&#xD;
silence for a minute or two, only broken by their footsteps.&#xD;
" Well-" he said slowly at length,-" suppos'n a piece&#xD;
o' ground bears as good a crop as it has soil for, hadn't&#xD;
you ought to be contented with it ?"&#xD;
"Yes," said Mr. Linden; "but I never saw such a piece&#xD;
of ground, yet."&#xD;
Mr. Simlins paused.&#xD;
" Do you believe some folks can be better than they air&#xD;
already ?" he asked.&#xD;
'I believe all folks can."&#xD;
"You believe in cameras, then. How're you goin' to&#xD;
work ?"&#xD;
"To make people better ?-set them to work for them-&#xD;
selves, if I can."&#xD;
"What sort o' ploughs and harrows would you want 'em&#xD;
.to take hold of?"&#xD;
"They'll find out, when they set to work in earnest to&#xD;
make the ground yield the right sort of fruit," said Mr.&#xD;
Linden.&#xD;
"What do you call the right sort ?" said the farmer, now&#xD;
thoroughly engaged. "Aint as good as a man can do, the&#xD;
right sort?"&#xD;
"Why yes," said Mr. Linden again, "but I tell you I&#xD;
fever saw that sort of fruit ripe-and I'm not sure that I&#xD;
ever shall in this world. For the best fruit that the ground&#xD;
can yield, includes not only the best seed and cultivation,&#xD;
but the perfect keeping down of every weeA, and the un-&#xD;
checked receiving of all sweet heavenly influences."&#xD;
"That's a camera !" said Mr. Simlins something shortly.,&#xD;
"You can't have all that in this world."&#xD;
"The fact that people cannot be perfect in this world,&#xD;
does not hinder their being better than they are."&#xD;
"Well, I say, how're you goin' to work to make it, when&#xD;
they're doin' the .best they can do, already ?"&#xD;
"'Who is?"&#xD;
"I am inclined to be of the opinion you air," said Mr.&#xD;
Simlins slowly. "I won't say I be-but I don't know how&#xD;
to do no better."&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Thank you, Mr. Simlinsi-" was the somewhat sorrowful&#xD;
reply,-"you may see what I do, but you do not see what&#xD;
I know. And for you, my friend-pray to know !---there&#xD;
can be no mistakes in the advice that comes from heaven."&#xD;
There was a minute's silence, till they came to a turning.&#xD;
"I'd be glad tQ see you," said Mr. Simlins in a somewhat&#xD;
lowered tone,-"ary one of you-down to my house, any&#xD;
time. You can take care of her the rest of the way.&#xD;
Good night !"-&#xD;
He turned off abruptly down a road that led his way.&#xD;
They had been walking with slackened steps during this&#xD;
conversation, and the lingering memory.of it still checked&#xD;
the pace of the two now left together:&#xD;
"Silence accompanied; for beast and bird.&#xD;
They to their grassy couch, these to their nests,"&#xD;
had all retreated. And when Mr. Linden spoke it was&#xD;
not in his own words.&#xD;
'"'I thank thee, uncreated Sun,&#xD;
That thy bright beams on me have shined&#xD;
I thank thee, who hast overthrown&#xD;
My foes, and healed my wounded mind !&#xD;
I thank thee, whose enlivening voice&#xD;
Bids my freed heart in thee rejoice!&#xD;
3 "'Thee will I love, my joy, my crown!&#xD;
f3f             Thee will I love, my Lord, my God!d&#xD;
Thee will I love-beneath thy frown&#xD;
J Or smile, thy sceptre or thy rod!&#xD;
s What though my flesh and heart decay,&#xD;
Thee shall I love in endless day'!&#xD;
The silence of the evening fell again unbroken. Unless&#xD;
a breath caught somewhat interruptedly.so gentle a&#xD;
break-might be said to break it. Faith said nothing,&#xD;
except by that caught breath. Mr. Linden's step was the&#xD;
only one heard.  Silently then he gave her his arm, and&#xD;
they went on at a quicker pace.&#xD;
After a while Faith broke the silence. She spoke in a&#xD;
very quiet voice ; as if choosing her words; and hesitated&#xD;
a little sometimes as if timidity checked her.&#xD;
"Mr. Linden, I want to ask you about something that&#xD;
troubles me--I don't know what is right. I know I know&#xD;
Very little-I know I cannot say much or can't say it well&#xD;

« JT occurs to me, Parson Somers," said that gentle-&#xD;
- man's lady wife, as she salted and sugared his morn-&#xD;
ing bowl of porridge; "it 'occurs to me, that Pattaquasset&#xD;
is getting stirred up with a long pole."&#xD;
"Ah, my dear ?" said Mr. Somers-" 'Stirred up.' Well&#xD;
-what makes you think so?"&#xD;
"Why-" said Mrs. 'Somers tasting the porridge--"Jen-&#xD;
ny! fetch some more milk. How do you suppose Mr.&#xD;
Somers is going to eat such thick stuff as that ?-and when&#xD;
do you suppose he is going to get his breakfast, at this&#xD;
rate? If you let your head run upon Jem Waters in this&#xD;
style, Jenny, I shall forbid him the house. I always notice&#xD;
that the day after he's been here Mr. Somers' porridge is&#xD;
too thick."&#xD;
"Well, my dear," said the parson,-" ha-the porridge&#xD;
will do very well.' I thought you were speaking of Patta-&#xD;
quasset when you spoke of something being 'stirred up.&#xD;
"So I was," said the lady, while Jenny blushing beyond&#xD;
her ordinary peonic hue, ran about in the greatest confu-&#xD;
sion, catching up first the water pitcher and then the mo-&#xD;
lasses cup.  "'Do very well ?'-no, indeed it won't !--but&#xD;
men never know anything about housekeeping."&#xD;
"Well, my dear, but about Pattaquasset? - I know&#xD;
something about Pattaquasset. Is there any trouble in the&#xD;
village ? It's a very peaceable place," continued Mr&#xD;
Somers, looking at his distant breakfast dish,-" always&#xD;
was-ha-I wish you'd let me have my porridge. Is there&#xD;
any trouble, my dear ?"&#xD;
" an't tell,-" said Mrs. Somers, adding critical drops&#xD;
of   ,-   see for yourself, Mr. Somers. If there isn't,&#xD;
there may be.-One set of things is at sixes, and another&#xD;
at sevens. There--that's better, though it's about as far&#xD;
from perfection as I am."&#xD;
"We're none of us perfect, and so-ha-my dear, we&#xD;
can't blame the porridge," said Mr. Somers with slight&#xD;

jocularity which pleased at least himself.  "But Patta.&#xD;
quasset is about as near the impossible state as most places,&#xD;
that I know. What have you heard of, Mrs. Somers? You&#xD;
deal in rather-a--enigmatical construction, this morning."&#xD;
"Who said I had, heard anything ?" said the lady,-"I&#xD;
only said, use your eyes, Mr. Somers,.-open your -study&#xD;
window and let the light in. Just see what a rumpus&#xD;
we've had about the school, to begin."&#xD;
"Ha! my dear,". said Mr. Somers, "if opening the win-&#xD;
dow of my study is going to let trouble, come in, I'd rather&#xD;
--ha-keep it shut! Judge llarrison~thiiks the teacher&#xD;
is a very fine man-and I've no doubt he is!-and the.&#xD;
Judge is going to give him a great celebration. I have no.&#xD;
doubt we shall all enjoy it. I think the disturbance that&#xD;
has been made will not give Mr. Linden any more&#xD;
trouble."&#xD;
"Why who cares about his trouble ?" said Mrs. Somers&#xD;
rather briskly,-" I dare say he's very good, Mr. Somers,&#xD;
but I shan't fret over him. I'm not sure but he's a little&#xD;
too good for my liking-I'm not sure that it's quite natural.&#xD;
Jenny! fetch some more biscuit !-how long do you sup-&#xD;
pose Mr. Somers and I can live upon one ?"&#xD;
Parson Somers eat porridge and studied the philosophy&#xD;
of Mrs. Somers' statements.&#xD;
"My dear," said he at length,-"I am not sure that you&#xD;
are correct in your view-indeed it seems to me-a-rather&#xD;
contradictory. I don't know what the stir is about; and I&#xD;
don't think there is any occasion, my dear, for you-a-to&#xD;
fret, about anything. Not about Mr. Linden, certainly.&#xD;
The disaffection to the new school was-a-confined to&#xD;
very few! I don't think it has taken root in the public&#xD;
mind generally. You will be better able to form a judg-&#xD;
ment on Thursday."&#xD;
"Bless your heart ! Mr. Somers," said his wife, "what's&#xD;
Thursday tQ do?' If you think I've said all I could say---&#xD;
why there's no help for it. Now there's Sam Deacon--&#xD;
don't come to meeting half the time lately,--and to match&#xD;
that, Faith Derrick walks into Sunday school with one of&#xD;
those Seacomb children tagging after her."&#xD;
"Well," said Mr. Somers looking exceedingly mystified,&#xD;
-" what's the harm in that ? If Miss Faith chooses to do&#xD;
&#xD;
it, it shews, I am sure, a-a charitable disposition,-praise-&#xD;
worthy !1&#xD;
"Mr. Somers !"-said the lady.  "Is it possible you can&#xD;
think for one moment that I mean what you mean? If she&#xD;
came to Society too, I should know what to make of it, but&#xD;
when people work alongside of some folks, and not along-&#xD;
side of others, why it's as long as it's broad. Then Maria&#xD;
iDavids says she drove those boys over to Neanticut 'tother&#xD;
day-or helped drive 'em. What do you think of that,&#xD;
Mr. Somers ?"&#xD;
Mr. Somers looked as if his wife was too fast for him..&#xD;
"My dear," said he however, plucking up,-" I think I&#xD;
would trust Faith Derrick as soon as Maria Davids, or-.&#xD;
any other young lady in Pattaquasset! If she. did go to&#xD;
Neanticut I presume it was all as it should be. Squire&#xD;
Deacon never was-a-very remarkable for being a reli-&#xD;
gious man or anything like that; and you can't help folks&#xD;
working alongside of each other-they will do it," said Mr.&#xD;
Somers relapsing into his-jocular mood. "I am a man of&#xD;
peace, my dear, and you should be a woman of peace."&#xD;
"Why you don't suppose I believed what Maria Davids&#xD;
said ?" replied. Mrs. Somers. "Her words are not worth&#xD;
their weight. in gold-and she isn't a bit too good to be&#xD;
jealous. But the thing is, if Faith didn't do that, what&#xD;
did she do?  Jenny! fetch in the tub of hot water, And be&#xD;
spry !&#xD;
With Jenny and the hot water walked in a somewhat&#xD;
rough-looking boy, who declared without much ceremony,&#xD;
beyond doffing his cap, that "'ma sent him to find out where&#xD;
the sewin' meetin' was to be this week."&#xD;
"Who are you ?" said Mrs.,Somers, dipping a cup in the&#xD;
hot water and wiping it with a 'spryness' that was quite&#xD;
imposing. "Is your name Bill Wright ?"&#xD;
"No 'taint," said the boy. "Guess again."&#xD;
"You'll never pay anybody for much trouble that way,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Somers dipping in the corresponding saucer.&#xD;
"Jenny-did you ever hear of anybody's getting along in&#xD;
a dish-tub without a mop ?"&#xD;
"Who is it wants to know, sir ?" said Mr. Somers po--&#xD;
litely. "Who is your father ?"&#xD;
"He's farmer Davids."&#xD;

"Oh! and are you Phil ?"&#xD;
"Yes ! What be I goin' to tell her ?"-This interroga.&#xD;
story being sent in the direction of the dish-tub.&#xD;
"Why you can tell her two things," said Mrs. Somers,&#xD;
eying. Phil from head to foot. "In the first place, the So.&#xD;
eiety'l1 meet down at Miss Bezac's; and in the second, as&#xD;
soon as your mother'll teach her children how to behave&#xD;
themselves I shall be very glad tosee them."&#xD;
"The Society'll meet down to Miss Purcell's ?"&#xD;
"  iss Bezac's"- said Mrs. Somers, preserving a cheer.&#xD;
ful a d brisk equanimity in the midst of her sharp words that&#xD;
wa quite elightful. "Pay more attention to your lessons,&#xD;
P i1 D ,ids, and you'll be a better boy, if you look sharp."&#xD;
"What lessons ?" said the boy blackly.&#xD;
"All you get-at home and abroad. You go to school&#xD;
I ny," replied Mrs. Somers.&#xD;
The boy glanced towards the clock and began to move&#xD;
off, answering by actions rather than wards.&#xD;
"You were over at Neanticut, I suppose, Saturday,"&#xD;
said. Mr. Somers affably. To which the answer was a&#xD;
choked and unwilling 'yes.'&#xD;
"Well who drove you over?"&#xD;
"He druv," said Phil. "I'm going..--'&#xD;
"And the ladies--weren't there ladies along?"&#xD;
"Yes-They druv too."&#xD;
"Did you have a fine time ?" said Mrs. Somers.&#xD;
"Yes! I did," said Phil very gloomily.&#xD;
"Why what did you do more than the rest ?"&#xD;
"I didn't do nothing !" said Phil, blurting out,-"and&#xD;
he went and took all my nuts away. He's the devil-!"&#xD;
The boy looked at the minute as if he was a young one.&#xD;
"Hush, hush !" said Mr. Somers. "Yoq.---you opghtn't&#xD;
to speak that way-don't you know? it's not proper."&#xD;
"I hope he boxed your ears first," said Mrs. Somers-....r&#xD;
"I'm c 'n you deserved it. What made him take your&#xD;
nuts away "&#xD;
"He w   ted 'em to make a present to you".-said the&#xD;
boy; and with another glance at the hands of the clock, he&#xD;
darted out of the house and down the road towards the&#xD;
schoolhouse, as if truly he had expected to meet there the&#xD;
character he had mentioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
"My dear-" said Mr. Somers --" do you think it is&#xD;
quite-a--.politic, to tell Mrs. Davids she don't bring up&#xD;
her children right? Mrs. Davids is a very respectable&#xD;
N woman-and so is Farmer Davids-none more so."&#xD;
S   "I don't know what you call respectable women-" said&#xD;
Mrs. Somers-" I should be sorry to think he was. But I&#xD;
just wish, Mr. Somers, that you would preach a sermon to&#xD;
the people about cutting off their children's tongues if they&#xD;
can't keep them in order. I declare! I could hardly keep&#xD;
hands off that boy."&#xD;
And with this suggested and suggestive text, Mr. Somers&#xD;
retired to his study.&#xD;
It had been a busy day with more than Mr. Somers,&#xD;
when towards the close of the afternoon Faith came out&#xD;
upon the porch of her mother's house. She had not read&#xD;
more than one delicious bit of her letter on the ride home&#xD;
from Neanticut; the light failed too soon. After getting&#xD;
$ home there was no more chance. Saturday night, that&#xD;
Saturday, had a crowd of affairs. And Monday had been&#xD;
a day full of business. Faith had got through with it all&#xD;
.at last; and now, as fresh as if the kitchen had been a&#xD;
bygone institution-though that was as true of Faith in the&#xD;
kitchen as out of it-she sat down in the afternoon glow&#xD;
to read the letter.. The porch was nice to match; she took&#xD;
a low seat on the step, and laying the letter in her lap&#xD;
rested her elbow on the yellow floor of the porch to take it&#xD;
at full ease.&#xD;
It was not just such a letter as is most often found in&#xD;
biographies,-yet such as may be found-' out of print.'&#xD;
A bright medley of description and fancy-mountains and&#xD;
legends and scraps of song forming a mosaic of no set pat-&#xD;
tern. And well-read as the writer was in other respects, it&#xD;
was plain that she was also learned in both the books Faith&#xD;
had had at Neanticut. The quick flow of the letter was&#xD;
only checked now and then by a little word-gesture of affec-&#xD;
tion,-if that could be called a check, which gave to the&#xD;
written pictures a better glow than lup the originals.&#xD;
It was something to see Faith read that letter -or&#xD;
would have been, if anybody had been i there to look.. She&#xD;
leaned over it in a sort of breathless abstraction, catching&#xD;
her breath a little sometimes in a way that told of the in-&#xD;

terest at work. The interest was not merely what would&#xD;
have belonged to the letter for any reader,-it was not&#xD;
merely the interest that attached to the writer of it, nor to&#xD;
the person for whom it was written; it was not only the&#xD;
interest deep and great which Faith felt in the subjects and&#xD;
objects spoken of in the letter. All these wrou ght with&#xD;
their full power; but all these were not enough t account&#xD;
for the intent and intense feeling with which Faith bent&#xD;
over that letter, with eyes that never wavered, and a cheek&#xD;
in which the blood mounted to a bright flush. And when&#xD;
it was done, even then she sat still leaning over the paper,&#xD;
looking not at it but through it.&#xD;
A little shower of fringed gentian and white Ladies'&#xD;
tresses came patting down upon the letter, hiding its deli-&#xD;
cate blhek ma s with their own dailty faces.&#xD;
"These are our means of transport back to Pattaquas.&#xD;
set," said Mr. Linden. Faith lookedup, and rose up.&#xD;
"1I had come back," she said, drawing one of those half&#xD;
long breaths as she folded up and gave him the letter. "I&#xD;
can't thank you, Mr. Linden."&#xD;
"I thought you were not reading, or I should not have&#xD;
ventured such an interruption. But I am in no hurry for&#xD;
the letter, Miss Faith. How do you like Italy ?"&#xD;
"I like it-" said Faith doubtfilly,.-" I don't know it-&#xD;
Mr. Linden," she went on with sce difficulty and flushing&#xD;
yet more,-"some time, will you   11 me in what books I&#xD;
can find out about those things ?-those things the letter&#xD;
speaks of."&#xD;
"-Those which concern Italy, do you mean ? I can ar-&#xD;
range an Italy shelf for you up stairs-but I am afraid I&#xD;
have not very much here to put on it."&#xD;
"No indeed !" said Faith looking half startled,--"I&#xD;
didn't mean to give you trouble-only some time, tif you&#xD;
would tellme what books-perhaps-"&#xD;
"Perhaps what ?" he said smiling, -" perhaps I&#xD;
wouldn't ?"&#xD;
"No," she said, "I mean, perhaps you would; and per-&#xD;
haps I could get them and read them. I feel I don't know&#xD;
anything."&#xD;
That Faith felt it was very plain. She had that rare&#xD;
beauty----a soft eye. I do not mean the grace of insipidity,&#xD;
&#xD;
' nor the quality of mere form and colour; but the full lus-&#xD;
1; trous softness that speaks a character strong in the founda.&#xD;
tions of peace and sweetness. Many an eye can be soft by&#xD;
a turns and upon- occasion; it is rarely that you see one&#xD;
where sweetness and strength have met together to make&#xD;
that the abiding characteristic. The gentleness of such an&#xD;
eye has always strength to back it. Weakness could never&#xD;
be so steadfast; poverty could not be so rich. And Faith's&#xD;
eye shewed both its qualities now.&#xD;
Mr. Linden merely repeated, "I will arrange it for you-&#xD;
and you can take the books in what order you like. Per-&#xD;
haps I can send you another journey when they are ex-&#xD;
hausted," ha added, turning the letter softly about, as if&#xD;
the touch were pleasant to him. She stood looking at it.&#xD;
"I don't know how to thank you for letting gne read&#xD;
that," she said. "It would be foolish in me to tell you how&#xD;
beautiful I thought it.&#xD;
"She is-" her brother said, with a tender, half smiling&#xD;
half grave expression. And for a minute or two he was&#xD;
silent-then spoke abruptly.&#xD;
"Miss Faith, what have you done with your 'Philosophe'?&#xD;
You know, though the rooms in the great Temple of Know-&#xD;
:: ledge be so many that no one can possibly explore them all,&#xD;
yet the more keys we have in hand the better. For some&#xD;
locks yield best to an English key, some to a French; and&#xD;
it is often pleasant to take a look where one cannot go in&#xD;
and dwell."&#xD;
She flushed a good deal, with eyes downcast as she stood&#xD;
before him; then answered, with that odd little change of&#xD;
her voice which told of some mental check.&#xD;
"I haven't done anything with it, Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"That requires explanation."&#xD;
"It isn't so hard as one of your puzzles," she said smil-&#xD;
ing.  "I mean to do something with it, Mr. Linden, if I&#xD;

I didn't know enough to begin-to learn that yet."&#xD;
"What other key are you forging?"&#xD;
"What other key ?" said Faith.&#xD;
"I mean," he answered with a tone that slpr.ed a little&#xD;
fear of going too far, "what do you want th~earn before&#xD;
that ?"&#xD;

"I don't know," said Faith humbly.-" I suppose, Eng.&#xD;
lish. It was a grammar of yours, Mr. Linden, a French&#xD;
grammar, that I was looking at ; and I found I couldn't&#xD;
understand what it was about, anywhere.  So I thought I&#xD;
must learn something else first."&#xD;
"Never was philosopher so put in a corner!" said Mr.&#xD;
Linden. "Suppose you take up him and the dictionary&#xD;
and let me be the grammar-do you think you could under.&#xD;
stand what I was about&#xD;
The blood leapt to her cheek; part of her answer Faith&#xD;
had no need to put in words, even if he had not seen her&#xD;
eyes, which he did. The words were not in any hurry to&#xD;
come.&#xD;
" When you have been teaching all day already "--she&#xD;
s 'd in a tone between regretful and self-reproving. "It&#xD;
wo dn't be right."&#xD;
"Mayn't I occasionally do wrong ?-just for variety's&#xD;
sake !"&#xD;
"You may---nd I don't doubt you would.  I was~hink.&#xD;
ing of my ow part."&#xD;
"I am glad you don't say you have no doubt I do," saidV&#xD;
Mr. Linden. "I suppose you mean that I would if suffi.&#xD;
cient temptation came up, which of course jtnever has."&#xD;
Faith looked an instant, and then her gravity broke up.&#xD;
"Ah, but you know what I mean," she said.&#xD;
"You will have to furnish me with a dictionary next,"&#xD;
he said smiling. "Look at my watch-Miss Faith, how&#xD;
can you have tea so late, when, I have been teaching all&#xD;
day ?--it isn't right,-and cuts off one's time for philoso-&#xD;
phizing besides."&#xD;
Faith ran into the house, to tell the truth, with a very&#xD;
pleased face ; and tea was on the table in less time than&#xD;
Cindy could ever understand. But during tea-time Faith&#xD;
looked, furtively, to see if any signswere to 'be found that&#xD;
little Johnny Fax lfid been made to yield up his testimony.&#xD;
Whether he had or no, she could see none; which how-&#xD;
ever, as she justly concluded with herself, proved nothing.&#xD;
The new grammar was far easier understood than the&#xD;
old. Although Mr. Linden unfolded his newspaper, and&#xD;
informed Faith that he intended to read 'uninterruptedly'-.&#xD;
so that she 'need feel no scruple about interrupting him '---&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
yet he probably had the power of reading two things at&#xD;
once; for his assistance was generally given before it was&#xD;
asked. His explanations too, whether Faith knew it or&#xD;
not, covered more ground than the French exigency als-o-&#xD;
lutely required,-he was not picking this lock for her, but&#xD;
giving her the grammar key.&#xD;
But Faith knew it and felt it; and tasted the help thus&#xD;
given, with an appreciation which only it neetled to do all&#xD;
its work; the keen delight of one seeking knowledge, who&#xD;
has never been helped and who has for the first time the&#xD;
right kind of help. Indeed, with the selfishness incident&#xD;
to human nature, she forgot all about Mr. Linden's inten.&#xD;
tion to read uninterruptedly, and took without scruple or&#xD;
question, all the time he bestowed upon her. And it was&#xD;
not till some minutes after she had closed her books, that&#xD;
her low, grateful "You are very good, Mr. Linden !"reached&#xD;
his ear.&#xD;
Now the fact was, that Faith had been much observed&#xD;
that afternoon,-her reading-dream on the steps had been&#xD;
so pretty a thing to see, that when Squire Ieacon had seen&#xD;
it once he came back to see it again; and what number of&#xD;
views he would have taken cannot be told, had he not been&#xD;
surprised by Mr. Linden. Naturally the Squire withdrew,.-..&#xD;
naturally his enlarged mind became contracted as he thought&#xD;
of the cause thereof; and not unnaturally he walked down&#xD;
that way after tea, still further to use his eyes. The house&#xD;
was in a tantalizing state. For though the light curtain&#xD;
was down, it revealed not only the bright glow of the lamp,&#xD;
but one or two shadowy heads; and the window being open&#xD;
(for the evening was warm) low voices, that he loved and&#xD;
that he did not love, came to his ear. Once a puff of&#xD;
wind floated the curtain in-more tantalizing than ever!&#xD;
Squire Deacon couldesee Mr. Linder bending aside to look&#xD;
at something, but what the Squire could not see; for there&#xD;
came the edge of the curtain. In a warm state of mind he,&#xD;
turned his face homewards, proclaiming to himself that he&#xD;
didn't care what they did !-the result of which was, that&#xD;
in ten minutes more he was knocking at Mrs. Derrick's&#xD;
door, and being promptly admitted by Cindy entered the&#xD;
parlour just as Faith had shut up her book and uttered her&#xD;
soft word of thanks.&#xD;

It was something of a transition ! But after a moment's&#xD;
shadow of surprise on her face, Faith came forward and&#xD;
ave the Squire her hand. She would have let him then&#xD;
explain his own errand; but as he did not seem very ready&#xD;
to do that, or to say anything, Faith stepped into the&#xD;
breach.&#xD;
"How is Cecilia, Mr. Deacon? I have not seen her in&#xD;
a long time."&#xD;
" She's firstrate," said the Squire, colouring up; for Mr.&#xD;
Linden's "how do you do again, Squire Deacon ?"'not only&#xD;
implied that they had lately met, but that the occasion was&#xD;
not forgotten.&#xD;
"It's a sort of suffocating evening," added the Squire,&#xD;
wiping his forehead. "I don't recollect so warm an October&#xD;
for a year or two. Cilly's been out of town, Miss Faith,&#xD;
and since she come back she's been complainin' of you."&#xD;
Faith was near saying that she hoped the warm weather&#xD;
would last till Thursday; but she remembered that would&#xD;
not do, and changed her ground.&#xD;
"I am sorry anybody should complain of me. Is that&#xD;
because I didn't go to see her when she was away ?".&#xD;
"I'm sure the rest-of us could have stood it, if you had&#xD;
come when she was gone, Miss Faith," said the Squire&#xD;
gallantly. "Seems to me we haven't seen you down to our&#xD;
house for an age of Sundays."&#xD;
"I will try to come of a week day," said Faith. "I&#xD;
think you never saw me there Sunday, Mr.Deacon."&#xD;
"I suppose an age of Sundays must be seven times as&#xD;
long as any other age," said Mr. Linden. "Isn't that the&#xD;
origin of the phrase, Squire Deacon ?"&#xD;
"Very like," said the Squire -who didn't care to be&#xD;
interrupted. "I don't know much about origa1s,Wh---eln&#xD;
a man has a position to fill, ir,1she can't study knick-knacks.&#xD;
What a handsome book,     iss Faith! such a becoming&#xD;
colour."                /&#xD;
"Don't you like the inside of books too, Mr. Deacon ?"&#xD;
said Faith."te&#xD;
"I daresay I should that one," said the Squire,-al"t&#xD;
outside's like a picture-Or a view, as some people cal it&#xD;
Looks just like a grain field in spring. What's- the nameO&#xD;
of it, Miss Faith ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.             147&#xD;
&#xD;
Half prudently, half wickedly, Faith without, answering&#xD;
took the book from the table and put it in Mr. Deacon's&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
The Squire's face looked like anything but a grain field&#xD;
in spring then-it was more like a stubble in November;&#xD;
for opening the book midway and finding no help there, he&#xD;
turned to the title page and found the only English words&#xD;
in the book, in very legible black ink.&#xD;
"So !" he said-."it's his'n, is it !"&#xD;
"Yes, it is mine," said Mr. Linden,-"almost any man&#xD;
may have so much of a library as that."&#xD;
The Squire glanced suspiciously at Faith, as if he still&#xD;
believed she had something to do, with it; but he did not&#xD;
dare press the matter.&#xD;
"Miss Faith," he said, calling up a smile that was meant&#xD;
to do retrospective work, "have you heard tell of the queer&#xD;
things they've found down to Mattabeeset ?"&#xD;
"What things, Mr. Deacon ?"&#xD;
"Some sort o' bird's been makin' tracks down there,"&#xD;
said the Squire leaning back in his chair, with the look of&#xD;
one who has now got the game in his own hands; "makin'&#xD;
tracks criss-cross round; and they do say the size on 'em&#xD;
might have come out of the ark, for wonder."&#xD;
"How large are they, Mr. Deacon? and what sort of&#xD;
bird is it?"&#xD;
"Well if I was a descendant of Noah, I s'pose I could&#xD;
tell you," said the Squire with increased satisfaction--&#xD;
"I'm sorry I can't, as it is. But if you're curious, Miss&#xD;
Faith (and ladies always is in my experience) I'll drive you&#xD;
down there any day or any time of day. I want to see 'em&#xD;
myself, that's a fact, and so does Cilly. Now Miss Faith,&#xD;
name the day!"&#xD;
The shortest possible smile orf Mr. Linden's face at this&#xD;
sudden and earnest request, did not help Faith to an&#xD;
answer; but the Squire was happily forgetful for they&#xD;
moment that there were more than two people in the&#xD;
room, and leaning towards Faith he repeated,&#xD;
"The sooner the quicker, always, in such cases!1 because&#xD;
Folks can never tell what may happen."&#xD;
"No," said Faith, "they cannot-especially about wea-&#xD;
ther; and I have got some particular work to attend to at&#xD;

home, Mr. Deacon, before the weather changes. I wish you&#xD;
and Cecilia would go down and bring us a report. I should&#xD;
like that. But for the present Mr. Skip and I have some-&#xD;
thing to do."&#xD;
"It's good. you want Mr. Skip, for I don't," said the&#xD;
Squire, stiffening a little. "Is that one of the new-&#xD;
fashioned ways of saying you won't go, Miss Faith ?"&#xD;
"What's your objection to Mr. Skip ?" said Faith plea-&#xD;
santly. "I am glad nobody else wants him, for we do."&#xD;
"Well, I say I'm glad you've got him," said the Squire,'&#xD;
relenting under the power of Faith's voice. "But what&#xD;
ails you Miss Faith, to go tackin' round like one o' them&#xD;
schooners against the wind?  Aint it a straight question&#xD;
as to whether you'll take an excursion to Mattabeeset?"&#xD;
"Very straight," said Faith smiling and speaking gently.&#xD;
"And I thought I gave a straight answer."&#xD;
"Blessed if I can see which road it took !" said Squire&#xD;
Deacon,-"save and except it didn't seem to be the right&#xD;
one. 'No' 's about as ugly a road as a man can foller.&#xD;
Guess I spoke too late, after all," said the Squire medita.&#xD;
tively. "How's your furr'n news, Mr. Linden?   Get it&#xD;
regular?"&#xD;
"Yes-" said Mr. Linden,-"making due allowance for&#xD;
the irregularity of the steamers."&#xD;
Faith look d up in no little astonishment, and took the&#xD;
eye as well as the ear effect of this question and answer;&#xD;
then said quietly,&#xD;
"Have yo4 any business in the post-office, Mr. Dea-&#xD;
con ?"&#xD;
"Not a gr at deal, Miss Faith," said the squire, with a&#xD;
blandness on one side of his face which but poorly set off&#xD;
the other.  "I go down for the paper once a week, and&#xD;
'lection times maybe oftener, but I don't do much in the&#xD;
letter line. Correspondence never was my powder maga-&#xD;
zine.  I shouldn't 'know where to put two or three femi-&#xD;
nine letters a week-if I got 'em."&#xD;
If he had got what somebody wanted to give him at&#xD;
that moment 1-Squire Deacon little knew what risk he'&#xD;
ran, nor how much nearer he was to a powder magazine&#xD;
than he ever had been in his life.&#xD;
"A sure sign that nobody will ever trouble you in that&#xD;
&#xD;
v/   SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
way," Faith said somewhat severely. But the Squire was&#xD;
obtuse.&#xD;
"Well I guess likely," he said, "and it's just as good&#xD;
they don't. I shouldn't care about living so fur from any-&#xD;
body I was much tied up in-or tied up to, neither. I&#xD;
can't guess, for one, how you make out to be contented&#xD;
here, Mr. Linden."&#xD;
"How  do you know that I do, sir ?"&#xD;
There was a little pause at that-it was a puzzling&#xD;
question to answer; not to speak of a slight warning&#xD;
which the Squire received from his instinct. But the&#xD;
pause was pleasantlyended.&#xD;
"Faith !" said a gentle voice in the passage--."open the&#xD;
door, child-I've got both hands full."&#xD;
Which call Mr. Linden appropriated to himself,, and not&#xD;
only opened the door but brought in the great dish of&#xD;
smoking chestnuts. Faith ran away to get plates for the&#xD;
party, with one of which in defiance of etiquette she served&#xD;
first Mr. Linden ; then handed another to the Squire.&#xD;
"I hope they are boiled right, Mr. Linden. Have you&#xD;
seen any chestnuts yet this year, Mr. Deacon ?"&#xD;
"I've seen some---but they warn't good for nothing,"&#xD;
said the Squire rather sourly. "Thank you, Miss Faith,&#xD;
for your plate, but I guess I'll go."&#xD;
"Why stay and eat some chestnuts, Squire Deacon !"&#xD;
said Mrs. Derrick. " Those are Neanticut ch tnuts--&#xD;
firstrate too."&#xD;
"I don't like Neanticut chestnuts-"said Squire Deacon&#xD;
rising--"never did,-they're sure to be wormy. Good&#xD;
night, Miss Faith-good night, Mr. Linden. Mrs. Der-&#xD;
rick, this room's hot enough to roast eggs."&#xD;
"Why the windows are open !" said Mrs. Derrick-..&#xD;
"and we might have had the curtains drawn back, too, but&#xD;
I always feel as if some one was looking in."&#xD;
Which remark did not delay the Squire's departure, and&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick followed him to the door, talking all the way.&#xD;
During which little 'passage' Faith's behaviour again&#xD;
transcended all rules. For she stood before the dish of&#xD;
chestnuts, fingering one or two, with a somewhat unsteady&#xD;
motion of the corners of her mouth; and then put both&#xD;

&#xD;
her hands to her face and laughed, her low but very merri-&#xD;
ment-speaking laugh.&#xD;
"Miss Faith," Mr. Linden said, "I think Job was an ex-&#xD;
traordinary man !-and the chestnuts are not so bad as&#xD;
they are reported, after all."&#xD;
Faith became grave, and endeavoured to make trial of the&#xD;
chestnuts, without making any answer.&#xD;
"Child," said, Mrs. Derrick returning, "I don't think the&#xD;
Squire felt just comfortable-I xpnder if he's well ?"&#xD;
Which remark brought do n the house.&#xD;
"By the way-" said Mr. Linden looking up,-" did you&#xD;
lose a bow of ribband fr m your sunbonnet, the other day at&#xD;
Neanticut ?"&#xD;
Faith owned to having lost it somewhere.&#xD;
"I found it somewhere-" said Mr. Linden with a rather&#xD;
peculiar look, as he took out the bow of ribband.&#xD;
"Where did you find it, Mr. Linden?"&#xD;
"I found it here-in Pattaquasset."&#xD;
"Where ?"&#xD;
But he shook his head at the question.&#xD;
"I think I will not tell you-you may lose it again.&#xD;
And all Faith's efforts could get no more from him.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
HE Thursday of the great school celebration arrived;&#xD;
and according to Faith's unexpressed wish, the&#xD;
weather had continued warm. It was the very luxury of&#xD;
October. A day for all the senses to disport themselves&#xD;
and revel in luxurious beauty. But the mind of Patta-.&#xD;
quasset was upon the evening's revel, and upon the beauty&#xD;
of white cambric and blue ribbands. The mind of Faith&#xD;
Derrick was on somewhat else.&#xD;
"Mother," she said, "do you know there must be a fire&#xD;
up in Mr. Linden's room as soon as the weather gets cold?"&#xD;
"Of course, child."&#xD;
"Well there is nothing in the world up there to put&#xD;
wood in."&#xD;
"It used to lie on the floor-" said Mrs. Derrick, as if&#xD;
the past might possibly help the future. " That does make&#xD;
"It's not going to lie on the floor now," said Faith. "I&#xD;
am going to get Mr. Skip to make me a box, a large box,&#xD;
with a top-and I will cover it with some carpet or dark&#xD;
stuff, if you'll give me some, mother. It must be dark, be-&#xD;
cause the wood of the room is. I am going to stuff .the&#xD;
top for a seat, and it will look very nice."&#xD;
"Anything does that you take hold of," said her mother.&#xD;
'Yes, child, I'll give you all I've got,-you can look for&#xD;
yourself and take what you like best."&#xD;
The immediate work of the day was to 'clear ship'-in&#xD;
-other words, to do all the-day's wbrk in the former part&#xD;
thereof, so as to leave time for the unwonted business of&#xD;
the afternoon. Mrs. Derrick even proposed that Faith&#xD;
should get dressed. But Faith said there was time enough&#xD;
after dinner; and that meal was gone through with as&#xD;
usual.&#xD;
With this slight variation in the table talk. Mr. Linden&#xD;
suggested to Faith the propriety of philosophizing a little,&#xD;
(151)&#xD;
&#xD;

:&#xD;
&#xD;
as a preparative for the dissipation of the evening; and de.&#xD;
clared that for the purpose, he would promise to bring his&#xD;
toilette within as narrow bounds as she did hers.&#xD;
Faith's face gave answer, in the'sort of sparkling of eye&#xD;
and colour which generally met such a proposition, and&#xD;
which to-day was particularly bright with the pleasure of&#xD;
surprise.&#xD;
"But," she said warningly, "I can dress in very few&#xD;
minutes !"&#xD;
So she did, and yet-and yet, she was dressed from head&#xD;
to foot and to the very point of the little white ruffle round&#xD;
her throat.  Hair, bright as .her hair was, and in the last&#xD;
degree of nice condition and arrangement, the same perfect&#xD;
presentation of hands and feet and white ruffles as afore.&#xD;
said;-that was the most of Faith's dressing; the rest was&#xD;
a plain white cambric fock, which had its only setting off&#xD;
in her face and figure.  The one-touch of colour which it&#xD;
wanted, Faith found when she went down stairs; for upon&#xD;
the basket where 'Le Philosophe' coihmonly reposed, lay a&#xD;
dainty breast-knot of autumn tints,-fringed gentian with&#xD;
its delicate blue, and oak leaves of the deepest red, and a&#xD;
late rose or two.&#xD;
It is a pity there was nobody to see Faith's face; for its&#xD;
tints copied the roses. Surprise and doubt and pleasure&#xD;
made a pretty confusion. She held in her hand the dainty&#xD;
bouquet and looked at it, as if the red leaves could have&#xD;
told her what other hand they were in last; which was&#xD;
what Faith wanted to know.&#xD;
A step on the porch-a slight knock at the front door,&#xD;
naturally drew her thoughts and feet thither, but whatever&#xD;
Faith expected she did not expect to see Sam Stoutenburgh.&#xD;
One might almost go further and say he did not expect to&#xD;
see her, for he gazed at her as if she had been an appari.&#xD;
tion-only that his face was red instead of white.&#xD;
"How do you do, Sam," said Faith, coming back a little&#xD;
to everyday life. "Do you want tosee Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"0 no, Miss Faith !" said Sam-as if it were the last'&#xD;
thing in the world lie wanted to see.&#xD;
"Well Sam-what then ?"&#xD;
But Sam was slow tofsay what then-.-or indeed to say&#xD;
anything; and what would have been his success is to this&#xD;
&#xD;
day unknown, for at that moment Mr. Linden came down&#xD;
stairs.&#xD;
"Do you want me, Sam ?" he said, approaching the&#xD;
front door.&#xD;
"No, sir," said Sam (playing both parts of an unwilling&#xD;
witness)-" I-I thought you were out, Mr. Linden."&#xD;
"0--" Mr. Linden said. "I beg your pardon!" And&#xD;
he not only went into the parlour but shut the door after&#xD;
him.&#xD;
To no purpose ! With him went the emnant of Sam&#xD;
Stoutenburgh's courage, if he had had To begin with,&#xD;
and after one more glance at Faith e fairly turned his&#xD;
back and fled-without striking his colours. Faith went&#xD;
back to the parlour.&#xD;
"What is the matter with the boy ?" she said, "I couldn't&#xD;
get anything out of him, Mr. Linden."&#xD;
A somewhat peculiar smile came with the words,&#xD;
"Couldn't you ?"&#xD;
Faith noticed it, but her thought was elsewhere. She&#xD;
came back to the table, took up the flowers, and said a&#xD;
little timidly,&#xD;
"Do you know who put these here, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
The look changed. "I think I do," he said.&#xD;
Her look did not change; except to a softened reflection&#xD;
of the one with which she had first viewed them. She&#xD;
viewed them still, bending over them doubtfully; then&#xD;
glancing up at him she shook her head and said,&#xD;
"You are dressed -before me, after all, Mr. Linden P"&#xD;
And ran away. She was back again in three minutes,&#xD;
with the flowers upon her breast; and if there had been but&#xD;
one adornment in the world that would have fitted her just&#xD;
then, the giver of the flowers had found it. Faith had&#xD;
altered nothing, she had only put them in the right place;&#xD;
and the effect was. curious in its beauty. That effect of her&#xD;
flowers was probably the only one unknown to Faith her-&#xD;
self, though it was with a face blushing with pleasure that&#xD;
she came in and sat gravely down to be a philosopher.&#xD;
She gave her teacher little trouble, and promised to give&#xD;
him less. She had excellent capacity, that was plain; with&#xD;
the eager desire for learning which makes the most of it;&#xD;
both the power and the will were there to appropriate and&#xD;

use every word of Mr. Linden's somewhat lawless but&#xD;
curiously skilful manner of instructing her. And the sim-&#xD;
plicity of her attention was perfect. She did not forget&#xD;
her flowers, probably, during this particular page of philo-&#xD;
sophizing, for 'a little tinge on her cheek never ceased to&#xD;
speak of pleasure all through the time; but that was the&#xD;
sole sign of distraction, if distraction there were. Less&#xD;
grave, but more intent, than Mr. Linden himself, the in-&#xD;
formation that Mr. Skip had driven the little wagon round&#xD;
before the door, came to her ears all too soon.&#xD;
The drive to the Judge's was not very long; it might&#xD;
have. been three quarters of a mile; so even at the old&#xD;
horse's rate of travelling they were soon there.&#xD;
Judge Harrison's house was large and old-fashioned, yet&#xD;
had much more style about it than any other house in Pat.&#xD;
taquasset pretended to; and the same was true of its arrange.&#xD;
ments and furniture. It was comfortable and ample; so&#xD;
was everything in it; with besides that touch of ease and&#xD;
fitness and adaptation which shews always-or generally-.&#xD;
that people have lived where there is a freedom from fixed&#xD;
standards. It was so here ; for Judge Harrison's family&#xD;
during the life-time of his wife had always spent their&#xD;
winters and often part of their summers away from Patta-&#xD;
quasset-in one of the great cities, New York generally&#xD;
or at some watering-place. There was also however an&#xD;
amount of good sense and kind temper in the family which&#xD;
made no difference, of intention, between them and the rest&#xD;
of Pattaquasset when they were there; so that they were&#xD;
extremely popular.&#xD;
Mr. Skip and old Crab were in very good time; there&#xD;
were not more than, half assembled of all the good com-&#xD;
pany asked and expected this afternoon. These were all&#xD;
over, in the house and out of the house ; observing and&#xD;
speculating. The house was surrounded with pleasant&#xD;
grounds, spreading on two sides in open smooth lawns of&#xD;
considerable extent, and behind the house and the lawns&#xD;
stretching back in a half open shrubbery. On one of the&#xD;
lawns long tables already showed their note of preparation;&#xD;
on the other there was a somewhat ominous array of&#xD;
benches and chairs; and among them all, round and about&#xD;
everything, scattered the people. -&#xD;

Mrs. Derrick and Faith went upstairs to the unrobing&#xD;
_ room, where the latter was immediately taken into consul-&#xD;
tation by Miss Harrison on some matters which promised&#xD;
to keep them both busy for some time. Mr. Linden mean-&#xD;
while received a very cordial welcome from Judge Harrison,&#xD;
who was cordiality itself.&#xD;
"Well, Mr. Linden ! we've got a good day ! Good for&#xD;
the boys and good for us. We've ventured to depart a&#xD;
little from your-instructions! but-I hope-in such a way&#xD;
: as not to compromise you. My son and daughter have&#xD;
managed it.' I'll introduce him to you"-said the old gen-&#xD;
tleman looking about,-" but he's somewhere just now."&#xD;
"I should like to know first, Judge Harrison, what my&#xD;
instructions were," said Mr. Linden, as his eyes likewise&#xD;
made search for the missing doctor.&#xD;
"0," said the Judge, "all right ! I understood your&#xD;
feelings exactly. I used that word 'because the right one&#xD;
didn't come. I have to do that often. I've heard of the&#xD;
'pen of a ready writer'-I'm sure I'd rather have the tongue&#xD;
of a ready speaker; but it don't matter for me now. My&#xD;
friends take me as they find me, and so will you, I have&#xD;
little fear. Julius !-Here's my son, Dr. Harrison, Mr.&#xD;
Linden."&#xD;
Dr. Harrison must have a word of introduction to the&#xD;
reader, though he was one of those who need very little in&#xD;
actua life. He was a handsome man, young but not very&#xD;
you g, and cameup at his father's.call and honoured the&#xD;
int oduction to his father's guest, with that easy grace and&#xD;
ad ess which besides being more or less born with a man,&#xD;
tell that much attrition with the world has been at work&#xD;
to take away all his outward roughnesses of nature. He&#xD;
was handsomely dressed too, though not at all in a way to&#xD;
challenge observation. His coat would have startled no-&#xD;
body in Pattaquasset, though it might have tol another&#xD;
that its wearer had probably seen France, had proba ly seen&#xD;
England, and had in short lived much in that kind  f so-&#xD;
ciety which recognizes the fact of ,many kinds of coats in&#xD;
the world. His greeting of Mr. Linden was both simple&#xD;
and graceful.&#xD;
"1 am very happy to see you," he said as he shook&#xD;
hands. "I should certainly have come to see you before,&#xD;

but I am more a stranger in Pattaquasset than anybody. I&#xD;
have hardly been at home since I returned; business has&#xD;
drawn me to other quarters-and I am only fortunate&#xD;
enough to be in time for this occasion. It's a good time&#xD;
for me," said he looking round,-" I can renew my old ac.&#xD;
quaintance with everybody at once-I think all Pattaquas.&#xD;
set is here."&#xD;
"Not grown out of your remembrance, has it ?" said Mr.&#xD;
Linden. " How long have you been away ?"&#xD;
"Well-it's had time to grow out-of everything ! espe-&#xD;
cially out of my memory. I have not been here for five&#xD;
years-and then only for a few days-and before that at&#xD;
College; so I may say I have hardly been here since my&#xD;
boyhood. I don't know anybody but the old ones. I shall&#xD;
apply to you, if you will allow me," said he, drawing him-&#xD;
self and Mr. Linden a little mor apart from the centre of&#xD;
reception. "Who, for instance, is that very--well-dressed--&#xD;
young lady just entering the hal ?.-good-looking too."&#xD;
The doctor's face was very quiet-so were his words;&#xD;
but his eye was upon Miss Cecilia Deacon, who in a low.&#xD;
necked blue silk, with an amber necklace and jet bracelets,&#xD;
as paying her respects to the Judge and his daughter.&#xD;
With equal quietness Mr. Linden made answer.&#xD;
"By the way," said the doctor suddenly, " I believe we&#xD;
owe this pleasant occasion-very pleasant I think it is&#xD;
going to be-to you."&#xD;
"Accidentally and innocently, I assure you."&#xD;
"Yes-of course,"-said Dr. Harrison, with the air of&#xD;
one who needed no information as to Mr. Linden's view of&#xD;
the subject, nor explanation as to its grounds. "But,"&#xD;
said he speaking somewhat low,-" my father has the in-&#xD;
terests of the school-and indeed of all Pattaquasset--&#xD;
truly at heart, and my sister has entered into all his feel-&#xD;
ings. I am a kind of alien. I hope not to be so.-But,&#xD;
as I was saying, my father and sister putting their heads&#xD;
together, have thought it would have a good effect upon&#xD;
the boys a d upon certain interests of the community&#xD;
through the and their parents too, to give some little ho-&#xD;
nours to the best students among them.--or to the cleverest&#xD;
boys-which, as you and I know, are not precisely synony-&#xD;
mous terms. Would you think well of such an expedient?&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
My father is very anxious to do nothing which shall not&#xD;
quite meet your judgment and wish in the matter."&#xD;
"I shall leave it in Judge Harrison's hands," said Mr.&#xD;
Linden' after a moment's silence: "I should be very sorry&#xD;
to gainsay his wishes in any respect. And some of the&#xD;
boys deserve any honours that can be given them."&#xD;
"Do they ?" said the doctor. "Can you indicate them&#xD;
to me ?"&#xD;
"No," said Mr. Linden smiling.  "I shall leave you to&#xD;
find out."&#xD;
"Leave me"-said the other. "How did you know what&#xD;
office they had charged upon me? Well-I am making as&#xD;
long a speech as if I were a member of Congress. By the&#xD;
way, Mr. Linden, can you imagine what could induce a&#xD;
man to be that particular -member of the body politic ? it&#xD;
occupies the place of the feet, I think; such members do&#xD;
little but run to and fro-though I remember I just seemed&#xD;
to give them the place of the tongue-unjustly. They&#xD;
don't do the real talk of the world."&#xD;
"The real talk?" said Mr. Linden.  "Indeed I think&#xD;
they do their share."&#xD;
"Of talk?" said the doctor with an acute look at his&#xD;
neighbour.; "Well-as I was saying-my sister has pro-&#xD;
vided I believe some red and blue, or red and something,&#xD;
favours of ribband--to be given to the boys who shall&#xD;
merit them. Now to find out that, which you won't tell&#xD;
me, I am to do, under your pleasure, some more talking-&#xD;
to them in public--to see in short how well they can talk&#xD;
to me. Do you like that ?"&#xD;
"Better than they will, perhaps-as merit is sometimes&#xD;
modest."&#xD;
"I assure you I would happilyyield the duty into your&#xD;
hands--who would do it so much better-but I suppose&#xD;
you would say as somebody else-'Let my friend tell my&#xD;
tale.'--Who is that ?" said the doctor slowly and softly,-.&#xD;
"like the riding pole of a fence-as little to spare-and as&#xD;
rigid-isn't he ?-and as long ! Don't I remember him ?"&#xD;
"You ought-that is Mr. Simlins."&#xD;
"Yes"-said the doctor musingly-."I remember him!&#xD;

unfortunate -next -looks like the perspective of a&#xD;
woman."&#xD;
But this lady Mr. Linden did not know. She was little,&#xD;
in form and feature, and had besides a certain pinched-in&#xD;
look of diminutiveness-that seemed to belong to mind as&#xD;
well as body, temper, and life-and. had procured her the&#xD;
doctor's peculiar term of description.&#xD;
"The next thing is," said Dr. Harrison, as his eye slowly&#xD;
roved over the assembled and assembling people-" who is&#xD;
to give the favours ? My sister of course does not wish to&#xD;
be forward in the business-and I don't-and you don't.&#xD;
I say, the prettiest girl here."&#xD;
"I think the hands that prepared the favours should dis.&#xD;
pense them," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"But she won't do it-and- ladies have sometimes the&#xD;
power of saying no-they're generally persuadable !-Who's&#xD;
that ?" said the doctor with a change of tone, touching Mr.&#xD;
Linden's arm,-" the one in white with a red bouquet de&#xD;
corsage-she's charming ! She's the one 1"&#xD;
"That is Miss Derrick."&#xD;
"She'll do,"-said the doctor softly to his companioinas&#xD;
Faith paused for a quick greeting of the Juqge'and then&#xD;
passed on out of sight;;--"she's charming-Do you sup.&#xD;
pose she knew what she was about when she put those red&#xD;
leaves and roses tog4ter ? I didn't know there was that&#xD;
kind of thing in Pattaquasset."&#xD;
"Yes, they look very well," said Mr. Linden coolly.&#xD;
"Julius !" said Mrs. Somers, laying hold of the elbow of&#xD;
the suggestive coat, "what do you mean by keeping Mr.&#xD;
Linden and yourself back here. That's the way with you&#xD;
young men-stand off and gaze at a safe distance, and&#xD;
then make believe you're fire proof."&#xD;
"Don't make believe anything, aunt Ellen," said the&#xD;
.young man lightly. "Prove me. You can take me up to the&#xD;
cannon's mouth-or any other !--and see if I am afraid of it."&#xD;
" I shall prove you before I take you anywhere," said&#xD;
Mrs. Somers. "You needn't talk to me in that style.&#xD;
But it's a little hard upon the boys to keep Mr. Linden&#xD;
here out of sight,-half of them don't know whether&#xD;
they're on their head or their heels till they see him, J call&#xD;
tell from their faces."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Mr. Linden," said the doctor with a gesture of invita-&#xD;
i tion to his companion,-"shall we Ago? Does it depend&#xD;
z upon your face which of the positions mentioned is to be&#xD;
assumed ?"&#xD;
The two gentlemen accordingly threaded their way to&#xD;
= the scene of action; passing, among others, Squire Deacon&#xD;
and Mr. Simlins wiom Mr. Linden greeted together. Mr.&#xD;
Simlins' answer was a mighty grasp of the hand. Squire&#xD;
Deacon's deserved little attention, and got it.&#xD;
The party were now on the lawn, at one side of which&#xD;
the boys had clustered and were standing in expectation.&#xD;
"I think, Mr. Linden,'said the doctor, if you will ex-&#xD;
plain to the boys what is to become of them in the next&#xD;
hour, I will go and see about the fair distributor of the&#xD;
favours-and then I suppose we shall be ready."&#xD;
It was well Dr. Harrison chose such a messenger,-no&#xD;
one else could have brought quietness out of those few dis-&#xD;
mayed minutes when the boys first learned, what was 'to&#xD;
become of them'; and the Judge would have felt remorseful&#xD;
; about his secret, had he seen the swift wings on which&#xD;
" Pleasure took her departure from the little group. It took&#xD;
, all Mr. Linden's skill, not to enforce submission, bu to&#xD;
bring pleasure back; perhaps nothing less than his half&#xD;
laughing half serious face and words, could have kept some&#xD;
of the boys from running away altogether.  And while&#xD;
. some tried to beg off, and some made manful efforts not to&#xD;
J feel afraid, others made desperate efforts to remember; and&#xD;
some of the little ones could be reassured by nothing but&#xD;
the actual holding of Mr. Linden's hand in theirs. So-&#xD;
they stood, grouped in and out the trees at the further&#xD;
edge of the lawn, till their teacher disengaged himself and&#xD;
came back to the house, leaving the parting directions-to&#xD;
say what they knew, and not try to say what they knew&#xD;
not.&#xD;
a Meanwhile Dr. Harrison had found his sister, and after&#xD;
a little consulting the two had pressed their father into the&#xD;
service; and then the three sought Faith. She was dis-&#xD;
covered at last on the other, lawn, by one. of the tables,&#xD;
Miss Harrison having d'smayfully recollected that she had&#xD;
asked Faith to help he? dress them, and then had left her&#xD;
all alone to do it. But Faith was not all alone; for Mr.&#xD;

Simlins stdod there like a good-natured ogre, watching her&#xD;
handling and disposing of the green leaves and late flowers&#xD;
with which she was surrounded, and now and then giving a&#xD;
most extraordinary suggestion as to the same.&#xD;
"Faith," said Miss Harrison after she had introduced her&#xD;
brother,-"I want you to give these favburs to the boys.&#xD;
Somebody must do it, and I can't-and you must !"&#xD;
"You see, my dear," said Judge Harrison, "Sophy and&#xD;
Julius want their fete to go off as prettily as possible; and&#xD;
so they want you to do this for them because you're the&#xD;
prettiest girl here."&#xD;
"Then I can't do it, sir," said Faith. She blushed very&#xD;
prettily, to be sure, but she spoke very quietly.&#xD;
"Faith ! you will do it for me ?" said Miss Harrison.&#xD;
"I can't, Sophy."&#xD;
"Nobody would do it so well as you-half!"&#xD;
"But I can't do it at all." And Faith went on leafing&#xD;
her dishes.&#xD;
"I dare put in no petition of my own," said the doctor&#xD;
then; "but I will venture to ask on the part of Mr. Lin.&#xD;
den, that you will do him and the school such a service."&#xD;
Faith's dark eyes opened slightly.  "Did he ask you,&#xD;
sir ?"&#xD;
"I cannot answer that," said the doctor, a little taken&#xD;
aback. "I have presumed on what I am sure are his&#xD;
wishes."&#xD;
He did not know what to make of her smile, nor of the&#xD;
simplicity with which Faith answered, in spite of her vary-&#xD;
ing colour,&#xD;
"You have been mistaken, sir."&#xD;
he doctor gave it up and said he was very sorry.&#xD;
'Then who shall do it ?" said Miss Harrison. "Miss&#xD;
Essie de Staff?"&#xD;
"She'll do," said the Judge. And the doctor, raising&#xD;
his eyebrows a little, and dropping his concern, offered his,&#xD;
arm to Faith to go to the scene of action. So it happened&#xD;
that as Mr. Linden entered the hall from one side door, he&#xD;
met the whole party coming in from the other, the doctor&#xD;
carrying the basket of blue and red favour which he had&#xD;
taken to present to Faith. But he stood till to let them&#xD;
pass, taking the full effect of the favours, the doctor, the&#xD;

&#xD;
. red leaves and their white-robed wearer; and then followed&#xD;
in his turn.&#xD;
All the inhabitants of the house and grounds were now&#xD;
fast gathering on the other lawn. Miss Sophy and her&#xD;
father separated different ways, the former taking the&#xD;
basket to commit it to Miss de Staff; and the doctor being&#xD;
obliged to go to his place in the performance, left his charge&#xD;
where he might. But nobody minded his neighbour now;&#xD;
Faith did not; the boys were drawn up in a large semi-&#xD;
circle, and the doctor taking his place in front of them, all&#xD;
in full view of the assembled townsmen of Pattaquasset,&#xD;
proceeded to his duty of examiner.&#xD;
He did it well. He was evidently, to those who conid&#xD;
see it, thoroughly at home himself in all the subjects upon&#xD;
which he touched and made the boys touch ; so thoroughly,&#xD;
that he knew skilfully where to tohch, and what to expect&#xD;
of them. He skewed himself a generous examiner too;&#xD;
he keenly enough caught the weak and strong points in the&#xD;
various minds he was dealing with, and gracefully enough&#xD;
brought the good to light, and only skewed the other so&#xD;
much as was needful for his purposes. He did not catch,&#xD;
nor entrap, nor press hardly; the boys had fair play but&#xD;
i they had favour too.&#xD;
The boys, on their part, were not slow to discover his&#xD;
good qualities; and it was certainly a comfort to them to&#xD;
know that they were acquitted or condemned on right&#xD;
grounds. Beyond that, there were curious traits of charac-&#xD;
ter brought to light, for those who had eyes to read&#xD;
them.&#xD;
The two head boys-Reuben Taylor and Sam Stouten-&#xD;
burgh, though but little apart in their scholarship were&#xD;
widely different in the manifestation thereof. Sam Stouten-&#xD;
burgh's rather off-hand, dashing replies, generally hit the&#xD;
mark; liut the steady, quiet clearheadedness of Reuben not&#xD;
only placed him in advance, but gave indications which no&#xD;
one could read who had not the key to his character. He&#xD;
coloured sometimes, but it was from modesty;y while part&#xD;
of Sam Stoutenburgh's blushes came ,from his curls. Little&#xD;
Johnny Fax, by dint of fixing his eyes upon Mr. Linden's&#xD;
far-off form (lie had been petitioned to stand in sight) went&#xD;
bravely through- his short part of the performance; and&#xD;
14*&#xD;

&#xD;
proved that he knew what he knew, if he didn't know&#xD;
much; and.of the rest there need nothing be said.&#xD;
Among the lookers-on there were also indications. To&#xD;
those who did not know him, Mr. Linden's face looked as&#xD;
unmoved as the pillar against which he leaned,--yet the&#xD;
varying play of light and shade upon the one was well re-&#xD;
peated in the other. Squire Stoutenburgh nodded and&#xD;
smiled, to himself and his neighbours, and made little aside&#xD;
observations -"That told, sir !"-= "Always was a good&#xD;
boy !-studious."-"Yes--Reuben Taylor does well--very&#xD;
well,-considering who his father is."&#xD;
That father the while, stood alone-even beyond the out.&#xD;
skirts of the gay party. With Miss Cilly's blue dress he&#xD;
had nothing in common-as little with Faith's spotless&#xD;
white. Dark, weatherbeaten', dressed for his boat and the&#xD;
clam banks, he stood there on the green turf as if in a&#xD;
trance. Unable to follow one question or answer, his eager&#xD;
eye caught every word of Reuben's voice ; his intent gaze&#xD;
read first the assurance that it would be right, then the as-&#xD;
surance that it was. The wholb world might have swept&#xD;
by him in a pageant-and he would scarcely have turned&#xD;
to look!-&#xD;
There was one other listener perhaps, whose interest was&#xD;
as rapt as his; that was Faith. But her interest was of&#xD;
more manifold character. There was the natural feeling&#xD;
for and with the boys; and there was sympathy for their&#xD;
instructor and concern for his honour, which latter grew pre-&#xD;
sently to be a very gratified concern. Then also Dr. Har-&#xD;
rison's examination was a matter of curious novelty ; and&#xD;
l5ack of all that, lay in Faith's mind a deep, searching,&#xD;
pressing interest in the subject mattersof it. What of all&#xD;
that, she knew,--how little,-and' how much the boys;-&#xD;
how vastly much Dr. Harrison; what far-reaching fields of&#xD;
knowledge.there were in some people's minds. Where was&#xD;
Faith's mind going?   Yet she was almost as outwardly&#xD;
quiet as Mr. Linden himself.&amp;amp; All her shew of feeling was 1&#xD;
in the intent eye, the grave face, and- a little deepening.&#xD;
and deepening tinge in her cheeks.&#xD;
The questioning and nswering was over-the boys were&#xD;
all in their ranks-the e was a little hush and stir of ex-&#xD;
pectaucy,-and Dr. Harrison gave his hand to a very bright&#xD;
&#xD;
lady with a basket and led her to a position by his side,&#xD;
filling the eye of the whole .assembly. Faith looked over&#xD;
to her with a tiny giving way of the lips which meant a&#xD;
great self-gratulation that she was not in the lady's place.&#xD;
There she stood, very much at home apparently,--Miss&#xD;
Essie de Staff, as fifty mouths said at once. She was rather&#xD;
a little lady, not very young, nor old; dressed in a gay-&#xD;
coloured plaid silk, with a jaunty little black apron with&#xD;
pockets, black hair in curls behind her ears, and a glitter&#xD;
of jewelry. It was not false jewelry, nor ill put on, and&#xD;
this was Miss Essie de Staff. S belonged to the second&#xD;
great family of Pattaquasset ; he too had been abroad and&#xD;
had seen life like the ilarrisons; but somehow she had seen&#xD;
it in a different way; and while the de Staffs had the shew,&#xD;
the Harrisons always had the reality of precedence in the&#xD;
town.&#xD;
And Dr. Harrison, raising slightly again his vo'e, which&#xD;
was a melodious one, said,&#xD;
"The ladies of Pattaquasset intend to honoui with a&#xD;
blue ribband the five elder boys who have spoken best; and&#xD;
with a favour of red ribband the five little boys who have&#xD;
w done the same on their part. Miss Essie de. Staff will do&#xD;
us the honour to bestow them. --Reuben Taylor, will you&#xD;
come forward-here, if you please."&#xD;
4 The 'favours' made a little stir among the group; and&#xD;
Reuben, who had been too much absorbed in the examina-&#xD;
tion for its own sake to think much of the question of pre-&#xD;
cedence, came forward at first with hesitation-then steadily&#xD;
and firmly.&#xD;
Miss Essie stepped a little forward to meet him, gave&#xD;
her basket to Doctor Harrison, and taking a blue favour&#xD;
from it she smilingly attached the same securely to the left&#xD;
breast of Reuben's coat.&#xD;
"Don't leave your place," said the doctor to him in a&#xD;
low to-ie ;-" L mean," he added smiling,-"go back to it&#xD;
and stay there.---Sam Stoutenburgh 1"-&#xD;
The doctor spoke like a man a little amused at himself&#xD;
for the part he was playing, but he did it wellenevertheless.&#xD;
And Reuben, who would fain have put himself and his blue&#xD;
ribband out of sight behind the rest, went back to, his&#xD;
-place; while Sam stepped briskly forward, and received the&#xD;

decoration in turn. Very different his air from Reuben's,-&#xD;
very different Reuben's grave and grateful bend of the head&#xD;
from the way in which Sam's hand covered at once his heart&#xD;
and the blue ribband. The four boys next in degreeto&#xD;
Reuben were severally invested with their blue stars.&#xD;
"Johnny Fax!"-said Dr. Harrison.   "Miss Essie, you&#xD;
are laying us under nameless obligations.-Johnny, come&#xD;
and      our ribband."&#xD;
Johnny came-looking first at Dr. Harrison and then at&#xD;
Miss Essie, as if a little uncertain  what they were going to&#xD;
- do with him; but" apparently the fluttering red favour&#xD;
pleased his fancy, for he smiled a little, and then looked&#xD;
quite away over Miss, Essie's shoulder as she bent towards&#xD;
him. For which neglect of the lady's face his youth and&#xD;
inexperience must account. But when the favour was on,&#xD;
Johnny's eyes came back, and he said simply,&#xD;
"Thank you, ma'am.   Shall I keep it always ?"&#xD;
"By all means 1" said Miss Essie.  "Never part with it."&#xD;
The five little fellows were made splendid; and then&#xD;
there was a pause. Miss Essie stepped back and was lost.&#xD;
Doctor Harrison made a sign with his hand, and two ser-&#xD;
vants came on the lawn bringing between them a table&#xD;
covered with a red cloth. It was set down before Dr.&#xD;
Harrison and his sister came beside him.&#xD;
"iMy dear friends," said the doctor raising his voice&#xD;
again,. and giving his sister at the same time the benefit of&#xD;
a slight play of face which others were not so situated they&#xD;
could see,-" You have all done yourselves and somebody&#xD;
else, a great deal of credit. I hope you will thank him;-.&#xD;
as we wish to shdw-our pleasure to you. It was not to be&#xD;
expected that everybody would be first this time-though&#xD;
on the next occasion..I have no doubt that will prove to be&#xD;
the case ; but as we could not of course in consequence&#xD;
give stars to all, we will do the best we can. Reuben&#xD;
Taylor-"&#xD;
Again Reuben came forward; the doctor hak pulled off&#xD;
the red cloth, and a tempting pile of books, large and&#xD;
small, and nicely bound, rose up to view upon the table.&#xD;
And Miss Harrison as Reuben came near, chose out one&#xD;
of the best and handed it to him, saying softly, "YOU&#xD;
have done very well."&#xD;
&#xD;
t&#xD;
&#xD;
Now Miss Sophy Harrison was, as everyone knew and&#xD;
said, thoroughly good and kind, like her father. She&#xD;
had chosen the books. And the one she had given Reuben&#xD;
was a very nice copy of the Pilgrim's Progress. She&#xD;
might have felt herself repaid by the one earnest look his&#xD;
eyes gave her,-then he bowed silently and retired.&#xD;
The list would be too long to go through. 'Every one&#xD;
was pleased this time ; the Harrisons had done the thing&#xD;
well; and it may only be noted in passing, that Johnny&#xD;
Fax's delight and red ribband were crowned and finished&#xD;
off with an excellent Robinson Crusoe. Then broke up&#xD;
and melted off the assembled throng, like-I wanta simile,&#xD;
--like the scattering of a vapoury cloud in the sky. It&#xD;
was everywhere and nowhere directly-that which before&#xD;
had been a distinct mass.&#xD;
"Faith," said Miss Cecilia, almost before this process&#xD;
of dispersion c mmenced, - "where did you get such a.&#xD;
pretty nosegay this time of year ?"&#xD;
"They grew--" said Faith .smiling.&#xD;
"Did they come out .of your own garden."&#xD;
"We don't keep oak trees in our garden."&#xD;
"I declare ! it's elegant. Faith,, give me just one of&#xD;
those red leaves, won't you? I want it."&#xD;
"No indeed !" said Faith, starting back and shielding&#xD;
the oak leaves with her hand, as that of Miss Deacon ap-&#xD;
proached them. "What are you thinking of ?"&#xD;
"Thinking ofI" said Cecilia colouring.  "So, Faith, I&#xD;
hear you've set up for a school teacher ?"&#xD;
"I've one little scholar," said Faith quietly. "That isn't&#xD;
much 'setting up,' Cecilia."&#xD;
"One scholar !" said Cecilia contemptuously. "Didn't&#xD;
you go over with all the boys to Neanticut the other day?"&#xD;
"Yes,"said Faith laughing, "indeed. I did; but I assure&#xD;
you I didn't go to teach school."&#xD;
"Miss Derrick,"-said Dr. Harrison, offering his arm to&#xD;
Faith,--"my sister begs the favour of your assistance-in-&#xD;
stantly and urgently-you know I presume for what ?"&#xD;
"Yes, I know, Dr. Harrison," said Faith smiling,-"I&#xD;
left it unfinished"&#xD;
And the two walked away together.&#xD;
"'Seems to me, Mr. Simlins," said Squire Deacon, watch-&#xD;

&#xD;
ing Faith and her convoy with a certain saturnine satisfac.&#xD;
tion; "I say it seems to me, that the Judge aint making&#xD;
the thing right side upwards. The boys get all the prizes&#xD;
--without Dr. Harrison thinks he has, and the teacher&#xD;
don't seem to. be much count. Now what a handsomer&#xD;
thing it-would have been to make the boys get him some.&#xD;
thing with their own hard cash,--a pleasure boat--" added&#xD;
the Squire, "or a Bible-or anything of that sort. I&#xD;
thought all this philustration was to set him up."&#xD;
Mr. Simlins gave a kind of grunt.&#xD;
"It haimt pulled him down much,". he said,-"as I see.&#xD;
And I suppose Judge Harrison thinks that drivin' wedges&#xD;
under a church steeple is a surrogate work-without he&#xD;
saw it was topplin'."&#xD;
Without getting any too clear a notion of the meaning&#xD;
of these words-it took a lively imagination to follow Mr.&#xD;
Simlins in.some of his flights, the Squire yet perceived&#xD;
enough to stay his own words a little; and he passed away&#xD;
the tedium of the next few minutes by peering round the&#xD;
corner of the house and getting far-off glimpses of Faith.&#xD;
"She looks 'most like a spectral illusion," he said ad-&#xD;
miringly. "The tablecloths aint bleached a bit whiter 'n&#xD;
her dress."&#xD;
"She aint no more like a spectre than I'm like a ghost,"&#xD;
said Mr. Simlins. "Washin' and ironin' 'll make a white&#xD;
frock for any woman."&#xD;
Then stalking up to Mr. Linden accosted him grimly,&#xD;
after his fashion. "Well Mr. Linden-.what   you think&#xD;
of that farm at Neanticut ? don't you want-t6 take it of&#xD;
me.?"&#xD;
"There are too many fences between me and it," was&#xD;
4he smiling reply.&#xD;
"It's good land," Mr. Simlins went on; "you can't do&#xD;
better than settle down there. I'd like to have you for a&#xD;
tenant--give you the land easy."&#xD;
"Let me pay you in nuts ?" said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
But then came up other farmers and heads of families to'&#xD;
claim Mr. Linden's attention; men whose bays were at the.&#xD;
school; and who now in various states of gratification, but&#xD;
all gratified, came one after another to grasp his hand and&#xD;
thank him f the good he had done and was doing them.&#xD;
&#xD;
"You're the first man, sir,"said one, a broad-shouldered,&#xD;
tall, strong man, with a stern reserved face,-"you're the&#xD;
first man that has been able to make that boy of mine-&#xD;
Phil.-attend to anything, or- go to school regular. He&#xD;
talks hard sometimes,-bit you do what you like with him,&#xD;
Mr. Linden! I give you my leave. Hle's smart, and he&#xD;
aint a bad boy, at heart; but he's wild, and he has his own&#xD;
way and it aint always a good one. His mother never had&#xD;
any government of him," said the father, looking towards&#xD;
the identical person whom Dr. Harrison had characterized&#xD;
as 'the perspective of a woman,' and who certainly had&#xD;
the air of one whose mind-what she' had-was shut up&#xD;
and shut off into the further extremities of possibility.&#xD;
Then came up Judge Harrison.&#xD;
"Well, Mr. Linden, I hope you have been gratified. I&#xD;
have. I declare I have !-very much. You are doing a&#xD;
great thing for us here, sir; and I don't doubt-it is a gra-&#xD;
tification to you to know it. I haven't made up my mind&#xD;
what we shall do to thank you-we've been thanking the&#xD;
b ys,-but that's, you know,-that's a political expedient.&#xD;
Mty heart's in the other thing."&#xD;
"Squire Deacon was givin' me about the same perspec-&#xD;
tive of the case," said Mr. Simlins,-"only he thought he&#xD;
warut the one to do the thankin'."&#xD;
Mr. Linden's face, through all these various gratulations,&#xD;
had been a study. One part of his nature answered, eye&#xD;
to eye and hand to hand, the thanks and pleasure so&#xD;
variously expressed. But back of that lay something else,&#xD;
--a something which gave even his smile a tinge,-it was&#xD;
the face of one who&#xD;
"Patiently, and still expect ant,&#xD;
Looked out through the wooden"bars."&#xD;
sometimes grave, at others a' queer sense of his own posi-&#xD;
ion seemed to touch him; and his manner might then re-&#xD;
Amind one of a swift-winged bird-who walking about on&#xD;
the grass for business purposes, is complimented by a com-&#xD;
pany of crickets on his superior powers of locomotion.&#xD;
And it was with almost a start that he answered Judge&#xD;
Harrison-.&#xD;

"I am sure we owe them,".said the Judge,-" but that's&#xD;
another view of the case, I know. Well-it's a good kind&#xD;
of debt to owe-and to pay !-"&#xD;
And he was lost again among some other of his guests.&#xD;
In the gradual shifting and melting away of groups, it&#xD;
happened that Mr. Linden found himself for a moment&#xD;
alone, when the doctor again approached him. '&#xD;
"Did I do your office well ?" he said gently, and half&#xD;
putting his arm through Mr. Lindens as if to lead him to&#xD;
the house.&#xD;
The answer was laughingly given-&#xD;
"'What poet would not mourn to see&#xD;
His brother write as well as he?,"&#xD;
"Well," said the doctor, answering the tone, "did I hit&#xD;
your boys ?-the right ones ?"&#xD;
" My boys in point of scholarship ?-yes, almost as care-&#xD;
fully as I should."&#xD;
"I am glad you were satisfied," said the doctor;-"and&#xD;
I'm glad it's over !-What sort of a life do ou lead here&#xD;
in Pattaquasset?  I don't know it. Hod can one get&#xD;
along here ?"&#xD;
He spoke in a careless sort of confidential manner, as&#xD;
perfectly aware that his companion was able to answer him.&#xD;
They were very slowly sauntering up to the house.&#xD;
"One can get along here in various ways-" said Mr.&#xD;
Linden,--"as in other places. Onecan (if one can) sub-&#xD;
side to the general level, or one can (with the like qualifi-&#xD;
cation) rise above it. The paths through Pattaquasset&#xD;
are in no wise peculiar, yet by no means alike."&#xD;
"No," said the doctor, with another side look at him--&#xD;
"I suppose as much. I see you're a philosopher. Do you&#xD;
carry a spirit-level about with you ?"&#xD;
"Define-" said Mr. Li). en, with a smile which ce&#xD;
tainly belonged to the I t philosopher he had been i'&#xD;
company with.&#xD;
"I see you do," said the doctor. "What's your opinion&#xD;
of philosophy ? that it adds to the happiness of the world&#xD;

You ask broad questions, Dr. Harrison-considering&#xD;
the many kinds of philosophy, and the unphilosophical state&#xD;
of 'the world in general."&#xD;
The doctor laughed a little. "I don't know," aid he,-.&#xD;
'I sometimes think the terms have changed sides, and that&#xD;
'the world in general' has really the best of it. But do&#xD;
you know what particular path in Pattaquasset we are&#xD;
treading at this minute ?"&#xD;
"A path where philosophy and happiness are supposed&#xD;
to part company, I imagine," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"Pre-cisely-" said the doctor. "By the way, if any-&#xD;
thing in my father's house or library can be of the least con-&#xD;

furnished ways of Pattaquasset, I hope you will use both&#xD;

CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
W     ITH p slight congee the doctor left them and went&#xD;
back again; and then came the full rush of all&#xD;
the guests, small and great. Miss Harrison claimed Mr.&#xD;
Linden's assistance to marshal and arrange the boys at&#xD;
their table-one being given specially to them; and then&#xD;
established him as well as circumstances permitted at&#xD;
another-between Miss Cecilia Deacon and Miss Essie de&#xD;
Staff.. Miss Harrison herself did not sit dovn. The&#xD;
guests were many, the servants far too few; and Miss llar~&#xD;
rison and her brother with one or two helpers, of whom&#xD;
Fpith was one, went round from table to table; attending&#xD;
to everybody's wants. The supply of all eatables and&#xD;
drinkables was ample and perfect enough; but without the&#xD;
quick and skilful eyes and hands of these educated waiters,&#xD;
the company could not have been entirely put in possession&#xD;
of them. So Faith's red oak leaves did after all adorn the&#xD;
entertainment, and publicly though most unconsciously on&#xD;
her part.&#xD;
"Reuben," she whispered at his shoulder, "there are no&#xD;
roast clams here-shall I give you some jelly?  I see you&#xD;
have got substantials."&#xD;
"No thank you, Miss Faith," said Reuben-adding with&#xD;
some hesitation, "I believe it's ungrateful in me, but I&#xD;
don't want to eat."&#xD;
"Are you eating your book all the while ? I am so glad,&#xD;
Reuben! Whee i   qur father ?"&#xD;
"I think he's home, Miss Faith-he must be by this&#xD;
time."&#xD;
"Home! I'm sorry. I've been looking for him. Sam&#xD;
what can I get you ? coffee ?" .&#xD;
"Miss Faith !" said Sam standing up in his place, "I'&#xD;
rather have one of those leaves you've been wearing ll&#xD;
day than all the coffee that ever was burnt !"&#xD;
Leaves ! you foolish boy" said Faith, her own colour&#xD;
in an instant emulating them, and as before her hand went&#xD;
(170)&#xD;
&#xD;
up to shield them. "I can't give you one of these, Sam--..&#xD;
Il bring you some coffee.&#xD;
Away she ran, coming bac  presently with.a cup and a&#xD;
piece of jelly cake, bestowing a fellow piece upon Reuben.&#xD;
"You can get plenty of oak leaves anywhere, Sam," she"&#xD;
said laughing a little.&#xD;
"But you haven't worn 'em, Miss Faith-and I can't&#xD;
keep this !" said Sam sA-veying the cake with a very serio-&#xD;
comic face.&#xD;
"Well, who wants to ?" said Joe Deacon. "Hand us&#xD;
over the other cake, that's got nothing between. If you're&#xD;
settin' up to get round anybody, Sam Stoutenburgh, you'll&#xD;
find there's two or three in a bunch-I tell you." Which&#xD;
remark Faith was hqppily too far off to hear.&#xD;
"Faith," said Mrs. Somers, leaning back and stopping&#xD;
her as she passed;" do you know why I let Sophy keep&#xD;
you running about so ?"&#xD;
"I like to do it, Mrs. Somers."&#xD;
"Well that's not the reason. You ought to sit up at&#xD;
the head of the table for your skill in arranging flowers&#xD;
I didn't know it was in you, child."&#xD;
And Mrs. Somers bent closer to Faith, to take the&#xD;
breath of the roses, but softy for she loved flowers herself.&#xD;
Faith bore it jealously, for she was afraid of another in-&#xD;
vading hand; and blushing at the praise she could not dis-&#xD;
claim ran away as soon as she was free. But as the tide&#xD;
of supper-time began to ebb, the doctor arrested Faith in&#xD;
her running about and saying that his sister had had no&#xD;
supper yet and wanted company, led her to the place his&#xD;
aunt had spoken of, a clear space at one end of the table,&#xD;
where the doctor also discovered he had taken no supper.&#xD;
The rest of the party sat at ease, or began to scatter again&#xD;
about the grounds. A new attraction was appearing there,&#xD;
in the shape of Chinese lanterns, which the servants and&#xD;
others were attaching in great numbers to the trees and&#xD;
shrubbery. The sun went down, the shades of evening&#xD;
were fast gathering. At last.Miss Harrison rose.&#xD;
"When the lamps are lit, Miss Derrick," said the doctor&#xD;
as they followed her example, "there is a particular effect&#xD;
which Iewill have the pleasure of shewing you-if you will&#xD;

&#xD;
" Dir.Harrison, how do you do !" said a voice that&#xD;
sounded like-perhaps as much like the bark of a red&#xD;
squirrel as anything ; and a little figure, with everything&#xD;
faded butcher ribbands,tand everything full but her cheeks,&#xD;
looked up with a pair of good, kind, honest eyes into the&#xD;
doctor's face. "It makes a body feel young-.or old-I&#xD;
don't know which, to see you again," she said. "Though'&#xD;
indeed I know just how old you are, without looking into&#xD;
the Bible. Not but that's a good place to look, for various&#xD;
thi gs. And there's a great variety of things there,---if a&#xD;
body had time to read 'em all, which I haven't. I used to&#xD;
read like a scribe when I was young-till my eyes got bad;&#xD;
but a body can't do much without eyes, especially when&#xD;
they have to sew all the time, as I do. I always did think&#xD;
it was one indemnification for b ing a man, that a body&#xD;
wouldn't have to sew. Nor do m ch of anything else---for&#xD;
'man works from sun to sun, but a woman's work is. never&#xD;
done.' And I always think the work after sundown comes&#xD;
hardest-it does to me, because my eyes are so bad.-Well,&#xD;
Miss Cilly! don't your dress fit !"-It may be proper to&#xD;
mention that this last sentence was a little undertone.&#xD;
"You have given me, Miss Bezac," said the doctor,&#xD;
"what I have wanted all my life until. now-an indemnifi-&#xD;
cation for being a man !"&#xD;
"Is that the way they talk over in France ?" said Miss&#xD;
Bezac-"well, it don't make. a body want to go there,&#xD;
there's that about it. And there always is something about&#xD;
everything. And I've something to say to you, Faith, so&#xD;
don't you run away. You've done running enough for one&#xD;
day, besides."&#xD;
Faith was in no danger of running away. For while&#xD;
Miss Bezac was running .off her sentences, a little low voice&#xD;
at Faith's side said "Ma'am !"-by way of modestly draw-&#xD;
ing her attention to Johnny Fax and his red ribband.&#xD;
Faith stooped down to be nearer the level of the red&#xD;
ribband.&#xD;
"You did bravely, Johnny. And you got a book too.,&#xD;
I guess Mr. Linden was pleased with you to-night," she&#xD;
added softly.&#xD;
"0O he's always pleased with me," said Johnny simply.&#xD;
"But I wasn't brave, ma'am,--I was frightened." Thea&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.                 173&#xD;
in a lower tone, as if he were telling a great secret, Johnny&#xD;
added,&#xD;
"I'm coming to you next Sunday if it's cold weather "-...&#xD;
N  and looked up in her face to see the effect oo this mysteri-&#xD;
ous announcement.&#xD;
"You, Johnny I" said Faith, with a flash of remembrance&#xD;
of the time she had last seen him, which made her almost&#xD;
sorrowful. " Well, dear-we'll do the best we can," she&#xD;
added in a tone which was sweet at least as tenderness&#xD;
could make it. The child looked at her a little wistfully.&#xD;
"Mr. Linden says he don't think I'm big enough to keep&#xD;
warm out of doors any more," he said with childish inex-&#xD;
plicitness.&#xD;
"I don't think you are," said Faith. "Well, Johnny-.&#xD;
you come to me next Sunday, and we'll try!"--And she&#xD;
2   gave him, what Sam Stoutenburgh would probably have&#xD;
mortgaged his life for,-.-a soft touch of her lips upon his&#xD;
cheek. And Sam Stoutenburgh was not far off.&#xD;
"Miss Faith I" he said as she rose to her former posi-&#xD;
tion, --"stand out of the way, Johnny, there's a good&#xD;
5  boy! -mayn' I see you home to-night ?    Please don't&#xD;
refuse me everything !"&#xD;
"There isn't room in the wagon, Sam," said Faith.  -&#xD;
"0 are you going to ride ?" said Sam. "But I may go&#xD;
with you to the wagon ?"&#xD;
"Yes if you like," said Faith looking a little puzzled&#xD;
and amused.  "I suppose you may."&#xD;
"Are there any more to come ?" said Miss Bezac, hose&#xD;
patience had outlasted that of Dr. Harrison,-" because if&#xD;
there are, I'd rather wait-I -don't like to be stopped when&#xD;
once I begin. And if I was you, Faith-(how pretty-you&#xD;
look1!)...-I'd keep still and not let my head be turned ; the&#xD;
old direction's the best ; and after all directions are more&#xD;
than dresses. For what's the odds between an embroidered&#xD;
vest and a plain one ? Not that it's much to embroider it-&#xD;
used to fiddle faddle many a one, till I lost my eyes; and&#xD;
'll teach you to do it in a minute, if you like." With&#xD;
which kind and lucid proposal, Miss Bezac .put her hand&#xD;
softly on Faith's waist and smoothed out an imaginary&#xD;
wrinkle in the white dress.&#xD;
~"Dear Miss Bezac," said Faith, not losing her amused&#xD;

Pt 4¢              SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
look,-" I don't want to embroider waistcoats. What are&#xD;
you talking of ?"&#xD;
"I know-" said Miss Bezac "and I suppose. that's&#xD;
enough., If folks don't know wlat you mean they can't&#xD;
say anything against it. But you don't know what you&#xD;
want, child,--any more than I did. And do you know,&#xD;
sometimes I wish I'd never found out?  But whenever you&#xD;
do know, you can come to me; and I'll fix you off so you&#xD;
won't know yourself. It's a pleasant way to lose a body's&#xD;
identity, I can tell you. Now give )me a kiss and I'll go,&#xD;
t for I live 'tother sire of creation-where you never come;&#xD;
and why you don't come, -and bring him, I don't see-but&#xD;
I've seen him, in spite of you. Here he comes, tQo"--said&#xD;
Miss Bezac, "so I'll be off."7&#xD;
There was such a variety of confusions in this speech&#xD;
that Faith was hopeless of setting them right. She stood&#xD;
looking at the speaker, and did not try. However, every-&#xD;
body was accustomed to7Miss Bezac's confusions.&#xD;
"Are you pledged to stand still on this particular spot ?"&#xD;
Mr. Linden said at her side.&#xD;
"No indeed," said Faith with ready smile,-"but people&#xD;
have been talking to me-"&#xD;
"Yes, and there is no telling how many I shall interfere&#xD;
with if I take you away now."&#xD;
"I don't care-" said Faith. "Only Dr. Harrison said&#xD;
he wanted to shew me something when the lamps were&#xD;
lit."&#xD;
"When they are lighting ? oer when they are lit ?"&#xD;
"When they are lit, he said."&#xD;
"Well they are not lit yet," said Mr. Linden, "and&#xD;
before they are I want you to get a view of people and&#xD;
things in twilight perspective. For which purpose, Miss&#xD;
Faith, I must take you to the extreme verge of society and&#xD;
the lawn-if you will let, me."&#xD;
"I would like to go anywhere you please, Mr. Linden."&#xD;
And Faith's face gave modest token that she would like i&#xD;
very much.&#xD;
He gave her his arm, and then by skilful navigation&#xD;
kept clear of the groups most likely to interrupt their pro-&#xD;
gress; passing rather towards the boy quarter, making Sam&#xD;
Stoutenburgh sigh and Joe Deacon whistle, with the most&#xD;

&#xD;
frigid disregard of their feelings. The shrubbery at the&#xD;
foot of the lawn was in more than twilight now, and its&#xD;
deeper shadow was good to look out from; giving full&#xD;
t effect to the dying light on earth and sky. The faint rose-&#xD;
coloured clouds hung over a kaleidoscope of dresses, which&#xD;
was ever shifting and making new combinations, passing&#xD;
into black spots in the shadow of the trees, or forming&#xD;
a broad spread of patchwork on the open lawn. The&#xD;
twilight perspective was far more witching than the sun-&#xD;
light full view.&#xD;
"How pretty that is!" said Faith delightedly.  "Thank&#xD;
you, Mr. Linden. I don't believe Dr. Harrison will shew&#xD;
me any effect so good as this. How pretty and odd it is1!"&#xD;
"Don't you know," he said, "that you never should thank&#xD;
me for doing pleasant things ?"&#xD;
"Why, Mr. Linden ?" she said in a tone a little checked.&#xD;
"Why?-because I like to do them."&#xD;
"Well,"she said laughing slightly, "that makes me want&#xD;
to thank you more."&#xD;
"It don't make me deserve the thanks, however.  Do&#xD;
you perceive the distant blue .of s Miss Cecilia's dress?&#xD;
does it make you think of the blue ether over your&#xD;
head ?"&#xD;
"Not the least !" said Faith much amused.   "What&#xD;
makes you ask me that, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"I should like to hear why it does not ?"&#xD;
"The two things are so very, very far apart," Faith said,&#xD;
after a moment's consideration.  "I don't see what could&#xD;
make me think of them together. The only thing is that&#xD;
both are blue, but I should have to think to remember&#xD;
that."&#xD;
"You haven't answered me yet,"he said smiling. "Why&#xD;
are they far apart ? -your blue gentians 'there, are as far&#xD;
below the sky in number of miles-yet from them to the&#xD;
sky the transition is easy."&#xD;
"Yes-" said Faith looking down at her blue gentian.&#xD;
'Why is it, Mr. Linden? But this is God's work too," she&#xD;
dded softly.&#xD;
"I suppose that is the deep root of the matter.  The&#xD;
ruined harp of man's nature yet answers to a breath from&#xD;
heaven as to no other touch. Then blue has been so long&#xD;

the emblem of truth, that separated from truth one can&#xD;
scarce, as you say, realize what colour it is."&#xD;
"Then Mr. Linden," said Faith after a moment's silence,&#xD;
with the tone and the lool of quick: pleasure,--"is this&#xD;
what you mean by 'reading' things ?"&#xD;
"Yes--" he said with a smile,&#xD;
To rightly spell&#xD;
Of every star that heaven doth shew,&#xD;
And every herb that sips the dew."'&#xD;
"But how far can you read ?" said Faith. "And I&#xD;
never thought of such reading till-till a little while ago!&#xD;
How far can you read, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"I don't know-" he said,-"because I don't know how&#xD;
far I cannot read ! Yet if 'tie invisible things of God'&#xD;
may be known 'by the things which are seen,' there is at&#xD;
least room for ample study. To some people, Miss Faith,&#xD;
the world is always (with the change of one adjective) an&#xD;
incomprehensible little green book; while others read a few&#xD;
pages now, and look forward to knowing the whole here-&#xD;
after.".&#xD;
There was a pause, a little longer than usual.&#xD;
"And you say I must not thank you ?"-Faith said&#xD;
very low.&#xD;
"I say I think you have no cause."&#xD;
She was silent.&#xD;
"Has the day been pleasant ?" Mr. Linden asked, as&#xD;
they walked up and down.&#xD;
"Yes, very pleasant. I liked what you didn't like, Mr.&#xD;
Linden-all that examination business. And I was very&#xD;
glad for Reuben and little Johnny."&#xD;
"How do you know I didn't like it ?"&#xD;
"I don't 'know'-I thought you didn't," she said looking&#xD;
at him.&#xD;
"You don't like to say ivhy ?"&#xD;
"Yes! -I thought you didn't like it, Mr. Linden, whe&#xD;
Judge Harrison first proposed it. You wished he wonl&#xD;
give us the pleasure without the shewing off."&#xD;
"iWell, did you also know," he  said with a peculia&#xD;
little smile, "that one of my best scholars~ was not ex&#xD;
ammned ?'&#xD;
&#xD;
S "No-who do you mean ?" she said earnestly.&#xD;
He laughed, and answered&#xD;
"One who would perhaps prefer a private examina-&#xD;
tion at home - and to whom   I have thought of pro-&#xD;
posing  it.&#xD;
."n&#xD;
"An examination ?  said Faith, wondering and with&#xD;
co siderable heightening of colour, either at the proposal&#xD;
o at the rank among scholars assigned her.&#xD;
"You need not be frightened," Mr. Linden said gravely&#xD;
"if anybody should be, it is I, at my own boldness. I&#xD;
am a little afraid to go on now-though it is something I&#xD;
hav long wanted to say to you."&#xD;
fhat is it, Mr. Linden ?" she said timidly&#xD;
"I have thought-" he paused a moment, and then went&#xD;
quietly on. "You have given me reason to think, that&#xD;
there are other, desirable things besides French of which&#xD;
you have no knowledge. I have wished. very much to ask&#xD;
you what they are, and that you would let me-so far as I&#xD;
can-supply the deficiency."  It was said with simple-&#xD;
frankness, yet with -a manner that fully recognized the&#xD;
delicate ground he was on.&#xD;
The rush of blood to Faith's face he could see by the&#xD;
lamplight, but she hesitated for an answer, and hesitated,&#xD;
-and her head was bent with the weight of some feeling.&#xD;
"I should be too glad, Mr. Linden !" she said at last&#xD;
4 very low, but with unmistakeable emphasis.&#xD;
"Then if you will let me see to-morrow what you are&#xD;
doing with that other little book, I will see what compan-&#xD;
ions it should have."  And warned by the kindling lamps&#xD;
on every side, he led the way a little more into the open&#xD;
lawn, that Faith might at least be found if sought. That&#xD;
allowed him to seetoo, the look he had raised in her face;&#xD;
the little smile on the lips, the flush of colour, the stir of&#xD;
deep pleasure that kept her from speaking. Yet when&#xD;
hey had taken a few steps on the broad lawn- and other&#xD;
ople would soon be nearing them, she suddenly said,&#xD;
ftly,&#xD;
"What 'other' book do you mean, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"I don't know how many there may be, Miss Faith, but&#xD;
Meant one which I tried to get at the store one day, and&#xD;
found that the last copy had passed into your hands."&#xD;

"The arithmetic !" said Faith.  "That was how you&#xD;
knew it.-There is Dr. Harrison looking for me !" she&#xD;
added, in a tone which gentle as it was would have turned&#xD;
that gentleman to the right about if he had heard it-- .&#xD;
which he did not-and if he had not been indifferent on&#xD;
the point of all such tones,-which he was.&#xD;
. "Stars shine, by their, own light I" said the doctor as he&#xD;
came up. " I have no need to ask, 'Where is Miss Derrick?'&#xD;
Your Quercus rubra there is brilliant at any distance, with&#xD;
a red gleam. You have Mars on your breast, and Hes-&#xD;
perus in your eye ! It is heaven on earth !"&#xD;
Faith could not choose but laugh at the mixture of gal-&#xD;
lantry and fun and flattery in the doctor's manner, though&#xD;
his meaning was, to her, doubtful. Other answer she made&#xD;
none.&#xD;
"And so," said Mr. Linden, "you make the stars shine&#xD;
by their' own light, and IIiss Derrick by the light of the&#xD;
stars !"&#xD;
"Advances constantly making in the sciencesI" said the&#xD;
doctor with a wave of his hand.  "I dare say you are a&#xD;
better astronomer than I am ;-I haven't kept up with the&#xD;
latest discoveries. But Mr. Linden, may I interfere with&#xD;
your heaven for a moment, and persuade these stars to&#xD;
shine, for that length of time, upon less favoured regions?&#xD;
With another revolution of the earth they will rise upon&#xD;
you again."&#xD;
"I shall not persuade the stars for'you," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
" I will endeavour so far," said the doctor turning to&#xD;
Faith. "I had the honour to offer to shew Miss Derrick the&#xD;
peculiar effect of Chinese lanterns in Pattaquasset--may I&#xD;
hope thdt she will allow me to fulfil my promise ?"&#xD;
He took possession of Faith, and with a graceful "Au&#xD;
revoir !".-to Mr. Linden, led her away.&#xD;
The effect of the lanterns was very pretty, and to her&#xD;
eyes very curious. So were the lanterns themselves, be-&#xD;
fore one and another*of which Faith stopped and looked&#xD;
with charmed eyes, and the doctor nothing loth gave her&#xD;
charming details.&#xD;
"After all, it is only child's play," he said as he turned&#xD;
away.  "Why should we yant Pattaquasset to look like&#xD;
China ?"&#xD;

"For one night?" said Faith.&#xD;
i"Well, for one night," saidthe doctor. "But you haven't&#xD;
got little feet on, have you ?' said he looking down at the&#xD;
edge of Faith's white dress in mock alarm;-' I shouldn't&#xD;
like the transformation to go too far."&#xD;
Faith laughed.&#xD;
"Reassure me," said the doctor. "Nothing can be more&#xD;
unlike the Mongol type than the pure Circassian I have&#xD;
before me,-yet let me see the slipper.  I want to be sure&#xD;
that all is right."&#xD;
He persisted, and to stop the absurdity of the thing,&#xD;
Faith chewed him, not indeed her slipper, but the most&#xD;
un-Chinese, un-French, neat little shoe thick enough for&#xD;
walking, in which she had come to Judge Harrison's&#xD;
party.&#xD;
"Alarmingly near !", said the doctor peering at it--"but&#xD;
the proportions are perfect. It is not Chinese. Thank you.&#xD;
I have seen so many odd things in my life, Miss Derrick,--&#xD;
and people,-that I never know what to expect; and any-&#xD;
thing right from head to foot, is a marvel."&#xD;
They moved 'on again and sauntered round and round in&#xD;
the paths of the shrubbery, Faith hardly knew whither. In&#xD;
truth the doctor's conversation was amusing enough to&#xD;
leave her little care. Very few indeed were the words he&#xD;
drew from her; but with all their simplicity and modesty,&#xD;
he seemed to be convinced that there was something behind&#xD;
them worth pleasing; at least he laid himself out to please.&#xD;
He easily found that what she knew of life and the world&#xD;
was very little, and that she was very ready to take any&#xD;
glimpses he would give her into the vast unknown regions&#xD;
'so well known to him. Always in his manner carelessly&#xD;
graceful, Faith never dreamed of the real care with which&#xD;
he brought up subjects, and discussed them, that he thought&#xD;
would interest her. He told of distant countries 'and&#xD;
scenes-lie detailed at length foreign experiences-he dea&#xD;
scribed people-he gave her pictures of manners/and cusy&#xD;
toms,-all new to her ears, strange and delightful; and sd&#xD;
easip yet so masterly given, that she took it all in an easy&#xD;
full flow of pleasure. So it happened that Faith did not&#xD;
very well know how they turned and wound in and out&#xD;

through the walks; she was in Switzerland and at Paris&#xD;
and at Rome, all the while.d&#xD;
She came back pretty suddenly to Pattaquasset. As&#xD;
they paused to watch the glitter of one of the lamps on the&#xD;
shining leaves of a holly tree, several of the boys, seeking&#xD;
their own pleasure, came sauntering by. The last of these&#xD;
had time to observe her, and swaggering close up under&#xD;
her face said, loud enough to be heard,&#xD;
"You aint, neither !--I know you aint.  Reuben Taylor&#xD;
says you aint."&#xD;
The lamplight did not serve to reveal Faith's changes&#xD;
of face and colour, neither did Dr. Harrison wait to observe&#xD;
them.S&#xD;
"What do you mean, sir ?" he said, catching hold of the&#xD;
boy's arm. "Why do you speak so to a lady ?.--what isn't&#xD;
she ?"&#xD;
"Somebody's sweetheart," said the boy resolutely. "She&#xD;
aint. Reuben Taylor says she aint."P&#xD;
"You'll never be, my fine fellow," said the doctor letting&#xD;
him go,-"if you don't learn more discretion. I must tell&#xD;
Mr. Linden his boys want a trifle of something besides&#xD;
Algebra. That don't give all the relative values of&#xD;
things."S&#xD;
"Pray do not! don't speak of it, Dr. Harrison!1" said&#xD;
Faith.    %&#xD;
He tried to see her face, but he could not.&#xD;
"Hardly worth while," he, said lightly. "Boys will be&#xD;
boys-which is an odd way of excusing them for not being&#xD;
civilized things. However-if ,you excuse him, I will."&#xD;
Faith said nothing. She was trying to get over the sud-&#xD;
den jar of those words. They had not told her anything&#xD;
she- did not believe-she thought no other; but they gave&#xD;
her nevertheless a keen stir of pain-a revival of the pain&#xD;
she had quieted at Neanticut; and somehow this was worse&#xD;
than that. Could Reuben Taylor talk abort her so ?.-.&#xD;
could Reuben Taylor have any authority for doing it?&#xD;
But that question would not stand answering. Faith's red&#xD;
oak leaves were a little 2Egis to ,ber then, a tangible pre-&#xD;
cious representative of all the answer that question would&#xD;
not wait for. No sting of pain could eater that way. But&#xD;
the pain was bad enough; and under the favouring shadowy&#xD;

light of the lamps she strove and strove to quiet it ; while&#xD;
the 'doctor went on talking.&#xD;
"Indeed,"- said he-going on with the subject of Phil's&#xD;
speech,-" I am obliged to him for his information-which&#xD;
was of course incorrect. But I am very glad to hear it&#xD;
nevertheless. Other people's sweethearts, you know, are&#xD;
'tabooed'-sacred ground-not to be approached without&#xD;
danger to all concerned. But now-if you will allow me,&#xD;
I think I shall claim you for mine."&#xD;
Whatever look the words may have, they did not sound&#xD;
rude. They were said with a careless half-amused, half&#xD;
gentle manner, which might leave his hearer in doubt&#xD;
whether the chief purpose of them were not to fall plea-&#xD;
santly on her ear and drive away any disagreeable re-&#xD;
mainders of Phil's insolence. But Faith scarce heard him.&#xD;
She was struggling with that unbidden pain, and trying&#xD;
with all the simplicity and truth of her nature and with the&#xD;
stronget- help she had learned to seek, to fight it down.&#xD;
She had never thought such an utterly vain thought as&#xD;
that suggested in Phil's words ; in her humility and mo-&#xD;
desty she chid herself that it should have come into her&#xD;
head even when other. people's words had forced it there.&#xD;
Her humility was very humble now. And in it she quietly&#xD;
took up with the good she had, of which her roses were&#xD;
even then breathing sweet reminders in her face; putting&#xD;
from her all thought of good that did not belong to her&#xD;
and she could not deserve.&#xD;
The uncertain light favoured her well, or Dr. Harrison&#xD;
would have seen too much of her face-play. They had&#xD;
been going on and on, and the doctor had been as usual&#xD;
talking, and she had managed now and then to seem to&#xD;
give an answer-she never remembered to what ; and her&#xD;
part in the conversation all along had been so modestly&#xD;
small that the doctor hardly knew when or whether she had,&#xD;
cease. to comprehend him. But they emerged at last upon&#xD;
the lawn, where Faith was taken possession of and marched&#xD;
off by the old Judge, nothing loth.&#xD;
. The doctor casting about for another fish to throw his&#xD;
line at, spied Reuben Taylor, standing alone, and eying&#xD;
as Mr. Linden and -Faith had done the gay scene about&#xD;
the house, nowgay with the many-coloured lamps.&#xD;

"Well, my man, said the doctor easily accosting him as&#xD;
he stood there, "you did very well this afternoon. How&#xD;
long have you been at the school ?"&#xD;
Reuben made answer with his usual respectful courtesy.&#xD;
"Are you a friend of Miss Derrick's ?"&#xD;
"I think Miss Derrick. is my friend, sir," said Reuben&#xD;
with a little flush.&#xD;
"Is she ?" said the doctor. "Well don't you think that&#xD;
comes to the same thing ?"&#xD;
"No sir."&#xD;
"No? What's the difference? I'm not examining you&#xD;
now-I am asking for formationn..&#xD;
"I think you must know, sir," said Reuben, respectfully&#xD;
but firmly, after a glance at his questioner.&#xD;
"Do you ?" said the doctor laughing slightly. "Well,&#xD;
if you are.aot her friend, it don't signify. I was going to&#xD;
remark to you,'if you were, that ladies don't generally care&#xD;
to have their private affairs talked about, and however&#xD;
much you may know, it is not always -worth while to tell&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"I neither know nor have said anything, Dr. Harrison,"&#xD;
said Reuben, drawing himself up a little, and looking full&#xD;
in the doctor' face.'&#xD;
" You're Reuben Taylor, aren't you ?"&#xD;
" Yes sir-I'm not anybody else though."&#xD;
"No," said the doctor carelessly. "Well, it isn't neces-&#xD;
sary you should be, for present purposes. I heard you&#xD;
quoted as authority just now, on something which touched&#xD;
that lady's affairs, whose friend you say you are not-and&#xD;
I think, your friend though she may be, she was not par-&#xD;
ticularly gratified with your interference."&#xD;
"Miss Faith knew it was a wrong quotation," said Reu-&#xD;
ben quietly.&#xD;
"You are sure of that ?"&#xD;
"Quite sure, sir-if it was anything about her which I&#xD;
ought not to have said." -  .&#xD;
"Don't know that it was," said the doctor ; "it's well&#xD;
enough sometimes to set people right when they are&#xD;
wrong-what I say is, that ladies don't always thank one&#xD;
for it."&#xD;

"And I have nothing to add to mine,"' said the doctor&#xD;
lightly. "I heard you quoted-that's all; 1 supposed you&#xD;
would know what for."&#xD;
"Who did you hear, sir ?"&#xD;
"Don't know, really," said the doctor-"only he was a&#xD;
rude fellow-if you can tell one by such a description among&#xD;
your mates, it was he."&#xD;
And the doctor strolled away.&#xD;
Reuben on his part seemed to recognize the description,&#xD;
for taking a sort of intuitive bee-line through people and&#xD;
trees, he suddenly brought up with the question,&#xD;
"Phil Davids, what have you been saying about me ?"&#xD;
"I s'pose you think.folks, have nothing to do but talk&#xD;
about you now. You're a long way out !"-. was the care-&#xD;
less answer.&#xD;
"What did you say I said ?" said Reuben.&#xD;
"I never heard you say anything, as I know, that was&#xD;
worth tellin' over. When I do, I'll let somebody know it,&#xD;
I tell you."&#xD;
"I suppose that means that you won't answer my. ques.&#xD;
tion," said Reuben. "What I want to know is, not what&#xD;
I said, but what you say I aid."&#xD;
"About what?"&#xD;
"About Miss Faith Derrick."&#xD;
"I don't say you said nothing about her-I never heard&#xD;
you call her name, as I know."&#xD;
"Like enough," said Reuben, with a sort of resolute&#xD;
patience; "but what did you say I said that had to do with&#xD;
h'er in any way?&#xD;
"Who do yo think you air ?" said Phil.&#xD;
"I tell you what, Phil Davids," said Sam Stoutenburgh,&#xD;
who had heard the last question or two, "if you don't keep&#xD;
your tongue off Miss Derrick, I'l pitch you up into, a pine&#xD;
tree so far that you'll see stars before you come down-or&#xD;
I'm not Stoutenburgh nor stout, neither 1" and Sam-who&#xD;
was a little of a young giant-backed Phil up against the&#xD;

or two towards the lighted front and the clusterin'g guests,&#xD;
and he paused, leaving Sam to go on alone.&#xD;
Sam's bashfulness was happily not of the uncompromising&#xD;
kind, therefore he not only found Faith, but she found him-&#xD;
ready to claim her promise-the very moment she was&#xD;
ready to go,&#xD;
"But I don't know whether the wagon is here, Sam,"&#xD;
said Faith. Other wagons were come, and driving off, and&#xD;
a little procession of colours was setting forth on foot, up&#xD;
and down the street from Judge Harrison's. The hall was&#xD;
full of people, getting hoods on and taking leave.&#xD;
"Well, Miss Faith," said Sam, "we can walk to where&#xD;
it ought to be, and if it isn't th re maybe you'll let me go&#xD;
further."&#xD;
"But I can't go without seeing my mother, Sam, and I&#xD;
don't know where she is."&#xD;
"Sam Stoutenburgh !" said Mr. Linden's voice, while&#xD;
the speaker laid both hands on the boy's shoulders, "what&#xD;
are you about ?"&#xD;
"Miss Faith said I might go as far as the wagon with&#xD;
her, sir," said Satn looking down.&#xD;
"The wagon is not here," said Mr. Linden,-" Mr. Skip&#xD;
is probably asleep."&#xD;
"Then I may see you home, Miss Faith?" was the joyous&#xD;
comment.&#xD;
"Sam Stoutenburgh 1" said Mr. Linden again, prevent-&#xD;
ing Faith's reply, and giving Sam a gentle shake. "Isn't&#xD;
one favour a day enough for you ?" he added presently.&#xD;
&#xD;
"No sir!"- said Sam boldly.&#xD;
"I suppose I must give way before a blue ribband," said&#xD;
Mr. Linden smiling, yet as if hwas much inclined to lift&#xD;
Sam out of the way. "Miss Faith, the matter is in your&#xD;
hands."&#xD;
But Faith did not smile, and looked, or was it his fancy ?-&#xD;
ever so little careworn.&#xD;
"What matter, Mr. Linden ?" she said simply,&#xD;
"Whether you will take charge of this boy as far as his&#xD;
father's gate. I will try and take care of you, after that. P&#xD;
"Will that do, Sam ?" said Faith pleasantly, as she&#xD;
threw her scarf over her head.&#xD;
"I'm glad to go any distance with you, Miss Faith,"&#xD;
said Sam, but half content---or a quarter I for that was the&#xD;
distance assignedhim.&#xD;
"Well behave'yourself then," said Mr. Linden, removing&#xD;
his hands. A   parting injunction -Sam's dignity would&#xD;
have dispensed with.&#xD;

CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
T HE evening was very still. A little too cool for insect&#xD;
voices, a little too late in the season for night birds,&#xD;
the soft dropping of the yellow leaves scarce stirred those&#xD;
already fallen. )ew sounds came from the houses; for all&#xD;
Pattaquasset had been out, and that portion which had got&#xD;
home was tired and thinking of bed, while the few strag-&#xD;
glers yet abroad were far from the late scene of action, on&#xD;
their lonely homeward roads.  Squire Deacon, with Joe&#xD;
for a thorn in his. side, was opening his own door for Miss&#xD;
Cecilia, and Miss Bethia Bezac, at 'the other side of crea-&#xD;
tion,' mused over the possibility of again (without eyes)&#xD;
embroidering wajistcoats. Thus when the clock struck&#xD;
eight, the earth seemed asleep and the stars at watch Over it.&#xD;
At about that point of time, Sam Stoutenburgh and his&#xD;
fair companion were near the parting gate; and Sam, not&#xD;
supposing. himself within range of other eyes, had bent&#xD;
down over Faith's glove in a very demonstrative manner;&#xD;
and she would certainly have received an unwonted proof&#xD;
of his devotion, if Mr. Linden-who had in .truth been all&#xD;
the time not very- far off-had not just then been very near.&#xD;
"Take care, Sam-" he said,-"you are exceeding direc-&#xD;
tions." A remark which sent Sam through the gate with&#xD;
more baste than coolness, while Mr. Linden stepped for-&#xD;
ward into his place.&#xD;
"Your mother rode home with Mrs. Somers, Miss Faith,&#xD;
and this little shawl was requested to walk home with you,"&#xD;
he said, wrapping it round her; for which he received&#xD;
quiet little "Thank you." He put her hand on If&#xD;
and once past the gate walked very slowly; moder&#xD;
steps to hers, and taking the most leisurelypace;&#xD;
to give her the full sedative effect of the night.&#xD;
faint breaths of air, that soft hush of everything, that cle&#xD;
starry sky,-so high, so still,-there was balm in them a&#xD;
And for a while Mr. Linden let them do their wor&#xD;
alone,--then he spoke.;&#xD;
(186)&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.                  18&#xD;
"One of my scholars is very tired to night. I'm afraid I&#xD;
have done wrong in letting her walk home."&#xD;
"Q no !" said Faith with a little start,--" I"like to walk&#xD;
very much, Mr. Linden; it's very pleasant.-And I am&#xD;
not tired," she added in a soft quiet voice.&#xD;
"what is the difference between being tired, and being&#xD;
in want of rest?"&#xD;
She looked at him again, and her words did not come at&#xD;
once.&#xD;
"Isuppose the difference is, that in one case you can&#xD;
get what you want-and in the other, you have to wait for&#xD;
"Till when ?"&#xD;
She laughed, somewhat uneasily, and asked him what he&#xD;
meant.&#xD;
"I hardly know how to make my question plainer, Miss&#xD;
Faith. I suppose I am of an impatient disposition, but&#xD;
the idea of waiting an indefinite time for rest is not plea-&#xD;
sant to me."&#xD;
"But can you always get it as soon as you would like to&#xD;
have it ?"-Faith asked with a kind of timid doubt, as not&#xD;
knowing but his power mio-ht extend so far.&#xD;
"Why not ?-seeing rest is like some sweet wind, which&#xD;
cannot blow its soft gale till there is- a clear space for it,&#xD;
why should it linger when the space is clear ?-why not&#xD;
rest when we are weary ?"&#xD;
"But can you always get the clear, space for it ?" Faith&#xD;
asked, looking at him wonderingly.&#xD;
He smiled.&#xD;
"I am talking of what may be done, Miss Faith-not of&#xD;
what I do. But I wish you would let me try my powers&#xD;
for you to-night. How comes there to be a demand?-.&#xD;
w comes there not tolbe a supply ?"&#xD;
£ rest ?" said Faith.  "Oh there is! At least," she&#xD;
reluctantly,-"there will be.  There is now, Mr.&#xD;
"Equal to the demand ?"&#xD;
"Why do you ask me ?" she said, a little troubled.&#xD;
"I believe I have a bad habit of asking questions," said Mr.&#xD;
Linden-and his tone was apologetic in its very gentleness.&#xD;
"It is partly my fault and partly Pet's.".&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="188-189" xml:id="VAC8219-00000094"/>&#xD;
188             SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Partly whose? Mr. Linden," said Faith.   "I don't&#xD;
think it's a bad habit. Whose fault, did you say ?"&#xD;
"Pet's-my sister's,-into whose company I hope to&#xD;
send you soon again."&#xD;
" Oh-I mustn't thank you !"---Faith said, beginning and&#xD;
stopping herself somewhat comically.&#xD;
" I don't know whether you will thank me for taking&#xD;
you past your own gate, which I was about to do," said&#xD;
Mr. Linden. "And I don't know whether the social and&#xD;
astronomical days ought to agree-but Hesperus set some&#xD;
time ago."&#xD;
"I don't understand, Mr. Linden-" said Faith pausing.&#xD;
"You must not expect to understand all astronomical&#xD;
things till you have studied astronomy," he said with a&#xD;
smile. "The practical application of my words is to sleep-.&#xD;
-"' That knits up the ravelled sleeve of care;&#xD;
Worn labour's bath; balm of hurt minds.'"-&#xD;
With which soporific potion he bade her goodnight;&#xD;
and Faith went to her room marvelling what could have&#xD;
put into Mr. Linden's head just those particular words; and&#xD;
whether he had a quality of vision that could see through&#xD;
flesh and blood; and a little in doubt whether or not in the&#xD;
circumstances to find the words or the surmise 'balmy.'&#xD;
But if she wanted rest that night, or seemed to have&#xD;
wanted it, she had found it the pext day, for she was all&#xD;
like herself. To speak with her own scrupulosity, there&#xD;
was perhaps just a shade of quieter gravity on her face and&#xD;
touching her smile, than there had been the day before&#xD;
And that shade she kept.&#xD;
It is a notable fact, that when Pleasure with her wand&#xD;
has roused into lively motion the waters of some mortal&#xD;
lake, she straightway departs; taking with her the sparkle&#xD;
the dancing foam, and leaving the disturbed waves t&#xD;
posit at their, leisure the sediment which she has stir&#xD;
Withered leaves flung upon the bank, a spot here an&#xD;
of discoloured froth,-4these are what remain. Thus in&#xD;
quiet nooks and corners of Pattaquasset were trophies no,&#xD;
too bright of the celebration.  Thus did Pattaquasse&#xD;
people behold some of the hidden evil in their neighbours,'&#xD;
and ,likewise in themselves. The boys indeed maintained&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.                  1g9&#xD;
their serenity and kept Pleasure with them; but in other&#xD;
quarters there '4ere some heartburnings-most of all at&#xD;
Squire Deacon's. Relieved at first by the idea of a new&#xD;
rival-then by some intuitive belief thrown off that ground&#xD;
of comfort ; the Squire was much in the condition of the&#xD;
man who wanted to commit an assault upon every small&#xD;
boy he met-for, boys were to him representatives. But&#xD;
deprived by law of this.manly way of expressing his feel-&#xD;
ings, the Squire sought some other. For the boys, they&#xD;
laughed at him-and at pretty much everything else ; and&#xD;
having as I said managed to keep Pleasure with them, the&#xD;
faces that greeted Mr. Linden on Friday morning were&#xD;
unusually bright.&#xD;
Yet there were one or two exceptions. Sam Stouten-&#xD;
burghj was a little shamefaced in broad daylight-a little&#xD;
afraid of being laughed at ; and Reuben Taylor, the head&#xD;
of the blue ribbands, was under a very unwonted clou.&#xD;
It even'seemed as if the day (no thanks to Pleasure) ha4&#xD;
done some work for Mr. Linden: perhaps he was consider-&#xD;
ing how long he should be within reach of such ceremonies;&#xD;
or (perhaps) how soon he could be willing to put himself&#xD;
out of reach. And when he came home in the afternoon,&#xD;
it was with the slow, meditative step which reminded Faith&#xD;
of his first week in Pattaquasset.&#xD;
"You are tired now, Mr. Linden,".she said with a smile,&#xD;
but the burden of her remark in her eyes, as she met him&#xD;
in the porch.&#xD;
"Boys are an extraordinary. commodity to deal with !"&#xD;
he said i oking at her, but answering the smile too. "I&#xD;
think you are bewitching all mine by degrees. Why can-&#xD;
not you confine your conjurations to the black cats of the&#xD;
neighbourhood ?-like some of the real, respectable Purl-&#xD;
an witches.?"&#xD;
aith blushed very much at the beginning of this speech,&#xD;
1ughed at the last.&#xD;
"What have I done, Mr. Linden ? there are no black&#xD;
ts in the neighbourhood."&#xD;
"Is that' it ?" said Mr. Linden-" I shai ave to. import&#xD;
afew. You give me a great deal of trouli e, Miss Faith."&#xD;
" I, Mr. Linden ? I am very sorry ! What have I done ?"&#xD;
"1 don't know I-or at least but partially. There is&#xD;

&#xD;
Sam Stoutenburgh, making as much ado over his lessons as&#xD;
if his wits had forsaken him-which perhaps they ha4&#xD;
There is Reuben Taylor-I don't know what is the matter&#xD;
with Reuben," he said,.his tone changing, "but his last&#xD;
words to me were a very earnest entreaty that I wou  per.&#xD;
suade you to see him for five minutes; and when I wanted to&#xD;
know why he did not prefer his own request, all I c uld get&#xD;
was that he was not sure you would let him. Which gave&#xD;
me very little clue to the sorrowful face he has worn all&#xD;
day."&#xD;
Once more, and this time with the keen tinge of pain,&#xD;
the blood rushed in a flood to Faith's cheek and brow; and&#xD;
for a second- she put her hands to her face as if she would&#xD;
hide it. But she put them down and looked up frankly to&#xD;
Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"I am sure Reuben Taylor has done no wrong !" she&#xD;
said. "You may tell him so, Mr. Linden."&#xD;
"Wrong !" he said-"to you ?"-and the tone was one&#xD;
Faith did not know. Then with a manner that was like&#xD;
enough to the flinging of the little stone into Kildeer river,&#xD;
he added, "Yes, I will tell him. Miss Faith, I shall be&#xD;
down again directly, and then will you let me see that&#xD;
book?"- And he passed on upstairs.&#xD;
The book was on the table in the parlour when he came&#xD;
down, but Faith met him standing. With a. little timid&#xD;
anxiousness, she said,&#xD;
"I have done wrong now. Mr. Linden, I said I was sure&#xD;
Reuben had not done any, and you will not speak to him&#xD;
as if he had ?  Please don't speak to him at all-I will see&#xD;
him myself."&#xD;
The answering smile broke through some little cloud of&#xD;
feeling, in spite of him.&#xD;
"Ypu need not fear," he said,-"I know Reuben T&#xD;
lor. But you have got something else to think of just no&#xD;
Then placing a chair for her at the table, Mr. Linden;.&#xD;
up the little book and began his work of examination.&#xD;
perhaps it is not too much to- say that even Dr. Harris&#xD;
might have learned somewhat from the way it was carried&#xD;
on. A skilful and kind way of finding out what she did.&#xD;
not know, from what she, did; initiation and examining so 4&#xD;
carried on together that Faith found herself kn'owing where&#xD;
&#xD;
she thought she was ignorant,-more still, perhaps, a kiid&#xD;
of separate decision what 'she ought to learn, and ho*;&#xD;
which saved her the trouble of acknowledging and confess-&#xD;
ing; and all as gently done as if he had been dealing with&#xD;
some delicate winged creature, whose downy plumage&#xD;
would come off with a touch,-such was the threatened&#xD;
examination. She might flntter a little under his, hand,&#xD;
but the soft wings were unhurt.&#xD;
" Tell me first, Miss Faith," he said turning over the&#xD;
leaves, "what you have been doing here by yourself."&#xD;
"I have been all through it," she said; 'fluttering' sure&#xD;
enough,. yet as much with plesure as with timidity ; not&#xD;
at all with fear.&#xD;
"Will you work these     or me-" and he gave her&#xD;
half a dozen different tests on 'a bit of paper.&#xD;
She coloured, and he could see her hand tremble ; but&#xD;
she was not long doing them, and she did them well, and&#xD;
gave them back without a word and without raising her&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
"Well," said Mr. Linden, smiling a little as he looked at&#xD;
the paper, "if it takes half an hour to hear Charles twelfth&#xD;
his lesson, and Johnny gives you but one quarter the&#xD;
trouble, and Rob Waters about twice as much a 'Johnny,&#xD;
how much time will you spend upon them all ?"&#xD;
"It will be  bout an hour-wanting an eighth," she&#xD;
said without raising her eyes, but with a bit of a smile&#xD;
too.&#xD;
"I hear you and Johnny have arranged preliminaries,&#xD;
Miss Faith."&#xD;
"Yes," said Faith looking up brightly, "he came to&#xD;
shew me his ribband and to tell me last night. But I was&#xD;
almost sorry, Mr. Linden,-that you should send him away&#xD;
km you."&#xD;
For Johnny's sake, or my own ?"&#xD;
For his sake-certainly."&#xD;
'You need not speak so assuredly.there were two&#xD;
arties to the question-besides you. But I have him&#xD;
still, you know, in a way. What has been in hand since&#xD;
his little book was finished ?"&#xD;

"And Shakspeare," said Faith casting down her eyes.&#xD;
" I cannot let you confine yourself to the study of human&#xD;
nature," said Mr. Linden,-." that will never do. Charles&#xD;
twelfth and Shakspeare want ground to stand upon. Did&#xD;
you ever read anything of Physical Geography ?"&#xD;
She shook her head. " I don't know what that is, Mr.&#xD;
"Then I will   ave the pleasure o  introducing you.&#xD;
Ordinary er      y is but a shell without it. And if we&#xD;
accidentally go deeper down han the stratum of geography,&#xD;
I will try and bring you back safe. But Miss Faith, you&#xD;
have not done with this book yet-the subject-matter of it.&#xD;
I want you to carry that further."&#xD;
"Well," she said smiling,-"I like it. I am ready.&#xD;
What comes next, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"Did you pay any attention to the algebra part of the&#xD;
examination yesterday ?"&#xD;
"9Yes, I believe so. I paid attention to it  all-I didit&#xD;
understand what some of it was about, but I believe I know&#xD;
what you mean."&#xD;
How should you like to work with letters and signs&#xD;
instead of figures? By the way, Miss Faith, your sevens&#xD;
are too much like your nines, and if you drew a check for&#xD;
$500 with that five, you might find yourself paying out&#xD;
$800"&#xD;
She coloured again, but bowed her head in assent, quite&#xD;
ignoring in her interest in the subject the extravagance of&#xD;
the supposition by which he illustrated it.&#xD;
"You shall not say that again, Mr. Linden."&#xD;
"Don't pledge yourself for me," he said smiling,-" I am&#xD;
a lawless kind oA person, as perhaps you have found out.&#xD;
But if I were to spend one minute well on the first day of&#xD;
the year, and each succeeding day add to my well-spe&#xD;
minutes so many more as the year was days old-how m&#xD;
of December would be well spent ?"&#xD;
But Faith could not tell.&#xD;
"You see what is before you-" Mr. Linden said:"&#xD;
must work that out, Miss Faith, in more ways than one.&#xD;
Well tell me this-Which is nearest to us now.--my sister:&#xD;

SKY AND SEAL.                 193&#xD;
Faith coloured again, a good deal, and with some sorrow&#xD;
"I am glad you asked me," she said ;-."I want you&#xD;
should know4,-but I don't know anything abort that,&#xD;
Mr. Linden. I know a little, of course," she said correct-&#xD;
ing herself, "but I couldn't answer you."&#xD;
"But why can't you understandd," he said looking at her,&#xD;
"that I am just some old, torn, dog-eared book of ques-&#xD;
tions that you are looking into for the first time ? I don't&#xD;
like to be made to feel like a bran new schoolbook."&#xD;
Faith looked at him, and probably the words "old, torn,&#xD;
andc dog-eared" made a peculiar contrast, for her eye&#xD;
flashed and in spite of everything she laughed, her musical&#xD;
little laugh.&#xD;
"That sounds reasonable," said Mr. Linden. "I like to&#xD;
be laughed at. But Miss Faith-just suppose' for a mo-&#xD;
ment that there were tears in your eyes,--what could keep&#xD;
them from falling?"&#xD;
Faith's eyes opened and she took a little time to consider&#xD;
this proposition.&#xD;
"If I were very determined, I think I could do it," she&#xD;
said.&#xD;
"Suppose they got so far as the tip ends of your eye-&#xD;
lashes?" he said, with a little play of the lips.&#xD;
"They must come down, I am afraid," said Faith look-&#xD;
ing and wondering.&#xD;
"Because my determination couldn't reach them there, I,&#xD;
suppose," she said in unmitigated wonder. "There would&#xD;
be nothing to keep them up."&#xD;
"Unphilosophic !" he said gravely,-"I shall have to&#xD;
teach you both why your tears fall, and why they don't."&#xD;
She smiled, as very willing to be t ought, but with a face&#xD;

"I will make time, Mr. Linden,--if I don't find it. I&#xD;
have a goo I deal. You won't tire me."&#xD;
"You must not make time out of strength. Will you&#xD;
write me a French exercise every day, among other things?&#xD;
Yes Cindy," he said-" I understand,"-apparently quite&#xD;
aware that Faith did not.&#xD;
"I will try," said Faith, with a colour again that was not&#xD;
of French growth.&#xD;
"Well baint you coming? " said Cindy, who stood still as&#xD;
if she liked the prospect before her.&#xD;
"Yes, but I can find my own way," said Mr. Linden; at&#xD;
which gentle hint Cindy vanished. And Faith sprang&#xD;

"; Teaching all day," she said, and no tea either !",--&#xD;
And she was about to run off, then paused to say,&#xD;
"That is all, Mr. Linden ?N-odo you want to say any.&#xD;
thing more?.&#xD;
"It was not tea, Miss Faith,-Reuben is at the door.&#xD;
Will you see him?  Shall I bring him here or will you go&#xD;
there ?"..&#xD;
"I will go there," said Faith hurriedly. But Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den followed "her.&#xD;
"Reuben," he said, "Miss Faith will hear you-and I am&#xD;
ready to answer for your word with my own;"--then he&#xD;
went back into the sitting room and closed the door.&#xD;
But those words seemed to touch at least one sore spot&#xD;
in the boy's heart-he had to struggle with himself a mo-&#xD;
ment before he could speak. Then it was low and humbly.&#xD;
"Miss Faith-I don't know just what Phil has said&#xD;
about me,--I can't find out. But whatever iti1 there isn't&#xD;
one word of it true. I never said one word about" yo&#xD;
Miss Faith, that I wouldn't say to you, just the sam&#xD;
And Reuben looked as if he would have confronted&#xD;
I am quite sure of it, Reuben," Faith said very gent&#xD;
"I didn't need you to come and tell me so."&#xD;
He'looked up at her with both gladness and thanks in&#xD;
hI shouldn't have troubled you with my trouble at all,&#xD;
&#xD;
Miss Faith-only he said you were displeased with me--&#xD;
and I was afraid it night be true."&#xD;
"Who said I was displeased with you ?"&#xD;
An involuntary glance of Reuben's eye towards the&#xD;
closed door, seemed to say he did not want his words to go,&#xD;
far.&#xD;
"Dr. Harrison, Miss Faith. At least I thought he said&#xD;
so.n&#xD;
'"Did he speak to you ?"&#xD;
"Yes ma'am-'and just pushed my word ou't of the way&#xD;
when I gave it,-said it might be well enough to tell&#xD;
people but he didn't think you liked it.  And so I got&#xD;
vexed. I'm so used to Mr. Linden," Reuben said-as if&#xD;
in excuse.&#xD;
"Are you satisfied now, Reuben ?" said Faith, giving&#xD;
him a good look of her eyes.&#xD;
A little qualified his look was-perhaps because he had&#xD;
been too much troubled to have the traces go off at once;&#xD;
but there was no want of satisfaction in his,&#xD;
"0 yes, Miss Faith-I can't tell you how thankful I am&#xD;
to you! Goodnight, ma'am.&#xD;
Faith went back to the parlour. And then Mr. Linden,&#xD;
taking from his pocket a piece of broad dark blue ribband,&#xD;
and laying it lightly round Faith's shoulders, told her&#xD;
gravely, "that she was entitled to wear that for the rest of&#xD;
the evening."&#xD;
Faith matched the blue with red, and stood eying the&#xD;
ribband which she had caught as it was falling from her&#xD;
shoulders, seeming for a minute as if she had as much as&#xD;
she could bear. Rallying, she looked up at Mr. Linden&#xD;
to get a little more light as to what he expected of her, or&#xD;
-wbat he meant. But unless she could read a decided&#xD;
pinion that the two 'favours' looked better together than&#xD;
parate, his face gave her no information.- Then smiling&#xD;
said;&#xD;
"I don't mean that you must wear it-merely that you&#xD;
have the right."&#xD;
Faith gave another glance at his face, and then without&#xD;
more ado tiedather bl  neribatn rhind her waist, where a&#xD;
she still wore the white dress of yesterday, it skewed to&#xD;

very g6o advantage. She said nothing more; only as she&#xD;
was quitting the room now in earnest to get tea, gave him&#xD;
an odd, pleasant, half grateful, half grave little smile. Too&#xD;
many things however had been at work to admit of her&#xD;
coming down into quietness immediately. The red left her&#xD;
no more than the blue for the rest of that evening.                    CHAPTER     XVI.&#xD;
ATURDAY was but' a half holiday to Mrs. ID&#xD;
little family-unless indeed they called the&#xD;
play, which some of them did. It was spent thus.&#xD;
By Mrs. Derrick, in the kitchen, in the bed-ro&#xD;
over the house generally-with intervals at the ove&#xD;
By Mr. Linden in the sitting-room, where Fait&#xD;
from time to time as she got a chance, to begin some&#xD;
with him and learn how to begin others by herself&#xD;
morning glided by very fast on such smooth wh&#xD;
action, and dinner came with the first Natural Phi]&#xD;
lesson yet unfinished. It was finished afterwards h&#xD;
and then Mr. Linden prepared himself to go forth o&#xD;
expedition, of which he only said that it was a lon&#xD;
"I am going to petition to have tea half an ho&#xD;
than usual to-night, Miss Faith," he said.&#xD;
"Just half an hour later, Mr. Linden ?" she said s&#xD;
"You shall have it when you like."&#xD;
"I hope to be home by that time-if not don't w&#xD;
me. You will find all the materials for your Frenc&#xD;
else on mytable.&#xD;
Which intimation quickened Faith's steps about th&#xD;
she had beforehand to do, and also quickened a tr&#xD;
beating of her heart. It was not quiet-timidity an&#xD;
sure were throbbing together, and throbbing fast, wh&#xD;
turned her back upon the rest of the house and w&#xD;
Mr. Linden's room. She would have a good uninter&#xD;
time this afternoon, at any rate. And the material&#xD;
here,' as he had said,-all the materials; from book&#xD;
and shut, to the 'delicate white paper, and a pen&#xD;
might be the very one Johnny Fax thought 'could&#xD;
itself. Faith stood and looked at them, and then sa'&#xD;

when a knock came to the front door, which Faith did not&#xD;
hear. Cindy however had ears to spare, and presently in-&#xD;
formed Mrs. Derrick that a gentleman wished to see her.&#xD;
And in the sitting-room Mrs. Derrick found Dr. Harrison.&#xD;
"You haven't forgotten to remember me, I hope, Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick," he said as he took her hand. He looked very&#xD;
handsome, and very pleasant, as he stood there before her,&#xD;
and his winning ease of manner was enough to "propitiate&#xD;
people of harder temper than the one -he was just now&#xD;
dealing with.&#xD;
"No indeed !" said Mrs. Derrick; "I remember a great&#xD;
many things about you,"- (as in truth she did.) "But I&#xD;
daresay you've changed a good deal since then. You've&#xD;
been gone a great while, Dr. Harrison."&#xD;
"Do you hope I have changed ?-or are you afraid I&#xD;
have ?"&#xD;
"Why I don't think I said I did either," said Mrs. Der-&#xD;
rick smiling, for she felt as if Dr. Harrison was an old ac-&#xD;
qupintance. "And I suppose it makes more difference to&#xD;
you than to ,me, anyway." Which words were not blunt&#xD;
in their intention, but according to the good lady's habit&#xD;
were a somewhat unconscious rendering of her thoughts.&#xD;
"How's Miss Sophy, after her holiday? I always think&#xD;
play's the hardest work that's cone."&#xD;
" I am very sorry you found it so !" said the doctor.&#xD;
"You needn't be-" said Mrs. Derrick, rocking compla-&#xD;
cently and making her knitting needles play in a style that&#xD;
certainly might be called work,-" I've got over it now.&#xD;
To be sure I was tired to death, but I like to be, once in a&#xD;
while."&#xD;
The doctor laughed, as if, in a way, he had found his&#xD;
match.&#xD;
"And how is Miss Derrick ?" he asked. "If she was&#xD;
tired too, it was my fault."&#xD;
"I guess that 'll never be one of your faults, Dr. Harri-&#xD;
son," said Mrs. Derrick,--"it would take any amount of&#xD;
folks to tire her out. She's just like a bird always. 0&#xD;
she's well, of course,-or I shouldn't be sitting here."&#xD;
"And'so like a bird that she lives in a region above&#xD;
mortal view, and only descends now and then ?"&#xD;
"Yes, she does stay 'upstairs a good deal," said Mrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
Derrick, knitting away.  "Whenever she's got nothing to&#xD;
do down here.  She's been down all the morning."&#xD;
"I can't shoot flying at this kind of game," said the doc-&#xD;
tor;-"I'll endeavour to come when the bird is perched,&#xD;
next time. But in the meanwhile, Miss Derick seemed&#xD;
pleased the other night with these Chinese illuninations-.-&#xD;
and Sophy took it into her head to make me the bearer of&#xD;
one, that has never yet illuminated anything, hoping that it&#xD;
will do that office for her heart with Miss Derrick. The&#xD;
heart will bear inspection, I believe, with or without the&#xD;
help of the lantern."&#xD;
And the doctor laid a little parcel on the table. Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick looked at the parcel, and at the doctor, and knit a&#xD;
round or two.&#xD;
"I'm sure she'll be very much obliged to Miss Harrison,"&#xD;
she said.  "But I know I shan't remember all the message.&#xD;
I suppose that won't matter."&#xD;
-Not the least," said the doctor.  "The lantern is ex-&#xD;
pected to throw light upon some things. May I venture&#xD;
to give Mrs. Derrick another word to remember, which&#xD;
must depend upon her kindness alone for its presentation&#xD;
and delivery ?"&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick stopped knitting and looked all atten-'&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"It isn't much to remember," said tie doctor laughing&#xD;
gently.  "Sophy wishes very much to have Miss Derrick&#xD;
go with her to-morrow afternoon.  She is going to drive&#xD;
to Deep River, and wished me to do my best to procure&#xD;
Miss Derrick's goodwill, and yours, for this pleasure of her&#xD;
company.  Shall I hope that hertwish is granted ?"&#xD;
Now Mrs. Derrick, though ,not quick like some other&#xD;
people, had yet her own womanly instincts; and that more&#xD;
than one of them was- at work now, was plain enough.&#xD;
But either they confused or thwarted each other, for laying&#xD;
down her work she said,&#xD;
"I know she won't go--but I'll let her come and give&#xD;
her own answer;" and left the room. For another of&#xD;
hey woman's wits made, her never send Cindy to call Faith&#xD;
from her studies. Therefore she went up, and softly open-&#xD;
ing the door of the study room, walked in and shut it after&#xD;
her.&#xD;

"Pretty child," she said, stroking Faith's hair, "are you&#xD;
very busy ?"&#xD;
"Very, mother !"-said Faith looking up with a 'burning&#xD;
cheek and happy face, and pen pausing in her hand:&#xD;
"What then ?"-&#xD;
"Wasn't it the queerest thing what I said that day at&#xD;
Neanticut !" said Mrs. Derrick, quite forgetting Dr. Harri-&#xD;
son in the picture before her.&#xD;
"What, dear mother ?"&#xD;
"Why when I asked why you didn't het Mr. Linden to&#xD;
help you. How you do write, child !"-which remark was&#xD;
meant admiringly.&#xD;
"Mother !"--said Faith. "But it can be done"-she&#xD;
added with quiet resolution.&#xD;
"I'm sure it never could by me, in that style," said Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick, -I"my fingers always think they are ironing or&#xD;
making piecrust. But child, here's Dr. Harrison-come&#xD;
for nobody knows what, except that Sophy took it into her&#xD;
head to send her heart by him-as near as I can make out.&#xD;
And he wants you to go to Deep River to-morrow. I said&#xD;
you wouldn't-and then I thought maybe you'd better&#xD;
speak yourself. But if you don't like to, you sha'n't. Z&#xD;
can deal with him."&#xD;
"I don't want to see Dr. Harrison, mother !-To-more&#xD;
row ?" said Faith. '."Yes-I will see him."&#xD;
She rose up, laid her pen delicately out of her fingers,&#xD;
went down stairs and into the sitting-room, where she con-&#xD;
fronted the doctor.&#xD;
Faith was dressed as she had been at the party, with the s&#xD;
single exception of the blue ribband instead of the dPoak&#xD;
leaves; and the excitement of what she had been abou was&#xD;
stirring both cheek and eye. Perhaps some other stir was&#xD;
there too, for the flush was a little deeper than it had been&#xD;
upstairs, but she met the doctor very quietly. He thought&#xD;
to himself the lanterns had lent nothing with their illumi-&#xD;
nation the other night.&#xD;
"No, sir," she said as he offered her a chair,-"I have&#xD;
something to do;-but mother said-"&#xD;
"Will the bird perch for no longer than this?" said the&#xD;
doctor, turning w'th humourous appeal to Mrs. Derrick who&#xD;
had followed he .&#xD;
&#xD;
"My birds do pretty much as they like, Dr. Harrison,''&#xD;
said Mrs. Derrick. "They always did, even when I had&#xD;
'em in cages."&#xD;
"Then this bird is free'"now ?"&#xD;
"I guess you'd better talk to her-" said Mrs. Derrick,&#xD;
taking her seat and her knitting again.&#xD;
'"Miss Derrick !" said the doctor obeying this direction&#xD;
with an obeisance,--"you are free to command, and I can&#xD;
but obey. Will you go with Sophy to-morrow to Deep&#xD;
River? I am not altogether uninterested, as I hope to&#xD;
have the honour. of driving you; but she sends her most&#xD;
earnest wish."&#xD;
"To-morrow is Sunday, Dr. Harrison."&#xD;
"Well-isn't Sunday a good day ?"&#xD;
"It isn't mine," said Faith gently.&#xD;
"Not yours ?" said the doctor. "You have promised it&#xD;
away, and we are so unfortunate ?"&#xD;
Her colour rose a little, but it was with an eye as steady&#xD;
as it wassft that she answered him.&#xD;
"The day belongs to God, Dr. Harrison-and I have&#xD;
promised it, and myself, away to him."&#xD;
The doctor looked astonished for a minute.  And he&#xD;
gazed at her.&#xD;
"But, my dear Miss Derick, do you think there is any-&#xD;
thing contrary to the offices of religion in taking a pleasant&#xD;
drive, in a pleasant country, in pleasant weather? that is&#xD;
all."&#xD;
Faith smiled a little, gravely; it was-very sweet and-very&#xD;
grave.&#xD;
'There are all the other days for that," she said. "God&#xD;
as given us his work to be done on his day, Dr. Harrison;&#xD;
there is so much of it to do that I never find the day&#xD;
enough."&#xD;
/'You are right !" he said--"You are quite right. You&#xD;
are a great deal better than I am. I am sorry I asked&#xD;
you,-.and yet I am glad.-Then Miss Derrick, will you&#xD;
forgive me ? and will you some other day shew that you&#xD;
forgive me and be so good as to go with us?"&#xD;
But Faith's interest in the subject was gone.&#xD;
"I am very busy, sir," -she said. "I have work to do&#xD;
that I do not wish to put off."&#xD;

"Cannot you go with us at all? We will wait and make&#xD;

"Do not wait," said Faith. I could go, but I could not&#xD;
go with pleasure, Dr. Harrison. I have not the time to&#xD;
spare, for that, nor for more now. Please excuse me."&#xD;
And she went.&#xD;
"Mrs. Derrick," said the doctor musingly, "this is a&#xD;
winged creature, I believe-but it is not a bird 1"&#xD;
At which Mrs. Derrick looked at him with a mingled&#xD;
satisfaction that he had got his answer, and curiosity to&#xD;
know what he thought of it. For the further she felt her.&#xD;
self from her child's high stand, the more presuming did.&#xD;
she think it in an  one to try'to bring her downfrom it.&#xD;
"If I thought, as I came here, that I walked on a higher&#xD;
level than the generality of mankind, as perhaps in the&#xD;
vanity of my heart I did,-I feel well put down on the&#xD;
ground now," pursued the doctor. "But Mrs. Derrick,&#xD;
when may I hope to see this winged thing gf yours&#xD;
again ?"&#xD;
It must be confessed that Mrs. Derrick did not admire&#xD;
this speech,-' a winged thing,' as she justly thought, was a&#xD;
somewhat indefinite term, and might mean a flying grass-&#xD;
hopper as well as a canary bird. Therefore it was with&#xD;
some quickness that she replied,, .&#xD;
"What sort of a winged t     are you talking of, doc-&#xD;
tor?"&#xD;
"Nothing worse than' a heavenly one, madam. But&#xD;
angel or cherub are .such worn-out *terms that ,I avoided&#xD;
them."&#xD;
He was standing yet where Faith left him, looking down&#xD;
gravely, speaking halflightly, to her mother.&#xD;
"I don'tknow who l see her when she's an angel," said&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick, with a little flush coming over her eyes;&#xD;
"But she wouldn't thank you for calling her one now," she&#xD;
added presently, with her usual placid manner. "Won't&#xD;
you sit down again, doctor ?".&#xD;
" May I ask," said he eying. her, somewhat intent upon&#xD;
the answer,-." why she wouldn't thank me for calling her&#xD;
one now ?-by which I understand that it would incur her&#xD;
displeasure.".   .   .&#xD;
"Why-why should she ?" said Mrs. Derrick, who&#xD;
&#xD;
having dropped a stitch was picking it up with -intentxress&#xD;
"True !" said the doctor in his usual manner. "Angels&#xD;
don't thank mortals for looking at them. But Mrs.. Der-&#xD;
rick, when may such a poor mortal.as I, stand a chance of&#xD;
seeing this particular one again ?"&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick laid down her work.&#xD;
"Well you have changed.!" she said, "there's no doubt&#xD;
of that! ,I'don't recollect that you used to care so much&#xD;
abut seeing her when you were here before. If I don't&#xD;
forget, yoi set your dog on her cat. And as to when you'll&#xD;
see hgr again, I'm sure I can't tell, doctor. She's- a busy&#xD;
child, and folks out of the house have to do without seeing&#xD;
her till shefgds time to see them."  Whereat Mrs Der-&#xD;
rick smiled 4iion-Dr. Harrison with the happy conscious-&#xD;
ness that she was one of the folks in the house.  .&#xD;
The doctor stood smiling at her, with a half humqiiis&#xD;
quite pleasant expression of face.&#xD;
"Set my dog on her cat !" he exclaimed. "Tkat iswhj&#xD;
she would be angry with me for calling her a cherub !-&#xD;

The doctor sat down.&#xD;
"What shall I do !" he said. ".Kdvise me, Mrs. Derrick."&#xD;
"I know what I should have done if I'd got hold of&#xD;
you," said Mrs. Derrick. "I thought I never would speak&#xD;
to you again--but you see I've got over it."&#xD;
" I'm not sure it," said the doctor meditatively.&#xD;
.  'Folks out of the ouse'-well! It strikes me I've been.&#xD;

jWhere is Mr. Linden? is he 'out,' or 'in,' this fine day ?"&#xD;
"out this afternoon," said Mrs. Derrick.. "I was&#xD;

knew ivwas no use."&#xD;
"Yes,  should like to see him," said the doctor. "but&#xD;
as he is a mortal like myself, I suppose I can find him&#xD;
another time by the use of proper precautions."&#xD;
.And Dr. Harrison took his departure.&#xD;

"Are ypu busy yet, child ?"&#xD;
"Not quite through."&#xD;
"I thought," said Mrs. Derrick stepping softly into the&#xD;
room, "that we'd go down to the shore this afternoon, and&#xD;
maybe dig some clams. I don't know but it's too late for&#xD;
that-we might ride down and see. You're tired, pretty&#xD;
child-and other people won't like that a bit more than I&#xD;
do."&#xD;
"I'd like to go, mother -I'm almost done, and I'm&#xD;
not tired," Faith said. pith happy eyes.  "There is time, I&#xD;
guess, for Mr. Linden don't want tea as early as usual. I'll&#xD;
come soon."&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick withdrew softly, and again Faith was en-&#xD;

the work was presently finished, th books putup in order,&#xD;
and the papers, with the exercise o, top; and Faith stood,&#xD;
a moment looking down at it.. Not satisfied, but too&#xD;
humble to have any false shame, too resolute to doubt of&#xD;
being satisfied and of satisfying somebody else, by and by.&#xD;
And the intellectual part of her exercise she thought, and&#xD;
with modest reason, would satisfy him now. Then she&#xD;
went down to her mother, quite ready for the beach or for&#xD;
anything else.&#xD;
It was one of those very warm October days which un-&#xD;
leged people call Indian summer,-the foreground land-&#xD;
scape yellow with stubble fields and sered forest, the dis.&#xD;
tance blue with haze.  So soft and still, that the faint&#xD;
murmur of the wheels as they rolled  ng the sandy road&#xD;
sounded as if at a distance, and the twittering birds alone&#xD;
set off the silence. Now and then came a farm wagoit&#xD;
loaded with glowing corn, then the field where the bereaved&#xD;
pumpkins lay among the bundles of cornstalks....ts-&#xD;
men passed with, their guns, schoolboys with their n  gs,&#xD;
and many were-the greetings Faith received; for ince the&#xD;
day at Neanticut every boy thought he had. a rightto take&#xD;
off his hat to her. From the midst of his cornfield, Mr.&#xD;
Simlins gave them a wave of his hand,-from the midst of&#xD;
its blue waters the Sound sent a fresh welcome.&#xD;
"I declare, child," said Mrs. Derrick, as they neared thee&#xD;
shore, "it's real pleasant !"&#xD;
" The tide's out, mother," said Faith, who had the spirt&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
of action upon her to-day-" we can get .some clams now,&#xD;
if we're quick.&#xD;
"I don't know but you're learning to be spry, among&#xD;
other things," said her mother looking at her. "I thought&#xD;
you were as spry as you could be, before. What haven't&#xD;
you done to-day, child 1"&#xD;
-Faith laughed a little, and then jumping out of the wagon&#xD;
and helping her mother down, was certainly 'spry' in get-&#xD;
ting ready for the clam-digging. Her white dress had&#xD;
been changed for a common one and that was carefully&#xD;
pinned up, and a great kitchen apron was put on to cover&#xD;
all but the edges of skirts as-white as the white dress, and&#xD;
with shoes and stockings off, basket and hoe in hand, she&#xD;
stood ready almost before her mother had accomplished fas-&#xD;
tening up old Crab to her satisfaction. Mrs. Rerrick on&#xD;
her part prepared herself as carefully for work (though not&#xD;
quite so evidently for play) and the two went down to the&#xD;
flats. The tide was far out,-even the usual strips of water&#xD;
were narroV-and far apart. Wherever they could, the little&#xD;
shell-fish scrambled about and fought their miniature bat-&#xD;
tles in one-inch water; but at the edge of the tall shore-&#xD;
grass there was no water at all, unless in the mud, and the&#xD;
shell-fish waited, by hundreds, for the tide. Here was the&#xD;
scene of action for the two ladies. Walking daintily over&#xD;
the warm mud with their bare feet, which however white&#xD;
and twinkling at first were soon obliged o yield to circum-&#xD;
stances; disturbing the little shell-fish  who in turn dis-.&#xD;
turbed them, by very titillating little attacks upon the&#xD;
aforesaid feet,-Mrs. Derrick and Faith marched up to the&#xD;
edge of the grass and there sought for clam holes. The&#xD;
war went on after this fashion. A clam hole being found,&#xD;
the hoe was struck far down into the mud to unearth the&#xD;
inhabitant; which the clam resenting, spit up into the in-&#xD;
truder's face. But the intruder-proof against such small&#xD;
fire--repeated the strokes, and the clam was soon brought&#xD;
to light and tumbled ignominiously into the basket,-to be&#xD;
followed every second or two by another of his companions ;&#xD;
or the clam holes were many. The basket was soon full,&#xD;
but not before the cool ripple of the tide had passed the&#xD;
liuscle rocks and was fast coming in-shore.&#xD;

bringing herself once more to an erect position-" I told&#xD;
Dr. Harrison so this morning. How you and Mr. Linden&#xD;
stand it, Faith, I don't know."&#xD;
"What, mother ?" said Faith, maki g a descent upon&#xD;
another promising clam shell. But M s. Derrick always&#xD;
preferred to go on with her remarks.&#xD;
"1It's good he's doing it, for his own sake, I guess," she&#xD;
said,-" he's done nothing but work ever since he came to&#xD;
Pattaquasset."&#xD;
"Doing what, mother ?" said Faith. "What are you&#xD;
talking of?"&#xD;
"Why I'm talking of you, child !" said her mother,-.&#xD;
"you and Mr. Linden. Ode of you played all the morning&#xD;
and the other's going to play all the afternoon. But I&#xD;
think you've done enough, Faith-it won't do to get sick&#xD;

I don't believe he's much of a doctor."&#xD;
"Played all the morning ?" said Faith taking up her&#xD;
basket,-" it was better than play to me. I wish I could&#xD;
do something for him, mother !"&#xD;
Very gravely, and-even a little sorrowfully, the last words&#xD;
were said.&#xD;
"Why yes," said-Mrs. Derrick stoutly. "Never tell me&#xD;
it's anything but play to te h ou, child-he didn't look&#xD;
as if it was, neither. I though he got his pay as he went&#xD;
along."&#xD;
Faith knew he had looked so; but that was not Faith--.&#xD;
it was Mr. Linden, in her account.'&#xD;
"Dr. Harrison ought to be a good.doctor, mother," she&#xD;
remarked, leaving the subject. " He has had chance&#xD;
enough."&#xD;
"La, child," said Mrs. Derrick, untying her apron,&#xD;
"chance don't prove anything. A man may have just as&#xD;
good a chanceAo kill as he has to cure. By which I don't&#xD;
mean that he has, for I don't know."&#xD;
"The tide is coming in, mother. We came just in the&#xD;
very point of the time. How pretty it is !-" said Faith;&#xD;
standing in the blue mud, with her bare feet, and with the&#xD;
basket of clams in her hand, but standing still to look off&#xD;
ate the flats and. the dark water and the hazy opposite&#xD;
shore, all with the sunny stillness and the soft enveloping&#xD;
&#xD;
haze of October lying lovingly upon them. ,Faith thought&#xD;
of the 'glory' again, and watched to see how water and&#xD;
shore and flats and sky were all touched with it. One or two&#xD;
sails on the Sound could not get on; they lay still in the&#xD;
haze like everything else; and the'glory' was on them too.&#xD;
She thought so. It seemed to touch everything. And&#xD;
another glory touched everything,--the glory of truth Faith&#xD;
had only for a little while come to know. She recognized&#xD;
it; there was 'light from heaven' in more senses than one;&#xD;
the glow of joy and hope unknown a while before; the&#xD;
softening yeil of mind-peace over whatever might be harsh&#xD;
or sharp in actual reality. She did not run out all the&#xD;
parall1, but she felt it, and stood looking With full eyes.&#xD;
Not full of tears, but of everything pleasarit beside.&#xD;
Then came the drive home, with the air darkening every&#xD;
minute, but notwithstanding this, Mrs. Derrick stopped by&#xD;
the way.&#xD;
"Faith," she said, "hold the reins, child-I won't(be a&#xD;
second, but I've got something to see to in here;" and&#xD;
Faith was once more left to her meditations.&#xD;
Not for long ; for as she sat gazing out over old crab's&#xD;
ears, she was 'ware' of some one standing by the wagon:&#xD;
it was Squire Deacon.&#xD;
"I    commence to think I'm a lucky man, after al l!"&#xD;
- ai  e Squire. "I was coming down to see you, Miss&#xD;
Faith,.--and couldn't just resolve my mind to it, neither.&#xD;
I wanted to pay a parting visit."&#xD;
"Were you?.-are you going away, Squire Deacon ?"&#xD;
"Why yes," said the Squire, looking down at his gun.-&#xD;
for he had been shooting,-"I've had considerable thoughts&#xD;
of taking a turn down to York. Cilly says she don't think&#xD;
it's worth my while-but I guess she don't know much&#xD;
more 'n her own concerns. Pattaquasset's a good deal&#xD;
come round this season," he added, without specifying&#xD;
which way.&#xD;
"Do you mean that you intend to forsake Pattaquasset&#xD;
entirely ?" said Faith, noticing the comfortable supply of&#xD;
ducks in the Squire's bag.&#xD;
"Well I can't just say-I'm not free to certify," said the&#xD;
Squire. "I said I thought it was worth my while to go,&#xD;
and so. I do. I should like to know from your lip's, Miss&#xD;

&#xD;
Faith; whether you'll make it worth my while to coa&#xD;
back."&#xD;
Faith was very glad it was so dark-..&#xD;
"I don't see how I can touch the question either way,&#xD;
sir," she said gently and with not a little difficulty.-.&#xD;
"Wherever you are, I hope you'll be very happy, and very&#xD;
good, Squire Deacon."&#xD;
"I should like something a little better grown than that,&#xD;
ma'am," said the Squire, striking his gun on the ground.&#xD;
"I can't just tell whether that's wheat or oats. It's likely&#xD;
my meaning's plain enough."1&#xD;
Faith was dumb for a minute.&#xD;
"I believe I understood you, sir," she said in a low voice,&#xD;
"I meant to answer you."&#xD;
"Well what's to hinder your doing it, then ?" said Squire&#xD;
Deacon.&#xD;
"I. thought I had done it," said Faith. "I have nothing&#xD;
to do with the question of your coming or going anywhere,&#xD;
sir,-and can't have,--except to wish you well, which I do&#xD;
heartily."&#xD;
"That's your ultimate, is it, Miss Faith ?"&#xD;
"No, sir," said Faith, conquering the beating of her&#xD;
heart. "Squire Deacon, I want to see you in heaven."'&#xD;
And she stretched out to him her little hand frankly&#xD;
over the side of the wagon.&#xD;
Squire Deacon took it for a moment--then dropped it&#xD;
as if it had burnt his fingers. And then with a voice in&#xD;
which whether sorrow or anger prevailed Fait* could not&#xD;
tell, he said-&#xD;
"Well-i don't blame you,-never did and never shall.&#xD;
Cunning's been too much for me this time." And he took&#xD;
up his gun and strode off, just as Mrs. Derrick opened the&#xD;
house door and came out to take her place in the wagon&#xD;
again.&#xD;
"Dear mother !" said Faith,-"why didn't you come&#xD;
sooner !"I&#xD;
"Why I couldn't, child I" said Mrs. Derrick. "That&#xD;
woman al ays will tell one every pain and ache she's had&#xD;
since the y ar one. What's the matter ?-why didn't you&#xD;
tie Crab iid come in, if you were lonesome." '&#xD;
Faith Was silent.&#xD;
&#xD;
"What's the matter?" repeated her mother,-'have&#xD;
you been getting sick after all I said to you?"&#xD;
"Squire Deacon has been hefe talking- to me," said Faith&#xD;
in a low tone.&#xD;
"Well then you hacompany, I'm sure. What did he&#xD;
talk about ? Come, Cra !-get on, sir !"&#xD;
"He says he is going away'from Pattaquasset, and he&#xD;
lays it to me, mother," she said after some hesitancy again.&#xD;
"What does he lay it to you, for ?" said Mrs. Derrick.&#xD;
"I don't believe he's going away, to begin with."&#xD;
"He wanted me to say something to bring him back&#xD;
again," said Faith lower yet.&#xD;
"0 is that allI" said Mrs. Derrick composedly. "I&#xD;
knew that gun was loaded, long ago. Well what's the&#xD;
harm if he did ?-it's not dangerous."&#xD;
"I'm sorry," said Faith. "But mother, do make Crab&#xD;
get on 1-it's time."&#xD;
"It's riot late," said Mrs. Derrick. "And don't you fret&#xD;
about Sam Deacon, child,-he always was a little goose-&#xD;
till he got to be a big one; but you needn't think he'll ever&#xD;
shoot himself for love of you,-he loves himself better than&#xD;
that."&#xD;
And at this point, Crab-roused by the thought of his&#xD;
own supper-set off at a good round trot which soon brought&#xD;
them home. There was nobody there however, not -even&#xD;
Cindy; so the need of haste did not seem to have been&#xD;
urgent. Faith soon had the kitchen fire in order, and her&#xD;
clams in the pot, and was for the next half hour thoroughly&#xD;
busy with them. Then she made herself ready for tea, and&#xD;
the mother and daughter sat together by the lamp, the one&#xD;
with her knitting the other with her book. But the extra&#xD;
half hour was already past.&#xD;
"Faith," said Mrs. Derrick at last, "why wouldn't Mr.&#xD;
Linden do the other thing you asked him to ?"&#xD;
Faith looked up suddenly from her book, as if not under-&#xD;
standing the question; then her head and her voice drooped&#xD;
together.&#xD;
"I haven't asked him yet, mother.&#xD;
"I didn't know but he''d some objection,"said Mrs. Der-&#xD;
rick. "Well I wish he'd come-I want my supper. I'm&#xD;
as tired as tired can be, paddling round there in the mud.&#xD;

&#xD;
How -did you like your lantern, child ?" she said as the&#xD;
clock struck half past seven.&#xD;
Faith raised her head and listened first to the clock and&#xD;
for any sound that mightobe stirring. near the house; then&#xD;
answered&#xD;
"I haven't looked at it, mother."&#xD;
"What do you think of having supper ?"&#xD;
"Before Mr. Linden comes, mother ?-well, if you like&#xD;
it, I'll get you yours-the clams are ready."&#xD;
"I don't care," said her mother,-" I'm more sleepy than&#xD;
hungry.  I'll just lie down here on the sofa, Faith, and you&#xD;
,can wake me up when you hear him." And disregarding&#xD;
the cooked clams in the kitchen, Mrs. Derrick went to&#xD;
sleep and dug them all over again.&#xD;
The clock ticked on,--softly, steadily, from the half hour&#xD;
to the hour, and from the hour to the half.  Out of doors&#xD;
there was nothing stirring, unless the owl stirred between&#xD;
his unmusical notes, or Mr. Skip's dog did something but&#xD;
howl. Hardly a wagon passed, hardly a breath moved the&#xD;
leaves. Cindy, on her part, was lost in the fascinatiogof&#xD;
some neighbouring)kitchen.&#xD;
And Faith at first' had been lost in her 4kudy. But the&#xD;
sounding of eight o'clock struck on more than the air, and&#xD;
she found, though she tried, she could not shut herself up&#xD;
in her book any more. Mrs. Derrick slept profoundly; her&#xD;
breathing only made. the house seem more still. Faith&#xD;
went to the window to look, and then for freer breath and&#xD;
vision went to the door. It was not moonlight; only the&#xD;
light of the stars was abroad, and that still further softened&#xD;
by the haze or a mistiness of the air which made it thicker&#xD;
still. Faith could see little, and could hear nothing, though&#xD;
eyes and ears tried well to penetrate the still darkness of&#xD;
the road, up and down.   It was too chill to stay at the&#xD;
porch, now with this mist in the air; and reluctantly she&#xD;
came back to the sitting-room, her mother sleeping on the&#xD;
sofa, her open study book under the lamp, the Chinese lan'&#xD;
tern in its packing paper. Faith had no wish to open it&#xD;
now. There was no reasoib to fear anything, that she&#xD;
knew; neither was she afraid; but neither could she rest.&#xD;
half past eight struck. She went to the window again,&#xD;
and very gravely sat down by it.&#xD;
&#xD;
She had sat there but few minutes when there camera&#xD;
rush of steps into the porch, and Cindy burst into the,, little&#xD;
sitting-room, almost too out of breath to speak.&#xD;
"Here's a proclamation !" she said-" Mr. Linden's been&#xD;
shot at dreadful, and Jem Waters is down to fetch Dr.&#xD;
Harrison. I'm free to confess they say he aint dead&#xD;
yet."&#xD;
With which pleasing announcement, Cindy -rushed off&#xD;
again, out of the room and out of the house, being seized&#xD;
with a sudden fear that Jem Waters would forestall her in&#xD;
spreading the news. The noise had awaked Mrs. Derrick'&#xD;
and she sat looking at Faith as if she was first in her&#xD;
thoughts. Faith stood before her with a colourless face,&#xD;
but perfectly quiet, though at first( she looked' at her&#xD;
mother without speaking.&#xD;
"Come here, pretty child," said her mother, "and sit&#xD;
down by me."'.                        -    '&#xD;
"Mother," said Faith,-but she would not have known&#xD;
her own voice,-"something has happened."&#xD;
But the way Mrs. Derrick's arms came round her, said&#xD;
that shy too had heard.&#xD;
"Where can he be, mother ?" said Faith gently disen-&#xD;
gaging herself.&#xD;
"I don't know, child."&#xD;
Faith was already at the door.&#xD;
"Faith !" her mother said, following her with a quick&#xD;
step,-" stop, child !"&#xD;
Faith put back a hand as if to stop her--she was list-&#xD;
ening.&#xD;
There was nbt a sound. Faith went down the steps and&#xD;
stood at the gate. Not a sound still; and her mother said&#xD;
softly, "Faith, you must not go out."&#xD;
She put one hand on her mother's arm, and clasping it&#xD;
stood without stirring; her other hand on the gate. In&#xD;
mingled sorr9gw and fear her mother stood, not knowing&#xD;
well what to do or what to say,-.-in that emergency where&#xD;
woman can only endure-where she is powerless but to&#xD;
suffer. Faith stood without moving head or )and.&#xD;
And so they- remained, they knew .not hown101g, until&#xD;
Cindy once more presented herself and told her story more&#xD;
at length.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
&#xD;
N that eventful evening, Mr. Simlins had a husking bee;&#xD;
and in his barn were met a fair representation of the&#xD;
Pattaquasset men and boys-especially boys. And with&#xD;
busy hands and tongues the work went on,.Mr. Simlins&#xD;
himself among the busiest. But in the midst of work and&#xD;
merriment though the fair stillness of the night was un-&#xD;
heeded, the sudden interruption which came brought every'&#xD;
one to his feet; it was a loud shriek frdm the house, 'a&#xD;
woman's shriek.&#xD;
"Hold on !" said Mr. Simlins-r" you all go ahead and&#xD;
Il go quiet the distractions. I suppose Mrs. Hummins&#xD;
has seen another rat in the dairy. No-thank'ee-I like&#xD;
to kill my own rats myself and then I know they air&#xD;
killed."&#xD;
So letting nobody follow him, Mr. Simlins Jeft the barn&#xD;
and went over to the house. In the kitchen he found the&#xD;
full array of female servants, of his own house and the&#xD;
neighbours', one of whom hiding her face was rocking back&#xD;
and forth with the most incoherent exclamations ; while all&#xD;
the rest, standing by in various attitudes, seemed to have&#xD;
got an extra pair of eyes apiece for the express purpose of&#xD;
looking on.&#xD;
"Well !"-said Mr. Simlins-"where is it ? I've got my&#xD;
stick ready. Hain't bit anybody, has he ?-O  has some-&#xD;
body got my silver spoons? What's to pay ?"&#xD;
Now silver spoons there were none in Mr. Simlins' econo-&#xD;
my, and this was a proverbial expression well known in the&#xD;
household.&#xD;
"0 Mr. Simlins ! Mr. Simlins !" cried the hysterical one,&#xD;
with a shudder, "there's a murdered man at the front door !&#xD;
--and I did shut it, but he might come round this way !"&#xD;
"You be hanged ! and shut up !"-was Mr. Simlins' re-&#xD;
mark in answer to this statement; and flinging down his&#xD;
stick on the kitchen floor with a rattle, he strode, to the&#xD;

front door and opened it, having had the precaution to take&#xD;
a candle with him.&#xD;
There was certainly a figure there, not standing, but jt.&#xD;
ting on the bench in an attitude that spoke of faintness;&#xD;
and of all the men in Pattaquasset, Mr. Simlins was per-&#xD;
haps most surprised  to see that it wad Mr. Linden. A&#xD;
white handkerchief ineffectually bound round his arm, but&#xD;
served to shew why he had tried to secure it there.&#xD;
Mr. Simlins surveyed it all with his candle in about three&#xD;
seconds, and then said hoarsely, "What's this?  Can you&#xD;
speak to me&#xD;
But the power for that Was gone, though a little parting&#xD;
of the lips spoke the intent.. Mr. Simlins set down his&#xD;
candle and-went back to the kitchen.&#xD;
"Get some brandy, you fools.!" said he. "Here's a friend&#xD;
o' mine got faint for want of his supper -been too long&#xD;
out shootin'. Fetch a glass of water here too!1 Jenny&#xD;
Lowndes, you go tell Jem Waters that 'ere plaguey black&#xD;
heifer has got outi of the yard. You send him to me, and&#xD;
if y.ou spile the frolic with your story I'll have nothing&#xD;
more to do with you, I give yu my word1"&#xD;
Mr. Simlins was obeyed. He himself went back with the&#xD;
water and the brandy, which he tenderly applied to Mr,&#xD;
Linden's forehead and lips, and seeing the handkerchief's&#xD;
ineffectual disposition had taken it off and bound it on tight&#xD;
by the time Jem Waters, one of his farm    hands, had&#xD;
reached the porch.  The two then taking the sufferer in&#xD;
their arms carried him into the house and into Mr. Simlins'&#xD;
room, which was on the first floor, where they laid him on&#xD;
the bed. Jem Waters was then despatched for Dr. Harri.&#xD;
son, with orders to hold his tongue and not say what he was&#xD;
sent for. A    Jem Waters, the swiftest runner in Patta-&#xD;
quasset, set o  and ran every step of the way, till the doc-&#xD;
tor was found,&#xD;
The cold applications, the resting posture, seemed to do&#xD;
their work, and Mr. Simlins was rewarded with a smile from&#xD;
both eyes and lips. He did not speak again however till&#xD;
he had seen a spoonful of brandy enter the lips ; then with&#xD;
a grave concern that did not seem like Mr. Simlins, he said,&#xD;
in a subdued tone,&#xD;
" How do you find yourself? Can you speak now?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Not much-" Mr. Linden answered with some effort,&#xD;
"I find myself in very kind hands."&#xD;
"Are you hurt anywhere else ?"&#xD;
"Somewhat-the shot scattered, I think,"&#xD;
There was a smothered execration, and then it was a&#xD;
very kind hand that renewed the touch of cold water to his&#xD;
forehead, though a big, brown and rough one.&#xD;
"I've sent for the doctor-and now I'll get you a nurse.&#xD;
You keep quiet, till you can do something else."&#xD;
Mr. Simlins gently went forth; and in a minute after was&#xD;
in the midst of his husking party in the barn.&#xD;
"Reuben Taylor !" said the farmer-" You don't mind&#xD;
takin' a run, do you ? Wouldn't you just as lieves help me&#xD;
catch that black heifer--afore she gets to Pequot ?"&#xD;
Reuben started up, and signified his ability to catch any-&#xD;
thing whatever. He was not alone; for half a dozen others&#xD;
volunteered to be.equally ready.&#xD;
"You keep where you be !" said the farmer with a wave&#xD;
of his hand- to the half dozen. "I don't let everybody&#xD;
chase that 'ere heifer-you've got to catch her by the head&#xD;
and not by the foot, I tell you! Reuben, you come along."&#xD;
And getting him well outside of the barn and half way&#xD;
towards the house; Mr. Simlins said in a very low growl&#xD;
indeed,&#xD;
"Mr. Linden's here -he's been hurt, somehow, in his&#xD;
arm-and he's kind 'o faint; I want you to stay by him till&#xD;
the doctor comes, and then let me know. If I don't keep&#xD;
in the barnthey'll raise Plute-or they'll come in-and I'd&#xD;
as lieves tlrey'd do one as 'tother."&#xD;
By this time Mr. Simlins had reached the door of his&#xD;
room, and ushered Reuben in. He heard-and long re-&#xD;
membered-the smothered cry which seemed to come no&#xD;
further than Reuben's lips as he stepped within the door;&#xD;
but after .that the boy might. have been made of iron, for&#xD;
his strength and steadiness. He walked up to the bedside&#xD;
and knelt down by it, with a look which again Mr. Simlins&#xD;
could not soon forget; but his face was quite calm, except&#xD;
in the first moment when Mr. Linden looked at him. The&#xD;
farmer was a man of iron too, yet his voice was low and&#xD;
changed from its usual wont when he spoje.&#xD;
"it's only loss of. blood, I guess," he said. "He'll get&#xD;

along.. You give him brandy, and water, Reuben, if he&#xD;
wants it; and call me when Dr. Harrison comes. Can&#xD;
do anything else ?"  The last wbrds were gently, even ten,&#xD;
derly, addressed to the sufferer.&#xD;
"No-" Mr. Linden said, with that same pleasant look&#xD;
of the eyes.  "I think there is not much lie matter-ex.&#xD;
cept what you said." (&#xD;
Mr. Simlins stalked off and was rather more grim than&#xD;
usual in the barn. The huskers had returned to their mer.&#xD;
riment, and the slight sound of wheels in the roil from&#xD;
time to time of course attracted no attention. Kfter one&#xD;
of these signals, however, Jem Waters appeared at the&#xD;
front door.&#xD;
" Mr. Simlins there's a gentleman wants to see yer. I'll&#xD;
take yer place."&#xD;
Very few strides did Mr. Simlins make between the barn&#xD;
and the house, and slight was his stay of greeting to IDr,&#xD;
Harrison.&#xD;
"He's in here-" said he leading the way.&#xD;
Reuben was just as Mr. Simlins had left him,-it seemed&#xD;
as if he had not once taken his eyes from the calm face&#xD;
before him. For very calm it was-reposeful; with not a&#xD;
line disturbed except where a slight contraction of the&#xD;
brow told of some physical discomfort. But he was not&#xD;
asleep, for he looked at them the moment they entered;&#xD;
and Reuben rose then, and stood leaning against the bedpost.&#xD;
"I'm sorry to see you so," said the doctor. "What's the&#xD;
matter? and where ?"&#xD;
A little smile, a glance towards the bandaged arm,&#xD;
seemed to say there was nothing very bad, but that what&#xD;
there was it would be easier for him to have the doctor find&#xD;
out for himself.&#xD;
Nor further did the doctor ask, but proceeded to work.&#xD;
And it appeared soon that Dr. Harrison at play, and Dr.&#xD;
Harrison at work, were two people-yet the same ! The&#xD;
doctor did not indeed play at his work ; yet the work was&#xD;
done with the same skilful ease that he brought to his play;&#xD;
an ignorant eye could see as much ; and Mr. Simlins jeal-&#xD;
ously looking on, felt very soon at ease as to the doctor's&#xD;
part in the scene before him. Dr. Harrison knew his busi-&#xD;
ness, and knew it well.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Linden's coat was removed, in the course of which&#xD;
operation a keen glance of the doctor's eye over at Reuben&#xD;
shewed that he recognized, him; but then he attend;l to&#xD;
nothing but his patient. He found that a number of dqek&#xD;
shot had been lodged in Mr. Linden's side and arm, the&#xD;
latter of which was somewhat lacerated, and this was the&#xD;
principal wound. The others were slight, the shot having&#xD;
taken a slanting direction and so rather grazed than pene-&#xD;
trated. Dr. Harrison with care and skill went on to extract&#xD;
the shot and dress the wounds, which he did after the happy&#xD;
and simple regimen of modern discoveries; .and ordered&#xD;
certain restoratives which he judged his patient needed.&#xD;
He did not. sp ak except on- business till he had seen&#xD;
these doing th  Ir work and Mr. Linden able to reply to&#xD;
him. And then his first words were to the farmer ; who,&#xD;
not asking a question, had stood by as silent and watchful&#xD;
as Reuben himself; nearly as grave.&#xD;
"There's nothing the matter with him, Mr. Simlins," he&#xD;
said. "He'll be able to shoot you in a day or two --if he&#xD;
has a mind. What have you beef doing to him ?"&#xD;
"Me! I've been actin' the part of the good Syrian. to&#xD;
him," growled Mr. Simlins; -"only I always thought&#xD;
before, the oil and wine went on the outside instead of&#xD;
the inside."&#xD;
"I dare, say," said the doctor lightly, probably not&#xD;
understanding the allusion. And then he seated himself&#xD;
on the side of the bed, looking down at his patient very&#xD;
much in his usual manner.&#xD;
"You'll have made yourself the hero of Pattaquasset,&#xD;
Linden," he said. . 1"There won't' another fellow stand a&#xD;
chance to be looked/at for a month to come-from here to&#xD;
Quilipeak. You ought to be indicted for breach of the&#xD;
public peace."&#xD;
"Don't try it-" said Mr. Linden. "I should doubtless&#xD;
prevail with the jury too."&#xD;
"Ha ?..-" said the doctor with another glance over at&#xD;
Reuben.  "Now how did this come about ?"&#xD;
"Quite suddenly-as I was walking home.'"&#xD;
"Where were you?"&#xD;
"About a mile from here, in the open road."&#xD;
"Who was fool enough to be shooting ducks in the open&#xD;

gave out."&#xD;
"Why how did the thing happen?" said the doctor.&#xD;
"Run !-you don't suppose the fellow meant to hit you?"&#xD;
"He meant to run-" said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
The doctor looked at Mr. Simlins, with a serio-comical&#xD;
expression.&#xD;
"Worse and worse !" said he. "It is a full-grown, rega.&#xD;
lar built adventure; and this is a hero from head to foot."&#xD;
"Which way did the fellow run ?" said Mr. Simlins, with&#xD;
a growl that was ominous.&#xD;
"Straight ahead-till he got into the woods," said Mr.&#xD;
Linden, smiling at his host. "But he probably turned&#xD;
there, Mr. Simlins."&#xD;
"I'll have him 1" said Mr. Simlins-" I'll foller his tracks,&#xD;
if they lead me to the two poles of the axletree! You tell&#xD;
me where you see him, and I'll set runners on, that won't&#xD;
give out neither."&#xD;
" They'd be as likely to run against each other as any&#xD;
way, in this mist to-night," said the doctor.  "You'd&#xD;
better leave all that till the morning.  I'll see you again&#xD;
to-morrow," said he holding out his hand to Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"I suppose they don't know what is become of you at&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick's-I will stop there as I go home and make&#xD;
myself as famous as I can. Though 'the first bearer of&#xD;
unwelcome news' does not recommend himself to favour,&#xD;
yet if they have heard anything, on the whole they will&#xD;
thank me. I'll take my risk."&#xD;
"I am a little inclined to ride down, with you," said Mr.&#xD;
Linden.&#xD;
"Folly !" said the doctor.  "Mr. Simlins is acting a&#xD;
good part by you, he says,-which I presume is true,&#xD;
though I did not understand his terms; but I have no&#xD;
doubt- he'll prove himself good for a day or two's board&#xD;
and lodging. I wish I had had the pleasure of finding&#xD;
you at my own door, iunstead of his having it!"&#xD;
"The question is whether I shall be good for a day or&#xD;
two-I have no doubt of Mr. Simlins." -&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.             .219&#xD;
&#xD;
"Does that mean you are going,to disobey me? You&#xD;
grudge me that little bit of famousness ?"&#xD;
"I shall hear the orders before I disobey--"&#xD;
The doctor looked at him a minute. "Linden,"-said&#xD;
he,-you're alarmingly well! but you must remain in quar-&#xD;
ters for another night or two. It would be dangerous to&#xD;
let you go. I can't allow it. Good night !-.-."&#xD;
Either the stimulus of the doctor's presence had been&#xD;
strong, or the effort to appear well had been fatiguing;&#xD;
and Dr. Harrison would have pronounced another verdict&#xD;
had he seen his patient ten minutes later. When Mr. Sim..&#xD;
lines came back into the room, Mr. Linden looked pale and&#xD;
exhausted. He roused himself however, at once.&#xD;
"Mr. Simlins," he said, "will you drive me into Patta-&#xD;
quasset to-night."&#xD;
"You aint a goin' to do that ?" said the farmer.&#xD;
"That was my intention. Why not ?"&#xD;
"You aint fit for it, no ways !  Can't you stop, here one&#xD;
night and be peaceable ?"&#xD;
"Yes, both," said his guest smiling. 4But if I do not&#xD;
go, I must send," he added after a minute's silence, diiring&#xD;
which perhaps some feeling of weakness came in aid of the&#xD;
doctor's orders.-"And I do not think it would hurt me&#xD;
to go."&#xD;
"Send !" said Mr. Simlins-" there's lots to send. Here's&#xD;
Reuben, and Sam Stoutenburgh-the boys.aint gone yet--&#xD;
and here's me. Who do you want to send to ?"&#xD;
"I want to send for two or three things out of my room.&#xD;
Reuben can go-and Sam may sit here with me, if you&#xD;
will sleep any better for it, Mr. Siinlins. That is what you&#xD;
must do," he said with a look of warm interest and kindness.&#xD;
"Sleep !" growled Mr. Simlins.  "It's about all I'm&#xD;
good .for !" (Which was not at all Mr. Simlins abstract&#xD;
judgment concerning himself-but purely comparative, on&#xD;
the present occasion.)  "Well-you tell Reuben what you&#xD;
want him to do, and he can take the blown mare-Jem'll&#xD;
have her ready-and I'll send Sam to you; and after I get&#xD;
rid of all creation, I'll come myself. You'd think all crea-&#xD;
tion was just made, and the chips about"&#xD;
After which setting forth of the state of his affairs Mr.&#xD;
Simnlins went forth.&#xD;

"I guess, sir," said Jem Waters when he had done his&#xD;
task with the mare, "I guess I'd as good sleep in the front&#xD;
porch to-night. ' Cause if there'll be one here, there'll be&#xD;
forty."&#xD;
"What'll the forty do ?"&#xD;
"Knockthe house down, sir, if there's nobody there to&#xD;

CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
DR. HARRISON did not find anybody at Mrs. Der-&#xD;
rick's gate. The two, mother and daughter, had&#xD;
stood there, even after Cindy had come in with her report;&#xD;
unconscious, or unregardful, of the chill thick mist which en-&#xD;
veloped everything and fell with steady heavy fall upon the&#xD;
bright hair of one and the smooth cap of the other. They&#xD;
had not spoken' to,each other all that while, unless an&#xD;
unfinished word or two of Mrs. Derrick's reached ears that&#xD;
did not heed them. It was Faith herself who first moved,&#xD;
perhaps reminded by the increasing chillness that her&#xD;
mother was feeling it too. She took her hand from the&#xD;
gate, and passing the other round Mrs. Derrick, led. her&#xD;
into the house, and into the sitting-room and to a chair;&#xD;
and then went for wood and kindling' and built up a fire.&#xD;
She went to the kitchen next. That fire was out too, and&#xD;
that fire also Faith rebuilt, and coaxed till a blaze was going&#xD;
up round the cold tea kettle. Cindy sat with her head on&#xD;
her arms on the kitchen table, fast asleep. Faith did not&#xD;
wake her. In half an hour she brought into the sitting-&#xD;
room a tray with tea made, and clams warmed, and all&#xD;
things that .should accompany the one teacup and saucer,&#xD;
and mutely set it before her mother. She did not then ask&#xD;
her to eat, except by this pantomime; and she herself im-&#xD;
mediately went again to stand in the porch. But again&#xD;
her mother followed.&#xD;
"Child," she said, "you mustn't stand here. You'll be&#xD;
sick next. You must come right in and drink some hot&#xD;
tea."&#xD;
Faith's quick answer was to put her hand upon her mo-&#xD;
ther's lips. Her mother went on, softly angi steadily, in&#xD;
spite of that slight obstructions Yet not in spite of it, for&#xD;
her voice was very low.&#xD;
"I know who'd say you ought to--" and she paused a&#xD;
little, as if to let her words have their full effect. Then&#xD;

&#xD;
with a dirious sort of instinct she herself har1Ifdperceived,&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick added,&#xD;
"Dr. Harrison'll be sure to come-andiou mustn't be&#xD;
standing here then."&#xD;
For the first time Faith's head drooped, and she turned,&#xD;
but it was to pass her mother and go upstairs; laying her&#xD;
hand for an instant as she went, with a kind of caressing&#xD;
touch, on her mother's arm; then she was gone.&#xD;
Mrs..Derrick stood where Faith left her, the still mist&#xD;
before her- out of door, the still house behind her. And&#xD;
there she stood until her ear caught the distant smooth&#xD;
roll of wheels. Softly it came, nearing her every minute,&#xD;
till Mrs. Somers' little wagon stopped at the gate, and Dr.&#xD;
Harrison jumped down and came towards her. Another&#xD;
had seen him, for Mrs. Derrick knew that a light step had&#xD;
come swiftly down stairs, but whither it went she knew not,&#xD;
The doctor spoke eerily.&#xD;
Nasty thick evening I My dear Mrs.'Derrick, do you&#xD;
stand at the door to shew your hospitality in welcoming&#xD;
your friends, all night ?"&#xD;
"It is late," said Mrs. Derrick. The doctor's words were&#xD;
too slippery for her to get hold of; she waited for himnto&#xD;
speak again. -a                             f   h&#xD;
"If it is late, my dear madam, why are you here? I&#xD;
don't want you to see me ever for anything but pleasure.&#xD;
Is it so late I mustn't come in ?"&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick stepped back into the hall-then stopped&#xD;
and turned.&#xD;
"I was there to watch, Dr. Harrison. Whit  he4e you&#xD;
got to tell me? ~-One story has come already."&#xD;
"Has it! Then I can tell you but half a one. I was&#xD;
thinking to make my fortune. Mr. Linden is spending the&#xD;
night at a friend's house, my dear Mrs. Derrick-that is all.&#xD;
He is as well as you are -though perhaps just at this&#xD;
minute not quite so strong as I am. But I am afraid he&#xD;
can boast more than that in another few days."&#xD;
That Mrs. Derrick felt at once relieved, doubtful, unsat-&#xD;
isfied, was clear. But the relief-slight as it was-brought&#xD;
back her hospitality; 'she led the way into the parlour.&#xD;
"What has been the matter ?" she said. "What is the&#xD;
matter ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"I don't know," said the doctor. "He fell in with some-&#xD;
body carrying a gun-which was very likely to happen,&#xD;
seeing I have met -a great many myself; but I never fell out&#xD;
with any of them yet-perhaps my time will come.-This&#xD;
fellow however, let off his gun in the wrong place and some&#xD;
of the shot hit Mr. Linden in the arm, and before he could&#xD;
get to Mr. Simlins, where I found him, he was a little faint.&#xD;
So-I commanded him to stay where he was till morning.&#xD;
That's all. He's perfectly well, I give you my word. I&#xD;
came now on purpose to relieve you from anxiety.  He&#xD;
wanted to come down with me, but I wouldn't let him."&#xD;
"Why didn't you let him ?" said Mrs. Derrick.&#xD;
"Well, I came near letting him," said the doctor,-"for&#xD;
I didn't know at one time that I could help it. It wouldn't&#xD;
have hurt him seriously. But he'll see you with more&#xD;
pleasure to-morrow."&#xD;
"I can't think how you made out to hinder him at all!"&#xD;
said Mrs. Derrick, looking a littk puzzled. "But I'm much&#xD;
obliged to you, doctor, for coming."&#xD;
"Is he such a difficult person to deal with ?" said the doc-&#xD;
tor, glancing at the different doors of the room.&#xD;
"I never tried," said Mrs. Derrick with very simple&#xD;
truth.&#xD;
"I must try, some time," said the doctor abstractedly:--&#xD;
"I like to deal with difficult people.-B-ut I remember you&#xD;
remarked it was late !--" And he started up and was&#xD;
about to take his leave; when his purpose met with an in-&#xD;
terruption. For the swift trot of a horse upon the road&#xD;
came to as quick a pause at Mrs. Derrick's gate, and Reu-&#xD;
ben Taylor came up the steps and in at the open front door&#xD;
before Dr. Harrison had finished his compliments.&#xD;
"I see I" said the doctor,-" you don't keep open doors&#xD;
for nothing, Mrs. Derrick. Here's another.. You're not&#xD;
riding after me, my friend, are you? You don't let the&#xD;
grass grow 1"&#xD;
"No sir," said Reuben. "Good evening, Mrs. Derrick-.&#xD;
may I go up to Mr. Linden's room ?"&#xD;
"How is he now, Reuben ?" said Mrs. Derrick. "0 yes,&#xD;
you/can go up, of course."&#xD;
'1 Thank you, ma'am-he said he was more comfortable&#xD;
when I came away." And with an almost imperceptible&#xD;

glance round the room he was in, Reuben tu ried and&#xD;
bounded lightly up the staircase. But all was d alrk there&#xD;
and in Mr. Linden's room. Reuben could not execute his&#xD;
commission so; and was turning to come down stairs again,&#xD;
when he encountered in the dim entry-way a white figure.&#xD;
"How is Mr. Linden, Reuben ?" said a voice which he&#xD;
knew, though it was in a very low key.&#xD;
"Miss Faith !" Reuben said with a little start-" I0 am&#xD;
so glad to find you !"-Then repeated gravely his former&#xD;
answer-"He said he was more comfortable when I came&#xD;
away, ma'am."&#xD;
"Is he much hurt?"&#xD;
Reuben hesitated.&#xD;
"I don't rightly know, Miss Faith," he said, so, low that&#xD;
she could scarce catch the words. "He says he's not-and&#xD;
Dr. Harrison says not,-I suppose- I'm easy frightened."&#xD;
"What makes you frightened, then ?" she said quickly.&#xD;
"I was frightened-" Reuben said, drawing a long&#xD;
breath, and with a sort of awe-stricken voice, as if the&#xD;
fright was upon him yet;   "and it takes a while to get&#xD;
over it. Maybe that's all. He wrote that, Miss Faith-"&#xD;
and Reuben laid a tiny folded paper in her hand. "And&#xD;
may I have a light, ma'am, to get some things from his&#xD;
room ?" He spoke eagerly now, as if he grudged the mo'&#xD;
ments.&#xD;
Faith directed him to the kitchen, and when Reuben&#xD;
came up, followed him into the room and stood waiting&#xD;
while he sought what he wanted. Then suddenly remem-&#xD;
bered that her paper might contain a request for something&#xD;
else, and bent 'over the candle to read it. It contained&#xD;
mpre than one.&#xD;
/"Miss Faith," it said, "if any of my scholars are anxious&#xD;
about me, tell them, from me, that there is no cause. Bid&#xD;
them take rest-without 'waiting for it.'-I am sorry that&#xD;
exercise must wait !-but I shall hope to see two on Mon..&#xD;
day. .J.E.L."&#xD;
Faith's head was bent a long while over the candle.&#xD;
"Have you got what you wanted, Reuben ?" she asked at&#xD;
last.&#xD;
Reuben had heard her voice often, but he had never heard&#xD;
it like that-nor any one else. What had passed through&#xD;
&#xD;
it, clearing it so? it was like the chiming :of silver bells.&#xD;
$le came at her word, bag in hand; and-with the freedom&#xD;
a mutual sorrow gives,.--held out his other hand to her.&#xD;
Then ran quick and softly down the stairs.&#xD;
"Hollo, sir!1" said the doctor, as Reuben passed the&#xD;
open doorway. "A word with you." Reuben paused, then-&#xD;
camne back a step.A&#xD;
aSo you are Mr. linden's friend, are you ?" said the doc-&#xD;
tor in a careless manner.&#xD;
"Did you want anything of me, sir ?" Reuben said.&#xD;
"Why yes-I commonly want an answer to a question."&#xD;
'"I don't just know what you mean by a friend, Dr.&#xD;
Harrison," said Reuben respectfully.' "I might answer&#xD;
wrong."&#xD;
"oSo rather than do that -You like to be on the safe&#xD;
side. Suppose you ask Mr. Linden to teach you defini-&#xD;
tions, among other things? And look here--keep him&#xD;
quiet and don't let anybody talk him out of his sleep to-&#xD;
night. That's all." And the doctor followed Reuben im-&#xD;
mediately.&#xD;
With a feeling of satisfaction certainly, Mrs. Derrick at&#xD;
last locked and bolted the front door, shutting out the&#xD;
driving mist and all that might hide within it; and then&#xD;
went to look after the only treasure the house contained.&#xD;
She wasn't far to seek, for as the locking and bolting&#xD;
sounded through the house, Faith.came down and went&#xD;
with her mother into the'sitting-room.&#xD;
"Have you h d nothing to eat yet, motherI" she ex-&#xD;
claimed as her ey' fell on the orderly tea-tray.&#xD;
"No child--nor sha'n't want it, till I see you have some-&#xD;
thing.&#xD;
Faith smiled a little, came and put her arms round her&#xD;
and kissed her; and then set about the whole work of get-&#xD;
ting tea over again. It was with a very pale face yet; only&#xD;
the silver ring of her voice told the change of the mental&#xD;
atmosphere. Her mother looked at her-but was perhaps&#xD;
afraid to ask any questions to disturb the quiet.&#xD;
"Reuben's a good boy !" she said, feeling that remark to&#xD;
be perfectly safe.&#xD;
"I'm glad he's there," Faith answered gravely. "I heard&#xD;
all Dr. Harrison said, mother."&#xD;

"Yes child," said her mother---as if she knew that before,&#xD;
--" I thought you'd-see Reuben too."&#xD;
"Reuben said the same, mother. And Mr. Linden him.&#xD;
self sent word there was no cause to be anxious."&#xD;
Faith did not say he had written that word to her.. Per-&#xD;
haps her own consciousness might have made her shy of the&#xD;
subject--or perhaps what she judged to be people's false&#xD;
reports had left a sore spot in her heart and she was afraid&#xD;
of touching that. But she did not speak of the little note'&#xD;
which had come to her. She was preparing her mother's&#xD;
tea with all speed, while Mrs. Derrick on her part peeped&#xD;
into the;sugar-bowl to see if it wanted filling, and began to&#xD;
cut the bread-&#xD;
"I'm glad to rear it, .child," she said. "Dr. Harrison's&#xD;
too smart for me-I can't get a bit of good out of him.&#xD;
My, Faith! I suppose Mr.' Linden can manage him, but if&#xD;
I had that man buzzing round me, I shouldn't know&#xD;
whether I was sick or well. When is he coming back,&#xD;
child ?"&#xD;
"I don't know, mother.".--Then with the invincible in-&#xD;
stinct of truth, she added, "He wants my work to be ready&#xD;
for him Monday."&#xD;
"Reuben's got a great deal of gumption !" said Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick, her heart quite expanding with the pleasure of&#xD;
hearing Faith talk once more. "Now half the boys in&#xD;
town would have blurted that right out to me and Dr.&#xD;
Harrison together,--and I wouldn't trust him for not ask-&#xD;
ing, questions. B t I'm sure I'm glad, child-it seems as&#xD;
if he'd been gone  month. Do you think he'll come to-&#xD;
morrow ? Maybe he meant you should send your work&#xD;
down to him."&#xD;
"I sha'n't do that," said Faith, as she gave her mother&#xD;
at last-a cup of tea that was to be' drunk.' But she had&#xD;
poured out none for herself. She sat before the tea-tray,&#xD;
still and pale. Her mother looked at~Jer.&#xD;
"You must take some, child."&#xD;
"I don't want it, mother."'LAnd she brought everything&#xD;
that was on the table round her mother's plate.&#xD;
"You must-" Mrs. Derrick repeated. "I sha'n't, if you&#xD;
don't,.-or else I'll get you a glass of wine. Why child,"&#xD;
she said, with a half sober, half smiling look, which Faith&#xD;
&#xD;
K&#xD;
&#xD;
for once did not read,.-"he's better. You ought to eat&#xD;
and be thankful."&#xD;
"I am thankful,"-Faith said, her head sinking for a&#xD;
moment.&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick deliberately got up, went to the pantry, and&#xD;
fetching thence a tiny cup and plate set them before Faith.&#xD;
"Eat, pretty child" she said.  "You know I'm right.&#xD;
If you don't look out, Mr. Linden'll be worse scared when&#xD;
he comes home than he's been to-day, I guess."~&#xD;
Faith gave her a look, both grateful and appealing, and&#xD;
very innocent of belief in her statement;-and did honour&#xD;
the little cup so far as to fill it with tea which she swallowed.&#xD;
But the plate she left clean.&#xD;
"I can't to-night, mother," she said in answer to Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick's look.  "I'll eat breakfast."&#xD;

CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
T T cannot be said that sleep came to Faith's eyes unbid.&#xD;
den,-- yet once come, sleep rested there sweetly, even&#xD;
beyond her usual time; and the first disturbing sound, in&#xD;
that misty Sunday morning, was the stopping of a wagon&#xD;
at the front door. But if Faith ran to the window with&#xD;
any special expectations, they were disappointed,--there&#xD;
was nothing at the door but Crab, his companion the little&#xD;
wagon, and Mrs. Derrick composedly getting out of the&#xD;
same. Which was at least surprising enough. The good&#xD;
lady's next appearance was a very noiseless one in Faith's&#xD;
room.&#xD;
"Dear mother ! where have you been ?"&#xD;
"Why I've been trying to get ahead of Dr. Harrison,"&#xD;
said her mother sitting down; "and I did it too. I should&#xD;
have been home before if I hadn't been afraid of meeting&#xD;
him-so I had to take a cross road." Mrs. Derrick seemed&#xD;
tired..                               '&#xD;
"Yoe needn't look at me so, child," she said, taking off&#xD;
her bonnet.  "It's enough to see one pale face in a morn-&#xD;
ing. I did see him, Faith, though I didn't speak to him."&#xD;
"How did he look, mother?"&#xD;
"I don't suppose he really looked bad-considering,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Derrick, with the tired look on her own face;&#xD;
"but I am not used to seeing him pulled down. It sort of&#xD;
upset me to see him lie there and those two boys keeping&#xD;
watch of, him. I declare, Faith ! I wouldn't like to be the&#xD;
one to touch him with them sitting by !"&#xD;
"But how is he, mother? who did you see&#xD;
"I didn't see anybody but them-Mr. Simlins wasn't up.&#xD;
They said he seemed better, dear--and that if I'd seen hip&#xD;
last night I'd think he had quite a colour now: so I sup-&#xD;
pose he is better. Only I haven't got theSheart of a kitten'&#xD;
sometimes-" and a little motion of the lips warned Faith&#xD;
that if her mother was sparing of details it was because&#xD;
she could scarce give them.&#xD;
(2'28)&#xD;
&#xD;
"But isn't  as well as the doctor said? lHe would look&#xD;
pale, you kno"&#xD;
"I shouldn't have known from what the doctor said, that&#xD;
he'd anything more than a scratch on the tip end of his&#xD;
little finger !" said Mrs. Derrick,--" so I believe I didn't ex-&#xD;
pect even to see him look pale. And all the while, the&#xD;
doctor was staring at the pantry doors-I didn't know but&#xD;
he'd get up and open 'em and look in."&#xD;
You said two boys were there who beside Reuben&#xD;
Taylor ?"&#xD;
"0 Sam Stoutenburgh was 'tother side," said Mrs. Der-&#xD;
rick, "and wanted to know how you were. I'd a great&#xD;
mind to tell him it was none of his business. I suppose he&#xD;
thinks his heart is as large as he is, and can hold every-&#xD;
thing at once."&#xD;
A shadow of something seemed to cross Faith at the&#xD;
mention of Sam's name. She turned away and, began&#xD;
dressing herself.&#xD;
"'Don't stir again, mother," she said. "I'll come down&#xD;
and see about breakfast."&#xD;
"It'll rest me to go with you, child,-I told Reuben I'd&#xD;
come again and stay if Mr. Linden would let me, and Reu-&#xD;
ben will send me word. So I want to see you in the mean&#xD;
time. But I don't think they'll send."&#xD;
The breakfast was a quiet meal, though Faith but poorly&#xD;

hour after breakfast her mother could but guess;. then she&#xD;

it was not for the reason his new teacher had feared.&#xD;
Faith's face was very pale,-that of itself touched the cliil'&#xD;
dren; and her words this day came in a tone that won&#xD;
all the recesses of their hearts.  She had forgot about&#xD;
other teachers or children being in her neighbourhood; on&#xD;
those three her stores of love and tenderness poured them'&#xD;
selves out. She told them with warm lips, of Christ and&#xD;
his love and his leading,-of the safety and joy of his sheep,&#xD;
-of her wish that her little charge should be lambs in that&#xD;
flock, and what sort of lambs they must be. Faith spoke&#xD;
to her children very much as if she had been a child her.&#xD;
self. They knew instinctively, with very sure knowledge,.&#xD;
that she belonged to the fold of which she was joyously&#xD;
telling them.&#xD;
The children, on their part, met her variously. Johnny&#xD;
-with his clear childish eyes, the flower-like unfolding of&#xD;
his little heart to that warm sunshine-gave her, more help&#xD;
than trouble,-she understood the liking to teach him for&#xD;
her own sake. If his thoughts sometimes wandered a little&#xD;
from her words, the downcast look, the slight quiver of his&#xD;
childish lips, told Faith where they had gone; and she&#xD;
could forgive him. But though at such times Robbie Wa-&#xD;
ters always remembered to look grave too, yet he displaced&#xD;
Faith's gravity once by whispering to her (in the midst of&#xD;
her earnest admonitions to charles twelfth) that 'she knew&#xD;
she was pretty'; and was in general in an easy, docile state&#xD;
of mind, and much interested and amazed at the 'deport-&#xD;
ment' of his little neighbour, Charles twelfth. When Faith&#xD;
came out of the school,,.she saw that all the seats of Mr.&#xD;
Linden's class were vacant; and with that little reminding&#xD;
touch, went to her own place in the church.&#xD;
It was between nine and ten o'clock, while Faith vas yet&#xD;
lost in her little charge, while Mrs. Derrick at home was&#xD;
thinking of her, and Mr. Siml as taking his late brea-&#xD;
fast, that Dr. Harrison's curri  ched the farmer's gate.&#xD;
All was quiet without-the hous  at when Jenny Lowndes&#xD;
admitted the doctor into the hall, the array of hats and&#xD;
caps upon the table might have startled a less professional&#xD;
man; might have even suggested the idea that Mr. Simlins&#xD;
was giving a breakfast pa rty.&#xD;
"Let me see Mr. Linden," said the doctor-.&#xD;
&#xD;
Jenny hesitated-then her fear of Dr. Harrison over-&#xD;
coming her scruples, she walked softly to the door and&#xD;
opened it. But if the doctor wanted to see his patient, he&#xD;
was obliged to wait a little; for the group of boys-some&#xD;
standing, some kneeling--.around the bed, hid everything&#xD;
else. The room was very still, very earnest; even Dr.&#xD;
Harrison could feel that; the sound of words, very low-&#xD;
spoken, was all he could hear. The closing door made&#xD;
itself heard, however,-several boys turned round, and at&#xD;
once stepped aside; and the doctor saw- his patient,4not&#xD;
dressed but lying as he had left him the night before. Mr.&#xD;
Linden smiled-and saying some words to his class held&#xD;
out his hand towards the doctor; but this was -fastened&#xD;
upon at once by so many, that the doctor again had to wait&#xD;
his turn; and it was not until everyone else had touched&#xD;
that hand, some even with their lips, that he was left alone&#xD;
with his patient.&#xD;
"What are you doing ?" said he, in a sort of grave tone&#xD;
which did not however mean gravity. "Holding a levee ?-&#xD;
and do you receive your courtiers at diff4'ent hours accord-&#xD;
ing to their ages ? in that cake I have come at the wrong&#xD;
time."&#xD;
"No, you shall have the time all to yourself."&#xD;
"I see I have it 1 Are the juvenile, members of society&#xD;
in Pattaquasset accustomed to pay their respects to you at&#xD;
this hour in tihe morning ?"&#xD;
"Not always. Once a week we meet to talk over plea-&#xD;
sant things."&#xD;
"Have I interrupted the pleasant things now ?"&#xD;
"No, I could not talk very long this morning. The&#xD;
boys were just going."&#xD;
"I wish I had come a little sooner," said Dr. Harrison.&#xD;
"I'm not a boy, to be sure, but I don't know that they are&#xD;
privileged to monopolize all pleasant things. If they are,&#xD;
I an against monopolies. However, if you can't talk, you&#xD;
mustn't talk. How do you do ?"&#xD;
"I do well-if a man can be doing well when he's doing&#xD;
nothing. I will talk as long as you please-about pleasant&#xD;
things."&#xD;
The doctor however diverged to the state of his patient's&#xD;
health, nor would talk of anything else till his investigations&#xD;

on that. point were made. The result of them seemed to&#xD;
be satisfactory.&#xD;
"Now Linden," he said, in a tone that indicated they&#xD;
were free. to ask and answer,-." who was that fellow last&#xD;
night? have you any idea?"-&#xD;
"It is difficult to identify a man when you are only&#xD;
within gunshot of him-.-and after sundown," said Mr. Lin.&#xD;
den smiling.&#xD;
"Difficuit--yes, it may be,--but you gathered some-&#xD;
thing ?"&#xD;
"I gathered a run."&#xD;
"That is," said the doctor looking at him, "you have an&#xD;
opinion on the subject and are not willing to risk it ?"&#xD;
"No," said Mr. Linden, "I have had risk enough for one&#xD;
night."&#xD;
"You are mistaken, Linden. A hint might be quite&#xD;
enough to bring out the certainty. My father is very eager&#xD;
about the matter, and is only waiting for you to empower&#xD;
him to act."&#xD;
"I shall give you no Ihint," said Mr. Linden.  "I might&#xD;
be willing to risk my own opinion, but not another man's&#xD;
character."&#xD;
The doctor looked at him keenly and curiously.&#xD;
"What possible motive !"-he said. "For it is evident&#xD;
that the shot was fired of intent, and evident that you your.&#xD;
se f think so. It is unheard-of !"&#xD;
" Were you bred to the bar, that you sum up evidence&#xD;
before it is given ?" said #r. Linden, with a good-humoured&#xD;
raising of his brows at the doctor.&#xD;
"But the man ran 1"&#xD;
" So did I-he could hardly think I was much hurt."&#xD;
" don't want to have such a fellow abroad in Patta-&#xD;
qua set," said the doctor. "But suppose we go back to&#xD;
the pleasant things. You must start the subject, Linden.&#xD;
Rousseau says a man can best describe the sweets of liberty&#xD;
from the inside of a prison-so, I suppose, you being shot&#xD;
at and laid on your back, can have no lack of theme."&#xD;
Mr. Linden smiled-the smile of a most unfettered spirit.&#xD;
"Liberty !" he sai.'j. " es I have realized since I have&#xD;
lain here, that-  /                   .   -&#xD;
" 'My soul is free, as ambient air,'-&#xD;
&#xD;
"My sense of liberty comes from the possession-not the&#xD;
want."'&#xD;
"Prospective possession,"-said the doctor. "Unless&#xD;
indeed," he went on with a humourous play of the lips-&#xD;
"you mean that my orders ,to you to lie still, merely gave&#xD;
zest to your triumphant knowledge that you could get up&#xD;
if you had a mind. A riotous degree of self-will that I&#xD;
believe I do not possess. Was that what good Mrs. Der-&#xD;
rick meant when she said she wondered how I had hindered&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
"No," said Mr. Linden smiling-"she meant that she&#xD;
did not think you had."&#xD;
"She didn't mean a thing of the kind! She spoke in&#xD;
pure wonder, and made me begin to wonder in my turn."&#xD;
Which wonder Mr. Linden did not inquire into.&#xD;
"I am very sorry I wasn't a boy this morning !" said Dr.&#xD;
Harrison,- after standing and looking down athim a little.&#xD;
"Can't you sit down and say why ?"&#xD;
"I should have heard so much !-which now I am not&#xD;
to hear. For if I had 'been a boy, I should certainly not&#xD;
have been missing at your levee."&#xD;
"0 you deceive yourself, -if you were a boy nothing&#xD;
'short of my authority would bring you, in the first place."&#xD;
"I have not the slightest doubt the power would have&#xD;
been found equal to the resistance," said the doctor bowing.&#xD;
"Neither have I."&#xD;
'"Well 1--" said the doctor laughing a little peculiarly,-&#xD;
"in that case I should have been here. Now I have a fancy&#xD;
to know what you call pleasant things, Linden. You.&#xD;
speak with a mouth full-as if there were plenty of them."&#xD;
"Yes, there are plenty," Mr. Linden said, moving a little&#xD;
and resting his face on his hand as if he felt tired ; "but we&#xD;
were talking of only two this morning,-heaven, and the&#xD;
way thither."&#xD;
Dr. Harrison looked at him steadily.&#xD;
"You are tired," he said gently. "You shall not talk&#xD;
any more to me now, and I shall forbid your holding any&#xD;
more levees to-day. After which," he added, the humour-&#xD;
ous expression coming back, "I shall expect to hear a pro-&#xD;
elanmation going through Pattaquasset, that, like the knights&#xD;
pf old, you are ready for all comers !-.Well.-PIll come and&#xD;

for the pleasure of talking. , You can have itall your own&#xD;
way, with a few ma6te days' strength. Will you have a&#xD;
levee to-morrow at the same hour ?"&#xD;
A little play of the lips came with the answer-&#xD;
"Will that suit you ?-I'll send you word." Then look.&#xD;
ing up at the doctor with a different expression, he added,&#xD;
"What do you think of my pleasant things ?"&#xD;
"Hardly in my line--" said the doctorwitha careless.&#xD;
ness which was somewhat dubious in its character. "It is&#xD;
very well for those who find the subject pleasant. I confess&#xD;
I have never studied it much."&#xD;
"Then you have but half learned your profession." But&#xD;
the words were so spoken that they could not give offence.&#xD;
Neither did the doctor seem disposed: to take offence,&#xD;
"I'll ask you what you mean by that to-morrow," he said&#xD;
very pleasantly. "I thought I had learned my profession,&#xD;
Have you learned yours ?" The last words were with a&#xD;
keen eye to the answer.&#xD;
"Some peoplendignify my present business with that&#xD;
name," Mr. Linden said.&#xD;
"Well, you shall discourse to me more at length to-mor-&#xD;
row," said the doctor.  "Shall I come later ?"b&#xD;
"I don't expect to be in school to-morrow, so you may&#xD;
name your own time," Mr. Linden said with a pleasant&#xD;
look. "But remember,-a physician who has no skill to&#xD;
feel the pulse of the mind,, no remedies that can reach its&#xD;
fever or its chills,-is but half a physician. If I had never&#xD;
studied the subject,-one word about heaven and the way&#xD;
thither would be worth more to me than all the science of&#xD;
medicine ever discovered ! It is now-" he said in a low&#xD;
tone, as the flush passed away. And then holding out his&#xD;
hand to Dr. Harrison, Mr. Linden added, "-I fully appre-&#xD;
ciate your skill and kindness-you need not doubt it."&#xD;
The hand was taken, and grasped, cordially but in si-&#xD;
lence.&#xD;
Whether the doctor went straight from Mr. Simlins'&#xD;
house to church-where he was not a very constant attend-&#xD;
ant--it does not appear. What is certain about the mat-&#xD;
ter, is, that he was outside of the church door after service&#xD;
just at the time that Faith Derrck found herself there, and&#xD;

that he assumed a place at her side and walked with her&#xD;
towards her mother's house instead of taking the other&#xD;
direction towards his own., Faith was alone, Mrs. Derrick&#xD;
having chosen to stay at home in case she should be sent&#xD;
for. The mist had .cleared off completely, and the sunny&#xD;
warm air invited to lingering in it. Faith would not have&#xD;
lingered, but the doctor walked slowly, and she could not&#xD;
leave him.&#xD;
o I have been wanting to see you, ever since my inoppor-&#xD;
tune proposal yesterday," said he in a low tone,-"to make&#xD;
my peace with you."&#xD;
"It is made, sir," said Faith, giving him a smile.&#xD;
"How do you do to-day ?"&#xD;
"Very'well!1" she told him.&#xD;
The doctor listened to the sound of her voice, and thought&#xD;
with himself that as regarded the moral part of he, nature&#xD;
the words were certainly true.&#xD;
"Let n~e have the pleasure of relieving you of that,"-&#xD;
he said, taking Faith's little Bible gently away from her.&#xD;
"I am going your way.' Miss Derrick-.-.you spoke yester-&#xD;
day of particular work to be done on Sunday. Have you&#xD;
any objection to tell me what you meant by it? I confess&#xD;
to you, your words are somewhat dark to me.. That is my&#xD;
fault, of course. Will you give me light ?" It was a gentle,&#xD;
grave, quiet tone of questioning.&#xD;
"Others might dotit far better, sir," said Faith.&#xD;
"I would far rather hear it from you I"&#xD;
The colour came a little into Faith's cheeks, but her&#xD;
words weregiven with great simplicity.&#xD;
"The other days are taken up very much with thework&#xD;
,of this world.-Sunday is meant more particularly or the&#xD;
work that belongs to the other world."&#xD;
"And what is that? if you do not object to tell me. I&#xD;
confess, as I tell you, I am ignorant."&#xD;
She forgot herself now, and looked steadily at him.&#xD;
"To learn to know God-with whom we have so much&#xD;
to do, here and there;-to learn to know his will and to do&#xD;
it, and to bring others to do it too, if we can...---And if we&#xD;
know and love him already, to enjoy it and take the good&#xD;
of it,"---.she added a little lower, and with a softening&#xD;
of expression.-&#xD;

Dr. Harrison read her look fixedly, till she turned it&#xD;
away from him.&#xD;
"And are these what you call pleasant things ?" said he&#xD;
somewhat curiously  .&#xD;
But Faith's answer rang out from her heart.&#xD;
"Oh yes!1"-&#xD;
She stopped there, but evidently not for want of what to&#xD;
say.&#xD;
"You are a happy thing," said the doctor, but not in a&#xD;
way to make his words other than graceful. "I wish you&#xD;
would make me al good as you are."&#xD;
She looked at him, and answered very much as if she had&#xD;
been speaking to a child.&#xD;
"God will make you much better, Dr. Harrison, if you&#xD;
ask him."'&#xD;
He was silent a minute after that, without looking at&#xD;
her. When he spoke again, it was with a change of tone.&#xD;
"You are of a different world from that in which I live;&#xD;
and the flowers that are sweet to you, belong, I am afraid,&#xD;
to a Flora that I have no knowledge of. What, for instance,&#xD;
would you call pleasant things to talk about-if you were&#xD;
choosing a subject of conversation ?"&#xD;
Faith looked a litt1surprised.&#xD;
"A great many things are pleasant to me," she said&#xD;
smiling.&#xD;
"I am sure of that!. But indulge me-what would you&#xD;
name as supremely such, to talk about ?"&#xD;
"If they are talked about right," said Faith gently, "I&#xD;
don't know anything so pleasant as those things I was&#xD;
speaking of-what God will have us do in this world, and&#xD;
what he will do for us in the next."&#xD;
"'Heaven and the way thither'-" said Dr. Harrison to&#xD;
himself.&#xD;
"What, sir?" said Faith.&#xD;
"I should like to have you answer me that; but I am&#xD;
sorry, I see Mrs. Derrick's house not far beyond us.-I saw&#xD;
our friend Mr. Linden this morning."&#xD;
"Is he better ?" said Faith simply.&#xD;
"He's doing very well. I told him he'd be a terribly&#xD;
famous man after this. And it's begun. I fotind near all&#xD;
the boys in Pattaquasset assembled there this morning.".&#xD;

"His Bible class-" said Faith, with a feeling which did&#xD;
not however come into her face or voice, and Dr. Harrison&#xD;
watched both.&#xD;
"Here is your Bible," he said as they stopped at the&#xD;
little gate. "Do you always look so pale on Sundays ?"&#xD;
he added with a look and tone of half professional half&#xD;
friendly freedom.&#xD;
"Not always," Faith said; but there came at the same&#xD;
time a little tinge into the cheeks,.-that Dr. Harrison&#xD;
wished away.&#xD;
"May I come and earn your forgiveness for yesterday's&#xD;
stupidity ?"&#xD;
"Certainly !" Faith said,-" but there needs no forgive-&#xD;

CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
D R. HARRISON had but little left Mr., Linden that&#xD;
morning, when Mr. Simlins came in. He had hardly&#xD;
seen his guest yet that day, except, like Mrs. Derrick, when&#xD;
he was 'asleep. For having: watched himself the greater&#xD;
part of the night, for the pure pleasure of it, Mr. Sim.&#xD;
lins' late rest had brought him almost to the hour when&#xD;
the boys came to what the doctor called Mr. Linden's&#xD;
levee.&#xD;
"Well how do you find yourself?" said the farmer, stand.&#xD;
ing at the foot of the bed and looking at its occupant with&#xD;
a kind of grim satisfaction.&#xD;
"I find myself tired, sir-and at the same time intending&#xD;
to get up. Mr. Simlins, are you going down to church&#xD;
this afternoon ?"&#xD;
"Well, no," said the farmer. "I think it's as good&#xD;
church as I can do, to look arter you."&#xD;
"You can have both," said Mr. Linden smiling,-"I&#xD;
should go with you."&#xD;
"You aint fit," said the farmer regretfully.&#xD;
"Fit enouglj-i'll come back and stay with you another&#xD;
day, when I a  well, if you'll let me."&#xD;
"Will you ?" said the farmer. "I'll bottle that 'eie pro.&#xD;
mise and cork it up; and if it aint good when I pull the&#xD;
cork-then I'll never play Syrian again, for no one. But&#xD;
s'pose I aint goin' to church ?"&#xD;
"Then I shall have, to take Reuben."&#xD;
"You sha'n't take no one but me," growled Mr. Simlins.&#xD;
"I'd rather see you out of my house than not-if I can't&#xD;
see you in it."&#xD;
The bells were ringing out for the early afternoon ser-&#xD;
vice when they set forth; not ringing against each other,&#xD;
as which should give the loudest call for its own particular&#xD;
church, but with alternate strokes speaking the-same thing&#xD;
-the one stepping in when the other was out of breath.&#xD;
(238)&#xD;
&#xD;
The warm sunshine rested upon all-" the evil and the&#xD;
goo" and spoke its own message though not so noisily.&#xD;
Alg the road Mr. Simlins' little covered wagon (chosen&#xD;
for various reasons) went at an easy pace; with one to&#xD;
drive, and one to bear the motion as best he might; and a&#xD;
third who would almost have agreed to be a pillow or a&#xD;
cushion for the rest of his life, if he could have been one&#xD;
for that day. What there were of that sort in the wagon,&#xD;
or indeed in the house, were to Reuben's eyes far too thin&#xD;
and ineffectual.  A little excitement, a very earnest desire&#xD;
to get home once more, did partially supply the need; and&#xD;
by the time the houses were empty and the churches full,&#xD;
the wagon stopped at Mrs. Derrick's gate.&#xD;
"I guess nobody's home," said Mr. Simlins as he with&#xD;
great tenderness helped Mr. Linden to alight-"but any-&#xD;
way, here's the house all standin'. Reuben, you go ahead&#xD;
and see if we can get in."&#xD;
But before Reben touched the door, Mrs. Derrick had&#xD;
opened it from the inside, and stood there-her usually&#xD;
quiet manner quite subdued into silence. Not into inaction&#xD;
however, for her woman's hands goon made their superior&#xD;
powers known, and Mr. Simlins could only wonder w4y&#xD;
this and that had not occurred to him before. Quick and&#xD;
still and thoughtful,,she had done half a dozen little things&#xD;
to make Mr. Lindecomfortable before he had been in the&#xD;
house as many minutes, and assured the two others very&#xD;
confidently that "he shouldn't faint again, if he wanted to&#xD;
ever so much 1"&#xD;
"Well, I was sorry to let lhim go," said Mr. Simlins,&#xD;
"and now I'm glad of it. It takes a woman ! Where's&#xD;
somebody else ?"&#xD;
"There's nobody else in the house," said Mrs. Derrick.&#xD;
"Faith's gone to meeting, and Cindy too, for all I know."&#xD;
"I'll send Dr. Harrison word in the morning where I&#xD;
am," said Mr. Linden,-which Mr. Simlins rightly under-&#xD;
stood to mean that the fact need not be published to-night.&#xD;
He took gentle leave of this lost guest and went to&#xD;
church; excusing himself for it afterwards by saying he&#xD;
felt lonely.&#xD;
If Faith had seen him there, she might have jumped at&#xD;
conclusions again ; buit she did not; and after the service&#xD;

walked home, slowly again, though nobody was with her,&#xD;
A little wearied by this time with the night and the dahy'&#xD;
work, wearied in body and mind perhaps, she paced home.&#xD;
wards along the broad street or road, on which the yellow&#xD;
leaves of the trees were floating lazily down, and which was&#xD;
all filled from sky and wayside. with golden light. It,&#xD;
brought to mind her walk of last Sunday afternoon--and&#xD;
evening;-t1Ehymn, and those other lines Mr. Linden had&#xD;
repeated and which had run in her head fifty times since,&#xD;
And Faith's step grew rather slower and less lightsome as&#xD;
she neared home, and when she got home she went straight&#xD;
up to her room without turning to the right or the left&#xD;
Her mother was just then in the kitchen and heard her not,&#xD;
and shielded by her bonnet Faith saw not even that Mr,&#xD;
Linden's door stood open; but when she cane out.again a&#xD;
while after, the full stream of sunlight that came thence&#xD;
into the passage drew her eyes that way. And Faith did&#xD;
not wonder then that her mother had been startled, and&#xD;
unprepared by the doctor's words for the sight of what&#xD;
she now saw. The chintz-covered couch was drawn be;&#xD;
fore the window, in the full radiance of the sunlight, and&#xD;
Mr. Linden lay there looking out; but the sunlight found&#xD;
no glow in his face, unless one as etherial as itself. The&#xD;
habitual sweet pure look was there-a look that reminded&#xD;
Faith of the one Johnny had worn in the morning; but&#xD;
the face was perfectly colourless. The bandaged arm was&#xD;
supported only by a sling, upon the other hand his cheek&#xD;
rested wearily. Faith looked, hesitated, thenstepped lightly&#xD;
into the room and stood before him; with a face not indeed&#xD;
quite so pale as his own, but that only the sunlight hin.&#xD;
dered his seeing was utterly-without its usual colour. She&#xD;
found nothing to say, apparently; for she did not speak,&#xD;
only held out her hand. He had turned at, the first sound&#xD;
of her step and watched her-at first smiling, then grave-&#xD;
as she came near; and taking her hand as silently as it&#xD;
was given, Mr. Linden looked up at her face,-perhaps to&#xD;
see whether his instr actions had been obeyed.&#xD;
"Ishave had men    hands about me so long," he said,&#xD;
"that yours feels like-" he did not specify what, but held&#xD;
it a minute as if he were trying to find out. "'Miss Faith,&#xD;
you want to be rocked to sleep."&#xD;
&#xD;
Could he see that her lips trembled ? He could feel how&#xD;
her hand did; but her look was as frank as ever.&#xD;
"Are you less well to-day ?"-she said at last, in a voice&#xD;
that was little above a whisper, and stopped short of his&#xD;
name.&#xD;
"Less well than yesterday at this time-not less well&#xD;
than this morning. A little more tired, perhaps."  He&#xD;
spoke very quietly, answering her words and letting his&#xD;
hand and eye do the rest. "Has Mrs. Derrick a cradle in&#xD;
the house that would hold you ?"&#xD;
PerhapI Fakh hardly heard the question, for she&#xD;
did not acknowledge it by so much as a smile. She&#xD;
wished to ask the further question, whether the assur-&#xD;
ance of last night was still true; but his appearance&#xD;
had driven such fear to her heart that she dared not&#xD;
ask it. She stood quite still a minute, but when she&#xD;
spoke her words were in the utmost clear sweetness of'a&#xD;
woman's voice.&#xD;
"Can I do something for you, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"You are doing something for me now-it is so pleasant&#xD;
to see you. But Miss Faith, I shall have to reclaim some&#xD;
of your scholars; you have been teaching too piuch to-&#xD;
day."&#xD;
"No-" she said,-" I have had no chance."&#xD;
"No chance to teach too much? And whf?"&#xD;
"Why," she said,-" I had only the usual hour this&#xD;
morning. I could do no more."&#xD;
"You look as if you had beenteaching all day-or&#xD;
taught, which is but another branch. What did my boys&#xD;
say to you?&#xD;
"I think they thought they were saying to you, M;.&#xD;
Linden,-they behaved so well."&#xD;
He smiled.&#xD;
"I don't believe even your conjuring powers could bring&#xD;
about such a hallucination, Miss Faith.-What a day it&#xD;
has been! Lookat that sunlight-and think of the city&#xD;
that hath 'no need of the sun'I"&#xD;
She looked where he bade her, but the contrast was a&#xD;
little too strong just then with the earth that had so much&#xD;
'need' of it! Only the extreme gravity of het face how-v&#xD;

ever indicated anything of the. struggle going on. Her&#xD;
eye did not move,-nor eyelid.&#xD;
"That is the only rest we must 'wait for," Mr. Linden&#xD;
said. "That 'remaineth.'&#xD;
Faith answered nothing. But after a little while the&#xD;
shadow of that sunlight passed away from her face, and she&#xD;
turned to the couch again and asked with her former gentle&#xD;
expression,&#xD;
"Will you have tea up here, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"I'm afraid I must," he said, looking up at, her with eyes&#xD;
that rather questioned than answered.&#xD;
"Does mother know what you would like to have ?"&#xD;
"Miss Faith-I wish you would tell me just what is&#xD;
troubling you."&#xD;
The question flushed her a little, and for a moment her&#xD;
face was a quick play of light and shade; then she said,&#xD;
"It troubled me not to see you looking better."&#xD;
He took the force of her words, though he answered&#xD;
lightly.&#xD;
"I suppose I do look rather frightful! But Miss Faith,&#xD;
I hope to get over that in a few days-you must try and&#xD;
brace up your nerves, because if you cannot bear the sight&#xD;
of me I shall have to deny myself the sight of you."&#xD;
"Don't do that," she said, the light coming into her eye&#xD;
and voice as .if by an actual sunbeam. "Then it is true,&#xD;
what you wrote me last night, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"Well !" he said-"I am not much in the habit of main-.&#xD;
taining my own words,-however, in this case I am willing&#xD;
to admit them true. If it will be any relief to your mind,&#xD;
Miss Faith, I will promise to remain in seclusion until you&#xD;
say I am fit to be seen down stairs."&#xD;
The answer, to that was only a rosy little smile, like the&#xD;
sunlight promise of fair weather on the last clouds that&#xD;
float over the horizon. But perhaps his words had brought&#xD;
her mind back to the question of supper for she asked&#xD;
again,&#xD;
"What are you to have for tea to-night, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"May' I take a great liberty ?" he said with a look as&#xD;
grave as before.&#xD;
"I don't know how you can,"-she said and with eyes&#xD;
&#xD;
somewhat surprised, that said in their own way it was im-&#xD;
possible.&#xD;
A little smile--which she scarce saw-came first, and&#xD;
then her hand was brought to his lips. But it was done&#xD;
too gravely and gently to startle even her.&#xD;
"Now you must go and rest," Mr. Linden said "I&#xD;
want nothing for tea that shall cost one extra step."&#xD;
Faith went about as silently and demurely as a cat that&#xD;
has had her ears Ioxed and been sent out of the dairy.&#xD;
Only in this case she went to her dairy; from whence in due&#xD;
time she emerged with cream and butter and made her ap-&#xD;
pearance in the kitchen.&#xD;
"Well child!" said Mrs. Derrick. "When did you get&#xD;
home? and what did you do with yourself?  I've looked&#xD;
and lookedfor you till I was tired, and if you'd staid five&#xD;
minutes more I should have run all over town after you."&#xD;
"Why mother !" said Faith,."I was in my own room for&#xD;
a good while. I got home in usual time."&#xD;
"Well !"-said her mother, "I hope next time you'll say&#xD;
as much-that's all. Do you know we've got company,&#xD;
Faith ?"&#xD;
"Who, mother ?-.--O I've seen Mr. Linden."&#xD;
"I meant him," said Mrs. Derrick.    "I'm sure the&#xD;
house seems as if it had twice as many in it since he came."&#xD;
"He ought to have tea, now, mother. Isn't Cindy home&#xD;
yet ?"&#xD;
"No, but that's no matter--I'll take it up in two minutes.&#xD;
Where's the teapot-"&#xD;
"I think, mother," said Faith as she was-adding the last&#xD;
touches to the tray which was to go up stairs, -"I must&#xD;
have put Mr. Linden in mind of his sister, or somebody,&#xD;
this afternoon. I am afraid he misses them now."&#xD;
"What do you meat by somebody ?" said Mrs. Derrick.&#xD;
"Some of his own family, I mean. I thought so."&#xD;
"I don't believe you ever pit anybody in mind of any-&#xD;
body else," said, Mrs. Derrick confidently. "What made&#xD;
you think so, child ?"&#xD;
"Something made me think so,"-said Faith rather ab-&#xD;
stractly. "Now mother-it is ready, and I'll take it up&#xD;
stairs if you'll take it then."&#xD;
"I guess I'm up to as much as taking it all the way,'"&#xD;

said her mother, lifting the tray. "I'll be down presently,&#xD;
dear,-you must want your tea." And up stairs she&#xD;
went..&#xD;
Reuben came to stay all night, so the ladies had only to&#xD;
take their own much needed sleep, in peace; and a note&#xD;
of information was left at Dr. Harrison's door next morn.&#xD;
ing, some time before that gentleman was awake.                         CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
KNOW what I have to do. to-day," said Faith the&#xD;
next morning. "Mr. Skip has got the box made,&#xD;
mother, and now I want the stuff to cover it."&#xD;
"W ell that's  ready-irin  my  pantry, child."&#xD;
Whereupon Reuben offered his services; but all that was&#xD;
given him to d6 was to carry up Mr. Linden's breakfast.&#xD;
This was hardly well over when Dr. Harrison came. Hie&#xD;
was shewn into the sitting-r9om, just as Faith with her&#xD;
arms full of ;,brown moreen came into it also from the&#xD;
pantry. The doctor was not going to lose a shake of the&#xD;
band, and waited for the brown moreen to be deposited on&#xD;
the floor accordingly.&#xD;
"You are looking more like yourself to-day," he said.&#xD;
"I will call mother," said Faith. Which she did, ldaving&#xD;
the doctor in company with the brown moreen.&#xD;
"Mrs. Derrick," said he, speaking by no nieans without&#xD;
a purpose, "I have cause of complaint against you! What&#xD;
have you done to allure my patient down here against&#xD;
orders ?"&#xD;
"He's better here," said Mrs. Derrick with a cool dispos-&#xD;
ing of the subject. "What did you want to keep him up&#xD;
there for, doctor ?"&#xD;
"Only acted upon a vigorous principle of Mr. Linden's&#xD;
nature, madam.-If I had ordered him to come, he would&#xD;
have stayed. May I see him ?"&#xD;
And Mrs. Derrick preceded the doctor up stairs, opened&#xD;
the door pf the room and shut it after him. Mr. Linden&#xD;
was on the couch, but it was wheeled round by the side Qf&#xD;

the heap. As the doctor entered, this was folded up and&#xD;
transferred to the disabled hand for safe keeping.&#xD;
Mr. Linden had that quality (much more common among&#xD;
women than among men) of looking well in undress; but&#xD;
let no one suppose that I mean the combination of care.&#xD;
lessness and disorder which generally goes by that name,&#xD;
and which shews (most of gall) undress of the mind. I&#xD;
mean simply that style of dress which Sam Weller might&#xD;
call 'Ease afore Ceremony;'-in it delicate particularity,&#xD;
Mr. Linden's undress might have graced a ball-room; and,&#xD;
as I have said, the dark brown wrapper with its wide sleeves&#xD;
was be niing. Dr. Harrison might easily see that his pa.&#xD;
tient was not only different from most of the neighbour.&#xD;
hood, but also from most p le that he had seen anywhere;&#xD;
and that peculiar repose look was strongly indicative of&#xD;
power,&#xD;
"Good morning !" said the doctor. "Do you expect&#xD;
me to behave well this morning?"&#xD;
"Why no-" said Mr. Linden. "My experience hitherto&#xD;
has not led me to expect anything of the sort."&#xD;
The doctor stood before the fire, looking down at him,&#xD;
smiling almost, yet with a keen eye, as at a man whose&#xD;
measure he had not yet succeeded in takis.&#xD;
"What did you come down here for, without my leave?&#xD;
And how do you do ?"    For you see, I mean to behave&#xD;
well."&#xD;
"I came down because I wanted to be at home," said&#xD;
Mr. Linden. "And I did not ask leave, because I meant&#xD;
to come whether tr no. You see what a respect I have for&#xD;
your orders."                      ,&#xD;
"Yes," said the doctor,-" that is a very ancient'sort of&#xD;
respect. How do you do, Linden ?"&#xD;
"I suppose, well,-as to feeling, I should not care to go,&#xD;
through the Olympic games, even in imagination; and the&#xD;
various sensations in my left arm make me occasionally wish&#xD;
they were in my right."&#xD;
The doctor proceeded to an examination of the arm. It&#xD;
was found not to be taking the road to healing so readily&#xD;
as had been hoped.&#xD;
"I am afraid it may be a somewhat tedious affair," said&#xD;

Dr. Harrison, as he renewed the bandages inthe way they&#xD;
ought to be.  "I wish I had hold of that fellow! This&#xD;
may take a little time to come to a harmonious disposition,&#xD;
Linden, and give you a little annoyance. And at the same&#xD;
time, it's what you deserve 1" said he, retaking his disen-&#xD;
gaged manner as he finished what he had to do. "I almost&#xD;
wish I could threaten you with ra fever, or something&#xD;
serious; but I see you are as sound as that 'axletree' our&#xD;
friend spoke of the other day.  There it is! You have&#xD;
learned to do evil with impunity. For I confess thishas&#xD;
nothing to do with the exercise of your lawless disposition&#xD;
yesterday. Why didn't you let me bring you, if you wanted&#xD;
to come? That old fellow can't have anything drawn by&#xD;
horses, that goes easier than a harrow !"&#xD;
"Let you bring me !" said Mr. Linden. "Would you&#xD;
have done it against your own orders ?"&#xD;
"Under your authority ! which is equal to anything, you&#xD;
know."&#xD;
"Well," said Mr. Linden, "will you take a seat under&#xD;
my authority, and then take the benefit of my fire? What&#xD;
is going on in the outer world ?"&#xD;
"I haven't any idea !" said the doctor.  "Pattaquasset&#xD;
seems to me to be, socially, at one extreme pole of the&#xD;
axletree before-mentioned, and while I am here I feel no&#xD;
revolution of the great mass heaving beyond. It takes&#xD;
away on 's breath, does Pattaquasset."&#xD;
"You re making it akin to 'the music of the spheres,"'&#xD;
said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"Is that what gou find in Pattaquasset ?" said the doctor.&#xD;
"Your ears must be pleasantly onstituted-or more agree-&#xD;
ably saluted than those of other mortals. The only music&#xD;
I know of here is Miss Derrick's voice. Does she feed&#xD;
upon roses, like the Persian bulbul ?"&#xD;
"I should suppose not-unless roses impart their colour&#xD;
in that way," said Mr. Linden, softly turning the folded&#xD;
paper from  ide to side.&#xD;
"This is a nice place," said the doctor surveying the&#xD;
room-"and ybu look very comfortable. I should like to&#xD;
take your invitation and sit down-but I mustn't. Won't&#xD;
you try and put a good opinion of me into the head of Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick ?"&#xD;

"What an extraordinary request !" said Mr. Linden,&#xD;
laughing a little. "Pray what am I to understand by it?&#xD;
And why mustn't you sit down ?--.here is something to re-&#xD;
joice your heart with a few of the aforesaid upheavings of&#xD;
Society;" and he handed the doctor an unopened foreign&#xD;
newspaper.&#xD;
"Absolutely irresistible !" said the doctor, and he broke&#xD;
the cover, took a chair and sat down before the fire; where&#xD;
for awhile to all appearance he also made himself 'comfort.&#xD;
able'; and certainly turned and returned and ran over the&#xD;
paper in an artistic manner.&#xD;
"After all," said he, "it's a bore! this alternation of&#xD;
knocking each other down which the nations of the earth&#xD;
practise,-and the societies,-and the men! It's a pugil.&#xD;
istic world we live in, Linden. It's a bore to kep up with&#xD;

and in Pattaquasset-where you are just now the king of&#xD;
men's mouths-And all the while it don't a pin signify,&#xD;

"How long 'must I, being 'atop,' lie here?  All this&#xD;
week ?"&#xD;
"What will you do if I say more than that ?"&#xD;
"Why. I'll listen respectfully. Do you know I like to&#xD;
see you sitting there ?-Here is another paper for you."&#xD;
The doctor looked at him with an odd, frankly inquisitive&#xD;
smile ;but he only took the paper to play with it.&#xD;
"I wonder if I may ask a roundabout favour from&#xD;
you ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"You may ask anything-" said Mr. Linden. "I&#xD;
would rather have it in a straight-forward form."&#xD;
"Can't," said the doctor, "because it is crooked. I sup-&#xD;
pose at this hour .every lady in Pattaquasset expects that&#xD;
her friends will not call her away from her affairs; and I&#xD;
stupidly forgot to deliver my message when I had a mo-&#xD;
ment's chance thf morning. Now as it is possible you may&#xD;
4     see this-if she cannot be called th  silver-fQoted Thetis,&#xD;
she is certainly the silver-tongued you would know how&#xD;
to address her?"                b&#xD;
"Thetis !-probably, when I s  her."&#xD;
"I may presume you will kn w her when you see her,-&#xD;
and that brings me to my poi t. I have got some good&#xD;
&#xD;
microscopic preparations--which I am to have the pleasure&#xD;
of exhibiting o-night to some friends of my sister. Now&#xD;
it would great y add to her pleasure and ,mine, if this mor-&#xD;
tal Polyhymni will consent to be of the number.-and this&#xD;
is what I was 'oing to ask you, if you please, to communi-&#xD;
cate to her or to her mother, in whose good graces, as I told&#xD;
you," said the: doctor with a funny smile, "I don't think I&#xD;
have the honogt to stand high. Sophy would have written&#xD;
this morning, but I gave her no chance. I Ai-call for&#xD;
Miss Derrick this evening if she will allow me."&#xD;
Mr. Linden took out his pencil aid made a note of the&#xD;
facts.&#xD;
"First," he said, I am to common ate, then you are to&#xD;
call, after that to exhibit. Do you call that crooked ?-why&#xD;
it's as straight as the road from here to your house."&#xD;
Dr.l Harrisonlooked-and for a minute did not anything&#xD;
else.&#xD;
"For your arm, Linden," he said then getting up from&#xD;
his chair, and 3 smile of doubtful comicality moving his lip&#xD;
a little-" we shall know better about it in two or three&#xD;
weeks; but certainly I think you must be content to stay&#xD;
at dome for double those-that's undoubted."&#xD;
Mr. Linden gave the doctor a quick glance, but the&#xD;
smile which followed was 'undoubted' in another way.&#xD;
"When two opposing forces meet at right angles, doc-&#xD;
tor," he said, "you know what happens to, the object.&#xD;
Not contented inertia."&#xD;
"Contented ! no, very likely,-not when it is this object.&#xD;
But you will find a third force will establish the inertia."&#xD;
"What is your third force ?"&#xD;
"The necessity of the case," said the doctor seriously!&#xD;
But to that Ir. Linden made no reply.  he conversa-&#xD;
tion had bee kept up not only kg ' st weakness but&#xD;
against pain, a d he lay very Mtill and colourless for a long&#xD;
time after the doctor closed the door.&#xD;
Meanwhile Faith, busy at her brown moreen, made her&#xD;
mother's job of mending seem like embroidery; but by de-&#xD;
grees Mrs. Derrick's face became thoughtful, and she said,&#xD;

"No, mother," she said, looking at her.&#xD;
"Why child!"-Mrs. Derrick began,-then she stopped&#xD;
and began again. "I guess he'd rather see you than&#xD;
that box, child, -if the doctor hasn't talked him to&#xD;
death."&#xD;
Mother, do you think he would like to have me come&#xD;
up and see him ?"&#xD;
"Like it ?" said Mrs. Derrick, her mind almost refusing&#xD;
to consider such an absurd question. "I'm sure he likes&#xD;

night?"&#xD;
Faith looked a little bit grave, then she hastily pushed&#xD;
her brown moreen and box into a somewhat more orderly&#xD;
state of disorganization, and went up stairs, with a quick&#xD;
light step that was not heard before her tap at Mr.&#xD;
Linden's door. And then receiving permission she went&#xD;
in, a little rosy this time at venturing into the charmed&#xD;
region when its occupant was there; and came with her&#xD;
step a little lighter, a little slower, up to the side of the&#xD;
couch and held out her hand; saying her soft "How do&#xD;
you do, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
He was lying just as the doctor had left him, with the&#xD;
unopened letters, and the white paper which Faith felt&#xD;
instinctively was her own exercise. But eye and hand&#xD;
were ready for her.&#xD;
"Courageous Miss Faith !" he said with a smile. "And&#xD;
so, 'She's gentle and not fearful' ?".&#xD;
She smiled, with an eye that took wistful note of him.&#xD;
"How do you feel to-day, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"Not very well-and not worse. Miss Faith, do you&#xD;
know that we have a great deal to do this week? You&#xD;
may lock up your stocking basket."&#xD;
"Please let me do something for you, Mr. Linden ?" she&#xD;
said earnestly.&#xD;
"That's just what I'm talking about. Do you think,&#xD;
Miss Faith, that if you brought that low chair here, and&#xD;
set the 'door wide open so that you could run out if you&#xD;
got frightened at my grim appearance, you would be,1-ll&#xD;
ing to philosophize a litl -"&#xD;
"Not to-day, Mr. Linden," said Faith. "Don't speak&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.                  251&#xD;
so! I haven't any stocking basket in the way. Can't I&#xD;
do something that would do you some good ?"&#xD;
"It would do me a great deal of good to get up and set&#xD;
that chair for you, but that is something I must ask you to&#xD;
do for me. I see you want coaxing"-he added, looking&#xD;
at her. "Well.-if you will do half a dozen things for me&#xD;
this morning, you shall have the reward of a letter and two&#xD;
messages."&#xD;
Faith looked down doubtful,-doubtful, whether to do&#xD;
what would please herself, and him, would be just right to.&#xD;
day; but the pleading of the affirmative side of the ques-&#xD;
tion was too strong. She gave up considering the pru-&#xD;
dential side of the measure, thinking that perhaps Mr.&#xD;
Linden knew his own feelings best; and once decided, let&#xD;
pleasure have its full flow. With hardly a shade upon. the&#xD;
glad readiness of her movements, she placed the chair and&#xD;
brought the book, and sat docile down, though keeping a&#xD;
jealous watch for any sign of pain or weariness that should&#xD;
warn her to stop. And from one thing to another he led&#xD;
her on, talking less than usual, perhaps, himself, but giving&#xD;
her none the less good a lesson. And the signs she sought&#xD;
for could not be found. Weary he was not, mentally, and&#xD;
physical nature knew its place. Last of all, the little exer-&#xD;
cise was opened and commented upon and praised--and&#xD;
she praised through it, though very delicately.&#xD;
"Have I tired you ?" he said, as the town clock struck&#xD;
an hour past the mid-day.&#xD;
"Oh no !-And you, 1r. Linden ?"&#xD;
In what a different tone the two parts of her speech were&#xD;
spoken.&#xD;
"I have not hurt myself," he said smiling. "!Perhaps&#xD;
by and by, this afternoon, you will lets me see you again.&#xD;
Dr. Harrison threatens to keep me at home for two or&#xD;
three weeks, and I want to make tile most of them,-I may&#xD;
not have such a time of leisure again."  And then Mr.&#xD;
Linden gave the doctor's message-a message, very strictly,&#xD;
and as near as possible mi the doctor's own words, receiving&#xD;
asltl  inge as it well could from the medium through&#xD;
Which it passed.&#xD;
"The other message," he said, givmghralte,"o&#xD;

"A message ?"--said Faith doubtfully and flushing with&#xD;
pleasure-"isn't this one of your sister's letters ?"&#xD;
"Yes. Mayn't she send you a message ?"&#xD;
A very modest and very happy smile and deepening&#xD;
blush answered that; and she ran away with a sudden com.&#xD;
punctious remembrance of Mr. Linden's dinner.&#xD;
After dinner Faith had something to do in the kitchen,&#xD;
and something to do in other parts of the house, and then&#xD;
she would have read the letter before all things else; but&#xD;
then came in a string of company-one after the other,&#xD;
everybody wanting the news and much more than could be&#xD;
given. So it was a succession of flourishing expectations&#xD;
cut down and blasted ; and both Faith and her mother&#xD;
grew tired of the exercise of cutting down and blasting,&#xD;
and Faith remembered with dismay that the afternoon was&#xD;
wearing and Mr. Linden had wished to see her again. She&#xD;
seized her chance and escaped at last, between the adieu of&#xD;
one lady and the accost of another who was even then&#xD;
coming up from the gate, and knocked at Mr. Linden's&#xD;
door again just as Mrs. Derrick was taking her minister's&#xD;
wife into the parlour. Her first move this time on coming&#xD;
in, was to brush up the hearth and put the fire in proper&#xD;
order for burning well; then she faced round before the&#xD;
couch and stood in a sort of pleasant expectation, as wait-&#xD;
ing for orders.&#xD;
"You are a bright little visiter !" Mr. Linden said, hold.&#xD;
ing out his hand to her. "You float in as softly and alight&#xD;
as gently as one of these crimson leaves through my win-&#xD;
dow.   Did anybody ever tell you 'the real reason why&#xD;
women are like angels ?"&#xD;
"I didn't know they were," said Faith laughing,&#xD;
and with something more of approximation to a crimson&#xD;
leaf.&#xD;
"'They are all ministering spirits'," be said looking at&#xD;
her.. "But you must be content with that, Miss Faith, and&#xD;
not make your visits angelic in any other sense. 'What do&#xD;
you suppose I have been considering this afternoon?-&#xD;
while you have been spoiling the last Pattaquasset story&#xD;
by confessing that I am alive ?"&#xD;
"Did you hear theni coming in ?" said Faith. "I didn't&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
253&#xD;
&#xD;
know when they were going to let me get away.--What&#xD;
have you been considering, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"The wide-spread presence and work of beauty. You&#xD;
see what a shock you gave my nervous system yesterday.&#xD;
Will you please to sit down, Miss Faith ?"&#xD;
Faith sat down, clearly in a puzzle; from which she ex-&#xD;
pected to be somehow fetched out.&#xD;
"What do you suppose is beauty's work in the world ?-&#xD;
I I don't mean any particular Beauty."&#xD;
Faith looked at the crimson leaves on the floor.--for the&#xD;
window wd6 open though the fire was burning; then at the&#xD;
fair sky outside, seen beyond and through some other crim-&#xD;
son leaves yet hanging on the large maple there,-then&#xD;
coming back to the face before her, she smiled and said,&#xD;
"I don't know-except to make people happy, Mr.&#xD;
I Linden."&#xD;
"That is one part of its use, certainly. But take the&#xD;
thousands of wilderness flowers, and the thousands-of deep&#xD;
sea shells; look at the carvings on the scale of a fish, which&#xD;
no human eye -can see without a glass, or those other ex-&#xD;
quisite patterns traced upon the roots and stems of some&#xD;
of the fossil pines, which were hid in the solid rock before&#xD;
there was a human eye to see. What is their use ?"&#xD;
To the wilderness and to the deep sea, Faith's thought&#xD;
and almost her eye went, and she took .some time to con-&#xD;
sider the subject.&#xD;
"I suppose-" she said thoughtfully-" I don't know,&#xD;
Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"Did you ever consider those words which close the&#xD;
account of the Creation-' God saw everything that he had&#xD;
made, and behold, it was very good'."&#xD;
"That is what I was going to say !" she said modestly&#xD;
but with brightening colour,--"that perhaps he made all&#xD;
those things, those you spoke of,i for himself?"&#xD;
"For himself-to satisfy the perfectness of his own cha-&#xD;
racter. And think how different! the divine and the human&#xD;
standards of perfection ! Not the outward fair colour and&#xD;
proportion merely, not the perfect fitness and adaptation,&#xD;
not the most utilitarian employment of every grain of dust,&#xD;
so that nothing is lost,..-not even the grandest scale of&#xD;
working, is enough ; but the dust on the moth's wing must&#xD;

minute shells, each one of which shines like spun silver or&#xD;
is figured like cut glass. Not more steadily do astrono.&#xD;
mers discover new worlds, than the microscope reveals&#xD;
some new perfection of detail and finish la our own."&#xD;
Faith listened,- during this speech, like one literally see.&#xD;
ing 'into space,' as far as an embodied spirit can, for the&#xD;
first time. Then with a smile, a little sorrowful, she&#xD;
brought up with,&#xD;
" I don't know anything of all that, Mr. Linden! Do&#xD;
you mean that chalk is really made of little shells ?"&#xD;
"Yes, realy-..-and blue mould is like a miniature forest.&#xD;
You will know about it"--he said with a smile.  "But do&#xD;
you see how this touches the standard of moral perfection?&#xD;
--how it explains that other word, 'Be ye also perfect'."&#xD;
Faith had not seen before, but she did now; for in her&#xD;
face the answer flashed most eloquently. She was silent.&#xD;
"That is the sort of perfection we are promised," Mr.&#xD;
Linden went on presently,.-" that is the sort of perfection&#xD;
we shall see. Now, both glass and ey~e are imperfect,..&#xD;
specked, and flawed, and short-sighted; and can bu4 faintly&#xD;
discern 'the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works&#xD;
of him that is perfect in knowledge.' But then I.-..&#xD;
'When sin no more obstructs our sight,&#xD;
When sorrow pains our hearts no more,&#xD;
How shall we view the Prince of Light,&#xD;
And all his works of grace explore!&#xD;
What heights and depths of love divine&#xD;
Will then through endless ages shine!"'&#xD;
The words moved her probably, for she sat with her&#xD;
face turned a little away so that its play or its gravity were&#xD;
scarce so well revealed.  Not very long however. The&#xD;
silence lasted time enough to let her thoughts come back&#xD;
to the subject never very far from them.&#xD;
"You are tired, Mr. Linden."&#xD;
"By what chain of reasoning, Miss Faith ?"&#xD;
"I know by the sound of your voice. And you eat&#xD;
nothing to-day. Do you like - cocoa, Mr. Linden ?" she&#xD;
added eagerly. .&#xD;
He smiled a little and answered yes. -&#xD;
" Then I shall bring you some!"&#xD;
&#xD;
Faith stayed for no answer to that remark, but ran off.&#xD;
laif an hour good had passed away, but very few minutes&#xD;
more, when her soft tap was heard at the door again and&#xD;
herself entered, accompanied with the cup of cocoa and, a&#xD;
plate of dainty tiny strips of toast.&#xD;
"Aunt Dilly left some here," she said as she presented&#xD;
the cup,-"and she says it is good; and she shewed me&#xD;
how to make it. Aunt Dilly has lived all her life with a&#xD;
brother who has lived a great part of his life with a French&#xD;
wife-so Aunt Dilly has learned some of her ways-and&#xD;
this is one of'them."&#xD;
But Mr. Linden looked as if he thought 'the- way' be-&#xD;
longed emphatically to somebody else.&#xD;
"And so I am under the rule of the blue ribbands still 1'&#xD;
he said as he raised himself up jo do honour to the cup of&#xD;
cocoa. "Miss Faith, do you knOw you are subjecting your-&#xD;
self to the penalty of extra lessons ?"&#xD;
"How, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"Don't you know that is one of the punishments for bad&#xD;
conduct? It's a great act of igsubordingtion to bring one&#xD;
cocoa without leave."&#xD;
She laughed, and then paid her attentions to the fire&#xD;
again; after which she stood by the hearth to see the cocoa&#xD;
disposed of,, till she came to take the cup.&#xD;
"Are you in pain, much, Mr. Linden ?" she asked as&#xD;
she did this.&#xD;
"Not mental.-" he said with a smile; "and the physical&#xD;
can be borne. Miss Faith, that cocoa was certainly better&#xD;
than I ever had from the hands of anybody's French wife.&#xD;
You must have improved upon the receipt."&#xD;
"When Dr. Harrison comes for me this evening, shall&#xD;
he come up and see you again ?"&#xD;
"If he wishes-there is no need else."&#xD;
"How did it happen, Mr. Linden ?" she said with a very&#xD;
serious face.&#xD;
"On this wise, Miss Faith. I, walking home at a rather&#xD;
quick pace, was suddenly 'brought to' as the sailors say,&#xD;
by this shot in my arm. But as for the moment it affected&#xD;
the mind more than the body, I turned and gave chase,-&#xD;
wishing to enquire who had thus favoured me, and .why.&#xD;
But the mind alone can only carry one a certain distance,&#xD;

danger of fainting that I turned about again, and made the&#xD;
best of my way to the house of Mr. Simlins. The rest&#xD;
you know."&#xD;
"What did the man run for ?"&#xD;
"There is no thread in my nature that just answers that&#xD;
question," said Mr. Linden. "I suppose he ran because&#xD;
he was frightened."&#xD;
"But what should have frightened him ?"&#xD;
"The idea of my displeasure probably," said Mr. Linden&#xD;
smiling. "Have you forgotten my character for cruelty,&#xD;
Miss Faith ?"&#xD;
"But-" said Faith. "Why should he think he had dis-&#xD;
pleased you?  He wasn't near you, was he ?"&#xD;
"Why I am not supposed to be one of those amiable&#xD;
people who like to be shot," said Mr. Linden in the same&#xD;
tone.&#xD;
"But'how near was he, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"Within gunshoPrange, of course-the precise distance is&#xD;
not easily meas ed at such a moment."   -&#xD;
"But if he was not near," said Faith, "how could he&#xD;
think that his shot had touched you ? He couldn't see it-&#xD;
and your running wouldn't seem like a man seriously&#xD;
injured ?"&#xD;
"He might think I disapproved of discharging a gun at&#xD;
random, in the public road."&#xD;
"You don't suppose it could have been done on purpose,&#xD;
Mr. Linden 1" she said in a changed awe-stricken tone.&#xD;
"I have no right to assume anything of the kind--.there&#xD;
are all sorts of so-called accidents. But Miss Faith! if&#xD;
you look so frightened-I shall begin to think you are an&#xD;
accomplice! What do you know about it?" he added&#xD;
smiling.&#xD;
"Nothing-." she said rather sadly, "except a little look&#xD;
of something, I don't know what, in your face when you&#xD;
said that, Mr. Linden."&#xD;
"You must not look grave-.-nor think twice about the&#xD;
matter in. any way," he said with a sort of'kind gravity&#xD;
that met hers. "Is there light enough for you to read,&#xD;
that first chapter of Physical Geography, and talk to me'&#xD;
about it ?-.-it is your turn to talk now."&#xD;

"Do you mean, aloud ?-or to myself, Mr. Linden ?" she&#xD;
asked a little timidly.&#xD;
"I mean, to me.&#xD;
Faith did not object, though her colour rose very visibly.&#xD;
She \placed herself to catch the fading light, and read on,&#xD;
talking where it was absolutely necessary, but sparing and&#xD;
placing her questions so as to call forth as few words as&#xD;
possible in reply. And becoming engaged in the interest&#xD;
of the matter she almost forgot her timidity ;-not quite,&#xD;
for every now and then something made it rise to the sur-&#xD;
face. The daylight was fading fast, sunlight had already&#xD;
gone, and the wood fire began to throw its red gleams un-&#xD;
checked; flashing fitfully into the corners of the room and&#xD;
playing hide and seek with the shadows. A little rising&#xD;
of the wind and light flutter of the leaves against the glass,&#xD;
only made the warm room more cheerful. Faith made the&#xD;
fire burn brightly, and finished the chapter by that, with the&#xD;
glow of the flickering flame dancing all over her and her&#xD;
book in the corner where she sat. But pages of pleasure&#xD;
as well as of prettiness, all those pages were.&#xD;
"Thank you, Miss Faith,'Mr. Linden said as she closed&#xD;
the book. "I only wish I could give you a walk now in&#xD;
this bright evening air; but I must wait for that."&#xD;
A little tap at the door 'came at this point to take its&#xD;
place in the conversation. It was Mrs. Derrick.&#xD;
"Child," said the good lady, "here's Dr. Harrison down&#xD;
stairs." And stepping into the room, Mrs. Derrick walked&#xD;
softly up to the couch, and not only made enquiries but felt&#xD;
of Mr. Linden's hand to see if he had any fever. -Faith&#xD;
waited, standing a little behind the couch head.&#xD;
"I'm not quite sure-" she said,-"your hand's a little&#xD;
warm, sir-but then it's apt to be towards night, -and&#xD;
maybe mine's a little cool. If you could only go to sleep,&#xD;
it would do you so much good !"&#xD;
And Mr. Linden laughingly promised to try, but would&#xD;
not guarantee the success thereof.&#xD;
Faith went. down stairs, a little afraid that she had been&#xD;
doing harm instead of good, and at the same time not see-&#xD;
ing very well how she could have helped it. .She found&#xD;
Dr. Harrison in the sitting-.room, and gave her quiet rea-&#xD;
sons for not going out with him. The doctor declared "he&#xD;

should be in despair-but that he had hope !" and having&#xD;
made Faith confess that: she would like to see his micro.&#xD;
scope, gently suggested the claims of the next two even.&#xD;
ings; saying that he nust be in Quilipeak for a day or two&#xD;
soon himself, and therefore was not impatient without reason,&#xD;
Faith did not know how to get off, and gave the doctor to-&#xD;
understand that she might be disengaged the next night,&#xD;
Having whicp comfort he went up to see Mr. Linden.&#xD;
Then followed Mr. Linden's tea, with cresses and grapes&#xD;
which Dr. Harrison had brought himself.&#xD;
"Mother,".said Faith, when the two ladies were seated&#xD;
at their own tea-table,--"did Dr. Harrison dress Mr. Lin.&#xD;
den's arm again to-night?"&#xD;
"Yes child-and I guess it was good he did. I think&#xD;
Mr. Linden was almost asleep when I went up."&#xD;
Do you know how to do it, mother? if it was wanted&#xD;
when the doctor is not here ?"&#xD;
"I don't know-" said Mrs. Derrick thoughtfully,-"no,&#xD;
child, I don't know how-at least not so I'd like to try.&#xD;
Do you, Faith ?"&#xD;
"No, mother-but could, you learn ?"&#xD;
"Why-I suppose I could, child," said her mother, as&#xD;
if she disliked to admit een so much.  "But I'd about as&#xD;
lieve have my own arm shot off-I'm so dreadfully afraid&#xD;
of hurting people, Faith-and I always was afraid of him,&#xD;
Why can't the doctor do it ? he can come six times a day&#xD;
if he's wanted-I guess he don't do much else."&#xD;
Jf       Faith said no more on the subject, but hurried through&#xD;
her tea and sat down by the lamp in the sitting-room to&#xD;
read her letter. A minute or two she sat thinking, deeply,&#xD;
with her cheek on her hand; then dismissing everything&#xD;
else she opened the precious paper at last.&#xD;
It was another Italy letter, but took her a very different&#xD;
journey from the last. A little graver perhaps than that,&#xD;
a little more longing in the wish to use eyesight instead of&#xD;
pen and ink; and as if absence was telling more and more&#xD;
upon the writer. Yet all this was\ rather in the tone than&#xD;
the wording-that was kept in hand. But it was midway&#xD;
in some bright description,:that the message to Faith broke&#xD;
4       forth.&#xD;
" Tell Miss Faith," she said, "that I would rather have&#xD;
&#xD;
seen her roasting clams down at 'the shore,' than anything&#xD;
I have seen since I heard of it,-which is none the less&#xD;
true, that I should have wanted to stand both sides of the&#xD;
window at once. And tell her if you can (though I don't&#xD;
believe even you can, John Endy) how much I love her for&#xD;
taking such care of one of my precious things. I feel as&#xD;
if all my love was very powerless just now ! However-&#xD;
you remember that comforting old ballad-&#xD;
'Where-there is no space&#xD;
For the glow-worm to lye;&#xD;
Where there is no space&#xD;
For receipt of a fly;&#xD;
Where the midge dares not venture,&#xD;
Lest herself fast she lay;&#xD;
If love come he will enter,&#xD;
And soon find out his way!'&#xD;
"So, Miss Faith, you may expect to see me appear some&#xD;
time in the shape of a midge !..-Endecott will tell you I am&#xD;
not much better than that now."&#xD;
So far Faith got in reading the letter, and it was a long&#xD;
while before she got any further; that message to herself&#xD;
she went over again and again. It was incomprehensible, it&#xD;
was like one of Mr. Linden's own puzzles for that. It was&#xD;
so strange, and at the same time it was such a beautiful&#xD;
thing, that Mr. Linden's' sister should have heard of her&#xD;
and in such fashion as to make her wish to send a message !&#xD;
Faith's head stooped lower and lower over the paper, from&#xD;
her mother and the lamp. - It was such a beautiful message&#xD;
too-the gracious and graceful wording of it Faith felt in&#xD;
every syllable; and the lines of the old ballad were some of&#xD;
the prettiest she had ever seen.  But that Faith should&#xD;
have love sent her from  Italy-and from that person in&#xD;
Italy of all others !-that Mr. Linden's sister should wish&#xD;
to see her and threaten to do it in the ;shape of a midge !&#xD;
--and what ever could Mr. Linden have told her to excite&#xD;
the wish? And what of this lady's precious things had&#xD;
Faith taken care of ?-'such care' of!  "Mother !"-Faith&#xD;
began oncs, byway of taking counsel, but thought better&#xD;
of it, and went on pondering by herself. One thing was&#xD;
undoubted-this message in this letter was a matter of&#xD;

great pleasure and honour! as Faith felt it in the bottom&#xD;
of her heart; but in the midst of it all, she hardly kne&#xD;
whence, came a little, little twinge of something like pain,&#xD;
She felt it--yes, she felt it, even in the midst of the mes&#xD;
sage; but if Faith herself could not trace it out, of cours&#xD;
it can be expected of nobody else.                                     CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
HIL DAVIDS, taking his morning walk thr&#xD;
pleasant roads of Pattaquasset, engaged in&#xD;
of-school amusements of hunting cats and frighten&#xD;
dren, was suddenly arrested in the midst of an&#xD;
face ('got up' for the benefit of Robbie Waters) b&#xD;
roach of Sam Stoutenburgh. In general this yo&#xD;
tieman let Phil alone, 'severely,' but on the pres&#xD;
sion he stopped and laid hold of his shoulder.&#xD;
"Phil Davids! I've a warrant against you."&#xD;
"Hands off, Sam! and let a man alone, will yo&#xD;
do you mean by that ?" said  hil gruffly.&#xD;
C "Yes-I'll let him alone-when I find him, if&#xD;
you," said Sam with great coolness and some Ii&#xD;
tempt. "But if you're tired of your own face, P&#xD;
don't you make up a handsome one, while you're&#xD;
eep out of his way, Robbie! can't you?"&#xD;
"Ges you don't know what folks says o' you&#xD;
yo ?" said Phil, wriggling his shoulder from up&#xD;
hand. "I do!"&#xD;
"I guess I know as much as is good for me,"re&#xD;
undaunted Sam.- "But that's none of your bus&#xD;
now. Mr. Linden wants to'see you, Phil-and it&#xD;
anybody does that, so you'd better make the mo&#xD;
chance." With which pleasing sentiment, Sam&#xD;
Phil, and taking a sharp run after Robbie Water&#xD;
him into a long confidential conversation about&#xD;
Sunday school teacher. In the midst of which h&#xD;
came again.&#xD;
'Twon't hurt you Sam-jest listen once. r&#xD;
Sam Stoutenburgh would have been a Lady ap~&#xD;
hadn't grown to be such a Swar, and all the while&#xD;
he's a Seek-no-further. That's what folks says. ]&#xD;

Mr. Linden."&#xD;
"Guess I will !" said Phil swaggering off,-" when Iwant&#xD;
to see him; and that aint to-day, by a long jump."&#xD;
" He said you were to come-" Sam called after him,&#xD;
"If I wasn't a Stoutenburgh sweeting, Phil Davids, I'd&#xD;
teach you to talk of him so! If I only was!--" Sam added&#xD;
sotto voce, wouldn't I pack myself up in a basket! Rob.&#xD;
bie, what sort of flowery did Miss Faith have in her bonnet?")&#xD;
At which interesting point the two turned a corner out of&#xD;
Phil's sight.&#xD;
But Phil pursued his way; decently regardless of threats&#xD;
or invitations, and having a wholesome opinion of his own&#xD;
that in holiday time Mr. Linden had nothing to say to him,&#xD;
In no possible time had he anything to say to Mr. Linden&#xD;
that he could help. So it happened, that coming in soon&#xD;
after Mr. Linden had dismissed his breakfast, Faith found&#xD;
Mr. Linden alone. She brought to his side a basket of very,&#xD;
fine-looking pears.&#xD;
"Mr. Davids has sent you these, Mr. Linden."&#xD;
"IHe is very kind," said Mr. Linden. "That is more&#xD;
thai I asked for. He hasn't sent Phil in the basket too,&#xD;
has he ?-as the easiest way of getting him here."&#xD;
Faith rather startled, and passing over that asked Mr.&#xD;
Linden how he did. Which point, having learned all he&#xD;
wanted upon the other, Mr. Linden was also ready for.&#xD;
Faith then leaving the basket by the couch side, went&#xD;
to the fire and hearth, and put them more thoroughly&#xD;
to rights than Cindy's delicacy of touch, or of eye, had&#xD;
enabled her to do; and going on round the room, care-&#xD;
fully performed the same service for everything in it gener-&#xD;
ally. This work however was suddenly stopped in the&#xD;
midst, and coming to the head of the couch, rather behind&#xD;
Mr. Linden, Faith spoke in a low and ill-assured tone.&#xD;
"Mr. Linden-will you let me be by this morning when&#xD;
Dr. Harrison dresses your arm ?"1&#xD;
There was a moment's silence, and then raising himself&#xD;
up and turning a little so as to see her, Mr. Linden an-&#xD;
ewfpred, gravely though smiling,&#xD;
&#xD;
"No, Miss Faith !"&#xD;
She coloured very much and drew back.&#xD;
"I asked--" she said presently, speaking with a good&#xD;
deal of difficulty,-"because he spoke of being away-and&#xD;
then there would be no one to do it -and mother is&#xD;
afraid-"&#xD;
And there Faith stopped, more abashed than anybody&#xD;
had ever seen her in her life before. He held out his hand,&#xD;
and took hers, and held it fast.&#xD;
"I know-" he said,-"you need not tell me. When is&#xD;
the doctor going away ?"&#xD;
"I don't know," she said almost under breath-" he said&#xD;
perhaps--or I thought-I understood him to mean in a few&#xD;
dais."&#xD;
"Miss Faith !"-and the tone was half expostulating,&#xD;
half scolding, half caressing. "Come here and sit down by&#xD;
me," he said,gently drawing her round to the low chair at&#xD;
his side, "I want to talk to you. Do you need to be told&#xD;
why I said no ?"&#xD;
She sat down, but sunk her head a little and put up hei&#xD;
other hand to shield the side of her face which was next&#xD;
him. The answer did not come at once-when it did, it&#xD;
was a low spoken "no." Her hand was held closer, but&#xD;
except that and the moved change of his voice, Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den took no notice of her fear.&#xD;
"I would not let Pet do-it--" he said gently, "if I could&#xD;
help it. My child, do you know what a disagreeable busi-&#xD;
ness it is? I could trust you for not fainting at the time,&#xD;
but I should ill like to hear of your fainting afterwards.&#xD;
And then if you chanced to hurt me-which the, doctor&#xD;
often does-you would be unhappy for the rest of the day,&#xD;
--which the doctor by no means is. That is all-I would&#xD;
a great deal rather have your hands -about me than his, but&#xD;
a thing that would give you pain-would give me very&#xD;
doubtful relief. I had rather go with my arm undressed."&#xD;
He had gone on talking-partly to give her time to re-&#xD;
cover; but the silent look that was bent upon that shielded&#xD;
face was a little anxious.&#xD;
She dropped the hand that shielded it presently, and&#xD;
chewed it flushed and wistful, yet with a tiny bit of smile&#xD;
beginning to work at the corners of the mouth.'&#xD;

"Then Mr. Linden," she said almost in the same tone&#xD;
and without turning her face,-" if you have no other oh.&#xD;
jection-please let me come !"&#xD;
"But that one is strong enough. You may send Cia.&#xD;
derella up to take a lesson."&#xD;
"You said that was all ?" she repeated.&#xD;
"That is the only real objection-I would not raise ede&#xD;
that in a case of greater need. But I suppose unskilful&#xD;
hands could hardly do me much mischief now. So if yon&#xD;
will send Cinderella," he added with a smile, "she may en.&#xD;
large her world of ideas a little."&#xD;
"Mr. Linden,"-said Faith looking at him now' fear.&#xD;
lessly-.--"I am going to come myself."&#xD;
"You are !" he said, looking at her-and then his eyes&#xD;
went from her' to the fire, and back again to her face,&#xD;
"Then if you faint away, Miss Faith, and I jump up to&#xD;
take care of you (which I shall certainly do) I may faint&#xD;
myself-at which stage of the proceedings Dr. Harrison&#xD;
will have his hands full."&#xD;
"I shall not faint-before nor after," she said, shaking&#xD;
her head.&#xD;
"I should not like to count too much upon your unfeel.&#xD;
ing disposition," said Mr. Linden, in whose face different&#xD;
currents of thought seemed to meet and mingle. "And&#xD;
then you see, my senses may be guilty of as great a breach&#xD;
of politeness as the warder in a German story I was read&#xD;
ing yesterday."&#xD;
" What was that ?"&#xD;
"It fell out," said Mr. Linden, "that a lady of surpassing&#xD;
beauty arrived at a certain castle; and next day, the lord&#xD;
of the castle brought before her his warder, bound in chains,&#xD;
for a great breach of politeness; he having failed to give&#xD;
his lord notice of the lady's 'approach ! The warder thus&#xD;
defended himself: he had indeed seen the lady, but hi&#xD;
dazzled eyes mistook her for another sun! So," added 1Mr&#xD;
Linden smiling, "if my eyes should mistake you for a sn-&#xD;
beam or a maple leaf, I might forget myself, and not keep&#xD;
my patience so perfectly as I ought under the hands of such&#xD;
'a chirurgeon."&#xD;
"What is going to try your patience, Mr. Linden ?-?"&#xD;

"Do you really want to do this for me ?" he said in a&#xD;
different tone, looking at her with that same grave, kind&#xD;
look which sue had seen before.&#xD;
"J think I can-and I should like to do it; Mr. Linden,&#xD;
if you are perfectly willing," Faith answered.&#xD;
"I am willing, since you wish it,-and now you must get&#xD;
the doctor's leave-or rather I must get it for you; but in&#xD;
the mean time, Miss Faith, we may go on with some of our&#xD;
studies, if you are at leisure."&#xD;
Faith went to get the books, but returned without them&#xD;
and with a disturbed face.&#xD;
"Mr. Linden, one of the boys wishes to see you."&#xD;
"I suppose it never was heard that a boy came at the&#xD;
right time," said Mr. Linden. "Well Miss Faith-I believe&#xD;
I must see him-will you write another exercise for me?&#xD;
Here is your pen and paper-I will try not to be hindered&#xD;
long."&#xD;
Faith mutely took the pen and paper, and went out with&#xD;
a divided mind, for the boy whom she let in, Cindy being&#xD;
nowhere visible, was Phil Davids. Phil had thought better&#xD;
of his determination, and wisely judging that if Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den wanted to see him he probably would accomplish the'&#xD;
measure some time, concluded the shortest way was to see&#xD;
him as smoothly as possible. So in he walked and made&#xD;
his bow, grimly civil, but civil.&#xD;
Mr. Linden's opening remark, after he had given the&#xD;
boy his hand (which even he liked to touch) was at least&#xD;
peculiar.&#xD;
"Phil-do you know what a smart boy you are ?"&#xD;
And the answer was a strictly true, though blundering,&#xD;
"No, sir.&#xD;
"I don't know how smart you could be, myself," said Mr.,&#xD;
Linden, "but I know you are very smart now. You always&#xD;
make me think of the man who found a bag of jewels lying&#xD;
in the road and didn't know what they were."&#xD;
It occurred to Phil's mind that not to know jewels when&#xD;
they were seen was a doubtful proof of smartness; so he&#xD;
answered with a somewhat surly, "How, sir ?"&#xD;
"This man," Mr. Linden went on, "instead of having his&#xD;
jewels set in gold, to wear or to sell, went round the town&#xD;

flinging them at his neighbour's windows-or his neigh.&#xD;
bour's cats,--as you do, Phil, with your very bright powers&#xD;
of head and tongue. Why don't you make a man of your-&#xD;
self-and use those powers for something worth while ?"&#xD;
"You never see me doing' it, sir !" said Phil, answering&#xD;
the most interesting part of Mr. Linden's address.&#xD;
"iDon't I ?" said Mr. Linden,-"I see and hear a good&#xD;
many things. But nobody can get on in the world after&#xD;
such a prickly fashion,-why even a porcupine smooths&#xD;
himself down before he tries to go ahead. If you were to&#xD;
be a lawyer Phil, you'd fight your clients instead of helping&#xD;
them fight,-and if you were a farmer, you'd be like the&#xD;
man who burnt up three stacks of his hay because the fourth&#xD;
got wet."&#xD;
Phil reddened,;though he couldn't help smiling, and was&#xD;
evidently getting angry.&#xD;
"That 'ere farmer was a big fool !" he said.&#xD;
"Yes, we are agreed upon that point," said Mr. Linden,&#xD;
-"I daresay he would have said so himself next day.&#xD;
Well Phil-this was not what I wanted to talk to you&#xD;
about to-day-much as I like to see smart boys make the&#xD;
most of themselves. I want to know exactly what it was&#xD;
that you heard Reuben Taylor say about Miss Derrick."&#xD;
Phil's eyes opened unmistakeably.&#xD;
"I never heerd him say nothing about her!" he said&#xD;
boldly.&#xD;
"'Then why did you say your did ?" said Mr. Linden,&#xD;
with the cool fac of one who knows his ground.&#xD;
"I didn't!" sad Phil. "I'm blessed if I did."&#xD;
"No you are not-" said Mr. Linden gravely,-"people&#xD;
are never blessed who do not speak truth. And you have&#xD;
shut both doors by which such a blessing might have come&#xD;
in this case, Phil."&#xD;
"Who, said I ever said so, sir ?" Phil asked confidently.&#xD;
"You told D   Harrison, for one," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"1I never spoke a word to Dr. Harrison.-" Phil began&#xD;
andchecked himself. " I never said anything but the&#xD;
truth, sir !"&#xD;
What truth did you say to him ?" said Mr. Linden'&#xD;
"I wish you would .do the same for me. The- roughest&#xD;

truth, Phil, is pleasanter to my ears than the oothest&#xD;
falsehood."&#xD;
fI said nothin' but what was truth, sir,".said Phil, per-&#xD;
plexedly, as if he felt caught in a snare. "I didn't t ink&#xD;
you meant that."&#xD;
"That is precisely what Ii meant."&#xD;
"'Twarn't nothing but the truth, sir."&#xD;
"Well-" said Mr. Linden,-" I never was afraid of the&#xD;
truth yet, and I don't mean to begin now. You didn't say&#xD;
I had cut your ears off, 'Aid you Phil "&#xD;
"I didn't say nothin' about you, sir, good or indifferent."&#xD;
"That's something," said Mr. Linden with unmoved&#xD;
gravity. "What else did you say ?"&#xD;
" It was down to Neanticut, sir," said Phil-" I told Reu-&#xD;
ben Taylor as how he'd druv her down, Joe Deacon said&#xD;
lie had; and Reuben said Joe had made a mistake. That's&#xD;
the hull of it, sir.'?&#xD;
t Who is her ?" said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"She--Miss Faith Derrick, sir."&#xD;
Phil was getting very uncomfortably red in the face.&#xD;
"Well whydid you tell Miss Derrick that Reuben didn't&#xD;
drive her down ?.-would not she have been likely to know."&#xD;
"I didn't, sir."&#xD;
"I thought not. What did you tell her ?"&#xD;
"She knows what I told her !"-said Phil, looking ab-&#xD;
stractedly at the corner of the couch on which Mr. Linden&#xD;
lay.-" I don't know as I can recollect. But that's what&#xD;
Reuben said, sir. "&#xD;
"Well tell me as near as you can recollect-." said Mr.&#xD;
Linden. "And also just the words you used to Reuben."&#xD;
Phil took time to reflect.&#xD;
"I don't want ter," he said.&#xD;
"No, I see you don't-but I want to hear them," said&#xD;
Mr. Linden very quietly. "But tell me the truth this&#xD;
time, Phil."&#xD;
"F~olks has a right to speak," said Phil, stating a broad&#xD;
lproposition,-" but they hain't a right to tell all they say !"&#xD;
"Well ?"---said Mr. Linden, waiving that.&#xD;
"'Twarn't nothin' !" said Phil-" and it 'll just make&#xD;

that, Phil? But my forgiveness always meets confession&#xD;
half way, as 'you know," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"Well," said Phil, "L jest told Reuben he'd druv her&#xD;
down, and Reuben said Joe was mistaken. It was Joe&#xD;
said it first."&#xD;
"And what did you say before Dr. Harrison ?"&#xD;
"I said what Reuben said,"--said Phil feeling poorly.&#xD;
"And what was that ?"-Mr. Linden was as untireable&#xD;
as a minority juror.&#xD;
"I said Reuben said she warn't what Joe said," Phil&#xD;
got out at last in a lowered'tone.&#xD;
"And what was that?"&#xD;
"Well-" said Phil desperately-" Joe said she was-.-"&#xD;
Mr. Linden waited. So did Phil.&#xD;
"This is the house that Jack built," Mr. Linden re-&#xD;
marked. "What did Joe say she was ?"&#xD;
The answer came in articulation pretty well smothered up.&#xD;
 "Joe said she was Mr. Linden's sweetheart."&#xD;
"0 !.-." said Mr. Linden, with a tone Phil felt to the&#xD;
tips of his ears,-" that was'it ! I really did not know,&#xD;
Phil, that you and Joe took an interest in such matters.&#xD;
Have you had much experience ?"&#xD;
Phil shuffled and looked exceedingly embarrassed, but&#xD;
words found none. He had exhausted his stock, of more&#xD;
than words.&#xD;
"Well!" said Mr. Linden,-"you will find, Phil, that it&#xD;
is generally safe to study arithmetic'before you begin alge-&#xD;
bra.  "There's a little mistake here. Reubenr did not&#xD;
drive anybody down to Neanticut-Mrs. Derrick drove the&#xD;
whole way. That explains his words. As for yours,&#xD;
Phil-I wish," said Mr. Linden, looking at him gravely,&#xD;
but gently too, "I wish I knew something you would like&#xD;
very much to have. Can you tell me ?"&#xD;
If ever in his life Phil Davids mentally stared, (physi-&#xD;
cally, too) he did it now. 'Something he would like very&#xD;
much to have'? What could Mr. Linden want to know&#xD;
that for?  In his confusion Phil didn't know himself. To&#xD;
take in Mr. Linden, all over, was all he was competent to.&#xD;
"Well ?" said his teacher with a smile-it was rather a&#xD;
faint one, for he was tired, but very pleasant still. "What&#xD;
is there, Phil?-.M-I am in earnest.".&#xD;
&#xD;
"I'm sorry I said it, anyhow !" burst at last from the&#xD;
boy's reluctant lips. That seemed to be his ultimatum.&#xD;
He could see that his words gave pleasure, though they&#xD;
were not directly answered.&#xD;
"I must sehd you away now," Mr. Linden said, taking&#xD;
his hand again. "I am not strong enough to talk any&#xD;
more. But Phil-if you will learn to speak the truth-so&#xD;
that at the end of six months you can truly say, 'I hate&#xD;
every false way'- I will give you then what you like,-you&#xD;
shall choose your own reward. I would give anything I&#xD;
have in the world if I could make you fear to displease&#xD;
God by telling a falsehood, as much as you fear to displease&#xD;
me by owning it !"&#xD;
It was as much as Phil could do, to take his teacher's&#xD;
hand, and that was done more humbly than certainly any&#xD;
previous action of his life. Speak he could not; but so&#xD;
far as Mr. Linden's influence and authority were concerned&#xD;
that boy was conquered. Whatever he became in after&#xD;
times, and whatever his mates found him still,-and they&#xD;
were not open-mouthed in praise,-for his teacher that boy&#xD;
was a different boy.&#xD;
On his way out of the house he chanced to pass Faith,&#xD;
and did so without a sign of recognition, giving her about&#xD;
as wide a berth as if she had been a ghost. At the door&#xD;
he met Dr. Harrison coming in; but the doctor perhaps&#xD;
did not recognise him. Once clear, Phil ran for it. And&#xD;
at the stair-foot the doctor found Faith.&#xD;
"Dr. garrison," she said with grave simpleness, "if you&#xD;
will allow me, I should like to see you dress Mr. Linden's&#xD;
arm. If you go to Quilipeak there will be nobody to do&#xD;
it,-and I think I can learn. Mother is afraid, and it&#xD;
would be very disagreeable to her."&#xD;
"And not to you ?" said the doctor.&#xD;
"Not so disagreeable. I think I can do it," she answered,&#xD;
meeting his look steadily.&#xD;
"You must not !" said he. "You were dot made for&#xD;
such things.  Could do it !  I don't doubt you. could do&#xD;
anything. But if I go, I will send Dr. Limbre in my place.&#xD;
There is no need for yoi to do disagreeable work. Now&#xD;
it's pleasant to me 1"!&#xD;

own house now-he is sick. I will go up with you, if you&#xD;
please."&#xD;
Dr. Harrison could but follow her, as she tripped up the&#xD;
stairs before him; but there is no reasonable doubt he&#xD;
would have sent her on some, other errand if he could,&#xD;
Faith tapped at the door, and they entered the room&#xD;
together.&#xD;
"How do you do ?" said Dr. Harrison rather gravely,&#xD;
approaching the couch.&#xD;
Now the fact was, that those two previous interviews&#xD;
had been both long and exciting; and the consequent pros,&#xD;
tration was greater than usual; so though Mr. Linden did&#xD;
take down the hand which covered his eyes, and did meet&#xD;
the doctor's look with his accustomed pleasantness, his&#xD;
words were few. Indeed he had rather the air of one&#xD;
whose mind has chosen a good opportunity to ride ram.&#xD;
pant over the prostrate flesh and blood, and who has about&#xD;
given up all attempts to hold the bridle. Whether Dr.&#xD;
Harrison perceived as much, or whether there might be&#xD;
some othertreason, his words were also few. He addressed&#xD;
himself seriously to work.&#xD;
"Will you permit me to introduce an apprentice ?" he&#xD;
said, in a more commonplace way than was usual for him,&#xD;
as he was removing Mr. Linden's wrapper from the arm.&#xD;
Faith had come quietly up to the head of the couch and&#xD;
was standing therq.&#xD;
"Is not that the doctor's prerogative ?"&#xD;
"Hum-"-said the 'doctor doubtfully; but he dic not&#xD;
explain himself further.&#xD;
Faith had come close to the head of the couch, but stood&#xD;
a little back, so that Mr. Linden could not"see whether she&#xD;
looked like fainting or not. There were no signs of that,&#xD;
for the. lessening of colour in her cheeks, which was de.&#xD;
cided, kept company with a very clear and intent eye.&#xD;
One little caught breath he might hear, when the wounded&#xD;
arm was first laid bare; but not another. The doctor&#xD;
heard it too, for he looked up, but Faith was gravely and&#xD;
quietly busy with what she had come there to see;'giving&#xD;
it precisely the same simplicity of attention that she brought&#xD;
to her physical geography or her French exercise; and&#xD;

&#xD;
that was entire. She did not shrink; she rather pressed&#xD;
forward and bent near, to acquaint herself perfectly with&#xD;
what was done; and once or twicgked a question as to the&#xD;
reason or the use of something. Dr. Harrison glanced up&#xD;
at her the first time-it might have been with incipient im-&#xD;
patience-or irony,--but if either, it disappeared. He&#xD;
answered her questions straightforward and sensibly, giving&#xD;
her, and with admirable precision, exactly the information&#xD;
she desired, and even more than absolutely that. For&#xD;
everything else, the work went on inlence. When the&#xD;
doctor however was standing at the table a moment, pre-&#xD;
paring his lint or something else, and Faith had followed&#xD;
him there and stood watching; he said to her over the&#xD;
table in a sotto voce aside--but with a sharp glance-&#xD;
"Was the information true, that we received the other&#xD;
night ?-under the lanterns ?"&#xD;
"What a singular question !" said Mr. Linden from his&#xD;
couch.&#xD;
"Pourquoi ?" said the doctor as simply as if the original&#xD;
words had been addressed to Mr. Linden himself. "Well,&#xD;
it may be a singular question, for it was singular informa-&#xD;
tion. Was it well-founded, Miss Derrick ?"&#xD;
"No-at a venture," said Mr. Linden, with just the sort&#xD;
of air with which a sick person puts in his word and as-&#xD;
sumes superior knowledge.&#xD;
The doctor looked at one and at the other; Mr. Linden's&#xD;
face told him nothing, any more than his words; Faith, by&#xD;
this time,4W  covered with confusion.  That at least it&#xD;
might be visible to only one person, she moved back to her&#xD;
former place.&#xD;
"Were you behind us ?" said the doctor;-"or were you&#xD;
French enough to come by invisibly ?"&#xD;
"Is that the last new method ?" said Mr. Linden. "You&#xD;
have been in Paris since I was."&#xD;
"Nlver got so far as that though, I am sorry to say,"&#xD;
said the doctor coming back to the couch. "But after all,&#xD;
that was very vague information-it didn't tell one much-&#xD;
only I have a personal interest in the subject. But I am&#xD;
glad you spoket...he man that can tell the dream should be&#xD;
,able to give the interpretation. What did it mean, Lin-.&#xD;

"Behold a man of an enquiring turn of mind !" said Mr,&#xD;
Linden with the same half listless half amused air. "ie&#xD;
asks for truth, and when that tarries demands interpreta.&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
"I don't know what sort of a man I behold !" said the&#xD;
doctor, moving his eyes with a double expression for gn&#xD;
instant from Mr. Linden's arm. to his face.&#xD;
"I should think you were a German student in pursuit of&#xD;
'the Idea'!" said-Mr. Linden taking a quiet'survey of the&#xD;
doctor's face. "Have you completed the circle, or is there&#xD;
still hope the Idea may seize you ?"&#xD;
"The idea seized me a good while ago," said the doctor,&#xD;
with a most comical mock confessional look.&#xD;
"Well then," said Mr. Linden in a sort of confidential&#xD;
tone, "what is your opinion upon the great German ques.&#xD;
tion-whether it is better to be One and Somewhat, or to&#xD;
be Nought and All ?"&#xD;
"You see,"-said the doctor, standing back and suspend.,&#xD;
ing operations, --"everybody can't be One and Some.&#xD;
what !"&#xD;
"Then you choose the comprehensive side--" said Mr.&#xD;
Linden. "That is without doubt the most difficult,-the&#xD;
One and Somewhat is called egotistical, but to be Nought&#xD;
and All !--one must be-what do you suppose ?"&#xD;
"A philanthropist, I should suppose !" the doctor an-&#xD;
swered, with a change of expression not agreeable. And&#xD;
returning to his work, for awhile he behaved unusually like&#xD;
other people; not hurrying his work, but doing it with a&#xD;
grave steady attention to that and nothing else--answering,&#xD;
Faith, and saying no more. Perhaps however he thought&#xD;
silence might be carried too far; or else had an unsatisfied I&#xD;
mood upon him; for as he was finishing what he had to do,&#xD;
he looked up again to Faith and remarked,&#xD;
"What do you think of this for our quiet town, Miss&#xD;
Derrick?  Has Mr. Linden any enemies in Pattaquasset-&#xD;
that you know ?"&#xD;
It was merciless in the doctor; for through all this time&#xD;
she had been in a state of confusion-as he knew-.that&#xD;
made speech undesirable, though the had spoken. And she&#xD;
didn't answer him now, except iby a quickly withdraw&#xD;
glance.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Who do you suppose loves him well enough," pursued&#xD;
the doctor, "to send a charge of duck shot into him like&#xD;
that?"&#xD;
A sudden little cry of pain, driven back before it was&#xD;
well begun, was heard and but just heard, from Faith. The&#xD;
doctor looked up.&#xD;
"I was afraid this--Are you faint ?" he said gently.&#xD;
"No sir,-" she answered; and she stood still as before,&#xD;
though the overspread colour which had held its ground for&#xD;
a good while past, had given way now and fluttered pain-&#xD;
fully. Butthe doctor's words brought Mr. Linden, for the&#xD;
first time since his accident-to a perfectly erect position&#xD;
on the couch-with a total disregard of where his arm&#xD;
went, or what became of its bandages.&#xD;
"What are you about!"'&#xD;
"I declare, I don't know !" said Dr. Harrison, standing&#xD;
back., "I thought I was just disposing of you comfortably&#xD;
for the day-but I am open to conviction 1"&#xD;
The left hand let go its grasp of'the couch-taken so&#xD;
suddenly, and for which the wounded arm took swift ven-&#xD;
geance; and Mr. Linden laid himself down on the cushions&#xD;
again, the colour leaving his cheeks as fast as it had come.&#xD;
"What's the matter, Linden ?" said the doctor with&#xD;
rather a kind look of concern. "You have hurt yourself."&#xD;
Faith left the room.&#xD;
"I fear I have disarranged some of your work."&#xD;
The doctor examined and set to rights.&#xD;
"I'll see how you do this evening. What ailed you to&#xD;
pitch into me like that, Linden ?"&#xD;
"I think the 'pitching in' came upon me," he answered&#xD;
pleasantly.&#xD;
."It seems so, indeed. I hope you won't try this kind of&#xD;
thing again. I am sure you won't to-day."&#xD;
And so the doctor went. A quarter of an hour or a&#xD;
ile more had gone by, when the light knock came at Mr.&#xD;
Linden's door that he had certainly learned to know by&#xD;
this time ; and Faith came in, bearing a cup of cocoa.&#xD;
The troubled look had not entirely left her face, nor the&#xD;
changeful.colour; but she was not -thinking of herself.&#xD;

The most prominent idea in Mr. Linden's mind just the,&#xD;
was that he had already had what he did not like; but that&#xD;
had no place in the look which answered her, as he raised&#xD;
himself a little (and but a little) to take the cup from her&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
"Pet would thank you better than I can now, Miss&#xD;
Faith."&#xD;
She stood looking down at him, with a little sorrowing&#xD;
touch about the lines of her mouth.&#xD;
"Do you know how much better two cups of cocoa are&#xD;
than one ?" said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"I don't know how you can have two at once, Mr. Lin.&#xD;
den."&#xD;
"Then I will bestow one upon you-and wait while you&#xD;
get it."&#xD;
"I am well-" she said, looking amused through her&#xD;
gravity, and shaking her head. "And besides, I couldn't&#xD;
take it, Mr. Linden." And to put an end to that subject,&#xD;
Faith had recourse to the never failing wood fire; andfrom'&#xD;
thence went round the room finishing what she had failed&#xD;
to do in the morning; coming back at the point of time to&#xD;
take Mr. Linden's cup. He looked at her a little as he&#xD;
gave it back.&#xD;
"You are too tired to go over all those lessons to-day-&#xD;
which do you like best? will you bring it ?",&#xD;
"I am not tired at all," she said with some flitting&#xD;
colour,."but you are, Mr. Linden. "Won't you rest-&#xD;
sleep-till after dinner-and then, if you like, let me come?"&#xD;
"I will let you come then-and stay now," he said&#xD;
smiling.&#xD;
"Let me stay and be silent then-or do something that&#xD;
will not tire you. Please, Mr. Linden !"\&#xD;
"Your line of action lies all within that'last bound," he&#xD;
said gently. "But'you may read French if you will-or&#xD;
write it and let me look over you,-or another geographic&#xD;
chapter. Neither need make me talk much."&#xD;
The hint about looking over her writing startled Faith'&#xD;
amazingly, but perhaps for that very reason she took it as&#xD;
the delicate expression of a wish. That would be a trial,&#xD;
but then too it wouht call for the least exertion on the part&#xD;
of her teacher. Faith was brave, if she was fearful, and&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

too really humble to have false shame; and after an instant's&#xD;
doubt and hesitation, she said, though she felt it to her&#xD;
fngers' ends,&#xD;
"ity exercise is all ready-it only wants to be copied-&#xD;
but how could you look over me, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"Could you do such an inconvenient thing as to use that&#xD;
small atlas for a table? and bring it here by me-I am not&#xD;
quite fit to sit up just now."&#xD;
Faith said no more words, but went for her exercise and&#xD;
sat down to write it, as, desired, under an observing and&#xD;
she knew a critical eye. It was well her business engrossed&#xD;
her very completely; for she was in an extremely puzzled&#xD;
and disturbed state of mind.  Dr. Harrison's words about&#xD;
the occasion of Mr. Linden's accident, carelessly run on,&#xD;
had at last unwittingly given her the clue her own innocent.&#xD;
spirit might have waited long for; apd grief and pain&#xD;
would have almost overcome her, 'but for a conflicting feel--&#xD;
ing of another kind raised by the preceding colloquy between&#xD;
the two gentlemen.  Faith was.in a state of profound un-&#xD;
eertainty, whether Mr. Linden's words had meant anything&#xD;
ar nothing. They were spoken so that they might have&#xD;
meant nothing-but then Phil Davids had just been with&#xD;
him-what for ?-and whatever Mr. Linden's words might&#xD;
have meant, Faith's knowledge of him made her instinc-&#xD;
tively know, through all the talk, that they had been spoken&#xD;
for the sake of warding off something disagreeable from&#xD;
her-not for himself. She tried as far as she could to dis-&#xD;
miss the question from her thoughts-she could not decide&#xD;
it-and to go on her modest way just as if it had not been&#xD;
raised; and she did ; but for all that her face was a study&#xD;
as she sat there writing. For amid all her abstraction in&#xD;
her work, the thought of the possibility that Mr. Linden&#xD;
might have known what he was talking about, would send&#xD;
a tingling flush up into her cheeks; and sometimes again&#xD;
the thoughts of pain that had been at work would bring&#xD;
upon her h.p almost one of those sorrowful curves which&#xD;
are so lovely and so pure on the_ lip of a little child-and&#xD;
rarely seen except there. All this was only by the way;&#xD;
it did not hinder the most careful attention to what she was&#xD;
about,'nor the steadiest working of her quite unsteady fin-&#xD;

gers, which she knew were very likely to move not accord.&#xD;
ing to rule.&#xD;
For a little while she was suffered to go on without in.&#xD;
terruption, other than an occasional word about the French&#xD;
part'of her exercise; but presently Mr. Linden's hand&#xD;
began to come now and then with a modifying touch upon&#xD;
her pen and fingers. At first this was done with a gentle&#xD;
"forgive me !" or, "if you please, Miss Faith,''-after that&#xD;
without words, though the manner always expressed them;&#xD;
and once or twice, towards the very end of the lesson, he&#xD;
told her that such a letter was too German-.or too sophist.&#xD;
ticated ; and shewe d her a more Saxon way. Which ad-&#xD;
monitions he helped her, as well as he could, to bear, by a&#xD;
quietness which w.s really as kind, as it seemed oblivious of&#xD;
all that had disturbed or could disturb her. And the words&#xD;
of praise and encouragement were spoken with their usual&#xD;
pleasure-taking and 'pleasure-giving effect. All this after&#xD;
a time effectually distracted Faith from all other thoughts&#xD;
whatever. When it was done, she sat a moment looking&#xD;
down at the paper, then looked up and gave him a very&#xD;
frank and humble "Thank you, Mr. Linden !" from face and&#xD;
lips both.&#xD;
If Faith liked 'approbation-that clover-honey to a&#xD;
woman's taste, so far beyond the sickly sweets of flattery&#xD;
and admiration -she might have been satisfied with the&#xD;
grave look of Mr. Linden's eyes at her then.&#xD;
"You are a brave little child !" he said. "I wish I&#xD;
could do something to give you a great deal of pleasure("&#xD;
"Pleasure !"-said Faith, and what was very rare with&#xD;
her, not only her face flushed but her eyes, so that she&#xD;
turned them away,-"why it is all pleasure to me, Mr.&#xD;
Linden !"-'Such pleasure as I never had before,'-she&#xD;
was near saying, but she did not say.&#xD;
"Well I must not let you tire yourself," he said with a&#xD;
smile, "for that would not be pleasant to one. Have you&#xD;
been out to-day ?"&#xD;
"No," said Faith, thinking of her brown moreen.&#xD;
"Nor yesterday-that will not do, Miss Faith. I am&#xD;
afraid I must give you up to the open air for a good part&#xD;
of this afternoon."&#xD;
&#xD;
"What shall I do there ?" said Faith smiling.&#xD;
"Let the wind-take you a walk-I wish I could be of the&#xD;
party. But the wind is good company, Miss Faith, and&#xD;
talks better than many people,--and the walk you vent."&#xD;
"So I want to finish my wood-box," said Faith, looking&#xD;
at the corner of the fireplace. "And I should think you&#xD;
would be tired of seeing the wood lie there, Mr. Linden. I&#xD;
am. I have got to go out this evening too-" she said&#xD;
with a little hesitation,-" to see that microscope."&#xD;
Mr. Linden was silent 'a moment.&#xD;
"The microscope does make'some difference," he .said,--.&#xD;
"as for the wood-box, Miss Faith, I don't think I can per-&#xD;
mit it to have any voice in the matter,-you may leave it&#xD;
for me to finish. But if you are going up there this even-&#xD;
ing-there are two or three things I should like to talk to&#xD;
you about first."&#xD;
"Then shall I come by :and. by ?" she said. "I must do&#xD;
something else before dinner."&#xD;

W    ELL child !" said lyrs. Derrick as they took their&#xD;
.      seats at the dinner-table, "what have you been&#xD;
about all day.? I've just spent the morning looking over&#xD;
those apples, so I've had no chance to look you up. How's&#xD;
Mr. Linden? does the doctor think he's getting better?"&#xD;
"He is, I hope, mother; the doctor didn't say anything&#xD;
about it." And a little shudder ran over Faith's shoulders,&#xD;
which she was glad her mother could make nothing of if&#xD;
she saw. "I'have been as busy as you have, mother.-so I&#xD;
couldn't look you up-nor my wood-box either."&#xD;
Learning all the world 1" said her mother smiling,&#xD;
though there was a little touch of regretfulness not quite&#xD;
kept down. "I think I'd rather sit and look at you, child,&#xD;
than eat my dinner. What are you going to do this after-&#xD;
noon ? ,".&#xD;
"I'ves got a little ironing to do after dinner, mother, and&#xD;
something to make for tea-and Mr. Linden wants to see&#xD;
me for something. I'll get ready for Judge Harrison's,&#xD;
and then "after I ar through up stairs I'll come down and&#xD;
see to you and my box together. I "wish you were going&#xD;
with me, mother."&#xD;
And Faith leaned her head on her hand.&#xD;
"Don't you want to go, pretty child ?" said Mrs. Der-&#xD;
rick fondly.      .&#xD;
"No, mother-but I couldn't help it. I found I should&#xD;
have to go sooner or later."&#xD;
"I'd go with you in a minute," said her mother, "if it&#xD;
wasn't for Mr. Linden. I don't care a pin whether they&#xD;
want me or not, Faith, if you do. And I dare say some&#xD;
of the boys will be here"-.Mrs. Derrick looked perplexed,&#xD;
as at the feeling of some unknown possibility. " Shall I,&#xD;
pretty child ?" she said with an anxious face,-" what are&#xD;
you thinking of, child ?"&#xD;
Faith came behind her and put both arms round her and&#xD;
kisses fist one side of her face and then the other.&#xD;
(278)&#xD;
&#xD;
"Mother !" she said with those silvery tones,-" I don't&#xD;
want anything ! I suppose I shall like to see the micro-&#xD;
scope-but I'd rather stay at home and learn my lessons.&#xD;
Don't look so!"-Which with another kiss upon her. lips,&#xD;
finished off Mrs. Derrick's anxiety.&#xD;
The ironing and the 'something for tea' Faith despatched&#xD;
with extra diligence and speed, and then dressed herself&#xD;
for the evening. It 4was not much extra dressing; only a,&#xD;
dark stuff dress a little finer than ordinary; the white ruffle&#xD;
round the neck and wrists was the same. And then, giving&#xD;
a few minutes to the seeking of some added help to quiet-&#xD;
ness, for Faith's mind had been strangely disturbed, she&#xD;
went again to Mr. Linden's room. A gentle vision she&#xD;
was, if ever one was seen, when she entered it.&#xD;
"You say I mustn't thank you, Mr. Linden," she said&#xD;
giving him back his sister's letter ;-"but-.--will you thank&#xD;
her for me&#xD;
"Ih don't think she deserves many thanks," he said with&#xD;
a smile, "but I will tell her."&#xD;
The course of study that afternoon was peculiar, and&#xD;
eminently a talk. Mr. Linden called for none of the usual&#xD;
books at first, but began by giving Faith a very particular&#xD;
account of the whole process of circulation; thence diverg-&#xD;
ing right and left, in the most erratic manner as, it seemed&#xD;
to her,.-passing from the bright crystal poiiits in chymise&#xD;
try to the blue mould on a piece of bread, and then ex-&#xD;
plaining to her the pemIliar mechanism of a fly's eye. Two&#xD;
or three times he sent her to the cupboard for some book&#xD;
to shew her an illustration of the subject, but if there was&#xD;
any connecting link that she could see etween one and&#xD;
an ther, it was simply the wonderful minute perfection of&#xD;
tie world. And she needed none-for the different things&#xD;
were touched upon so clearly and yet with such a happy&#xD;
absence of needless details, that they stood forth in full re-&#xD;
lief, and set off each other. The daylight was already fail-&#xD;
ing, and the red firelight was playing hide and seek with&#xD;
the shadows in Mr. Linden's room, before he gave her a&#xD;
chance to think what time it, was. When she saw it, Faith&#xD;
started up&#xD;
"I told mother I would come and see her before I&#xD;
went !"-she said, drawing a long breath like a person in&#xD;

an atmosphere he ca't get enough of. Then with a little&#xD;
change of,tone,'after standing a minute looking at the fire,&#xD;
she went on.-"All Ican do, is to drive the nails into that&#xD;
wood-box-but I'll do it before to-morrow." She held out&#xD;
her hand as she spoke.&#xD;
"No you must not," Mr. Linden said, as he took the&#xD;
hand. "To-night you will be out, and you must not give&#xD;
me a late breakfast, Miss Faith 1-therefore you must go to&#xD;
bed as soon as you come home, and leave the box to me."&#xD;
Faith ran away and did not go to her hammering just&#xD;
then. She brought a low bench to her mother's feet, sat&#xD;
down there ; and taking Mrs. Derrick's hands from what-&#xD;
ever they were about, wrapped both arms round herself,&#xD;
laying her head on her mother's lap.&#xD;
"Mother," she said caressingly,-" I couldn't come down&#xD;
before. I war so busy and so interested, I didn't in the&#xD;
least know what time it was; and I hadn't a chance to&#xD;
think."&#xD;
"I'm sure I'm glad, pretty child," said her mother, bend-&#xD;
ing down to kiss her. 0 "I think sometimes you think too&#xD;
much. But you look just like a baby, for all that. PIm&#xD;
sure .I shall always love Mr. Linden for pleasing you so&#xD;
much," said Mrs. Derrick stroking Faith's hair, "even&#xD;
though he does please himself too."&#xD;
Faith secured that hand again an    held them both&#xD;
wrapped round her; but further words for a moment spoke&#xD;
not.&#xD;
"I shall come home as early as I can," she said;--."ino-&#xD;
ther, time enough to do everything for breakfast."&#xD;
"You sha'n't do a thing, child," said her mother. "You&#xD;
may come home as early as you like, but I'm going to keep&#xD;
you out of the works. I feel so 'grand when you're up-&#xD;
stairs studying-you can't think ! You wouldn't know me,&#xD;
Faith."&#xD;
Faith laughed, the laugh that was music to Mrs. Der-&#xD;
rick's ears, and indeed would have been to any, and held&#xD;
the hands closer.&#xD;
"I feel a little grand too,"-she said,-"-." sometimes-in&#xD;
a way-"&#xD;
This did not seem to be one of the times, or else feeling&#xD;
grand had a soporific effect; for Faith's eyelids presently&#xD;
&#xD;
drooped, and when t r. Harrison came to the house and&#xD;
for some time befo, she was fast asleep on her mother's&#xD;
lap.&#xD;
"Psyche !".-exclaimed Dr. Harrison as he discerned by&#xD;
the firelight the state of the case. Mrs. Derrick gave him&#xD;
a little reproving glance for speaking so loud, but other&#xD;
reply made none, save a low-spoken polite Offer of a&#xD;
chair.&#xD;
"Thank you-I am going up to see Mr. linden. Miss&#xD;
Derrick was so good as to promise she would go with me to&#xD;
see my sister this evening. In these circumstances,"-said&#xD;
Dr. Harrison in his softest voice-"do you think it would&#xD;
be presumption to wake her up ?"&#xD;
"Well go up,, then," said Mrs. Detick, "and I'll wake&#xD;
her up before you'come down."&#xD;
Which arrangement took effect; and in a very few&#xD;
minutes thereafter, Dr. Harrison's horse making much&#xD;
better- speed than old Crab could do now, Faith was de-&#xD;
posited safely at Judge Harrison's door.  There she was&#xD;
received with open arms and great exultation by Miss So-&#xD;
phy and with great cordiality and pleasure by the Judge;&#xD;
and with a certain more uncerta' amount of both by Mrs.&#xD;
Somers, whom Faith found there the only addition to the&#xD;
family party ; while the doctor st od complacently on the&#xD;
rug, in silence; surveying everybody, like a man who has&#xD;
gained his poirt.&#xD;
"Well Julius," said Mrs. Somers, "how's Mr. Linden&#xD;
to-night? did you see him ?"&#xD;
"Yes ma'am-I saw him."&#xD;
"Well how is he ?" repeated Mrs. Somers.&#xD;
"He is-very happily situated," said the doctor.  "I&#xD;
should like to b e in his place."&#xD;
"What do you go there twice a day for? Do you think&#xD;
him worse?  You began   it  going once," said Mrs. So-&#xD;
mers.&#xD;
"Always begin gently," said Dr. Harrison. "You get&#xD;
on faster."&#xD;
"How soon do you expect to take up your abode there&#xD;
altogetIher, at that rate ?"&#xD;
"At what rate, aunt Ellen ? You are too fast for me."&#xD;

to be told what you go there for ?-what I do want to&#xD;
know, is whether he's like to get well,. and how soon."&#xD;
"He will be conquering Pattaquasset in a few weeks,"&#xD;
said the doctor.&#xD;
"I wonder whether he'll conquer Phil Davids," said&#xD;
Mrs. Somers. "I should like to see that done. Julius,&#xD;
did you ever find out anything about the man that fired the&#xD;
shot?" i&#xD;
"Really, aunt Ellen, I am not a detective"-said the&#xD;
doctor carelessly, looking at Faith, who kept as quiet as a&#xD;
dormouse. "If it had been my business I suppose I should&#xD;
have found out."&#xD;
"I think I heard you opine that Mr. Linden knew"_....&#xD;
said Mrs. Somers. "And I think somebody ought to find&#xD;
out-unless you want the thing done over again. Don't&#xD;
you think so, Judge Harrison ?"&#xD;
"Well my dear," said the Judge," I understand Mr. Lin.&#xD;
den to have been actuated by a every benevolent motive-I&#xD;
understand his feelings. . He wouldn't run the risk of ac.'&#xD;
casing a man unjustly-I can't blame him. It's right, I&#xD;
think, though it's provoking. What do you think, Miss&#xD;
Faith ?"&#xD;
Faith lifted her eyes, but perhaps the doctor saw in her&#xD;
changing cheek some token of the pain he had stirred in&#xD;
the morning. He prevented her reply.&#xD;
"Ladies don't think about these things, my dear sir!-&#xD;
Aunt Ellen is so sharp she gets ahead of her sex. Let me&#xD;
have the honour of suggesting a pasanter subject of medi.&#xD;
tation. I have seen to-night, aun\ Ellen, the most exqui.&#xD;
site and valuable jewelry I have ev/r seen in my life !"&#xD;
"Here in Pattaquasset I" said h  sister.&#xD;
"In Pattaquasset-or perhaps in the world." '&#xD;
"Don't excite yourself, Sophy," said Mrs. Somers,--&#xD;
"let's hear what they were, first."&#xD;
Faith, like everybody else, looked for the doctor's answer,&#xD;
though she hardly knew what she was looking at.&#xD;
"A lady, aunt Ellen," the doctor went on, glancing at&#xD;
her,-" had made a necklace of her mother's arms,-,and a&#xD;
cross, more precious than diamonds, of her mother's hands;&#xD;
and clasping this cross to her breast, adorned with this&#xD;
most exquisite and rare adornment, had-gone to sleep !"&#xD;
&#xD;
"And for once," said Mrs. Somers," you preferred the&#xD;
wearer to the jewels and-.went into a trance ! I can&#xD;
imagine you !"&#xD;
"I? not I !"-said the doctor-"I went up stairs. But&#xD;
you have no idea of the effect."&#xD;
Faith had been experiencing some of the scattering fire&#xD;
of society, which hits no one knows where and no one&#xD;
knows when. First the name of Phil Davids had ploughed&#xD;
up the ground at her right; then the question abotit the&#xD;
man who had fired the shot had ploughed up the ground&#xD;
at her left; and shaken first by one and then by the other&#xD;
.he had welcomed the doctor's change of subject and now&#xD;
was smiling as pleased as anybody.&#xD;
"I didn't suppose the trance was a long one," said Mrs.&#xD;
Somers, with a little raising of her eyebrows. "Faith, my&#xD;
dear, what have you done to that little Seacomb child ? I&#xD;
can't get over my astonishment at his transformation."&#xD;
"Iam afraid there isn't much transformation yet," Faith&#xD;
said. " He listens very quietly and behaves well in school&#xD;
-but I don't know how he is at home."&#xD;
"You are not a school teacher too?" said the doctor.&#xD;
"It isn't a bad trade," said Faith, though her cheeks&#xD;
had answered for her another way.&#xD;
"Not a bad trade-certainly-bat one may have too&#xD;
many trades. Aunt Ellen-I had the honour-do you be-&#xD;
lieve it ?-of giving Miss Derrick lessons this morning."&#xD;
"I think she was very good to permit it," said Mrs.&#xD;
Somers-composedly.&#xD;
"She was very good-" said the doctor demurely. "I&#xD;
am afraid that is her character generally 1"&#xD;
He was called off by his father, and Miss Harrison seized&#xD;
Faith and planted her bet een herself and Mrs. Somers&#xD;
on the sofa.&#xD;
"Don't mind his nonsense, Faith! Julius never can&#xD;
talk like anybody else. Why haven't you been here this&#xD;
age?"&#xD;
"I've been busy, Sophy."&#xD;
"Why wouldn't you go to ride with us? Julius wouldn't&#xD;
go after what you said. Why wouldn't you ?"&#xD;
"It was Bunday, Sophy."&#xD;

"Sunday isn't my day-I can't use it for my own&#xD;
work."&#xD;
"But taking a little ride isn't work ?"&#xD;
Faith hesitated.&#xD;
"Isn't it work to the horses, Sophy?  And if it is only&#xD;
pleasure-Sunday has its own pleasures, dear Sophy,..&#xD;
can't have both."&#xD;
"Why can't you ?"&#xD;
"Because,-if I take these, God will not give me those,"&#xD;
Faith said 'very gravely.&#xD;
"But Faith !"-said Miss Harrison looking disturbed,....&#xD;
"you didn't use to be so religious ?"&#xD;
Faith's face flushed a little and was touchingly humble&#xD;
as she said, "No-I didn't."&#xD;
"What's changed you so ?"&#xD;
"It isn't a bad change, dear Sophy!"&#xD;
"I don't believe any ring's bad about you," said Miss&#xD;
Harrison kissing her,- 'but don't change too far, dear;&#xD;
don't forget your old frie ds."&#xD;
"I want them to change too," said Faith looking at her&#xD;
winningly.&#xD;
"That's right Faith, stand by your colours !" said Mrs.&#xD;
Somers, with a tone and manner that came quite from&#xD;
the other side of her character.- "Sophy-your mother&#xD;
wouldn't know her child, to hear you ask such ques.&#xD;
tions."&#xD;
Miss Harrison looked troubled, and left the room. Dr.&#xD;
Harrison immediately took her place, and almost as immie.&#xD;
diately tea came in.&#xD;
That is to say, tea and chocolate were handed round,&#xD;
together with a sufficient abundance and variety of deli.&#xD;
cate substantials to suit the air and the style of a country&#xD;
town. Judge Harrison's was the only house in Pattaquas-&#xD;
set where tea was served in this way,-except perhaps the&#xD;
De Staff's; though there was this difference to be observed;&#xD;
-the De Staffs never had tea carried round unless when&#xD;
they had company; at the Harrisons' it.was never carried&#xD;
round unless they were alone.&#xD;
Dr. Harrison attended politely to his aunt, but he was '&#xD;
eyes and hands for Faith; finding at the same time very&#xD;
agreeable occupation for her hears. If people ebuld be&#xD;
&#xD;
content with being agreeable! But in the midst of cold&#xD;
tongue and chocolate the doctor broke out again.&#xD;
"After all," said he,-"what about that piece of curious&#xD;
information, Miss Derrick ? You know I was balked this&#xD;
morning and led a Will o' the wisp chase after the Idea!&#xD;
Is Mr. Linden in the habit of spoiling people's fun in that&#xD;
manner?"&#xD;
Faith said simply she did not know. She did, not, but&#xD;
in private she thought it likely enough.&#xD;
"Well, about the question," said the doctor helping her&#xD;
to something at the same time,-" what was the truth of it,&#xD;
Miss Derrick ?  You see I am interested. Was our little&#xD;
informant correct ?"&#xD;
Now Faith had no mind, even in the dark, or about any-&#xD;
thing, to set her 'yes' against Mr. Linden's 'no.' Besides,&#xD;
she knew that the doctor had heard no names, and what-&#xD;
ever might be the extent of Mr. Linden's knowledge, he&#xD;
knew nothing. And she was very willing to take the shelter&#xD;
of the shield which had been thrqwn round her. The&#xD;
deep, deep dye-of her cheeks she could not help; but she&#xD;
answered with tolerable quietness, behind-that shield,&#xD;
"I hoped you had got enough of the subject this&#xD;
morning."&#xD;
The doctor had enough of it now! He changed his&#xD;
ground with all speed, and for the rest of the evening Dr.&#xD;
Harrison shewed himself at his best.&#xD;
So soon as the removal of tea things gave him a clear&#xD;
field, he brought out his microscope; and from that in-&#xD;
stant Faith almost forgot and forgave him everything.&#xD;
She forgot everything present -the Judge, Sophy, and&#xD;
Mrs. Somers; and came to the table so soon as the bright&#xD;
brass of the little machine caught her eye. The machine&#xD;
alone was a wonder and beauty; it seemed to Faith like&#xD;
an elegant little brass gun mounted on the most compli-&#xD;
cate and exquisite of gun carriages-with its multiplica-&#xD;
tion of wheels and screws and pins, by which its adjustment&#xD;
might be regulated to a hair; with its beautiful workman-&#xD;
ship and high finish, and its most marvellous and admirable&#xD;
purpose and adaptation.  Dr. Harrison had never ad-&#xD;
justed his microscope with more satisfaction, perhaps, than&#xD;
with those childish womiinly eyes looking on; and neither&#xD;

he nor many other people ever performed better thesubse.&#xD;
quent office of exhibiting it. He troubled Faith now with&#xD;
nothing; his very manner was changed; and, with kind.&#xD;
ness and sense most delicate, most thoughtful, most grace.&#xD;
ful always, gave her all he could give her.&#xD;
He was a trifle surprised to find that the amount of that&#xD;
was not mno, There was no lack indeed; he could t,&#xD;
and she could listen indefinitely-and did ;--nevertheless&#xD;
he found ome of his channels of communication stopped,&#xD;
off. At the   st thing he skewed her, Faith looked for a&#xD;
instant and then withdrawing her eye from the microscope&#xD;
and facing him with cheeks absolutely paled with ecite&#xD;
ment and feeling, exclaimed rapturously,&#xD;
" Oh !-are those the chalk shells ?"&#xD;
The doctor hadn't counted upon her knowing anything&#xD;
of chalk shells..&#xD;
"Aunt Ellen-" said he, as he looked to shift or adjust&#xD;
something-"do you think Miss Derrick has ever lived&#xD;
upon anything worse than roses?"&#xD;
"Upon something stronger, I fancy," said Mrs. Somers,&#xD;
a little surprised in her turn, but well pleased too, for Faith&#xD;
had come nearer her heart that evening than ever before,&#xD;
and the voyage of discovery was pleasant.&#xD;
"I should certainly think I was in Persia !" said the&#xD;
doctor,.-"only the bulbul knows nothing of scientific dis.&#xD;
coveries, I fancy."&#xD;
But Faith was in no danger of hearing, or caring, if she&#xD;
had understood; she had gone back to the chalk shells,&#xD;
and back still further, from them, into the world of those&#xD;
perfections which God had made for himself. .A new&#xD;
world, now for the first time actually seen by her, and for&#xD;
a moment she almost lost her st ending in this. Mrs.&#xD;
Somers watched he   miling and c rious.&#xD;
She drew back presently with     breath, to give the&#xD;
other ladies a chance; but Mis      on had looked all&#xD;
she cared to look, and Mrs. Som     as not new to the&#xD;
thing. They took a view occasion y, one for form,-the&#xD;
other for real interest; but for the most part Faith found&#xD;
the exhibition was for her and she and the doctor might&#xD;
have it all their own way. A long way they made of it;&#xD;
for the doctor found a good deal of talking to do, and Faith&#xD;

was most ready to hear. He talked well and gave her a&#xD;
great deal of what she liked, with a renewal every now and&#xD;
then of his first surprise; for in the midst of some elaborate&#xD;
explanation he was launching into for her benefit, most in-&#xD;
nocently and simply Faith would bring him up with. a&#xD;
gentle 'yes, I know,'--not spoken with the faintest arro-&#xD;
gance of knowledge, but merely to prevent him going into&#xD;
needless detail; and herself too rapt in the delight of the&#xD;
subject that occupied her to have any heed of the effect of&#xD;
her words.&#xD;
"I have kept the best for the last," said the doctor, when&#xD;
this exhibition had lasted a much longer time than Faith&#xD;
was aware of;-"]I thought you would like to see the cir-&#xD;
culation;-and I have sent all over town for a frog-found&#xD;
one at last, by great happiness."&#xD;
"All over town !" said Mrs. Somers,-" do try out of&#xD;
town next time, and save yourself trouble."&#xD;
"Have you got to kill the frog, Julius ?" said Miss Har-&#xD;
rison with a disturbed face.&#xD;
"I hope not !" said the doctor gravely. "That would&#xD;
rather interfere with our purposes than otherwise, Sophy.&#xD;
.-Aunt Ellen, I never learned the real extent of 'town' yet&#xD;
-when I was a boy it seemed .to me to have no limits;-&#xD;
and now it seems to me to have no centre. Tell James to&#xD;
bring in that frog, Sophy."&#xD;
Miss Harrison retreated from the frog; but the doctor&#xD;
assured Faith that he was in very tolerable circumstances,&#xD;
shut up in a little bag; and that he was only going to be&#xD;
requested to exhibit a small portion of the skin of his toe,&#xD;
and to hold himself still for that purpose; which benevo-&#xD;
lent action the doctor would help him to perform by put-&#xD;
ting him in a slight degree of confinement. The holding&#xD;
still was however apparently beyond the frog's benevolent&#xD;
powers, and it was some little time before the doctor could&#xD;
persuade him to it.  Then Faith saw what she had never&#xD;
seen nor fully imagined before.&#xD;
"0 Sophy !-9-0 Mrs. Somers !"--she exclaimed,-"look&#xD;
at this 1"&#xD;
She stood back with a face of delighted wonder. Miss&#xD;

"It is curious---" she- said. "What are those litter&#xD;
things, Julius ?"&#xD;
"You have heard of the 'circulating medium,' said the&#xD;
doctor. "That is it."&#xD;
Faith evidently had never heard of the 'medium'-referred&#xD;
to. Turning to her, the doctor began a clear full account&#xD;
of the philosophy of what she saw going on in the frog's&#xD;
foot. But the' she met him again.&#xD;
"Yes, I kndw, Dr. Harrison,"-she said with the simple&#xD;
tone of perfect intelligence. The doctor bit his lip, while&#xD;
Faith stooped over the microscope, and read, and read;&#xD;
what was to be seen there.&#xD;
"Faith," whispered Sophy, "it's cruel of me--but I am&#xD;
afraid your mother will be anxious, and Julius will never&#xD;
let you know-"&#xD;
"What time is it?" said Faith starting up.&#xD;
"About-hajf an hour-after eight-" said the doctor,&#xD;
"After ten, Taith."&#xD;
Not another look did Faith give, but for her bonnet, and&#xD;
went home as fast as the doctor would walk with her.&#xD;
Whether Mrs. Derrick was anxious or no, she did not&#xD;
say, but glad she certainly was to see Faith back.&#xD;
"Well child," she said, undoing the wrappers from&#xD;
Faith's ad and neck, "I hope you've had a grand time?"&#xD;
"Yes mother, very-only I didn't mean to stay so late,&#xD;
I meant to be home in good time. I have seen everything,&#xD;
mother 1"&#xD;
"Everything I" said her mother,--"I guess at that rate&#xD;
I might say I'd been everywhere."&#xD;
"Where have you been, mother? anywhere ?"&#xD;
"I've been out to tea !" said her mother, with the&#xD;
manner of one who has a remarkable secret on hand.&#xD;
"You have! Where, mother ?"&#xD;
"Guess"- said Mrs. Derrick smiling at her. "I went up&#xD;
stairs to tea, I'aith !-what do you think of that? What'll&#xD;
you expect to hear of my doing next ?"&#xD;
"Oh mothe !" said Faith laughing,.-.''I am glad ! That&#xD;
was the best  ing you.could have done."&#xD;
"It wasn't my doing, though," said Mrs. Derrick. "But&#xD;
when I went up with Mr. Linden's tea, he asked me if you&#xD;
ha~ gone, and I said yes, and he said since there was no-&#xD;
&#xD;
body better worth seeing down stairs he wished I'd come&#xD;
and drink tea with him. So I went, child,  nd it was real&#xD;
pleasant too. And I don't know how it w s, but I staid&#xD;
there all the evening,-only I wouldn't let him talk to me,&#xD;
and h'e just went to sleep as if I hadn't been there. I think&#xD;
he was very tired, Faith. So then I felt very comfortable,"&#xD;
added Mrs. Derrick smiling, "and I sat there and watched&#xD;
him till Reuben came-a little while ago."&#xD;
"Was he tired !" said Faith, the light in her face&#xD;
changing. "He had been talking to me all the'afternoon !&#xD;
.-Mother, half the pleasure I had to-night he gave me, for&#xD;
he was all the afternoon preparing me for it." She stood&#xD;
looking at the fire reproachfully.&#xD;
"Why child," said her mother, "I suppose his arm pains&#xD;
him a good deal-and that tires one, you know. He didn't&#xD;
talk to. you a bit more than he wanted to, I'll warrant.&#xD;
Why he even talked to me all tea-time 1" said Mrs. Derrick,&#xD;
as if she felt quite proud in consequence.&#xD;
"Well mother, we must go to bed now, for I must be up&#xD;
very early to finish that box."&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIV.'&#xD;
&#xD;
V ERY early it was, when Faith's hammer was at work&#xD;
again on the brown moreen, and short interruption&#xD;
did she give herself from anything that could be spared,&#xD;
till the box was done. It suited her well when it was done,&#xD;
The cover was stuffed, old-fashioned brown binding was&#xD;
lapped over the edges and seams, and fastened off with rows&#xD;
of brass-headed nails; which made it altogether an odd,&#xD;
handsome, antiquated-looking piece of furniture. With&#xD;
this, when her morning work was done and her exercise&#xD;
prepared, Faith went up to Mr. Linden's room; to see&#xD;
it brought in and placed properly.&#xD;
"I shall have to put a stop to this state of things !" he&#xD;
said,-" that blue ribband will work me mischief yet. Miss&#xD;
Faith, how can you take advantage of my disabled condi-&#xD;
tion ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Are you better this morning, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"The time has not quite come yet for me to be much&#xD;
better. But Miss Faith, if I had known that you would&#xD;
3 wake yourself up early this morning, what do you think I&#xD;
should have done ?"&#xD;
"I can't think, Mr. Linden," she said looking merry.&#xD;
"I should have invited you and Mrs Derrick up here to&#xD;
breakfast!-which I only did not do, because I could not&#xD;
take the extra trouble upon myself, and because I knew&#xD;
you ought to sleep, till this time.&#xD;
Faith shook her head a little, perhaps sorry to have&#xD;
missed the breakfast; then went off and brushed away the&#xD;
dust. and chips left round the wood-box. Then came and&#xD;
sat down.&#xD;
"I saw almost everything, last night, Mr. Linden"&#xD;
"Well before you go off to last night-will you come tO&#xD;
morrow morning ?  Now .what did you see ?"&#xD;
(290)&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.                 291&#xD;
The bright smile and flush and sparkle answered the in-&#xD;
vitation; and perhaps Faith thought no other answer was&#xD;
needed; for she gave nqmother.&#xD;
"I know now," she said after an instant, "what you were&#xD;
doing all yesterday afternoon, Mr. Linden!1"&#xD;
"I know what you were, MissrFaith."&#xD;
She smiled innocently and went on,&#xD;
"All that just fitted me, as you meant it should, to take&#xD;
the good of the evening-and I had a great deal," she&#xD;
said gravely. I saw almost everything you spoke of-and&#xD;
other things. I saw the chalk shells, Mr. Linden1-and&#xD;
the circulation in a frog's foot; and different prepared&#xD;
pieces of skin; and the moth's plumage! and the silver&#xD;
scale-armour of the Lepisma, as Dr. Harrison called it; and&#xD;
more."&#xD;
"And with very great delight-as I knew you would. I&#xD;
am very glad!1"&#xD;
"Yes," said Faith-" I know a little better now how to&#xD;
understand some things you said the other day. I am very&#xD;
glad I went-only for one thing.-"&#xD;
"What was that?"&#xD;
"Dr. Harrison asked such a strange thing of me as we&#xD;
were walking home-at least it seems to me strange."&#xD;
"May my judgment be brought to bear upon it ?" Mr.&#xD;
Linden said after a moment's silence.&#xD;
"Yes indeed," said Faith; "that was what I was going&#xD;
to ask. He wants me to go with him to see a woman, who&#xD;
is dying, he says, and miserable,--and he'wants me to talk&#xD;
to her. He says he does not know how." And half mo-&#xD;
destly, half timidly, she added, "Is not that going out of&#xD;
my way&#xD;
A quick, peculiar smile on Mr. Linden's face, was suc-&#xD;
ceeded by a very deep gravity,--once or twice the lips&#xD;
parted, impulsively.-then took their former firm set; and&#xD;
shading his eyes with his hand he looked into the fire in&#xD;
profound silence.&#xD;
Very soberly, but in as absolute repose of face, Faith&#xD;
now and then looked at him, and meanwhile waited for his&#xD;
thoughts to come to an end.&#xD;
"Dr. Harrison said," she remarked after a little while,&#xD;

"Did you promise to go with him"                     "Mr. Linden,"-she    d.&#xD;

was looking at her then, though with eypi still shielded,  every subject there is inexhaustible meaning,-&#xD;

your kind office at once? It will be a great comfort to&#xD;
me, and I shall be the better able to do something for you&#xD;
afterwards." And the manner almost made Faith feel as&#xD;
if the proposition had come from her at first.&#xD;
She went about it, not this first time without some tren-&#xD;
bling of heart,. but with also a spirit that rose above and&#xD;
quite kept down that. She knew exactly and intelligently&#xD;
what was to be done; it was only the h ads that were un.&#xD;
wonted, and therefore she feared unskilful. But there are&#xD;
things that some women have by nature, and a skilful land&#xD;
is one of them; and it was Faith's. Her womanly love&#xD;
and care were enough for all the rest; she made no&#xD;
mistakes, nor delays; and her soft fingers inflicted no&#xD;
pain that it was in the power of fingers to spare. A&#xD;
little longer th n the doctor she way1 perhaps about&#xD;
it; not much, a d not more awkward; and that is saying&#xD;
enough.&#xD;
So soon as that was done, Faith went for her exercise,&#xD;
and sat d wn as yesterday to write it.  ,-'&#xD;
He too went on witg the exercise; but watching her,&#xD;
lest relief might be wAnted in another quarter. There&#xD;
was nothing of that, though. Quiet and very great satis.&#xD;
faction, was the result of the matter in Faith's mind; at&#xD;
least it was all she permitted to be seen; and now she gave&#xD;
herself happily to the connexion of her nouns and adjec-&#xD;
tives, and to watching against the 'german' or 'sophisti-&#xD;
cated' letters in her handwriting. The exercise indeed was&#xD;
fast taking a very compound character; so much so, that&#xD;
Faith might well begin to suspect there had been a two-.&#xD;
fold reason for proposing it. But Mr. Linden had a peen-,&#xD;
liar way of teaching-especially of teaching her; and made&#xD;
her almost forget in the pleasure of learning, the fact that&#xD;
she had need to learn. And as for his memory on the sub-&#xD;
ject, or his perception of how it might touch. her,-th,.ey&#xD;
were out of sight: she might have been a little child there&#xD;
at his side, for the grave simplicity and frankness of his in.&#xD;
structions.. And so exercise and reading and philosophy&#xD;
followed on in a quiet train, and the surface of the earth&#xD;
revealed new wonders, and the little French book was&#xD;
closed at the end, of a' pretty chapter. '.&#xD;
"Whenever I get about my duties again, Miss Faith?"&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Linden said, "I shall make one very stringent rule for&#xD;
our future intercourse."&#xD;
"What's that, Mr. Linden ?" she said, with the face of&#xD;
quick deep pleasure she always wore when about any of&#xD;
her studies with him.&#xD;
/  roiinhe time when I /come home to dinner till I go&#xD;
off again, I will neither speak nor be spoken to, Miss Faith,&#xD;
except in French. That is, you may speak-but I shall&#xD;
not answer."&#xD;
Faith started a little, looked puzzled, and looked terri-&#xD;
fled,-as much as she ever did; but rather closed with&#xD;
looking as if it was impossible.&#xD;
"I should make the rule at once," said Mr.-Linden smil-&#xD;
ing, "but I foresee that you would absent yourself entirely.&#xD;
Now when I an1lown stairs you will have to see me--&#xD;
whether you wantto or not."&#xD;
'"But I don't know one word !" said Faith breathlessly.'&#xD;
"I am afraid I shall not say, or hear, much, Mr. Linden."&#xD;
"0 you shall hear a great deal-I will take that ypon&#xD;
myself."&#xD;
Faith shook her head, gave the fire a final mending, and&#xD;
ran off; for it was again an hour past: the mid-day. Mr.&#xD;
Linden's dinner came up, and was hardly removed before&#xD;
Dr. Harrison followed.&#xD;
"Well, Linden!" he said coming jauntily in,--" I' hope&#xD;
you haven't missed me this morning."&#xD;
"Not in the least."&#xD;
"I am glad of that.  How do you do?   I will try and&#xD;
put you in condition not to miss me this evening-though&#xD;
it is benevolentI!"-added the doctor, pulling off his left&#xD;
glove. "It is a great secret-to make oneself missed !"-&#xD;
"It is a secret your gloves will hardly find'out, by my&#xD;
fire," said Mr. Linden. "How-well you look, doctor !-&#xD;
not a bit like Nought and All."&#xD;
"No,"-said the doctor,-" I believe I disclaimed that&#xD;
particular sphere of existence yesterday. One had need&#xD;
be One and Somewhat in this wind-if one will keep a&#xD;
place in a wagon, or elsewhere ! But fire mustn't tempt&#xD;
me, Linden. I'll. see to you and be off, and decide what&#xD;
Il be afterwards."&#xD;
"You may be off without preamble."&#xD;

a you mean to dismiss me ?" exclaimed the doctor&#xD;
raising his eyebrows. "Have I said that you must accept&#xD;
my poor services ?"&#xD;
"Why* no !" said Mr. Linden,-."doubly no ! I am most&#xD;
happy to see you, doctor."&#xD;
"The happiness will be mutual when I have the felicity&#xD;
of understanding you," said the doctor, settling himself in&#xD;
an attitude. Mr. Linden surveyed him from head to foot,&#xD;
"I perceive indeed that you are One and Somewhat!"&#xD;
he said,--"you still need 'the four azure chains.' Do you&#xD;
need explanations too?"&#xD;
"If you'll be so good !" said the doctor. "Or-ha! you&#xD;
don't mean that, do you ?"&#xD;
"My arm has been dressed," said Mr. Linden quietly.&#xD;
"Never trust a woman 1" said the doct  heeling round,&#xD;
"I thought she had got enough of tha   yesterday. Did&#xD;
she do it well?"&#xD;
"Excellently well."&#xD;
"Your face says so as well as your tongue," said the&#xD;
doctor, with ar. odd manner of despair. "I have lost-...&#xD;
not my occupation, for I never had any !-but I have lost&#xD;
my power over you; and she has got it I-I don't know'&#xD;
how to whistle, or I suppose I could take comfort in that."&#xD;
Mr. Linden did not whistle, nor laugh, nor speak,-all&#xD;
that could be said of him was that be lay there very quiet,&#xD;
with his eyes open, looking remarkably well.&#xD;
"Let a woman alone for doing what she has a mind to1"&#xD;
the doctor went on, in his usual manner now, putting on his&#xD;
gloves. "I tell you what, Linden.--they're the hardest&#xD;
creatures to manage there are;-boys aie nothing to them!&#xD;
Well, good morning I"&#xD;
"Good morning,"-said Mr. Linden. "I hope you will&#xD;
be ile to manage the wind."&#xD;
The Dr. Harrison who had been up stairs was not at all&#xD;
jDr. Harrison that met Faith in the hail and escorted&#xD;
her to the carriage. Grave, gentle, graceful, but especially&#xD;
grave, for some reason or other, he was; and not the less&#xD;
for that agreeable, she thought. Faith was in a sober&#xD;
mood herself; for she was about an undertaking she did&#xD;
not much like; and which Mr. Linden had liked even less.&#xD;
Faith pondered, as tiley drove swiftly along, what the par.&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
29'&#xD;
&#xD;
ticular objections had been which he had not chosen to tell&#xD;
her; and now and then thought a little uneasily of .the&#xD;
coming interview, with the doctor's patient, with Dr. Har-&#xD;
rison himself for auditor and spectator. She did not like&#xD;
it; but she had honestly done what she thought right, and&#xD;
Mr. Linden had said she was not wrong. And she was&#xD;
bound on the expedition, which she could not get rid df;&#xD;
so though these considerations did floi t over and over her&#xD;
mind they did not shake what was neve itheless a very happy&#xD;
peacefulness. Faith was glad the doctor was pretty well&#xD;
engaged with his horses; and let her own musings run&#xD;
upon the pleasant things of the morning, and of yesterday,&#xD;
with glances at the delightful new 'world of work and&#xD;
knowledge into which she had entered, or was entering; and&#xD;
happy resting   n on the foundation for all joy so lately&#xD;
known to her. hirled along on smooth going wheels, in&#xD;
that bright brisk day, little interrupted with 'talk, these&#xD;
thoughts and meditations took fair little flying passages&#xD;
through her head;- chasing and succeeding each other, put&#xD;
in and put out by the lights and shadows, the hills and&#xD;
fields, sky and trees and wind-clouds, as the case might be,&#xD;
and mixing up with them all.&#xD;
Dr. Harrison had come for her this time in an easy&#xD;
pleasant-going curricle, drawn by beautiful animals, and&#xD;
who felt beautifully in that gay wind. They. looked s ,&#xD;
certainly, every motion fro m ears to -tail telling of life a d&#xD;
the enjoyment of it.&#xD;
"You are not afraid of anything, I know," said Dr.&#xD;
Harrison, one time when he had been obliged to hold them&#xD;
in with a good deal of decision; -"or I would have&#xD;
brought the old family trotter for you."&#xD;
"What makes you think so, Dr. Harrison ?"&#xD;
"I have had proof of it," said he looking at her. :Faith&#xD;
shook her head a little, and could have told him several&#xD;
things; but did not.&#xD;
"You are not afraid of these fellows ?"&#xD;
She said no.&#xD;
"There is no pleasure in handling what gives you no&#xD;
trouble ;-don't you think so?"&#xD;
Faith sought for illustrations of the subject in her own&#xD;
experience ; did not find them.&#xD;

"Now look at those fellows," the doctor went on. "They&#xD;
are fit to fly out of their skins; but a little bit of" steel in&#xD;
their mouths-and a good rein-and a strong hand at the&#xD;
end of it-and they are mine, and not their own," said he,.&#xD;
giving them a powerful check at the same time which&#xD;
brought them  on their haunches;-'"and they know it,&#xD;
Now isn't there some pleasure in this ?"&#xD;
"It is rather a man's pleasure," said Faith;-"isn't it?"&#xD;
"Do you think so ?" said the doctor. "Ah, you know.&#xD;
better. Do you mean to say," he added softly, "that a&#xD;
woman doesn't know the pleasure of power ?"&#xD;
"I don't think I do," said Faith meeting his eyes with a&#xD;
smile. He smiled too, a different smile from what was&#xD;
usual with him.&#xD;
Theive was long-.much longer thangfaith had counted&#xD;
upon, lthough they went so fast. "Down by the river"--_&#xD;
the doctor had said; but it appeared not yet what part of&#xD;
the river he was aiming for. Still it was beautiful; the&#xD;
broken country, open and free, with the cloud shadows and&#xD;
the brilliant sunlight driving across it, and grey sharp rocks&#xD;
everywhere breaking it, and tufts and reaches of brown or&#xD;
sear woodland diversifying it, was not easy to weary of.&#xD;
Nor did Faith weary. The doctor's words had sent her.&#xD;
off on a long journey of thought, while she travelled over&#xD;
all that open; sunlight and shadow, country. Starting&#xD;
from the words, "Behold we put bits in the horses' mouths,&#xD;
that they may obey us";--she had gone on to moral gov.&#xD;
ernment and suasion; the means and the forces of both,&#xD;
not failing to illustrate largely here from personal experi.&#xD;
ence; and on and up to the one great and strong hand&#xD;
that holds the reins of all, and makes even sunlight and&#xD;
shade, rock and hill, do his work and his bidding.&#xD;
But now in all that broad picture of life and life work,&#xD;
appeared a little dark spot ; which, small as it was, formed&#xD;
for the moment the vanishing point, where every line of&#xD;
beauty and sunlight met and ended. For with that strange&#xD;
recognizing of unkndwn things, Faith saw before her the&#xD;
house where the dyn'oa lay,.-apd knew it for that,&#xD;
before the doctor spoke. A plain, brow i, unpainted house;&#xD;
straight and square, with no break of piazza or window&#xD;
blinds; tapestried on the front with frost-.bitten gourd&#xD;
&#xD;
SAYD AND SEAL.            299&#xD;
&#xD;
vines, the yellow and green fruit yet unscathed. The usual&#xD;
little gate and dooryard common to such country houses;&#xD;
the usual remains of autumn flowers therein; the usual&#xD;
want of trees. Yet by the universal law of indemnification,&#xD;
the house was more picturesque than painting and archi-&#xD;
tecture could have made it.  Neighbours it had -none, for&#xD;
contrast; but a low woody point of land stretched off&#xD;
behind it, reaching out even into the Mong.    And the&#xD;
Mong itself-with its cool sharp glitter in the stirring&#xD;
wind, and the swash of its blue waves at the very foot of&#xD;
the little paling about the house; its white-sailed craft, its&#xD;
white-winged sea gulls ;--&#xD;
"Our lives are rivers, gliding free&#xD;
To that unfathomed, boundless sea,&#xD;
The silent grave !&#xD;
Thither all earthly pomp and boast&#xD;
Roll, to be swallowed up and lost&#xD;
In one dark wave.&#xD;
"Thither the mighty torrents stray,&#xD;
Thither the brook pursues its way,&#xD;
And tinkling ril.&#xD;
There all are equal. Side by side&#xD;
The poor min and the son of pride&#xD;
Lie calm and still."&#xD;
Of the two that now entered that little dooryard, one&#xD;
felt all this and one did not.  The one who had felt "the&#xD;
power of an endless life," perceived the narrow bounds of&#xD;
this,-to the one who had nothing beyond, its domain was&#xD;
vast. And as is often the case, the man went first and the&#xD;
angel followed.&#xD;
The doctor stepped up to the bedside and made some&#xD;
general enquiries. But it did not appear that there was&#xD;
much he could do for her.&#xD;
"Mrs. Clusters " said he presently, "you know I pro-&#xD;
mised I would bring, if I could, a lady to see you. Here&#xD;
she is-Miss Derrick."&#xD;
Faith came to the side of the bed. Little her quiet face&#xD;
shewed how she was trembling.  In her soft sweet way she&#xD;
asked the sick woman how she did. And Mrs. Ousters&#xD;
turned her head a little, and gazed up into the blooming&#xD;

She did not answer, then; though as if the tones of&#xD;
Faith's voice were making their way, there came presently&#xD;
a slight quiver of the face, and a bright drop or two that&#xD;
the closed eyelids could not quite keep back. But she was&#xD;
at that point of time where the fear of man has lost its&#xD;
power,-where the doctor loses his supremacy and visiters&#xD;
their interest: where men and things are pushed like sha-&#xD;
dows into the background, and the mind can see no object&#xD;
save "the great white throne."  This was what the silence&#xD;
expressed,-it was not dislike, nor churlishness; but those&#xD;
surface questions failed to reach her where she stood,&#xD;
The next gentle and tender "Vhat is the matter ?"-was&#xD;
so spoken that it found her even there. Her eyes came back&#xD;
to Faith's face with the sort of look they had given before.&#xD;
And then she spoke.&#xD;
"Where would you be going if you were lying where I&#xD;
be ?"&#xD;
Faith heeded not the doctor then, nor anything else in&#xD;
the world. She waited an instant; she had drawn herself&#xD;
up on hearing the question; then leaning forward again&#xD;
she said slowly, tenderly,&#xD;
"I should be going-to be happy with my divine Re-&#xD;
deemer. Are not you?"&#xD;
"What makes you think you would ?"&#xD;
"Because I have his word for it," said Faith. "He&#xD;
says that whoever believes in him shall not perish, and that&#xD;
every one that loves him shall be with him where he is;-I&#xD;
believe in him and love him with my whole heart; and I&#xD;
know he is true. He will not cast me awaye'A Slowly,&#xD;
clearly, the words were spoken; so that they might every&#xD;
one enter and be received by the ears that heard.&#xD;
The-woman looked at her,-.scanned her, examined her,&#xD;
-looked down towards the foot of the bed at the doctor-&#xD;
then back at Faith.&#xD;
"Do you believe all that?" she said.&#xD;
"I know it !"-said Faith, with a tiny bit of joy-speaking&#xD;
smi46&#xD;
&#xD;
L  3t.fr&#xD;
&#xD;
Again that intent look.&#xD;
"Well he don't," she said with a motion towards the&#xD;
doctor. "Which of ye am I to-believe ?"&#xD;
"Don't belieVe either of us !" said Faith quickly, her&#xD;
look rather brightening than otherwise, though the play&#xD;
of her lips took a complicate character-."Believe God !&#xD;
Don't you know his words ?"&#xD;
"I s'pose I do-some of 'em. I can't believe anything&#xD;
with him down there lookin' at me !? she said impetuously.&#xD;
"He said he didn't believe-and I keep thinkin' of that."&#xD;
"Will, you believe him, rather than God ?-rather than&#xD;
the Lord Jesus, who came and gave his very life for us, to&#xD;
bring us to heaven. Do you think he would tell us any-&#xD;
thing but truth after that? His words are, "'He that&#xD;
believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.'&#xD;
"Well I'm 'most dead-"' said the woman in a sort of&#xD;
cold, hopeless tone.&#xD;
"Let, Jesus make you live I" said Faith, in a voice as&#xD;
warm and loving.&#xD;
"The doctor said he couldn't," she answered in the same&#xD;
tone as before. "He believes that, apyhow."&#xD;
Faith answered,&#xD;
"'My sheep hear my voice, and.1 know them, and they&#xD;
follow me. And I give unto them eternal life; and they-&#xD;
shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out&#xD;
of my hand."&#xD;
That same little quiver passed over the face, but it&#xD;
changed into an irrepressible shudder.&#xD;
"Sit down here on the bed," she said, looking up at&#xD;
Faith, "and put your face so I can't see his'n-and then&#xD;
you may talk."&#xD;
And with that fair head for a screen, as if it really&#xD;
warded off some evil influence, Mrs. Casters lay and lis-&#xD;
tened quietly for a while; but then her hands were clasped&#xD;
over her face, and she broke into a low sobbing fit-as if&#xD;
mind and body were pouring out their griefs together.&#xD;
Not loud, not hysterical; but weary, subdued, overpower-&#xD;
ing; until the utter exhaustion brought sleep.&#xD;
Faith got off the bed then,-looked at her, looked at the&#xD;
doctor,---and then by an irrepressible feeling, sutik on her&#xD;
knees. Leave her, go out of the house with him, she could&#xD;

&#xD;
not, until she had put the cause of them all into the&#xD;
hand she knew her friend and wished theirs.     A few&#xD;
moments' motionless hiding of her face, during which, as&#xD;
indeed during the whole conversation, Dr. Hairrison was&#xD;
nearly motionless too, and used his eyes silently; and&#xD;
Faith rose from her knees.   She gave another look at&#xD;
the poor weary face that lay there, and then led the&#xD;
way out of the house. The doctor followed her, having&#xD;
perhaps got more than enough of the result of his ride,.&#xD;
But as he was unfastening his horses, or rather after he-&#xD;
had done it and was waiting to hand her in, Faith addressed&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"Dr. Harrison, on whose errand do you go telling that&#xD;
woman that God's word is not true ?"&#xD;
She spoke gently, yet as the doctor faced her he saw&#xD;
that her soft eye could be steady as an eagle's. He did&#xD;
not answer.&#xD;
"Not for God's service," she went on answering herself,&#xD;
-"nor for 'yours.  See to itI"&#xD;
She turned and let him put her into the carriage and&#xD;
they set off again. But the drive homewards promised to&#xD;
be.as silent as the drive out had been.  The doctor was&#xD;
grave after another fashion now, with a furtheridown gray-&#xD;
ity, and scarce looked at anything but his horses; except&#xD;
when a glance or a hand came to see if Faith was well&#xD;
wrapped up from the wind, or to make her so. And either&#xD;
action was done not with his accustomed grace merely, but&#xD;
with even a more delicate tender care of her than ordinary.&#xD;
Faith was in little danger of cold for some time. Grief&#xD;
and loving sorrow were stirred and stirring too deeply&#xD;
for thought or feeling of anything else; only that be.-&#xD;
neath and with them her heart was singing, singing, in&#xD;
notes that seemed to reach her from   the very harps of&#xD;
heaven,-&#xD;
"I thank Thee, uncreated Sun,&#xD;
That thy bright beams on me have shined!"&#xD;
As they went on, however, and mile after mile was passed&#xD;
over again, and the afternoon waned, the wind cloud&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
seemed thicker and the wind more keen; Faith felt it and&#xD;
began to think of home. The horses felt it too, and per-&#xD;
haps also thought of home, for they travelled well.&#xD;
"What are you meditating, Miss Derrick ?" the doctor&#xD;
said at length, almost the first word he had spoken.&#xD;
"I was thinking, just at that minute, sir, of the use of&#xD;
beauty in the world."&#xD;
"The use of beauty 1" said the doctor, looking at her;&#xD;
he would have been astonished, if theuppermost feeling&#xD;
had not been of relief.  "What is its use ?  To make the&#xD;
world civilized and habitable, isn't it ?"&#xD;
"No-" said Faith,-."1AI should think it was meant to&#xD;
make us good. Look at the horses, Dr. Harrison !"&#xD;
The carriage had turned an angle of the road, which&#xD;
brought the wind pretty strongly in their faces. The&#xD;
horses seemed to take it as doubtful fun, or else to be in-&#xD;
clined to make too much fun of it. They were all alive&#xD;
with spirit, rather excited than allayed by their ,miles of&#xD;
quick travelling. The doctor tried to quiet them by rein&#xD;
and voice both.&#xD;
"They get a little too much oats for the work they do,"&#xD;
said he. "I must take them out oftener.  Take care of&#xD;
this wind, Miss Derrick;-I haven't a hand to help you.&#xD;
What's that ?-"&#xD;
'That' was a bunch of weeds thrown into the road just&#xD;
before the horses' heads, from over the fence; and was just&#xD;
enough to give them the start which they were ready for.&#xD;
They set off instantly at full run.  The road was good -and&#xD;
clear; the carriage was light; the wind was inspiriting,&#xD;
the oats suggestive of mischief. The doctor's boasted rein&#xD;
and hand with al the aid of steel bits, were powerless to&#xD;
stop them. In vai he coaxed and called to them; their&#xD;
speed increased ev y minute ; they had made up their&#xD;
minds to be frightened, and plunged along accordingly.&#xD;
The doctor spoke once or twice to Faith, encouraging or&#xD;
advising her; she did not speak nor stir.&#xD;
They were just nearing the brow of a hill, when an un-&#xD;
lucky boy in the road, thinking to stay their progress,&#xD;
stepped before them  and waved his hat over his head.&#xD;
Faith heard an execration from the doctor, then his shout&#xD;

,to her, "Don't stir, Miss Derrick !"-and then she hardly&#xD;
knew anything'else. The horses plunged madly down the&#xD;
hill, leaped carriage and all across a fence at the bottom&#xD;
of it, where the road turned, overthrew themselves and&#xD;
landed the doctor and Faith on different sides of the car-&#xD;
riage, in a meadow.&#xD;
The doctor picked himself up again, entirely unhurt, and&#xD;
going round to Faith lifted her head from the ground.&#xD;
But she was stunned by the fall, and for a few minutes&#xD;
remained senseless.&#xD;
In these circumstances,n ouse being near, the doctor&#xD;
naturally shouted to a cap or hat which he saw passing&#xD;
along the road. Which cap also it happened belonged to&#xD;
Sam Stoutenburgh, who was on an errand into the country&#xD;
for his father.&#xD;
If ever .Dr. Harrison was unceremoniously put aside, it&#xD;
was then. Sam had come rather leisurely at first-.-then&#xD;
with a sort of flying bound which cleared the fence like a&#xD;
thistle down, he bore down upon the doctor, and taking'ap&#xD;
Faith as easily as if she had been a kitten, absolutely ran&#xD;
with her to a spring which welled up through the long&#xD;
meadow grass a few yards off. There the doctor found&#xD;
him applying the cold water with both gentleness and skill,&#xD;
for Sam Stoutenburgh had a mother, and, her fingers had&#xD;
been so employed about his own head many a time.&#xD;
"You're a handy fellow!1" said the doctor with a mix-&#xD;
ture of expressions, as he joined his efforts to Sam's.-&#xD;
"That will do it 1"-&#xD;
For Faith opened her eyes. The firstword was "Mother!"&#xD;
-then she sat up and looked round, and then covered her&#xD;
face.&#xD;
"Are you hurt?" said Dr. Harrison after an instant.&#xD;
"No sir, I think not-I believe not."&#xD;
"Can you stand up?"&#xD;
With the help of his hand she could do it easily. She&#xD;
stood silent, supported by him, looking on the prostrate&#xD;
horses and shattered curricle; then turned her grave eyes&#xD;
on the doctor.&#xD;
"Don't stand too long, Miss Faith 1" said Sam earnestly,&#xD;
with tremb ' g lips too, for the manhood in him had not&#xD;
got very fa . "Are you sure you're not hurt ?"&#xD;

"Sam !" said Faith giving her hand to him.-" I didn't&#xD;
know it was you who was helping me."&#xD;
"I only wish I'd been here for you to fall\upon!" said&#xD;
Sam, with a queer mingling of grief and pleasure. "Seems&#xD;
as if folks couldn't always be in just the right place."&#xD;
"I am not hurt," she said with a little shudder.&#xD;
"Now, how are you going to do to get home ?" said the&#xD;
doctor looking much concerned. "Shall I-"&#xD;
"I will walk home," she said interrupting him.&#xD;
"You are not able ! We are three miles, at least, from&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick's house. You could not bear it."&#xD;
"I can walk three miles,  he said with a faint, fair&#xD;
smile. "I will go home with Sa  and you can take care&#xD;
of the horses."&#xD;
"That would be a tolerably backhanded arrangement!"&#xD;
said the doctor.-."Young man, will you bring these horses&#xD;
into town for me-after I get them on their legs-to Judge&#xD;
Harrison's, or anywhere ?-I must take care of this lady&#xD;
and see her safe."&#xD;
"Yes-I'll bring 'em into town," said Sam, "but Miss&#xD;
Faith's to be seen to first---if they don't get on their legs&#xD;
all night!  That '11 be a work of time, I take it. Miss&#xD;
Faith-could you walk just a little way ?-there's a house&#xD;
there, and maybe a wagon."&#xD;
"You don't understand me," said the doctor. "I asked&#xD;
if you would do me the favour to bring my horses into&#xD;
town. I will take care of the lady."&#xD;
Sam considered a minute--not the doctor but things.&#xD;
"Miss Faith," he said, "I can ruir faster than you can&#xD;
walk, beyond all calculation. If you'll keep warm here,&#xD;
I'l run till I find a wagon-for if you don't ride and tell the&#xD;
story some one else will,-and then there's two people will&#xD;
be worse hurt than you are. You'd get home quickest so."&#xD;
Faith was about to speak but the doctor prevented her.&#xD;
"Then you refuse to take care of my horses ?" he said.&#xD;
"I told you I would take care of the lady."&#xD;
"Bother the horses!1" said Sam impatiently,-"who's to&#xD;
think about horses with Miss Faith here frightened to&#xD;
death ?  Im ready to drive 'em all over creation, when I&#xD;
gjet ready, Dr. Harrison !"&#xD;
Faith in her turn interposed.&#xD;

"I would rather walk than wait, Dr. Harrison. If Sanm&#xD;
knows some house near by, I would rather walk so far with&#xD;
him than wait for him to go and come again. We could&#xD;
send some one to help you then. Sam, you'll help pr,&#xD;
Harrison get the horses up."&#xD;
So much Sam was willing to do, and the doctor with such&#xD;
grace as he might, accepted ; that is, with no grace at all,&#xD;
The horses with some trouble and difficulty were raid to&#xD;
their feet, and found whole. The carriage was broke too&#xD;
much to be even drawn into town. Faith then set out with&#xD;
her escort.&#xD;
"How far is your house, Sam ?"&#xD;
But Sam shook his head at that-the nearest one "f any&#xD;
sort was a poor sort of a place, where they sometim s had&#xD;
a wagon standing and sometimes didn't. "But we can try,&#xD;
Miss Faith," he said in conclusion. Sam's arm was a strong&#xD;
one, and certainly if he could have induced his companion&#xD;
to lean her whole weight on it his satisfaction would have&#xD;
increased in proportion; as it waste gave her good help.&#xD;
And thus they had walked on, in the fading afternoon light,&#xD;
more than what to Faith was "just a little way," when the&#xD;
first house came in sight.&#xD;
Fortunately the wagon was at home; and before it stood&#xD;
an old horse that one of the men said "he should like to&#xD;
see run !"-but for once such deficiency was the best recom'-&#xD;
mendation. Another man set off on foot to find and help&#xD;
Dr. Harrison, and the owner of the slow horse gavp the&#xD;
reins to Sam. The wagon was not on springs, an the&#xD;
buffalo skin was old, and the horse was slow !-beyond a&#xD;
question; but still it was easier than walking, and even&#xD;
quicker. Sam Stoutenburgh did his best to make Faith&#xD;
comfortable-levying upon various articles for that purpose,&#xD;
and drove along with a pleasure which after all can ever&#xD;
be unmixed in this world ! Even Sam felt that, fdo his&#xD;
long-drawn "Oh Miss Faith !"-said much, and carried&#xD;
Faith's thoughts (she hardly knew why) to more than one&#xD;
person at home.&#xD;
" Sam," said Faith, "I don't want to say anything about&#xD;
this to-night."&#xD;
" Well, ma'am-I won't say a word, if I can help it. Do&#xD;
you mean to anybody, Miss Faith ?"&#xD;

"Not to anybody. I mean, not to any one at home "&#xD;
-I won't if I can help it," Sam repeated.  "But it's my&#xD;
night to stay with Mr. Linden."&#xD;
" Is it ?.Well.-What if it is ?"&#xD;
"I don't know-" said Sam dubiously,--" he has a funny&#xD;
way of reading people's faces."&#xD;
"But what is going to be in yours, Sam ?"&#xD;
"I don't know that, neither," said Sam.  "But the fact&#xD;
is, Miss Faith, he always does find out things--and if it's&#xD;
anything he's got to do with you may just as good tell him&#xD;
at once as to fuss round."&#xD;
A pretty significant piece of information ! Upon which&#xD;
Faith mused.&#xD;
It was not so late when they reached Mrs. Derrick's door,&#xD;
that the good lady's anxiety had got fairly under way. At&#xD;
that moment indeed, she had quitted the front of the house,&#xD;
and gone to hurry Cindy and the teakettle ; so that Faith&#xD;
was in the house and her escort dismissed, before Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick appeared.&#xD;
"Why pretty child !" she said-"here you are ! I was&#xD;
very near getting worried. And I went up and asked Mr.&#xD;
Linden what time it was, lest the clock should'nt be right ;&#xD;
but he seemed to think it wasn't worth while to fret about&#xD;
you yet. You're tired to death !" she added, looking at&#xD;
Faith. "You're as pale as anything, child !"&#xD;
"Yes mother-I'm very tired." j&#xD;
And very glad to get home, she'would have said, but her&#xD;
lips failed it.&#xD;
"Well do sit down, child," said her mother, "and I'll&#xD;
take your things up stairs. Tea's all ready-that'll do you&#xD;
good, and then you shall go right to bed."&#xD;
But that did not seem what Faith was ready to d'o ;instead&#xD;
of that, she preferred to sit down by her mother, and wrap&#xD;
her arms round her again and lay her head in her mother's&#xD;
lap. Even then: she did not sleep, though s  was by no&#xD;
means inclined to talk and answered Mrs. Derrck's fond or&#xD;
anxious words with very few in return, low and quiet, or&#xD;
with quiet caresses. And when her mother was silent, to&#xD;
let her sleep, Faith was silent too.&#xD;
SThey had sat so motionless for awhile, when Faith changed&#xD;

CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
HILE Dr. Harrison was sleeping off the effects of his&#xD;
exertions, mental and physical, of the preceding&#xD;
day; and his horses in their stable realized that the reap-&#xD;
ing of wild oats has its own fatigues; Mrs. Derrick was&#xD;
stirring about with even unwonted activity, preparing for&#xD;
that unwonted breakfast up stairs. An anxious look or&#xD;
two at Faith's sleeping face had assured her mother that&#xD;
the fatigue there had been nothing very serious; and Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick went down with a glad heart to her preparations.&#xD;
There Faith joined her after awhile, and as breakfast time&#xD;
approached, Mrs. Derrick suggested that Faith should go&#xD;
up and see that the table was all right, and receive the&#xD;
breakfast which she herself would send, up. Cindy was&#xD;
already there, passing back and forth, and the door stood&#xD;
open to facilitate her operations.&#xD;
If Faith had felt curios as to the success of Sam Stout-&#xD;
enburgi's efforts at concealment, her curiosity was at once&#xD;
relieved. The room as she saw it through the half-open&#xD;
door was bright with firelight and sunshine; the spoons&#xD;
and cups on the little table shone cheerily in the glow; and&#xD;
all things were in their accustomed pretty order and dis-&#xD;
order. But the couch was empty, and Mr. Linden stood&#xD;
by the mantelpiece, leaning one arm there, his face bent&#xD;
down and covered with his band.&#xD;
Faith had no need to knock-the door being open and&#xD;
Cindy in full possession; but as her light step came near&#xD;
the fire he turned suddenly and held out his hand to her&#xD;
without a word. Then gently pushing her back to the&#xD;
corner of the couch, Mr. Linden bade her "sit down and be&#xD;
quiet-" and he himself took a chair at her side. She&#xD;
could hardly tell how he looked-the face was so different&#xD;
from any she had ever seen him wear.&#xD;
For a minute she obeyed orders; then she said, though&#xD;
with an eye that avoided meeting his,&#xD;
"I mustn't be quiet, Mr: Linden-I must see to the&#xD;
breakfast table."&#xD;

If his first motion was to hinder that, he thought better&#xD;
of it, and suffered her to go and give her finishing touches;&#xD;
watching her alP'the time, as she felt, but without speaking;&#xD;
and when Cindy shut the door and tramped down stairs, the&#xD;
room was very still. Only the light crackling of the hickory&#xD;
sticks in the chimney, and those soft movements about the&#xD;
table. If ever such movements were made with pleasure..&#xD;
if ever a face of very deep peacefulness hovered over the&#xD;
placing and displacing of knives and forks, plates and salt.&#xD;
cellars,--it was then. Yet it was not a very abstracted&#xD;
face, nor looked as if the outward quiet might be absolutely&#xD;
immovable. The last touch put to tlfi table, Faith glanced&#xD;
at the hickory sticks on the fire; but they wanted nothing;&#xD;
and then her look came round to Mr. Linden, and the smile&#xD;
which could no longer be kept. back, came too; a smile of&#xD;
touching acknowledgment.&#xD;
"Miss Faith, will you come and sit down ?"   -&#xD;
She came, silently.&#xD;
One deep breath she did hear, as Mr. Linden arranged&#xD;
the cushions and with gentle force made her lean against&#xD;
them, but either he did not feel himself able to tone di.&#xD;
rectly what they were both thinking of--or else tho ght&#xD;
her not able to bear it. His tone was very quiet, the rest&#xD;
of his hand upon her hair hardly longer than it had been&#xD;
yesterday, as he said,,&#xD;
"What will my scholar be fit for to-day ?--anything but&#xD;
sleep ?"&#xD;
For a momeiW it was a little more than she could bear,&#xD;
and her face for that moment was entirely grave; then she&#xD;
smiled up at him and answered in a tone lighter than his&#xD;
had been,&#xD;
"Fit for anything-and more fit than ever, Mr. Linden.&#xD;
I only rest here because you put me here."&#xD;
- The next remark diverged a little, and was given with&#xD;
darkening eyes.&#xD;
"How DARED he take you with those young horses !"&#xD;
"He thought he could do just what he pleased with&#xD;
them-" said Faith, shaking her head a little.&#xD;
"And with you-" was in Mr. Linden's mind, but it&#xD;
came not forth. " Where is your mother?-does she&#xD;
know ?"&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
"Mother's coming," said Faith raising herself from the&#xD;
cushions,--"as soon as she sends up the breakfast. She&#xD;
doesn't know yet. I told Sam not to tell you, Mr. Linden.'-&#xD;
"How do you do to-day ?"&#xD;
She answered him with a bright fair glance and in a&#xD;
tone as sweet as happiness could make it,&#xD;
"Very well!"&#xD;
Mr. Linden's eyes went from her to the opening door&#xD;
and the entering dishes.&#xD;
"Sam was not in fault, Miss Faith,-I heard you come&#xD;
home."&#xD;
In the train of the dishes came Mrs. Derrick, and looked&#xD;
with a little amaze at Mr. Linden off the couch and Faith&#xD;
upon it. But if the first didn't hurt him, she knew the&#xD;
second wouldn't hurt Faith, with whose appearance her&#xD;
mother was not yet quite satisfied. And when they were&#xD;
all at the, table, Mrs. Derrick might wonder at those words&#xD;
of very earnest thanksgiving that they- were all brought&#xD;
together again, but they needed no explanation to any one&#xD;
else. In all her life Faith had never known just such a&#xD;
breakfast. That sweet sense of being safe - of being&#xD;
shielded, - of breathing an atmosphere where no evil,&#xD;
mental, moral, or physical, could reach her,-how precious&#xD;
it was !-after those hours of fear and sorrow. If her two&#xD;
companions had visibly joined hands around her, she could&#xD;
not have felt the real fact more strongly. And another&#xD;
hand was nearer and more precious still to her- apprehen-&#xD;
sion; even the one that made theirs strong and had brought&#xD;
her within them. Faith's face was a fair picture, for all&#xD;
this was there. But Faith's words were few.&#xD;
How many Mr. Linden's would have been, of choice,&#xD;
cannot be known; for Mrs. Derrick's mind was so intent&#xD;
upon the last night's expedition, so eager to know howthe&#xD;
poor woman was, and what she said, and where she lived;&#xD;
and how Faitlir enjoyed the drive, and what made her get&#xD;
so tired,-that he had full occupation in warding off the&#xD;
questions and turning them another way. In compliance&#xD;
with her wishes he had taken his usual place on the couch,&#xD;
and there made himself useful both with word and hand;&#xD;
the particular use of breakfast to him, was not so apparent.&#xD;

finished the work of removing it before she brought up word&#xD;
that the doctor was come and wanted to see Mis' Derrick,&#xD;
Faith judged the enquiry was meant for herself and ran&#xD;
down stairs accordingly. The doctor was satisfied that she&#xD;
was none the worse of her ride with him, but had brought&#xD;
a very serious face to the examination.&#xD;
"Have you forgiven me, Miss Derrick ?"&#xD;
"I have nothing to forgive, sir !" Faith told him with a&#xD;
look that gave sweet assurance of it.-" I am not hurt. I&#xD;
am very glad I went."&#xD;
"May I say," said the doctor, and he looked as if he was&#xD;
uneasy till he had said it,-"that you misjudged me yester-&#xD;
day from that woman's words. I did not choose to inter.&#xD;
rupt her-and the severity of your remarks to me," he said&#xD;
with a little smile which did not want feeling, "took from&#xD;
me at the moment the power to justify myself., I3ut Miss&#xD;
Derrick, I have not done what you seemed to supposo-&#xD;
and fairly enough, for she gave you to understand it.' I&#xD;
never set myself to overthrow her belief in anything. I&#xD;
have hardly held any conversation with her, except what&#xD;
related to her physical condition; if I have said anything&#xD;
it has been a word intended to quiet her. I saw her mind&#xD;
was very much disturbed."&#xD;
Faith had looked very grave, with eyes cast down, during&#xD;
the hearing of this speech. She rised them then, at the&#xD;
end, and said with great gentleness,&#xD;
"There is but one way to give quiet that will stand, Dr.&#xD;
Harrison."&#xD;
"I am sure you are right," he said looking at her with&#xD;
an unwonted face, nearer to reverence than Dr. Harrison&#xD;
was often known to give to anything "I hope you will&#xD;
go and see that poor creature again and undo any mischief&#xD;
my careless words may have done."&#xD;
"Won't you undo them yourself, Dr. Harrison ?"&#xD;
"I will endorse yours, so well as I can !" he said. "But&#xD;
won't you see her again ?"&#xD;
"If I can,-I will try to go."&#xD;
"May I see Mr. Linden ?" was the next question in a&#xD;
lighter tone; and receiving permission the doctor moved&#xD;
himself up stairs. ~He entered Mr. Linden's room with a&#xD;
quiet, composed air, very different from the jaunty manner&#xD;
&#xD;
of yesterday; and applied himself with business quiet to&#xD;
Mr. Linden's state and wants. And the reception he jnet&#xD;
was not one to set him a talking. It was not tinged with&#xD;
the various feelings which the thought of him had&#xD;
stirred in Mr. Linden's mind that night and morning,-if&#xD;
they lived still it was in the background. The grasp of&#xD;
his hand was firmer than usual, the tone m re earnest,&#xD;
which said, "I am very glad to see you !"-nd yet the&#xD;
doctor felt that in them both there was more--a d also less&#xD;
.-than mere personal feeling.&#xD;
He had nearly finished the arrangem  ts of Mr. Linden's&#xD;
arm when he remarked, "Did you h eithe result of our&#xD;
expedition yesterday ?"&#xD;
A grave 'yes,' answered him.&#xD;
"You see," said the doctor, "I couldn't manage the&#xD;
wind !"&#xD;
But to that there was no reply.&#xD;
"It was just that," said the doctor.  "Those horses had&#xD;
been taking whiskey, I believe, instead of oats; and the&#xD;
wind just made them mad. They ran for pure love of run-&#xD;
ning !-till a little villain threw up his hat at them-and&#xD;
then indeed it was which'could catch the clouds first."&#xD;
If the doctor wanted help in his account, he got none.&#xD;
He drew back and took a survey.&#xD;
"What's the niatter, Linden ?-you look more severe at&#xD;
me this morning than Miss Derrick does;-and I am sure&#xD;
she has the most reason."&#xD;
"I have a prudent fit come over me- once in a while,"&#xD;
said Mr. Linden goodhumouredly, but with a little restless&#xD;
change of position. "I'm afraid if I talk much upon this&#xD;
subject I shall.get out of patience-and I couldn't lay all&#xD;
the blame of \that upon you."&#xD;
"What blame-do you pretend-to lay upon me, as it&#xD;
is?" said the doctor not illhumouredly.&#xD;
"Thereell be no pretence about it-when I lay it on,"&#xD;
said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"Enact Macduff-and lay on1" said the doctor smiling.&#xD;
"Let it suffice you that I could if I would."&#xD;
"The shadows of strokes suffice me!". said the doctor.&#xD;
"Am I a man of straw ? Do you take me for Sir .Andrew&#xD;
Aguecheek ? 'horribly valiant', after- his fashion. . What&#xD;

have I done, man ?" He stood, carelessly handsome and&#xD;
handsomely careless, before the couch, looking dowrupon&#xD;
Mr. Linden as if resolved to have something out of him.&#xD;
A part of the description applied well to the face he was&#xD;
looking at---yet after a different fashion ; and anything less&#xD;
careless than the look Mr. Linden bent upon him, could not&#xD;
be imagined. It was a look wherein again different feelings&#xD;
held each other in check,--the grave reproof, the sorrowful&#xD;
perception, the quick indignation-IDr. Harrison might&#xD;
detect them all; and yet more, the wistful desire that he&#xD;
were a different man. This it was that answered.&#xD;
"What have you done, doctor ?-you have very nearly&#xD;
given yourself full proof of those true things which you&#xD;
profess to disbelieve."&#xD;
" How do you know that I disbelieve anything ?" said the&#xD;
doctor, with a darkening yet an acute look;-"much more&#xD;
that I profess to disbelieve ?"&#xD;
"How do I know whether a ship carries a red or a blue&#xD;
light at her masthead ?"&#xD;
"You don't, if she carries no light at all; and I do not&#xD;
remember that I ever professed myself in your hearing on&#xD;
either side of the 'things' I suppose you mean."&#xD;
"What do you say of a ship that carries no light at all?"&#xD;
"Must a ship always hang out her signals, man?"&#xD;
"Ay--" said Mr. Linden,-." else she may run down the&#xD;
weaker craft, or be- run down by the stronger."&#xD;
"Suppose she don't know, in good truth, what light&#xD;
belongs to her ?"&#xD;
"It is safe to find out."&#xD;
" Who has told you, Linden, that I believed or disbelieved&#xD;
anything ?"&#xD;
"Yourself."&#xD;
"May I ask, if any other testimony has aided your judg-&#xD;
ment, or come in aid of it?"&#xD;
"No," said Mr. Linden, looking at him with a grave,&#xD;
considering eye. "I am not much in the habit of discuss&#xD;
ing such points with third' parties."'&#xD;
The doctor bit his lip; and then smiled.&#xD;
"You're a good fellow, Linden. But you see, I can&#xD;
afford to say that now. I have you at advantage. As long&#xD;
as you lie there, and I am your attending physician--whiCh&#xD;
&#xD;
latter I assure you I look upon as a piece of my good for-&#xD;
tune-you can't knock me down, if you feel disposed. I&#xD;
am safe, and can afford to be generous. As to the lights,"&#xD;
said the doctor taking up his hat, " I agree to what you&#xD;
say and that's more of a concession than I ever made on&#xD;
the subject before. But in the atmosphere I have lived in,&#xD;
I do assure you I have not been 4ble to tell the blue lights&#xD;
from the red 1"&#xD;
"I believe you," said Mr. Li den,--"nor was it alto-&#xD;
gether the falilt of the atmosphere  Even where the colour&#xD;
is right, the glass is sometimes dim. What then ?"&#xD;
"What then ? why the inference is plain. If one can-&#xD;
npt be distinguished from the other, one is as good as the&#xD;
other 1"&#xD;
"And both shine with a steady clear ligt upon the&#xD;
heavenward way ?"&#xD;
"There's no question of shirgng," said the doctor half&#xD;
scornfully, half impatiently. "If they shew colour at all,&#xD;
it is on a way that is murky enough, heaven knows !"&#xD;
"Then what have they to do with the question ?" said&#xD;
Mr. Linden,-"you are applying rules of action which you&#xD;
would laugh at in any other case. Does the multitude of&#xD;
quacks disgust you with the science of medicine ?-.-does the&#xD;
K dim burning of a dozen poor candles hinder your lighting&#xD;
a good one ?  You have nothin to do with other people's&#xD;
r lights,-let your own shine 1"&#xD;
Dr. Harrison stood looking at his adviser a minute, with&#xD;
a smile that was both pleased and acute.&#xD;
"Linden "-said he,-"it strikes me that you are out of&#xD;
your vocation."&#xD;
" When I heard that account last night,"-Mr. Linden&#xD;
went on-and he paused, as if the recollection were pain&#xD;
ful,-" the second' thing I thought of was your own words,&#xD;
that heaven 'is not in your line.'&#xD;
"Well?-." said the doctor swinging his hat and begin-&#xD;
hing to pace up and down the room, and speaking as if at&#xD;
once confessing and justifying the charge laid tohim,-..&#xD;
"Now and then, I believe, a bodily. angel comes down to&#xD;
the earth and leaves her wings behind her-but that's not&#xD;
humanity, Linden I"&#xD;
" True servant of Goll, is as fair a name as angel," said&#xD;

Mr. Linden; "and that is what humanity may be and often&#xD;
is.  'Though crowns are wanting, and bright pinions&#xD;
folded.'"&#xD;
" I don't know-" said the doctor. "I shouldn't have&#xD;
wondered any minute yesterday to see the pinions unfold&#xD;
before me." Which remark was received in silence.&#xD;
If such an angel were to take hold of me," the doctor&#xD;
went on meditatively,-"I believe she might make me and'&#xD;
carry me whither she would. But I wonder if I shall be&#xD;
forbid the house now !"--He stopped and looked at Mr.&#xD;
Linden with a face of comic enquiry.&#xD;
"You may come and see me," said Mr. Linden, with&#xD;
comforting assurance.&#xD;
"Do you think I may ?" said the doctor. He sat down&#xD;
and threw his hat on the floor.-" What shall I do with&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick?  She will want to send me off in a balloon,&#xD;
on some air journey that will never land me on earth !-or&#xD;
find some other vanishing medium most prompt and irrevo-&#xD;
cable--all as a penalty for my having ventured to leap a&#xD;
fence in company with her daughter !"&#xD;
But the prudent fit had perhaps come back upon Mr.&#xD;
Linden, for except a sudden illumination of eye and face,&#xD;
the doctor's speech called forth no opinion.&#xD;
"The best driver on earth can't be a centaur, man!&#xD;
Horses in these days will have heads 'of their own." But.&#xD;
then the doctor rose up and came gracefully and gravelyU&#xD;
again to take his friend and patient's hand.&#xD;
"I agree to all you say !" said he, looking down with a&#xD;
goodhumoured wilful expression to Mr. Linden's face;-&#xD;
"and I know no, other man to whom I would own as much,&#xD;
after such words and such silence as you have bestowed on&#xD;
me. Good-bye. But really, remember, a man is not an-&#xD;
swerable for all his horses-or all his wits--may do."&#xD;
The doctor went; and then there was an intervalof some&#xD;
length. Faith had found several things to do in her down&#xD;
stairs department, which she would not leave to her mother;&#xD;
especially after the shock Mrs. Derrick's mind and heart&#xD;
had received from the communication of what had happened&#xD;
the day before. So it was a little later than usual when&#xD;
the light tap was heard at Mr. Linden's door and Faith and i&#xD;
a cup of cocoa came in. She set the cup down, and then 4&#xD;
&#xD;
went out again for a dish of".grapes and pears-Tudge&#xD;
garrison's and Farmer David's sending---which she brought&#xD;
to the table.&#xD;
"1 didn't know which you would like best, Mr. Linden;--&#xD;
so I brought both."&#xD;
"I should like to be waNng on you," he said,-" Miss&#xD;
Faith, you ought not to be waiting on me. I shall bestir&#xD;
myself and come down stairs."&#xD;
There was expression in the kind of happy silence that&#xD;
answered him, as she offered the cocoa.&#xD;
"I don't know where to begin to talk to you this morn-&#xD;
ing," said Mr. Linden,-" everything demands the first&#xD;
place. Miss Faith, when you feel that you can, will you&#xD;
tell me all about yesterday ? I wish I could give you this&#xD;
couch again, but I suppose in prudence I ought to lie still."&#xD;
She saw him served with what he would have; then sat&#xD;
down, and a shadow of sweet gravity came over her.&#xD;
"The ride out was all very pleasant. There wasn't much&#xD;
talk, and I could just enjoy everything. It's a long way,&#xD;
Mr. Linden," she said glancing at him-she spoke generally&#xD;
with her eyes bent somewhegre else ;-."it 41ust be ten or&#xD;
twelve miles, for we went very fast ; and it was beautiful,&#xD;
with the wind and the driving clouds and shadows. So I&#xD;
enjoyed all that part, and I wasn't afraid of the horses, or&#xD;
not much afraid-though they went vry fast and I saw&#xD;
they felt very gay. I liked the going fast and I thought&#xD;
the doctor could manage them." She paused.&#xD;
"Are you sure you want to talk of this now ?" Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den said. "You know we have other things to do-this&#xD;
can wait till you chos.&#xD;
"I. like to tell it," she said withnother quick glance and&#xD;
a quick breath,-" but the visit comes next-and I don't&#xD;
know how to tell you of that. Mr. Linden, I wish you&#xD;
could see that woman 1-And if you can't soon, I must,-&#xD;

"If I can't-or if I can, I will find you the 'somehow,'&#xD;
if you want to go. And if you will let me," he added.&#xD;
"Is she really dying ?"&#xD;
" She.says so-" Faith said low. And was silent a bit.&#xD;

seemed to .grow more friky than ever-I think the wind&#xD;
excited them; and Dr. Harrison had his hands full, I could&#xD;
see, to hold them in, especially after we turned Lamprey's&#xD;
corner and the wind was in their faces. I think it was&#xD;
something suddenly flung over the fence, that started them&#xD;
off to run-and then they ran faster and faster, and reins&#xD;
and bits were of no use at all."&#xD;
Faith was excited herself, and spoke slowly and low and&#xD;
with hindered breath.&#xD;
"I saw they were getting more and more furious,-and&#xD;
there were a. few minutes, Mr. Linden, when I thought I&#xD;
should maybe never see home again.-And then I thanked&#xD;
you in my heart."&#xD;
"ie ?" he said with quick emphasis, and looking at her,&#xD;
Faith did not look at him, but after a pause went on very&#xD;
quietly.&#xD;
"I mean, on earth I thanked you. The end of it was,&#xD;
they took a new fright at something, I believe, just at the&#xD;
top of a hill; and after that it was all a whirl. I hardly&#xD;
knew anything-till I found myself lying on the ground in&#xD;
the meadow. The horses had jumped the carriage and all&#xD;
clean over the fence. The fence was just below the foot&#xD;
of the hill; the road took a turn there.--Sam told you the&#xD;
rest-didn't he, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
' He said "yes," and not another word, but lay there still&#xD;
with those closely shielded eyes ; and lips unbent from their&#xD;
usual repose, with grave humbleness and grief and joy.&#xD;
The silence lasted till Faith spoke again. And that was&#xD;
some little space of time. A shade' graver and lower her&#xD;
tone was when she spoke.&#xD;
"I shall never forget after this, that it is 'part of ae'&#xD;
Christian's sailing-orders to speak every vessel he meets.'&#xD;
.-I think I shall never forget it again."&#xD;
Mr. Linden did look then at the little craft that had begun&#xD;
her voyage so undauntedly under -the Christian colours,&#xD;
though what he thought of her he said not ; apparently his&#xD;
own words were not yet ready, though he spoke.&#xD;
"Be strong and of a good courage; he not afraid, neither&#xD;
be thou dismayed : for the Lord thy God is with thee&#xD;
whithersoever thou goest.'" -&#xD;
Faith spoke no more. She sat in the absolutest quiet,&#xD;

of face and figure both ; looking into the fire that played&#xD;
in the chimney, with a fixedness that perhaps told-in the&#xD;
beginning--of some doubtfulness of self command. But&#xD;
the happy look of the face was in nowise changed.&#xD;
A knock at the door was the first interruption, a knock&#xD;
so low down that the latch seemed quite too high to match&#xD;
it; but by some exercise of skill this was lifted, and Johnny&#xD;
'fax presented himself. He looked very wide awake, and&#xD;
smiling, and demure, as was his wont, though to-day the&#xD;
smiles were in the ascendant ; owing perhaps to the weest&#xD;
of all wee baskets which he held in his hand. Coming close&#xD;
up to Mr. Linden, and giving him the privileged caress,&#xD;
Johnny stood there within his arm and smiled benignly&#xD;
upon Faith, as if he considered her quite part and parcel&#xD;
of the same concern. Who smiled back upon him, and&#xD;
enquired " where he had come from ?" .&#xD;
Johnny said "From home, ma'am," and looked down at&#xD;
his tiny basket as if it were a weight on his mind that he&#xD;
did not know how to get rid of.&#xD;
"Johnny," said Mr. Linden, "what have you got in that&#xD;
basket ?"&#xD;
"You couldn't guess !" said Johnnywith a very bright&#xD;
face.&#xD;
"I couldn't guess1" said Mr. Linden. "Don't you sup-&#xD;
pose I can do anything ?"&#xD;
"Yes--"said Johnny shaking his head,-.." but you can't&#xD;
do that."&#xD;
"Then I shall not try," said Mr. Linden, ",nd you'll&#xD;
have to tell me."&#xD;
Johnny put his face close down by Mr. Linden, and&#xD;
whispered, but not so low that Faith could not hear-&#xD;
"It's two white eggs that my black hen laid for you,&#xD;
sir!"&#xD;
"Well I never should have guessed that !"-said Mr.&#xD;
Linden smiling. "I didn't suppose there was a hen in&#xD;
the world that cared so much for me. I don't believe&#xD;
she would if she was not your hen, Johnny. "-Which last&#xD;
sentence Johnny understood just well enough to feel de-&#xD;
lighted; and stood with a glad little face while his teacher&#xD;
opened the- basket, and taking up first one egg and then&#xD;
the other, commented upon their size and whiteness.&#xD;

"As soon as I can get out I shall come and see that hen,"&#xD;
said Mr. Linden, drawing the child closer and giving hiu&#xD;
another kiss.-which Johnny thought was worth a whole&#xD;
basket of eggs;-"Jso you must tell her to have her feathers&#xD;
in good order.   Now what have you to say to Mis&#xD;
Faith ?"&#xD;
" 0 she talks to me," said Johnny.&#xD;
"Does she ?" said Mr. Linden,-"is that the division&#xD;
of labour ? What does she talk about, Johnny ?-.--let me&#xD;
see how well you remember." It was said with a little&#xD;
acknowledging look that he was asking that to which&#xD;
somebody would demur-but also with a wilful assumption&#xD;
that somebody would come to no harm. So though Faith&#xD;
flushed and started, she sat back in her seat again without&#xD;
making any word interposition. Johnny stood and thought&#xD;
--...for he was a real little literalist.&#xD;
"She talked about heaven-' he said slowly,--"and.how&#xD;
to get there,-and said she was going-and we must too.&#xD;
That's what she said Sunday. And at Judge Harrison's&#xD;
she said she was glad I'd got a red ribband-and down to&#xD;
Neanticut she told me to run away."&#xD;
"I'm sure that was a gentle way of dismissing you "said&#xD;
Mr. Linden, stroking the child's forehead. "Well J y&#xD;
-are you trying to follow her in that way to heave she&#xD;
told you of?"&#xD;
The "yes" was given without hesitation, and came with&#xD;
strangely sweet effect from those childish lips. Then after&#xD;
a minute Johnny added, as if he feared some inisunder-&#xD;
standing,&#xD;
T "It's the same way you told me, sir."&#xD;
"Yes, I trust you will see me there too," Mr. Linden&#xD;
said, with a rather moved look at the little face before&#xD;
him.&#xD;
What made Yaith, at those last words of Johnny's, jump&#xD;
up and spring to the fire? And after a most elaborate&#xD;
handling of the sticks of wood, she did not come back to&#xD;
her seat; but stood still with her back turned to the couch&#xD;
and the little witness who was testifying there. He was&#xD;
not called uplon for any more evidence, however. Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den talked -or let him talk-about various important&#xD;
things in Johnny's daily life and experience, and gave a&#xD;
&#xD;
promise that he himself would be at school as soon as the&#xD;
doctor gave his permission.&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick's softknock and entrance came now, she&#xD;
herself looking in good truth as if a "tear-storm" had&#xD;
passed over her. But she brightened up a, little at the&#xD;
sight of Faith.&#xD;
"Pretty child !" she said, coming up to 1er, "and so&#xD;
you're here? I couldn't rest any longer wi hout seeing&#xD;
just where you were."&#xD;
Faith put one hand on her shoiJder as she stood, and&#xD;
then clasped Ahe~ther upon that.&#xD;
Pretty child 1" her motherarepeated, in a tone that&#xD;
spoke more of pain than pleasure-and Faith could feel&#xD;
the shudder that passed over her then. But she controlled&#xD;
herself. "Do you know it's dinner time, Faith ?  How is&#xD;
Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"There he is," said Faith smiling. "I don't know,&#xD;
mother."&#xD;
"He'don't look to me as if he had ever been asleep,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Derrick, -but whether that skewed want of&#xD;
sleep, or the reverse, was, as Mr. Linden remarked, quite&#xD;
doubtful.&#xD;
Mrs.Derrick looked at him, met his smile-then her&#xD;
whole heart answered to something it said.&#xD;
Sh Mr. Linden! think of her being in such danger I"&#xD;
an here was a minute of deep silence.&#xD;
"Na v" he answered softly-and the face was beautiful&#xD;
in its c  ing expression,-"think of her being so safe!"&#xD;
Mrs. Drick could bear neither word nor look after that.&#xD;
The two ladies went down together, leaving Johnny to&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
THE dinner up stairs was a very quiet and- uninter.&#xD;
rupted one. The dinner down stairs was destined&#xD;
not.to be so.&#xD;
The first break was the entrance of Cindy with a bunch&#xD;
of flowers-which the doctor had sent to Miss Derrick,&#xD;
with the desire to know how she was. Faith received the&#xD;
flowers with a dubious face and put them in water on the&#xD;
dinner-table, where they looked splendid. Mrs. Derrick&#xD;
could hardly see their splendour.&#xD;
"He needn't think to come round me that way," she&#xD;
said. "Child ! I wouldn't let you go off with him again&#xD;
for twenty kingdoms 1"&#xD;
"Not with those horses, mother."&#xD;
"Nor with any others. I sha'n't ever want to have you&#xD;
go with anybody again, Faith."&#xD;
"What's goin' on here ?" said a growling voice which&#xD;
they knew, before Mr. Simlins entered the door' of the&#xD;
dining room. "That gal o' yourn wants me to stay po ' y&#xD;
'n the parlour yonder-but I ain't polite-and I c to&#xD;
e you; not your doors and windows nog' the pr  paper&#xD;
on your walls. What are you algbou',1irs. .fick? I&#xD;
hear the very spirit of turbidness has got iAto ~ house"&#xD;
"There's not much spirit in me to-day," said Mrs. Der-&#xD;
rick, "nor spirits neither. I've lost what little I had&#xD;
Anybody could knock me down with a straw.   Sit down,&#xD;
Mr. Simlins, and take some dinner."&#xD;
"I'n afeard, if it's done so easy, I might occasionally do&#xD;
it with one o' them posies," said Mr. Simlins standing and&#xD;
surveying the bouquet as if he didn't know what to m06'&#xD;
of it. "Do you eat the grass of the field atyour noon-&#xD;
spell ?"&#xD;
"You may ask Faith," said Mrs. Derrick; "she put 'em&#xD;
there."&#xD;
"Sit down, Mr. Simlins," said Faith.'&#xD;
(322)&#xD;
&#xD;
"I ain't goin' to sit down! I've eat my dinner.  I've&#xD;
k just come in, Mrs. Derrick, to see if you're all overturned,&#xD;
or if there's anything left straight yet."&#xD;
It's all straight," said Faith smiling up at him. "Sit&#xD;
down, Mr. Simlins."&#xD;
"What's the truth of it, Mrs. Derrick? This child ain't&#xD;
all straight, is she?"&#xD;
It followed that, bit by bit, Mr. Simlins got out the&#xD;
story of the accident, for neither Faith nor Mrs. Derrick&#xD;
was forward to speak about it. He then enquired, with an&#xD;
9 unsatisfied grunt, why Faith was "postin' round with&#xD;
Dr. Harrison ?"  Whereat Mrs. Derrick felt justly indig-&#xD;
nant.&#xD;
"Why she ain't! Mr. Simlins.   She went down there&#xD;
on business, and there was noboq'y else at hand to take her&#xD;
} just then."&#xD;
"'What'do you call being' at hand ?" said Mr. Simlins.&#xD;
"I've got two hands, and more'n two horses-that won't&#xD;
run away neither.  It's only my cows do that!-Where's&#xD;
Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"0 he's up stairs--" said Mrs. Derrick. "He's not&#xD;
been down yet. Faith, don't you think he's some stronger&#xD;
to-day ?"&#xD;
"And so," said Mr. Simlins turning to her again re-&#xD;
proachfully,-"while he's lyin' up there and can't stir, you&#xD;
go drivin' over the country with 'tother one !"&#xD;
But that brought out Faith's round low laugh, so incon-&#xD;
trovertibly merry and musical that it changed Mr. Simlins'&#xD;
face on the instant.  It came to an end almost as soon, but&#xD;
short as it was it was better than the warble of any nightin-&#xD;
gale; inasmuch as the music of a good sound human heart&#xD;
is worth all the birds in creation.&#xD;
"When's Mr. Linden going to be down stairs, where a&#xD;
body can get sight of him?"&#xD;
"The doctor says he mustn't go out for a long time yet,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Derrick. "When are you going to find the man&#xD;
that shot him ?-that's what I want to know."&#xD;
"When I get a composition from the only witness," Mr.&#xD;
Simlins answered.  "And as the witness ain't particular&#xD;
about testifying, I'm afeard it'll be a spell o' time yet.- It'll&#xD;
come out. I should think the fellow'd ha' made tracks,&#xD;

fust thing; but I 'aint heerd of any one's begin' mission' from&#xD;

Mr. Simlins suddenly started, stopped, and gazed a&#xD;
Faith with a most extraordinary expression.&#xD;
"Did you look at my flowers, Mr. Simlins ?" said Pait&#xD;
quite quietly, though without meeting his eye.&#xD;
"I've seen nosegays afore," growled Mr. Simlins in&#xD;
very uninterested manner. "I don't see as this is no more&#xD;
nor less than a nosegay. Do you s'pose I might go up an4&#xD;
see somebody up stairs for two minutes, without creating&#xD;
any confusion ?"&#xD;
Mr. Simlins went up and shortly afterwards went away&#xD;
But if Faith anticipated a good long lesson that afternoon&#xD;
to make up for the morning and afternoon in which she&#xD;
had had none-lbeit the morning had been better tha ni&#xD;
lessons--she wa to be disappointed. Hardly was the din.&#xD;
ner over, and the muffins mixed which she was determined&#xD;
should make amends for Mr. Linden's poor breakfast, when&#xD;
Miss Harrison came; full of sorrow, and sympathy&#xD;
hope.    .r                             s&#xD;
"Faith don't look a bit the worse, ma'am," she said to&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick.&#xD;
"She couldn't look any way but just so," her mother&#xD;
said with a fond glance.        -.6&#xD;
"Why she could look pale, but I don't see that she does&#xD;
even that;-unless, perhaps, just such a tiny paleness as&#xD;
is rather becoming than otherwise. Dear Mrs. Derrick, I I&#xD;
hope you have forgiven Julius ?"                    }..&#xD;
It was a sorrowful smile that met her words, and eyes I&#xD;
that grewr dim and looked away. A&#xD;
"I suppose I could forgive the whole world--.since he&#xD;
didn't do any more harm," Mrs. Derrick said with her&#xD;
wonted gentleness. "But I wouldn't see her go with him&#xD;
again, Miss Sophy-if that's what you call forgiveness.",&#xD;
"Why not? Dear Mrs. Derrick,!"-&#xD;
"Why not ?"--said the good lady.-" why Faith's used&#xD;
to being taken care of, Miss Sophy..and I'm used to see.&#xD;
ing it,"&#xD;
"My dear Mrs.Derrick !"-Missarrison exclaimed out&#xD;
of breath,-"do you think she was not taken care of?&#xD;
Julius knows his horses, and he is a capital hand with&#xD;
&#xD;
them; he says himself he thinks he should have brought&#xD;
them to, if that little wretch of a boy hadn't thrown up his&#xD;
hat before their eyes. No horses would stand that, you&#xD;
know. And the best man in the world, and the best driver,&#xD;
can't'be certain of his.horses, Mrs. Derrick.' Not take&#xD;
care of her 1-&#xD;
"I don't mean to say that he didn't mean to," said Mrs&#xD;
Derrick quietly, "but I don't think he knows how. You&#xD;
needn't look so, Miss Sophy-I'm not saying a word&#xD;
against your brother. But Faith's only part of the world&#xD;
to him-and she's the whole of it to me. He should have&#xD;
taken horses he was sure of," said Mrs. Derrick with a&#xD;
little flush on her cheek.&#xD;
"I don't know," said Miss Harrison softly, and looking&#xD;
at Faith,-" I don't know just what part of the world&#xD;
she is to him-but I think, and am very sure, he would&#xD;
have thrown himself out rather than her. Can anybody&#xD;
do more ? Can any mark do more, Mrs. Derrick ?" she&#xD;
said smiling. "I know you are her mother; and though&#xD;
I am not her mother, I think of her just as you do."&#xD;
~ "I can't say what any man'can do," said Mrs. Derrick&#xD;
pleasantly,-" I haven't tried many. And you can't tell&#xD;
how I feel, Miss, Sophy-it isn't cross, if it sounds so.&#xD;
How long has Dr. Harrison had those horses ?"&#xD;
"Why, not very long," said Miss Harrison,-"he hasn't&#xD;
been home long himself. But he's a good judge of horses,"&#xD;
she said, a little less sure of her ground than in the former&#xD;
part of the conversation. Perhaps she was not sorry to&#xD;
have it interrupted.&#xD;
"My dear Mrs. Derrick !" said Mr. Somers entering,-&#xD;
"I have come to congratulate you!  Miss Harrison, I see,&#xD;
is before me in this pleasant-a-office. Miss Faith !-I&#xD;
am glad to see you looking so well after your overthrow."-&#xD;
Mr. Somers went round shaking hands as he spoke.-" Mrs.&#xD;
Somers will be here presently to join me-she stopped a&#xD;
few minutes by the way. Mrs. Somers always has more&#xD;
business on hand than I can-a-keep up with. Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick, I have rejoiced with you, indeed, ma'am."&#xD;
Mrs. Somers had managed to keep up with her business&#xD;
and him too, for she came in before Mr. Somgrs had well&#xD;
taken the measure of his chair. She walked up to Faith&#xD;

and kissed her, with a sort of glad energy, gave her a com.&#xD;
prehensive glance from head to foot, and then turned to&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick with,&#xD;
" There's nothing amiss with her, after all.-Sopi,&#xD;
what excuses have you brought in your bag ?-it seemsto&#xD;
be full."&#xD;
"I wish you'd make some for Julius, aunt Elle -I can&#xD;
see Mrs. Derrick has only half forgiven him."&#xD;
"Has she got so far as that ?" said Mrs. Somers.&#xD;
"I don't know. Faith, you might come and say some.&#xD;
thing-you know if it isn't true; and Mrs. Derrick will&#xD;
heat' you."&#xD;
Faith was busy giving Mrs. Somers a chair, and cer.&#xD;
tainly looked as if she had nobody to forgive anything in&#xD;
the wide world.&#xD;
"What do you want me to say, Sophy ?"&#xD;
"Why, that Julius wasn't to blame."&#xD;
"I find it is stillan disputed point, whether a man has a&#xD;
right to break his own neck," said Mrs. Somers. "I think&#xD;
he hasn't, myself, but most people don't agree with me.&#xD;
Mr. Somers thinks people may run away alone or together,&#xD;
just as they've a mind. I don't know whether it's the fees&#xD;
or the freedom that takes his fancy."&#xD;
"I suppose, my dear," said Mr. Somers, "a man may&#xD;
lawfully set out to take a ride without intending to break&#xD;
his own neck, or anybody else's; and find it done at the&#xD;
end, without blame to himself. I never was, I hope, a&#xD;
promoter of-ha !-flighty marriages-to which you seem&#xD;
to allude."&#xD;
"If he finds it done at the end, it isn't done very&#xD;
thoroughly," said Mrs. Somers. "But Pattaquasset's grow-&#xD;
ing up into a novel-last week furnished with a hero, and&#xD;
this week with a heroine,-the course of things can't run&#xD;
smooth now.   So we may all look out for breakers-of&#xD;
horses, I hope, among other things."&#xD;
"Oh aunt Ellen !"-was Miss Harrison's not gratified&#xD;
comment on this speech.&#xD;
"I hope Mrs. Somers don't mean that we are to look&#xD;
out for breakers of hearts, among the other things," said&#xD;
Mr. Somers.&#xD;
"Look out for them? to be sure !" said Miss Harrison;-&#xD;
&#xD;
"always and everywhere. What would the world be with&#xD;
out them?"&#xD;
"The world would not be heart-broken," said Mrs.&#xD;
Somers. "Faith--which of you came to first? who picked&#xD;
you up V&#xD;
yI don't know, Mrs. Somers. Sam Stoutenburgh was&#xD;
passing just at the time and Dr. Harrison called him -I&#xD;
don't know who picked me up."&#xD;
"Sam Stoutenburgh !" said Mrs. Somers,--" well, he's&#xD;
made, if nobody else is! He'll bless Julius for the rest of&#xD;
his life for giving him such a chance. Do you know how&#xD;
that boy watches you, Faith ?-I mean to speak to .Mr.&#xD;
Linden about it the very first time I see him."&#xD;
Something in this speech called forth Faith's colour.&#xD;
She had spoken Sam's name herself with the simplest un-&#xD;
changnig face; but now the flushes came and came abund-&#xD;
antly.&#xD;
"I don't know what good that would do, Mrs. Somers."&#xD;
"Nor I--till I try," said the lady smiling at her.  "But&#xD;
if the mere, suggestion is so powerful, what may not the&#xD;
reality do ? I'll say one thig for Mr. Linden-he makes&#xD;
all those boys come into church and get seated before the&#xD;
service begins--which nobody else ever did yet; if they&#xD;
ever tried. I was curious to see how it would be last Sun-&#xD;
day when he wasn't there--but they were more punctual&#xD;
than- ever. It's quite a comfort-if there's anything I do&#xD;
hate to see, it's a troop of men and boys( outside the door&#xD;
when they ought to be in. What are you afraid he'll say&#xD;
to Sam, Faith ?"&#xD;
Faith's eyes were looking down. The question brought&#xD;
them up, and then her smile was as frank as her blushes&#xD;
had been. "I am    not afraid he'll say anything, Mrs.&#xD;
Somers."&#xD;
"I don't know why he should, my dear," said Mr. Somers.&#xD;
"We all like to use our eyes-you can't very well blame a&#xD;
boy."&#xD;
"0 Mr. Somers !" said his wife-with that air which a&#xD;
woman ,puts on when she says she believes, what she&#xD;
wouldn't for the world say if she believed, -.-" of course you&#xD;
think that! Don't I know how you broke your heart after&#xD;
a green veil when you were in college ? I don't think it's&#xD;

--or his future wife."&#xD;
"Well Mrs. Derrick, what shall I tell Julius ?" said Miss&#xD;
Harrison as she rose to go.&#xD;
"Tell him ?" said Mrs. Derrick enquiringly. "ge&#xD;
wouldn't care to hear anything about me, if you did tell&#xD;
him, Miss Sophy."&#xD;
"Well !-he'll have to come and talk to you himself"&#xD;
said Miss Harrison.  "Faith, stand up for the right."&#xD;
Faith went to the door with her and returned ushering&#xD;
in a new-comer, even th  Te of Farmer Davids.     g&#xD;
"Husband wanted m    o co   and see how Mr. Linden&#xD;
was," she said in meek ex nation of her appearance. "He&#xD;
would have come hisself, bu ie was forced to be in the&#xD;
field, and he said he wisht I'd come myself. How is hei&#xD;
ma'am ?.&#xD;
"I hope he's better,"-said Mrs. Derrick, giving her new&#xD;
visiter a kind reeption and a seat.  "le don't get strong&#xD;
very fast. How are you all at home, Mrs. Davids ?"&#xD;
"We're considerable comfortable, ma'am," said Mrs.&#xD;
Davids taking the chair 4n an unobtrusive spirit. "I am&#xD;
happy to have the occasion to make your acquaintance&#xD;
better. Husband would have come hisself, only he couldn't,&#xD;
Mr. Linden don't get strong ?"&#xD;
"Not very fast," said Mrs. Derrick. "I don't know just&#xD;
when the doctor '11 let him go to school again. I suppose&#xD;
you're anxious about Phil, Mrs. Davids. But all the boys&#xD;
have to be out, now."&#xD;
"Yes ma'am, we're anxious-and husband is anxious&#xD;
about Mr. Linden, and he sent me to know. But there is&#xD;
such a change in Phil, ma'am,"--she said turning to Mrs.&#xD;
Somers,-" such a change, you wouldn't believe ! he never&#xD;
would go to school before-not regular-not for nobody-'&#xD;
not for his father, nor for me; and it was mor'n my life&#xD;
was worth. My husband, he said it was my fault; but I&#xD;
don't know how 'twas! And now sir, he don't want a&#xD;
word spoke to him! he's off before it's time in the morning&#xD;
-and he learns too, for I catch him at it; and my hus-&#xD;
band don't think anything in the world is too good for Mr.&#xD;
Linden; nor of course, I s'pose, I don't. But however he's&#xD;
managed or overcome it, to make Phil draw in harness, I&#xD;

don't know, and husband says he don't. And ma'am, was&#xD;
pears good? or what does Mr. Linden like ?  If it's&#xD;
on the farm he'll get it."&#xD;
It would have taken more conversational skill than Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick possessed, to give a summary answer to all this;&#xD;
but her simplicity answered as well, after all.&#xD;
«I guess he'll like what you've been saying better than&#xD;
anything, Mrs. Davids; I'll tell him."&#xD;
"Do," said Mrs. Davids. "I wisht you would. Hus-&#xD;
band would have said it completer. He thinks ma'am,"&#xD;
(turning to Mrs. Somers again) "that Mr. Linden is a won-&#xD;
derful manI And I'm of the opinion lie's handsome."&#xD;
Faith had been sitting, quiet and demure, for some time&#xD;
past, hearing what was going on; but this last sentence&#xD;
drove her to the right about like lightning. She found&#xD;
something to do in another part of the room.&#xD;
"Did you ever hear anybody say he wasn't ?" said Mrs.&#xD;
Somers. "Mr. Somers, it's time we were going. Ah.-&#xD;
there's Squire Stoutenburgh! Faith-come here !"&#xD;
And Squire Stoutenburgh, appearing in the doorway&#xD;
like the worthy father of his stout son, bowed to the com-&#xD;
pany.&#xD;
"Well Mrs. Derrick-" he said,-"go'od day Mr. Somers&#xD;
.-and Mrs. Somers! I beg pardon-Well Miss Faith!&#xD;
I'm glad it is well, I'm sure. My dear, how do you do ?"&#xD;
"Why very well, sir !" said Faith.&#xD;
"Why so it is !" said Squire Stoutenburgh taking hold&#xD;
of both her hands and looking at her. "Sam said you&#xD;
were as pale as a ghost when he carried" you down to the&#xD;
spring-but 'Sam don't always see straight when he's ex-&#xD;
cited. You needn't be frightened if I kiss you, my dear-&#xD;
you know I always do, and always have-since you were a&#xD;
year old," said the Squire as he took his wonted privilege.&#xD;
Faith gravely submitted, not letting the Squire however&#xD;
get any further than her cheek; which ought to have con-&#xD;
tented him.&#xD;
"Sam was very good to me yesterday,.sir," she answered.&#xD;
"I think, Squire," said Mr. Somers, "your son was-a-.&#xD;
in luck, as we say. A fortunate chance ! What iost&#xD;
people would have thought no-a-disagreeable office."&#xD;
"Sam's a good boy-" said his father,-" a very godd&#xD;

boy-always was. He does crow a little over Dr. Harrison,&#xD;
I must say. But what shall we do with the doctor, M.&#xD;
Somers ?-what does he deserve for running away with our&#xD;
Pattaquasset roses and turning them into meadow lilies?&#xD;
Yes, yes, Miss Faith-you may look as pink as you please&#xD;
now-it won't help the matter. What shall we do with&#xD;
him, sir ? My dear," said Squire Stoutenburgh seating&#xD;
Faith by his side and dropping his voice, "you're growing&#xD;
wonderfully like your father !"&#xD;
A changed, sweet glance of Faith's eyes answered him&#xD;
"Yes !"-the Squire repeated meditatively and looking&#xD;
at her.-"Ah he was a fine man! 1 used to think he&#xD;
couldn't be better-but I s'pose he is now. My dear, you&#xD;
needn't wonder when I tell you that I thought more of your&#xD;
mother last night than I did of you. But you don't remem.&#xD;
ber all about that. Well-I shall go home and tell Mrs.&#xD;
Stoutenburgh that you're as pretty as a posie, and then she&#xD;
won't care what else is the matter," he said, getting up.&#xD;
again. "Mrs. Somers, I see the parson durstn't say a word&#xD;
about Dr. Harrison before you."&#xD;
"I-I declare I don't think Dr. Harrison is very much&#xD;
to be blamed, Squire," said the parson thus called upon.&#xD;
"And Mrs. Somers is so well able to speak for herself-..I&#xD;
have no doubt, Squire Stoutenburgh, if it wasn't for Mrs.&#xD;
Somers,--I dare say I might like to do as much as the doctor&#xD;
did, myself I"&#xD;
"Bless my life !" said Squire Stoutenburgh, "I can't stay&#xD;
to be a party to confidences of that sort !-I must go !-."&#xD;
and he departed, laughing and followed by the two others.&#xD;
But even as they went, Faith, who with her mother had&#xD;
accompanied them to the door, vas electrified somewhat&#xD;
doubtfully at the vision of Miss Deacon just within the&#xD;
gate. Miss Cecilia came forward, also with some doubt&#xD;
upon her spirit, to judge by her air. But Faith's greeting&#xD;
of her was so pleasant and kind, though she could not pre.&#xD;
vent its being grave, that the young lady evidently took&#xD;
heart. Being reassured, she sat and talked at leisure, and&#xD;
at length, using her eyes as well as her tongue; thus making&#xD;
herself mistress of all the truth she could get at, and of&#xD;
some more. She was thorough in her investigations as to&#xD;
all the drama of the last seven days, and all and each of the&#xD;
&#xD;
actors therein; and at the close of her visit declared that&#xD;
"Sam had been a great fool to go away, and that she had&#xD;
told him so before "; and departed at last with her head full&#xD;
of Dr. Harrison.&#xD;
But detentions were not over. Miss Bezac came before&#xD;
Miss Deacon was quit of the parlour; and before Miss&#xD;
Bezac had been two minutes there, other members of the&#xD;
Pattaquasset community came pouring in. Everybody&#xD;
must see Faith, hear particulars, discuss realities and possi-&#xD;
eilities of the accident, and know how Mr. Linden was&#xD;
getting along. The hours of the afternoon waned away;&#xD;
but people came as people went; and it was not till long&#xD;
shadows and slant sunbeams began to give note of supper&#xD;
time, that the influx lessened and the friends gathered, in&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick's parlour began to drop away without others&#xD;
stepping in to take their place.&#xD;
"Faith," said her mother when they were at last alone,&#xD;
"I can't bear this any longer ! I shall go crazy if I hear&#xD;
that story one other time to-night !"  And she put her&#xD;
arms round Faith, and leaned her head wearily on her&#xD;
shoulder. "I'll sit up to tea," she went on presently, "and&#xD;
then if the rest of the town comes, you'll have to see 'em-&#xD;
for I can't !"&#xD;
Faith gently put her into a chair and holding her in her&#xD;
arms stooped over her.  "Mother "-the words were as soft&#xD;
as the kisses which came between,-" you mustn't mind it&#xD;
so much.  Sit up to tea !  Why I have made some of the&#xD;
best muffins that ever were seen."&#xD;
"Child !" said her mother in .a low voice, "I felt this&#xD;
morning as if I had been as rear death as you had !"-and&#xD;
if the words needed any emphasis, they had it in the way&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick leaned her head against Faith and was silent.&#xD;
But not for long., She got up, and kissing Faith two or&#xD;
three times, said, "My pretty child !" in a tone that indeed&#xD;
told of possible heartbreak; and then half holding her,,&#xD;
half held by her, drew her on into the tea-room.&#xD;

CHlAPTIR XXVII.&#xD;
IT so happened that the first griddleful of muffins did not&#xD;
do credit to their raising--(or to their bringing ups&#xD;
elegant reader !)-therefore Mr. Linden's teatray waited for&#xD;
the second.  Of course the other tea waited too. Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick walked out into the kitchen to see what'was the&#xD;
matter with the griddle; Faith discovered that one spoon&#xD;
on the tray looked dull, and went to the spoonbasket to&#xD;
change it. Thus occupied, and giving little reprehensive&#xD;
glances at the spoons generally, and mental admonitions to&#xD;
Cindy, with the open closet door half screening her from&#xD;
the rest of the room, she was startled-not by the opening&#xD;
of another door, but by these words,---&#xD;
"Miss Faith, shall I carry this tray upstairs ?"&#xD;
To this day it is uncertain what sort of a spoon Faith&#xD;
brought back !-or indeed whether she brought any at all.&#xD;
There was one flash of gladness in her cheek and her eye,&#xD;
with the exclamation, "Mr. Linden !"-then she came from&#xD;
the closet just her old little self.&#xD;
"Are you well enough to be down stairs, sir ?"&#xD;
"In whose estimation, ma'am ?"&#xD;
"Because if you are, Mr. Liqden," she said with a face&#xD;
of laughing pleasure, "won't you please come into the&#xD;
other room ?"&#xD;
"I think not," he said, laughing a littteToo,-if the ex-&#xD;
ertion of coming down' had inade him pale, the pleasure&#xD;
partly concealed it.  "I will take a chair here, if you please.&#xD;
Am I alone, of all Pattaquasset, to be forbidden to pay my&#xD;
respects to you to-night? Miss Faith, how do you do ?"&#xD;
"I am very well. But Mr. Linden, if you will please&#xD;
come into the other room, there is an easy chair there.&#xD;
Please do! this room is cold, for the fire got down while we&#xD;
were seeing people."&#xD;
She led the way as she spoke, without waiting for another&#xD;
denial; pushed the table and a great chair of state, or of&#xD;
ease, in the sitting-room, into closer neighbourhood; and&#xD;
(332)/&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
renewed the brilliancy of the fire. Then lit up the lamp&#xD;
and cleared books away from the table; all done with quick&#xD;
alacrity.k&#xD;
"That will do almost as well as the couch, won't it ?"&#xD;
she said; and then repeated in gentler tones her question,&#xD;
"Are you well enough to be down, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"I don't know, Miss Faith!--I am well enough to want&#xD;
to be dowij. How can you let the charms of society divert&#xD;
your mind from your books for a whole afternoon?  Have&#xD;
you been so studious for the last few days only because yon&#xD;
had nothing else to do ?"&#xD;
She laughed at the question, and went off, leaving Mr.&#xD;
Linden in a region of comfort. More comfort came soon&#xD;
in the shape of the teatray, borne by Cindy; then Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick; and lastly Faith herself appeared-bearing a plate&#xD;
of the muffins, perfect this time, and delicate as they had&#xD;
need to be for a delicate&amp;amp; appetite. Mr. Liden was pres-&#xD;
ently served with one of these and a cup of smoking tea;&#xD;
and Faith thought, and her look half said it, that being&#xD;
down stairs would do him no harm.  Certainly the surprise&#xD;
and pleasure of such company to tea did Mrs. Derrick good,&#xD;
whoever else missed it; though it is presumable no one&#xD;
did. The pleasant sighing of the wind round the house&#xD;
and in the chimney (it sighed alone for that evening) the&#xD;
sparkling of the fire, the singing of the maple or hickory&#xD;
sticks, the comfortable atmosphere of tea and muffins dif-&#xD;
fused, like the firelight, all through the room; gave as fair&#xD;
an assemblage of creature comforts as need be wished; and&#xD;
the atmosphere of talk was as bright, and savoury, and glow-&#xD;
ing too, in its way; though the way was quiet. Mr. Linden&#xD;
amused himself (and Faith) by giving her little lessons in&#xD;
the way she would have to talk in those French "noonspells"&#xD;
she had in prospect: making Mrs. Derrick laugh with the&#xD;
queer sounding words and sentences, and keeping Faith&#xD;
i interested to that point, that.if he had not attended to her&#xD;
tea as well, she'would scarce have got any.&#xD;
"I shall not be hard upon you at first," he said smiling,--&#xD;
"when I see you sitting-in silent despair because you want&#xD;
something at my end of the table, I will help you out w th&#xD;
a 'que voulez-vous, mademoiselle ?' and perhaps within a&#xD;
'voulez-vous ?' this or that. But after a week or two, Miss&#xD;

Faith, if you go without any dinner, it will not move me.&#xD;
the least."&#xD;
Faith looked as if she would gladly forego her dinner to&#xD;
escape the French asking for it, and yet not quite so neither.&#xD;
But this ordeal was more terrible to her by far than all the&#xD;
rest; she could face them, indeed they had ceased to be&#xD;
anything but pleasure-or pleasure with a spice that en.&#xD;
hanced it; but at this she trembled. To the above speech,&#xD;
or threat,.-she simply answered,&#xD;
"I shall be so glad to see you come home to tea, Mr.&#xD;
Linden I"&#xD;
"And so glad to see me go away from dinner !"&#xD;
"I didn't say that."&#xD;
"You will-" said Mr. Linden,-" I can imagine you&#xD;
falling back in your chair and exclaiming, 'Ah, quand&#xD;
voulez-vous partir, monsieur !'-which of course will make&#xD;
it extremely difficult for me to remain a moment longer."&#xD;
"I don't think you can imagine me doing it," said Faith&#xD;
laughing.   I can't imagine, myself."&#xD;
"That proves nothing. Only don't ever say to me,&#xD;
'Monsieur! partez a instant !'-because-"&#xD;
"Because ,what, Mr. Linden ?" said Faith seriously.&#xD;
"Because we might disagree upon that point," he said&#xD;
with rather a demure ardh of his eyebrows. Faith's full&#xD;
silver rang out, softly.&#xD;
"You see !" she said. "It's beginning already. I don't&#xD;
know in the least what you are talking about 1"&#xD;
"No-you do not," was the laughing reply. "But Miss&#xD;
Faith, if I am kept at home long enough, and society keeps&#xD;
at home too, instead of coming between us and our&#xD;
exercises, those conversations will seem less terrible by the&#xD;
time. they begin. I should certainly get you a pocket dic-&#xD;
tionary, but I prefer to be that myself. How far can you&#xD;
ride on horseback at once ?"  (2&#xD;
"On horseback ?" said Faith, aas if those words had&#xD;
been also French, or an algebraical puzzle.&#xD;
"That was what I said."&#xD;
"I know that was what you said-I didn't know what&#xD;
you meant, Mr. Linden. I have never been really on horse-&#xD;
back but a few times in my life-then I rode a few miles--&#xD;
I don't know exactly how many." .&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.                  335&#xD;
I wonder people don't do it mor4'--said Mrs. Derrick.&#xD;
"When I was a girl that was the common way of getting&#xD;
about; and nobody ever got thrown, neither."&#xD;
"Wouldn't that be the pleasantest way of getting to&#xD;
Mattabeeset ?" said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
An illumination answered him first; then "Oh, yes.&#xD;
want you to see what is to be seen over there," he&#xD;
said,-"shall we go some day, if I get well enough before&#xD;
cold weather?"&#xD;
Faith's quiet words of agreeing to this proposal were&#xD;
declared to be a sham by her eyes, cheeks, lips and brow,&#xD;
every one of which was giving testimony after a different&#xD;
fashion.&#xD;
At this moment the door opened. It happened that&#xD;
Dr. Harrison had encountered Cinidy at the hall door,&#xD;
where she was either loitering to catch snatches of indoor&#xD;
conversation, or waiting to entrap Jem Waters. But there&#xD;
she was, and being asked for Mr. Linden replied that he&#xD;
was down stairs, and without more ceremony ushered the&#xD;
doctor in; and entering the whole view lay before him in&#xD;
its freshness. Mrs. Derrick, complacent and comfortable,&#xD;
sat behind the no-longer-wanted tea-tray, listening and&#xD;
playing with a spoon. Faith's face, though considering&#xD;
her unfinished muffin, was brilliant with rosy pleasure;&#xD;
while the fire which she had for some time forgotten to&#xD;
mend, lay in a state of powerful inaction, a mass of living&#xD;
coals and smoking brands. In the glow of that stood the&#xD;
easy chair, and therein Mr. Linden,-although with the air&#xD;
and attitude of one wanting both rest and strength, was&#xD;
considering with rather unbent lips no less a subject than&#xD;
-One and Somewhat!-further the doctor's eyes could&#xD;
not read. The precise direction of those other eyes, was&#xD;
shaded. The doctor came up and stood beside them.&#xD;
"Did I order you to stay up stairs?" he said in soft,&#xD;
measured syllables, without having spoken to anybody else.&#xD;
"Good evening, doctor !" said Mr. Linden offering his&#xD;
hand. "As I m      .eet you half way, please excuse me for&#xD;
keeping my seat."&#xD;
From that hand, the doctor passed to Faith's; which&#xD;
was taken and held, just enough to say al he wishes  to&#xD;
say; which, be it remarked in passing, was a good deal.&#xD;

"May I approach Mrs. Derrick ?" said he then, turning&#xD;
round to Mr. Linden, with a cool, funny, careless, yet good.&#xD;
humoured, doubt upon his face.&#xD;
"What is the present state of your nerves ?"&#xD;
"Depending upon your answer, of course !-which the&#xD;
ordinary rules of society forbid me to wait for.  Madam !_&#xD;
are you in sufficient charity with me to give me a cup of&#xD;
tea ?"&#xD;
"Yes, doctor-if the tea's good enough," said Mrs. Ier.&#xD;
rick with her usual quietness. "And if it isn't I'll have&#xD;
some more." So saying she got up and went towards the&#xD;
kitchen to call Cindy. The doctor skilfully intercepted this&#xD;
movement, placing himself in her way.&#xD;
"May I ask, where you arp going ?" he said with a sort&#xD;
of gentle kindliness he did nit always put on.&#xD;
"Why to get some tea that's fit to give you, doctor. I&#xD;
don't think this is."&#xD;
"Will you give me something else ?"&#xD;
"I'll give you that first," said Mrs. Derrick-" I'll see&#xD;
about the rest." And passing out into the kitchen she&#xD;
gave her orders about the teapot, and a quiet little injunc'&#xD;
tion to Faith to go in and sit down.&#xD;
"Mother, you're tired," said Faith. "Let me see about&#xD;
the tea !"&#xD;
"I guess I will!" said Mrs. Derrick.  "I'm not going to&#xD;
have the house stand up on one end just because Dr. Hiar.&#xD;
rison wants his tea. You go off, pretty child,-if you stay&#xD;
here he'll think you're baking muffins for him, and I don't&#xD;
choose he should."&#xD;
"Why I would do it, mother," said Faith. She went&#xD;
off, however, into the other room and sat down gravely,&#xD;
quite the 'other side of the fireplace from the tea-table.&#xD;
Dr. Harrison was standing on the rug with his back to&#xD;
the fire, and followed her with his eye.&#xD;
"How do you do ?". he said in a softened voice, stepping&#xD;
a step nearer to her. She looked up and gave him a&#xD;
frank and kind "very well"&#xD;
Was it altogether professional, the way in which he took&#xD;
up her hand and held it an instant ?&#xD;
" Cool, and quiet," he said. "It's all right. I didn't&#xD;
frighten you out of your wits yesterday in"&#xD;
&#xD;
The "no, sir," was in a different tone.&#xD;
"Do you suppose," he said, "that your mother will ever&#xD;
bear the sight of me again ?"&#xD;
"Why I hope so, sir," said Faith smiling.&#xD;
"I don't know !" he said. "I wonder if I have been so&#xD;
much more wicked than I knew of? I don't think I have.&#xD;
I couldn't have punished myself any more."&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick came in, followed by teapot and muffins,&#xD;
and having with her usual polite-ness requested, the doctor&#xD;
to take a seat at the table, she proceeded to pour him out&#xD;
a cup of tea, nor even stinted him in sugar.&#xD;
if I stay at home according to your orers," said Mr.&#xD;
Linden, "I shall have all the trustees after me."&#xD;
"You aren't just the person they ought to be after,"&#xD;
said the doctor. "Mrs. Derrick, I don't know why we&#xD;
never hare anything at our house so good as this."  The&#xD;
doctor w s discussing a buttered muffin with satisfaction&#xD;
that was evidently unfeigned.&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick knew why-but she wouldn't tell him,&#xD;
though exulting in her own knowledge. A low knock at&#xD;
the parlour door announced Reube Taylor.&#xD;
"I beg your pardon, Mrs. Derri -" he said,-"but I&#xD;
rent-&#xD;
"I am here, Reuben," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
The boy stayed not for more compliments then, but pass-&#xD;
ing the ladies and the doctor with a collective bow, and&#xD;
"good evening, Miss Faith," went round with a quick step&#xD;
and a glad face to Mr. Linden. And kneeling down by&#xD;
him, with one hand on his shoulder, gave him the post&#xD;
despatches,. and asked and answered questions not very&#xD;
loud but very earnestly. That was a phasis of Reuben&#xD;
Dr. Harrison had not seen before. He took good and&#xD;
broad note of it, though nothing interrupted the doctor's&#xD;
muffin-or muffins, for they were plural. Neither did he&#xD;
interrupt anything that was going on.&#xD;
"Are you better, sir? are you really well enough to be&#xD;
down stairs ?"-Dr. Harrison would hardly have known&#xD;
the voice. And the answering tone was of the gentlest&#xD;
and kindest, though the words failed to reach the doctor's&#xD;
ears. Some directions, or commissions, apparently, Mr.&#xD;
Linden gave for a few minutes, and then Reubel rose to&#xD;

his feet with a long breath that spoke a mind very madh&#xD;
relieved. He paused for a moment on his way out, oppN&#xD;
site Faith, as if he wanted a word in that quarter; but&#xD;
perhaps the doctor's presence forbade, for all the congratu,&#xD;
lation that Reuben gave her was in his face and bow,&#xD;
That did not satisfy Faith if it did him. She jumped up&#xD;
and gave him her hand, almost affectionately.&#xD;
"You see I am safe and well, Reuben."&#xD;
"I am so thankful, Miss Faith !"  And the words said&#xD;
not half.&#xD;
The doctor had finished his muffins and was standing&#xD;
before the fire again. "Have you found out yet, my man,?&#xD;
he said in a somewhat amused voice,-." whose friend you&#xD;
are ?"&#xD;
The words jarred-and the colour on Reuben's face was&#xD;
of a different tint from that which had answered Faith,&#xD;
It was with his usual reserved manner, though nothing&#xD;
could be more -civil, that he said, "No sir-no more than I&#xD;
knew before." But the respect was from Reuben as a boy&#xD;
to Dr. Harrison as a man. Faith's eye glanced from one&#xD;
to the other, and then she said, "What .do you mean, Dr.&#xD;
Harrison ?"&#xD;
"Only a play of words," said the doctor lightly. "This&#xD;
young fellow is very cautious of making professions-.as I&#xD;
have found."&#xD;
"He has no need, sir,".said Faith. She quitted as she&#xD;
spoke, the boy's hand which she had held until then, and&#xD;
came back to her seat. The words were spoken quietly&#xD;
enough and with as gentle a face, and yet dith somewhat&#xD;
in the manner of both that met and fully answered all the&#xD;
bearing of the doctor's.&#xD;
"You need not wait, Reuben," said his teacher-..." I shall&#xD;
see you again by and by."&#xD;
"Who is that ?" said the doctor as Reuben went out.&#xD;
"One of my body-guard," said Mr. Linden, with lips&#xD;
not yet at rest from their amused look.&#xD;
"Are you waited upon by a Fehm-gericht? or may the&#xD;
members be known by the uninitiated?"'&#xD;
"I beg pardon !" said Mr. Linden,-" but as you seemed&#xD;
to know him, and as you really did know his name a week&#xD;
ago-That is Reuben Taylor, Dr. Harrisog."&#xD;
&#xD;
f  "So do I beg pardon ! His name I do know, of course-.&#xD;
I have had occasion; but the essence of my enquiry&#xD;
remains in its integrity. Him I do not know. Where&#xD;
and to whom does he belong?"&#xD;
"le is one of those of whom we.spoke this morning,"&#xD;
said Mr. Linden.  "True- servant of God is his title-to&#xD;
Him does Reuben belong. His home here is a little hut on&#xD;
the outskirts of Pattaquasset,-his father a poor fisherman."&#xD;
There was a minute's silence, all round.&#xD;
"May I ask for a little nlightening, Miss Derrick"?"&#xD;
said the doctor. "What d~ you mean, if you will be so&#xD;
good as to let me know,-by a person who 'does not need'&#xD;
to make professions."&#xD;
Faith hesitated.&#xD;
"Will you please say first, Dr. Harrison, justwhat you&#xD;
mean by 'professions*?'" she said somewhat timidly.&#xD;
"I shall shelter myself under your meaning," said he&#xD;
looking at her. "Fact is, I am not good at definitions-I&#xD;
4 don't half the time know what I'm saying myself."&#xD;
Faith cast an involuntary glance for help towards Mr.&#xD;
Linden; but getting none she came back to the doctor&#xD;
and the question, blushing a good deal.&#xD;
"I think," she said, "professions are telling people what&#xD;
you wish them to believe of you."&#xD;
SThe doctor looked comical, also threw a glance in the&#xD;
direction of Mr. Linden, but put his next question seriously.&#xD;
"Why do you say this Reuben Taylor does not need to&#xD;
make professions? according to this definition.&#xD;
"Because those who know him know what he is, with-&#xD;
out them."&#xD;
"But do you mean that there ino use in making pro-&#xD;
fessions?  How are you to know what a man is ?"&#xD;
"Unless he tells you ?" said Faith smiling.&#xD;
The doctor stood,.half smiling; evidently revolving more&#xD;
thoughts than of one kind. With a face from which every&#xD;
shadow was banished he suddenly took a seat by Mrs. Der-&#xD;
rick.&#xD;
"Do you know," he said with gentle pleasantness of&#xD;
manner and expression, "how much better man I should&#xD;
be if I should -come here and get only one definition a day&#xD;

"What one has she given you now ?" said Mrs. Derrick,&#xD;
whose mind evidently stood in abeyance upon this speech.&#xD;
"One you didn't hear, ma'am. It was a definition of&#xD;
me, to myself. It isn't the first," said the doctor gravely,&#xD;
"Mrs. Derrick, are you friends with me ?"&#xD;
"As much as I ever was," said Mrs. Derrick, smilingly,&#xD;
"I always thought you wanted putting in order.".&#xD;
"How did you know that ?"&#xD;
"Why, because you were out of order," said Mrs. Der.&#xD;
rick, knitting away. The doctor uttered the lowest of&#xD;
whistles and looked down at his boot.&#xD;
"It's because of that unlucky dog !" he muttered. "Lin.&#xD;
den-" (glancing up from under his eyebrows) "when I&#xD;
was  a boy, I set my dog on Miss Faith's cat."&#xD;
"Felt yourself called upon to uphold natural antipa-&#xD;
thies-"&#xD;
"Miss Faith, have you a cat now ?" said the doctor&#xD;
looking over to her.&#xD;
"No, sir."&#xD;
"And I have no dog 1" said the doctor. "I have only&#xD;
horses. If I could manage to do without animals alto,&#xD;
gether,-Mrs. Derrick, have you forgiven me ?" This last&#xD;
was in a changed tone.&#xD;
"I don't want to talk about it, doctor," said Mrs. Der-&#xD;
rick very soberly.&#xD;
"About forgiving me ?" he said as soberly.&#xD;
"And I don't mean to."&#xD;
"Nor I," said the doctor quietly; but you are going to&#xD;
inflict more punishment on me than I deserve."&#xD;
"What am I going to do ?" said Mrs. Derrick. "If&#xD;
you know, I don't."&#xD;
"Refuse to give me your hand, perhaps."&#xD;
"I never did that to anybody, yet," she said pleasantly.&#xD;
"Then you must let me do as we do in another country."&#xD;
He bent his face to her hand as he spoke, and kissed it.&#xD;
There was no mockery in the action. Done by some peo-&#xD;
ple it would have been ridiculous. By Dr. Harrison, in&#xD;
the circumstances, it was in the highest degree graceful.&#xD;
It spoke sympathy, penitence, respect, manly confession,&#xD;
and submission, too simply not to be what it certainly was&#xD;
in some measure, a true expression of feeling. Mrs. Der-&#xD;
&#xD;
rick on .her part looked amused,.-her old recollections of&#xD;
the boy constantly tinged her impressions of the man; and&#xD;
perhaps not without reason.&#xD;
"You're as like yourself askever you can be, doctor 1"&#xD;
she said, smiling at him.  "How you used to try to get&#xD;
round me ."&#xD;
"I don't remember 1" said the doctor.. "I am sure I&#xD;
never succeeded, Mrs. Derrick ?"&#xD;
"I'm afraid you did, sometimes," she said, shaking her&#xD;
head. -.He smiled a little, and turned the other way.&#xD;
"Linden, I've been considering the German question."&#xD;
"Will it please you to state the result ?"&#xD;
"This 1" said the doctor.  "I have come to the conclu&#xD;
sion,-that in order to be One and Somewhat, it is neces-&#xD;
sary to begin by being Nought and All-- Thus ranging&#xD;
myself in security on both sides of a great abyss of meta-&#xD;
physics. What do you think ?  Unphilosophical ?&#xD;
"Unsafe-" said Mr. Linden. "And impossible."&#xD;
"Hum ph ?"--said the doctor.  "Nothing is impossible&#xD;
in metaphysics-because- you may be on both sides of an&#xD;
abyss, and in the bottom of it !-at once -and without&#xD;
knowing where you are.  The angel that rode Milton's&#xD;
sunbeam, you know, was no time at all going from heaven&#xD;
to earth; and I suppose he went the other way as quick."&#xD;
"I don't see the abyss'in that case," said Mr. Linden,-&#xD;
"but&#xD;
'Uriel to his charge&#xD;
Returned on that bright beam'-&#xD;
so probably he did."&#xD;
"Yes"-said the doctor.-"And my meaning skippe the&#xD;
abyss,-also on a sunbeam. It referred to the unsulstan-&#xD;
tial means of travelling in use among metaphysicians."&#xD;
"And among angels."&#xD;
"That reminds me," said the doctor. And quitting his&#xD;
stand on the rug, which he had taken again, he went over&#xD;
to Faith and sat down by her.&#xD;
"Is the Nightingale flourishing on her rose-bush to-&#xD;
day ?"&#xD;
"What, sir ?" said Faith, her eyes opening at him a&#xD;
"I beg pardon !" said the doctor. "I have been living&#xD;

&#xD;
in a part of the world, Miss Derrick, where it is the fash,&#xD;
ion to call things not by their right names. I have got -&#xD;
foolish habit of it. Do you feel quite recovered ?"&#xD;
"Quite. I'm a little tired to-night, perhaps."&#xD;
"I see you are, and I'll not detain you. Mrs. Clusters&#xD;
wants to see you again." - He had dropped all banter, and&#xD;
was speaking to her quietly, respectfully, kindly, as he&#xD;
should speak; in a lowered tone, but not so low as to be&#xD;
unheard by others than her.&#xD;
"I will try to see her again soon---I will try to go very&#xD;
soon," she answered.&#xD;
"Would you be afraid to go with my father's old stand.&#xD;
bys ?-they are safe !"-&#xD;
"I cannot do that, Dr. Harrison-but I will try to see&#xD;
her soon."&#xD;
"Can you go without riding ?"&#xD;
"No," she said smiling; "but I must find some other&#xD;
way."&#xD;
"I won't press that point," said the doctor. "I can't&#xD;
blame you.. I must bear that. But-I want for my own&#xD;
sake to have the honour of a little talk with you-I want&#xD;
to explain to you one or two things. Shall you be at lei.&#xD;
sure to-morrow afternoon ?"&#xD;
"I am hardly at leisure any time, Dr. Harrison. I do&#xD;
not suppose I shall be particularly busy then."&#xD;
"Then will you take that time for a walk ?"&#xD;
Faith hesitated. "I have very little time, sir."&#xD;
"But you take time to go out ?"&#xD;
"Not much.'&#xD;
"I will not ask much. A little will do; and so much&#xD;
you owe to skyey influences.  You will not refuse me&#xD;
that ?"&#xD;
"I will go, Dr. Harrison," Faith answered after an in-&#xD;
stant a little soberly. He rose up then; proposed to&#xD;
attend upon Mr. Linden, and they went up stairs to-&#xD;
gether.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVIII.&#xD;
AITI was half ready to wish the next day might be&#xD;
rainy; but it rose fair and bright. She must go to&#xD;
walk, probably; and visiters might come. The only thing&#xD;
to be done was to despatch her ordinary duties as quick as&#xD;
possible, prepare her French exercise, and go to her teacher&#xD;
early. Which she did.&#xD;
She came in with a face as bright as the day, although"&#xD;
little less ready to look in everybody's eyes. There were&#xD;
enough things ready for her. Lessons were pressed rather&#xD;
more steadily than usual, perhaps because they had been&#xD;
neglected a little for the last two days-or hindered; and&#xD;
it was not till one book and another had done its work, till&#xD;
the exercise was copied and various figure puzzles disposed&#xD;
of, that Mr. Linden told her he thought a talking exercise&#xD;
ought to come next,-if she had one ready he should like&#xD;
to have the benefit of it.&#xD;
"You are tired, Mr. Linden !" said Faith quickly.&#xD;
"You may begin by giving me the grounds of that con-&#xD;
clusion."&#xD;
'   "I don't know," she said half laughing,-"I don't see it;&#xD;
but that don't make -e know. I was afraid you were tired&#xD;
with this work."&#xD;
"Very unsafe, Mis Faith, to build up such a superstruc-&#xD;
ture upon grounds that you neither see nor k ow. I was&#xD;
immediately beginning to question the style of ay own ex-&#xD;
planations this morning."&#xD;
"Why, sir?"&#xD;
"If I seem tired, said explanations may have seemed-&#xD;
tiresome."&#xD;
She looked silently, with a smile, as if questioning the&#xD;
possibility of h s thinking so ; and her answer did not go&#xD;
to that point.&#xD;
"You didn't seem tired, Mr. Linden-..I had no reason&#xD;
for thinking so, I suppose. I was onlyrafraid. I was&#xD;
going to ask you what Dr. Harrison meant last night by&#xD;

the angel riding upon a sunbeam ?   I s    ou lnew what&#xD;
he meant.'&#xD;
Mr. Linden got, up and went for a book-then can&#xD;
back to his couch again.&#xD;
"Precisely what Dr. Harrison meant, Miss Faith, I&#xD;
should not like to say. What he referred, to, was a part&#xD;
of Paradise Lost, where the angels set to guard the earth&#xD;
have a messenger.&#xD;
"' Thither came Uriel, gliding through the even&#xD;
On a sunbeam, swift as a shooting star.'&#xD;
"Who is Uriel ? an angel?"&#xD;
"Yes. He is called,&#xD;
"'The archangel Uriel, one of the seven&#xD;
Who in God's presence, nearest to his throne,&#xD;
Stand ready at his command, and are his eyes.&#xD;
That run through all the heavens, or down to the earth,&#xD;
Bear his swift errands over moist and dry,&#xD;
O'er sea and land."'&#xD;
Faith listened, idently with a pleased ear.&#xD;
But I suppos    the angel could come as well without&#xD;
the sunbeam as wit it?"&#xD;
"I suppose so !" he said smiling. "In my belief, angels&#xD;
go where the sunbeams do not. But Milton chose to name&#xD;
fUriel as the special regent of the sun, and so passing to and&#xD;
fro on its rays."&#xD;
"What do you mean by 'regent,' Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"A regent-is one appointed to rule in place of tlie king."&#xD;
"But that don't seem to me true, Mr. Linden,"'said&#xD;
Faith after a little meditation.;&#xD;
"What, and why ?"&#xD;
Faith blushed at finding herself 'in for it,' but went on.&#xD;
"I don't suppose the sun wants anybody to rule it or to&#xD;
take care of it, under its Maker ?"&#xD;
"Yet it may please him to have guardian spirits there as&#xD;
well as here,-about that we know not. In the Revela-&#xD;
tion, you know, an angel is spoken of as 'standing in the&#xD;
sun,' and from that Milton took his idea. Part of the de-&#xD;
scription is very beautiful, at least ;.--.&#xD;
&#xD;
" So spake the false dissembler unperceived;&#xD;
For neither man nor angel can discern&#xD;
Hypocrisy, the only evil that walks ,-&#xD;
invisible, except to God alone,&#xD;
By his permissive will, through heaven and earth.&#xD;
And oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps&#xD;
At wisdom's gate, and to simplicity&#xD;
Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill,&#xD;
Where no ill seems: which now for once beguiled&#xD;
Uriel, though regent of the sun,*and held&#xD;
The sharpest sighted spirit of all in heaven.'&#xD;
"Who is the person spoken of in the first line, Mr.&#xD;
Linden ?"&#xD;
"Satan-applying to Uriel for guidance to the new created&#xD;
earth and its inhabitants, on the same plea that Herod&#xD;
presented to the wise men."&#xD;
"But that's a story ?" said Faith.&#xD;
 "Yes. The Bible only tells the work done by him after&#xD;
he got here."&#xD;
"Mr. Linden, will you read that over once more for me."&#xD;
She listened with a face of absorbed intentness while it&#xD;
was read; then looked away from the book with an.uncon-&#xD;
scious, but very audible sigh.&#xD;
"Well ?" Mr. Linden said, skiing as he looked at her.&#xD;
"I like .it very much !" was Faith's answer.&#xD;
"Is that what mad' you sigh ?"1&#xD;
"Sigh!" she said starting a little and colouring.  No,&#xD;
-I didn't mean to sigh."&#xD;
"The fact is more than the intention. Whence came&#xD;
that ?"&#xD;
"It was only-Please don't ask me, Mr. Linden. I can't&#xD;
tell you."&#xD;
He made no answer to that, but turning over the leaves&#xD;
read to her here and there without much comment,-then&#xD;
asked her if she was tired of hearing about angels.&#xD;
"I think I should never be tired !" said Faith. 4"1But&#xD;
you must be, Mr. Linden. Please," she said putting her&#xD;
hand gently on the book,-"don't read for me any more.&#xD;
Is all the look like that ?"&#xD;
"Not quite all-I have given you some bits that I par-&#xD;
ticularly like, but there is much more. You need not be&#xD;
uneasy about my being tired," he said smiling; "if I were,&#xD;

by your own shewing I can have rest. However, Mi&#xD;
Faith-lessons being the order of the day-.wil you read&#xD;
French to me ?"&#xD;
In her reading, Faith came ,to the description of the&#xD;
philosopher's perplexity in finding that the birds would not&#xD;
pick up the crumbs he threw to them on the roof as usual,&#xD;
He concluded the feathered things were not more reason.&#xD;
able than mankind, and had taken fright for nothing.&#xD;
"J'allais fermer ma fenetre sur cette reflection, 'quand&#xD;
j'apergois tout A coup, dans l'espace lumineux qui s'etend&#xD;
a droite, l'ombre de deux oreilles qui se dressent, puis une&#xD;
griffe qui s'avance, puis la tete d'un chat tigre qui se motitre&#xD;
a l'angle de la gouttiere. Le drole stait h en ambuscade&#xD;
esperant que les aniettes lui ameneraient-du gibier.&#xD;
"Et moi qui accusais la couardise de mes h6tes! J'etais&#xD;
sir qu'aucun danger ne les mena9ait ! je croyais avoir bien&#xD;
regarded partout! je n'avais oublie que le coin derriere moil!&#xD;
"Dans la vie comme sur les toits, que de malheurs arrivent&#xD;
pour avoir oublie un seul coin-!"&#xD;
Faith closed the book then, very much amused with the&#xD;
philosopher's "chat tigre&amp;amp;"&#xD;
"But often one can't see round the corner," she re-&#xD;
marked.&#xD;
A little gesture of lips and brow, half asserted that if&#xD;
one could not, one could: but Mr. Linden only said,,&#xD;
"Most true ! Miss Faith. Nevertheless, the knowledge&#xD;
that there are corners is not to be despised."&#xD;
"I don't know. I shouldn't like to live always in fear&#xD;
of seeing the shadow, of a cat's ears come in."'&#xD;
"Have you quite outgrown the love of cats ?" said'Mr.&#xD;
Linden smiling.&#xD;
"No, but I was talking of the fear of corners," she said&#xD;
with an answering smile. "I don't think I want to re-&#xD;
member the corners, Mr. Linden."&#xD;
"I don't think I want you should. Philosophers and birds,&#xD;
you know, go through the world on different principles."&#xD;
She laughed a little at that, gave the hearth a parting&#xD;
brush, and went off to dinner.&#xD;
Business claimed its place after dinner, business of a&#xD;
less pleasant kind, quite up to the time when Faith must&#xD;
put on her bonnet to walk with Dr. Harrison.&#xD;
&#xD;
Faith had no great mind to the walk, but she couldn't&#xD;
help finding it pleasant. The open air was very sweet and&#xD;
bracing; the exercise was inspiriting, and the threatened&#xD;
talk went well with both. There was nothing whatever&#xD;
formidable about it; the words and thoughts seemed to&#xD;
play, like the sunlight, on anythin  t came in their way.&#xD;
Dr. Harrison knew how to make a    or a talk pleasant,&#xD;
even to Faith, it seemed. What     e had at any time&#xD;
seen in him that she did not like, was out of sight; plea-&#xD;
sant, gentle, intelligent, grave, he was constantly supplying&#xD;
ear and mind with words and things that were worth the&#xD;
having. Probably he had discovered her eager thirst for&#xD;
knowledge; for he furnished'her daintily with bits of many&#xD;
a kind, from his own stores which were large. She did&#xD;
not know there was any design in this; she knew only that&#xD;
the steps were taken very easily in that walk. So pleasant&#xD;
it was that Faith was in no haste to turn, in no mood to&#xD;
quicken her pace. But something else was on her mind,-&#xD;
and must come out.&#xD;
"Dr. Harrison,"-she said when they were in a quiet&#xD;
part oufthe way, with nobody near, "may I speak to you&#xD;
about something ?-that perhaps you won't like ?"&#xD;
"You can speak of nothing I should not like-to hear,"&#xD;
he said with gentle assurance.&#xD;
"Dr. Harrison-" said Faith, speaking as if the recollec-&#xD;
tion touched her,-" when you and I were thrown out in&#xD;
that meadow the other day and came so near losing our&#xD;
lives-if the almost had been quite, if we had both been&#xD;
killed,--I should have been safe and well, I believe.--How&#xD;
would it have been with you ?"&#xD;
Dr. Harrison looked at her.&#xD;
"If I had gone in your company," he said, "I think it&#xD;
would hardly have been, ill with me."&#xD;
"Do you know so little as that ?"-she said in such a&#xD;
tone of sorrow and pity as might have suited one of the&#xD;
'ministering spirits' she had been likened to.&#xD;
"I don't think I am as good as you are," the doctor said&#xD;
with a face not unmoved.&#xD;
"Good !" said Faith. "What do you mean by goodness,&#xD;
Dr. Harrison ?"&#xD;
"I shall have the worst of it if I try to go into defii&#xD;

tions again," he said smiling. "I think you will find wha&#xD;
Imean, in consulting your own thoughts."&#xD;
"Goodness ?" said Faith again. "Do you remember the&#xD;
silver scale-armour of that Lepisma, Dr. Harrison? To&#xD;
is perfection. That is what God means by goodness-..not&#xD;
the outside things    very eye, or your own, can see;&#xD;

of your heart will     ch looking at and be found fault-&#xD;
less! Less than that, God will not take from you, if you&#xD;
are going to heaven by your own goodness."&#xD;
He looked at her. They had changed sides; and as&#xD;
fearless now as he, she was the speaker, and he had little&#xD;
to say.&#xD;
"I don't know much about these things, Miss Faith,"he&#xD;
answered soberly.&#xD;
"I don't know much, Dr. Harrison," she said humbly,&#xD;
"But think what you were near the other day."&#xD;
"I ton't know !"-said he, as if making a clean breast&#xD;
of it. She paused.&#xD;
"Dr. Harrison, will a wise man leave such a matter in&#xD;
uncertainty ?"&#xD;
"I am not wise," said he. "I am ignorant-in this."&#xD;
"You know you need not remain so."&#xD;
"That is not so certain ! I have seen so much--of what&#xD;
you have seen so little, my dear Miss Derrick, that you can&#xD;
scarce understand how light the weight of most people's&#xD;
testimony is to me."-                         '&#xD;
"But there is the testimony of one higher," said Faith.&#xD;
"There is God's own word ?"&#xD;
"I don't know it."&#xD;
"Won't you know it, sir ?"&#xD;
"I will do anything you ask me in that voice," he said&#xD;
smiling at her. "But after all one reads people and&#xD;
people's professions, Miss Faith;-and they make the first&#xD;
impression."&#xD;
"I dare say it is often not true,"-said Faith sadly.&#xD;
"You are true," said he; "and you may say to me what&#xD;
you will, on this subject or any other, and I will believe it."&#xD;
They walked a little distance in silence.     -&#xD;
"What are you thinking of?" said the-doctor in a very 1&#xD;
gentle accent of enquiry-.i&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am sorry--very sorry for you, Dr. Harrison."&#xD;
"Why ?" said he taking her hand.&#xD;
"Because it seems to me you are not caring in earnest&#xD;
about this matter."&#xD;
He kissed the hand, without asking permission. But it&#xD;
was done with a grateful warm expression of feeling.&#xD;
"I will do whatever you tell me to do !" he said.&#xD;
How Faith wished she could send him to another ad-&#xD;
viser ! But that she could not.&#xD;
"Tell me," he repeated. "I will do it." The look and&#xD;
tone were earnest, moved, and warm;. she had hardly seen&#xD;
the like in Dr. Harrison before.&#xD;
"Then, Dr. Harrison, I wish you would read the Bible,&#xD;
with the determination to do what you find there you ought."&#xD;
"I will," he said smiling. "And if I. get into difficulty&#xD;
you must help me."&#xD;
The rest of the way was extremely pleasant, after that;-&#xD;
only it seemed to Faith that they met all the world ! First&#xD;
there was Cecilia Deacon, whose eyes took good note, she&#xD;
thought, of both the walkers from head to foot. Then they&#xD;
met at intervals every one of Faith's Sunday school scholars;&#xD;
for every one of whom she had a glad greeting and word&#xD;
which she must stop for, somewhat to the doctor's amused&#xD;
edification. Miss Bezac happened, of all people, to be&#xD;
going up street when they were going down; and her eyes&#xD;
looked' rather with some wistful gravity upon the pair, for&#xD;
all her pleasant nods to both. Then Mrs. Somers.&#xD;
"Well I think you are Faith!"-was her brisk remark,-.&#xD;
"or faithless-which is it ? Julius, I heard a remarkable&#xD;
story about you yesterday."&#xD;
"Aunt Ellen-I like to hear remarkable stories. Espe-&#xD;
cily about anything remarkable."&#xD;
"Well this isn't one of that sort," said Mrs. Somers.&#xD;
"I am sure you said-However, let's have it, of any&#xD;
sort."&#xD;
"I heard you had your pocket picked of a good oppor-&#xD;
tunity," said Mrs. Somers. "Does Mr. Linden expect to&#xD;
be out next week, Faith ?"&#xD;
"I believe Dr. Harrison will not let him, Mrs. Somers."&#xD;
A little unverbalized sound answered that, and Mrs.&#xD;

Somers said good evening and walked on. Faith thought&#xD;
that was the end, as they were near her own door. But&#xD;
Dr. Harrison followed her in; and entering the sitting-,&#xD;
room, Faith found that her meetings were not over. There&#xD;
was no 'less a person-than Mrs. Stoutenburgh, and there&#xD;
also, regaling her eyes and ears, were Mrs. Derrick and&#xD;
"    Mr. Linden.&#xD;
Mrs. Stoutenburgh was a fair, pretty, curly-haired woman,&#xD;
a good deal younger than the Squire, intensely devoted to&#xD;
her own family, and very partial to Mr. Linden-whom she&#xD;
had taken under her wing (figuratively) from his first coming&#xD;
to Pattaquasset. The first sound Faith heard as she&#xD;
opened the door was Mrs. Stoutenburgh's merry laugh at&#xD;
some remark of his-then the lady jumped up and cane&#xD;
towards her.&#xD;
"1My dear Faith, how do you do ?-Dr. Harrison-.I half&#xD;
said I would never speak to you again! Faith, how can&#xD;
you trust yourself with him for one minute ?"&#xD;
"Mrs. Stoutenburgh," said the doctor,-" I half thought&#xD;
I would shoot myself!"              .&#xD;
"I guess that's as near as you'll come to it, on purpose,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Stoutenburgh. "You needn't think I shall forget&#xD;
it-whenever I want Faith to come and see me I shall tell&#xD;
Mr. Linden to bring her. He's safe-or supposed to be,"&#xD;
she added laughingly.,&#xD;
"I hope that's as near to it as I shall ever come on pur-&#xD;
pose, or otherwise, Mrs.' Stoutenburgh 1" said the doctor,&#xD;
"I think you ,should judge me safer than Mr. Linden,-as&#xD;
appearances, go."&#xD;
"Squire Deacon used to tell very hard stories of him&#xD;
when, he first came," said the lady-" and I have heard a&#xD;
report or two since. I do love to talk to him about it --&#xD;
he always looks so grave, I think he likes it."&#xD;
The laugh was-mutual, whether the delight was o0 no.&#xD;
"Who is Squire Deacon ?" said the doctor. "I should&#xD;
like to make his acquaintance."&#xD;
Faith took off her bonnet, and then pulled off her gloves,&#xD;
deliberately, and bestowed them on the table.&#xD;
"0 he's a Pattaquasseter," said Mrs. Stoutenburgh-&#xD;
"haven't you seen his sister?  She admires you-more than&#xD;
I think she need," she added mischievously. "'But the&#xD;
&#xD;
Squire's been away for awhile,--he just got home this after-&#xD;
noon."&#xD;
Faith had recourse to the fire. The doctor came round,&#xD;
took the tongs from her and did the work; after which he&#xD;
took asomewhat succinct leave of the assembly.&#xD;
"By the way, Linden," lie said pausing by his chair a&#xD;
moment,-" I expect to be in Quilipeak for a few days-.I&#xD;
am very sorry, but I must. You won't want me, I think.&#xD;
Limbre can do all that is necessary. I shall see you Mon-&#xD;
day or Tuesday again."&#xD;
"Doctor !" said Mrs. Stoutenburgh-" I want you to take&#xD;
me home. Mr. Stoutenburgh always makes such a fuss if&#xD;
I'm out after dark and don't bring anybody home to-tea,&#xD;
that I never dare do it."&#xD;
"Will you trust yourself with me, Mrs. Stoutenburgh ?"&#xD;
said the doctor standing in comical doubt.&#xD;
"Just'wait a minute," said Mrs. Stoutenburgh, as she&#xD;
went round with her pretty, free, womanly manner, and -laid&#xD;
her hand on Mr. Linden's forehead and hands, just as if he&#xD;
had been one of her own boys. "I tell you what-I 'don't&#xD;
think you cure him up half fast enough among you. If I&#xD;
had him up at my house I'd take better care of him."&#xD;
"No, Mrs. Stoutenburgh, even you could not do that," he&#xD;
said looking up at her. She stood still a moment.&#xD;
"You shouldn't look at me so," she said,-" I shall go&#xD;
home and feel real bad for all the nonsense I've been talking.&#xD;
You know," she added, with the mischievous look coming&#xD;
back, "I never did believe one word of it-except--." and&#xD;
the sentence was finished softly. "Now I'm ready, doctor--&#xD;
0 Faith, I had a message for you, but Mr. Linden will tell&#xD;
you. Good-bye. No, doctor-I'm, not going to trust&#xD;
myself with you,-you're going, to trust yourself with&#xD;
me."&#xD;
Dr. Harrison was for once quiet, and went off without a&#xD;
repartee.&#xD;
Other eyes looked with a different anxiety at Mr. Linden&#xD;
then, and another voice, more grave as well as more timid,&#xD;
asked, at his side, "Are you not so well to-night, Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den?"&#xD;
Hie smiled, and gave' her his hand by way of answer,&#xD;
before he spoke.&#xD;

"I think I am, Miss Faith--you know Mrs. Stoutenburgh&#xD;
has not seen me before since I was.quite well."&#xD;
She brought both hands to test the feeling of his, for an&#xD;
instant, without speaking.&#xD;
"Mr. Linden, I heard what Dr. Harrison said.-.-Don't&#xD;
you think I can do instead of Dr. Limbre ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Miss Faith-if you will be so good," he answered&#xD;
without hesitation and with the simplest tone and manner.&#xD;
Her brow lightened immediately ; and happy and quiet as&#xD;
usual, and that was very happy, she began to make her&#xD;
preparations for tea, clearing the table and rolling it to its&#xD;
last night's position. In which last operation she had as-&#xD;
sistance. Then she went off for her tea-and the lamp&#xD;
and the fire-light shone again presently on the pleasant&#xD;
scene of last night.&#xD;
"Don't you want to hear your message, Miss Faith"&#xD;
Mr. Linden said.&#xD;
KtYes, but I wasn't in a hurry, Mr. Linden. I supposed&#xD;
it would come."&#xD;
"It is in three parts. The first is nothing new; being&#xD;
merely that the birthday of the young heirs of the house of&#xD;
Stoutenburgh occurs on the 29th of November. Whether&#xD;
the- second part is new, I-being a stranger-cannot tell;&#xD;
but the day is to be graced with various suitable festivities."&#xD;
"It's all new to me," said Faith laughing.&#xD;
"Of the novelty of the third part you also must judge,"&#xD;
said Mr. Linden with a smile.  "The aforesaid young heir&#xD;
will consider the festivities entirely incomplete without your&#xD;
presence-nay, will perhaps refuse to have his birthday&#xD;
come at all, and wish that these 'happy returns' had never&#xD;
had a beginning."&#xD;
Faith's laugh came with its full merry roll now, and she&#xD;
withal coloured a little.&#xD;
What must I do then, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"I generally incline to the merciful side, Miss Faith-I&#xD;
believe I should advise you to go. Then I, not having&#xD;
such power in my hands, may not appreciate its fascinations."&#xD;
"Such power,? As what, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
I ought in conscience to tell you-" he went on without&#xD;
answering her,-" it has been on my mind ever since, that&#xD;
te-other night .--and the look was grave for a minute-&#xD;
&#xD;
the trophy of a broken rosebud was picked up where you&#xD;
fell. eAnd I had not the heart to reclaim it, Miss Faith,"&#xD;
Mr. Linden said, with a submissive air of confession.&#xD;
She looked at hitm, with the prettiest look in the world,&#xD;
of grave, only half conscious enquiry; and then the lost&#xD;
rosebud was more than replaced in her cheeks.&#xD;
"That is the'state of the case," Mr. Linden said, as&#xD;
gravely as if both rosebuds had been out of sight and mind,&#xD;
"but your mother refuses to go. And it seems that I also&#xD;
am wanted on the 29th; so if you please, Miss Faith, I&#xD;
aml try to see that you make the journey both ways in&#xD;
sI should like to go," said Faith quietly. "They are&#xD;
pleasant people."&#xD;
The tea-things were withdrawn, and Cindy was no more&#xD;
needed there, and Mrs. Derrick also had gone into' the&#xD;
other part of the house to attend to some business. Faith&#xD;
stood before the fire looking meditatively into it.&#xD;
"I wish," she said slowly and soberly,-" Dr. Harrison&#xD;
would please to talk to you instead of to me, Mr. Linden !"&#xD;
Talk to me ?" Mr. Linden repeated, looking at her.&#xD;
"Aboutprofessions ?"&#xD;
"No indeed !" said Faith, first astonished and then smil-&#xD;
ing, -"I mean very different things. About religion, and&#xD;
what he thinks of it?"&#xD;
Ratherhsoberly the words were received, and soberly&#xD;
answered, not at once.&#xD;
"Do not let him say much to you on that last point,&#xD;
Miss Faith."&#xD;
"flow can I help it, M. Linden ?" she said instantly.&#xD;
"Forbid him, if need be. If he asks for information,&#xD;
and you choose to give it, that is one thing,-you are not&#xD;
obliged to hear all the skeptical views and arguments with&#xD;
which he is furnished. Your statement of the truth has&#xD;
nothing to do with the grounds of his unbelief."&#xD;
Faith got no further. She stood thinking of that after-&#xD;
noon's talk, and of the certain possible hindrances to her&#xD;
following such advice&#xD;
"I am talking a little in the dark, you know," Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den said,-." I am only supposing what he may say and&#xD;

&#xD;
ask you to say; and I do not think much of such conver.&#xD;
sation between any parties. Press home the truth---and&#xD;
like David's pebble it may do its work; but in a fencing&#xD;
match David might have found it harder to maintain his&#xD;
ground. And his overthrow would not have touched the&#xD;
truth of his cause, nor perhaps his own faith--yet the&#xD;
Philistine would have triumphed."&#xD;
"Thank you, Mr. Linden," she said with a gratefIu&#xD;
smile. "That is just the truth. But, do you think Dr.&#xD;
Harrison is-exactly a Philistine ?"&#xD;
"Not in all respects," he said smiling. "What do you&#xD;
mean by a Philistine ?"&#xD;
"I thought you put him in the place of that Philistine,"&#xD;
she said.&#xD;
"Yes, for the illustration. But I do not know him to&#xD;
be strictly a champion of unbelief, although he avows him.&#xD;
self on that side. His conversations with me have left me&#xD;
uncertain how far he would go."&#xD;
Faithwas silent and looked thoughtful.&#xD;
"Have I touched any of your difficulties? May I hear&#xD;
any more ?"&#xD;
"No-" she said. "I believe you have said all you can&#xD;
say. And it is good for me.""&#xD;
"I have not said all I could say, but it is not easy for me&#xD;
to talk to you about it at all. You see, Miss Faith," said&#xD;
Mr. Linden smiling, "there cannot be such an anomaly in&#xD;
nature as a philosophical bird-so what am I to do?"&#xD;
Faith smiled a little and thought that as long as he gave&#xD;
her the benefit of his philosophy, it did not much matter.&#xD;
Which recondite view of the subject she did not put into&#xD;
words.&#xD;
The days began to roll on smoothly once more, subsid-&#xD;
ing into their old uneventful flow. ,The flow of talk indeed&#xD;
had not quite subsided; but as nothing came to throw any&#xD;
light on the point ofthe unknown sportsman who chose&#xD;
his sport so strangely, curiosity took a modified, condensed&#xD;
form; and the whole matter was stowed away in people's&#xD;
minds as the one Pattaquasset mystery. Happy Patta-&#xD;
quasset!&#xD;
Even Mr. Linden's protracted confinement, to the house&#xD;
*made little difference to most, he had been so little seen&#xD;
&#xD;
when he was able to be out: only the boys had had his&#xD;
daylight hours; and where he had spent those times of&#xD;
twilight and evening when he was not at home, no one&#xD;
knew but the poor unknown class who mourned his absence&#xD;
as they had blessed his presence, in secret. The. boys were&#xD;
not silent,--but they had the indemnification of going, to&#xD;
see him, and of watching-or sleeping.-in his room at&#xD;
night, according to their various dispositions.  There"&#xD;
came all his scholars on Sunday,-met by Faith on her&#xD;
contrary way; there came the whole school by turns, and&#xD;
at all hours. Indeed when once the embargo upon visitors&#xD;
was taken off, the supply was great !-and without careful&#xD;
measures on the part of Mr. Linden, French exercises&#xD;
would have been put aside with a witness. But he made&#xD;
two or three rules, and carried then out. In the first&#xD;
place he would see nobody before dinner, except the doc-&#xD;
tor; nor anybody after tea, save the same privileged idi-&#xD;
vidual. In the second place, when lie was able to be out&#xD;
of his room without too much fatigue, the lessons were&#xD;
carried on down stairs,-in the dining-room generally, as&#xD;
being more private. There could both parties cude and&#xD;
go without observation; and often when Mrs. Derrick was&#xD;
entertaining a roomful, a sudden fall of the thin partition&#xD;
would have revealed the very people they were discussing,&#xD;
deep in some pretty point of information. Pretty those&#xD;
lessons were ! Faith's steps,-arithmetical, geographical,&#xD;
or what other,-were swift, steady, and sure; herself&#xD;
indefatigable, her teacher no less.  If Mr. Linden had&#xD;
not quite come to be in her eyes "an old school book," she&#xD;
was yet enough accustomed to his teaching and animad-&#xD;
versions to merge the binding in the book; and as to him,&#xD;
she might have been one of his school boys, for the straight-&#xD;
forward way in which he opened paths of knowledge and&#xD;
led, her through. The leading was more careful of her&#xD;
strength, more respectful of her timidity,-was more&#xD;
strictly leading than pushing,-that was all. Of course&#xD;
in two weeks, or even in four, the best of teachers and&#xD;
scholars could make but a begin ing; but that was well&#xD;
made, and the work went steadily on from thence-despite&#xD;
"teaching all day," despite the various other calls for time&#xD;
and strength.&#xD;

And Faith was as docile and obedient as Johnny Fax&#xD;
himself, and as far as those qualities went, very much in&#xD;
the same way. If the denial of Phil's information and&#xD;
Mr. Linden's manner the day after her overturn, had raised&#xD;
a doubt as to the real abstractness of his regard for her,&#xD;
Faith's modesty and simplicity put the thought well into&#xD;
the background. She did not care to look at it or bring&#xD;
it up; in the full, happy, peaceful hours she was enjoying&#xD;
she had enough, for the present; and so Faith went on&#xD;
very much after her old fashion.. A little quieter, per,&#xD;
haps, when not called out of it; a little shyer of even inno,&#xD;
gently putting herself forward; but in speech or action,&#xD;
speaking and acting with her wonted free simplicity.&#xD;
The only breaks in these weeks were one or two visits&#xD;
to Mrs. Custers, and the doctor's comings and goings.&#xD;
He could not be shut out.&#xD;
The Monday evening after the doctor's absence atQuili..&#xD;
peak, the little party were as usual in the sitting-room;&#xD;
and a pretty chapter of Physical Geography was in pro.&#xD;
cess of reading and talk, when the doctor's quick wheels&#xD;
at the door announced not only his return but his arrival,&#xD;
And Mr. Linden announced to his scholar, that it was&#xD;
needful now to return to the surface of the earth and&#xD;
attend to the flow of conversation-and to put the book&#xD;
in his pocket.&#xD;
"Are you glad to see me back ?" said the doctor as he&#xD;
took the hand of his patient. He looked rather glad&#xD;
himself.&#xD;
hiIf I say yes, that will be to confess that I have reason.&#xD;
You perceive my dilemma," Mr. Linden said, but with a&#xD;
smile that was certainly as kind and trustworthy as any&#xD;
the doctor had seen since he went away.&#xD;
"Do-you mean-that you have no reason to be glad ?"&#xD;
said Dr. Harrison slowly, eying the smile and giving it,&#xD;
to judge by his own, a trustful regard.&#xD;
" Certainly not ! It's a comfort to -have somebody at&#xD;
hand who is ready to fight me at any moment," said Mr.&#xD;
Linden.&#xD;
"What have you been doing since I went away ?"&#xD;
" Reading, writing, and considering the world generally."&#xD;
"Frarm this Pattaquasset centre !" '&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND. SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Why not?-if lines meet and make it one.&#xD;
"How do you get the ends of the lines in your hands!"&#xD;
said the doctor. "A centre, I feel it to be-but very like&#xD;
the centre of the earth-socially and politically. You see,&#xD;
I have just emerged to the surface, and come down again.&#xD;
Who has taken care of you ?"&#xD;
"I feel quite equal to the task of taking care of myself,&#xD;
thank you, doctor."&#xD;
"You don't mean to say, man, you have dressed your&#xD;
arm yourself?"&#xD;
"What do you suppose my powers are equal to ?"&#xD;
"That is a matter," said the doctor, "upon which I stand&#xD;
in doubt-which gives me an uncomfortable, troublesome&#xD;
sort of feeling when I am in your presence. It must be&#xD;
superstition. I suppose I shall get the better of it-or of&#xD;
you !-in time. Meanwhile, who has dressed your arm for&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
The answer was given very quietly, very simply, not&#xD;
very loud. "The lady whom you had the honour of in-&#xD;
structing in the art, Dr. Harrison."&#xD;
"Did you do it well ?" said Dr. Harrison somewhat&#xD;
comically, wheeling round before Faith.&#xD;
She was a contrast; as her face looked up at him, rather&#xD;
pleased, and her soft voice answered,--" I think I did, sir."&#xD;
"I don't doubt you did ! And I don't doubt you would&#xD;
do anything. Are you preparing to be another Portia ?&#xD;
And am I to be Bellario ?"&#xD;
"I don't know what you mean, Dr. Harrison."&#xD;
"Do you know the story of Portia ?-in the Merchant&#xD;
of Venice ?"&#xD;
"I never read it."&#xD;
"She was a dangerous character," said the doctor.&#xD;
"Portia, Miss Derrick, wishing to save not the life but&#xD;
the character and happiness of a-But what a way this&#xD;
is to tell you the story ! Is there a Shakspeare here ?"&#xD;
"We haven't it," said Faith quietly.&#xD;
"I'll bring the play the next time I come, if. you will&#xD;
allow me," he said sitting down by her ;-" and indoctrin-&#xD;
ate you in something more interesting than my first lesson.&#xD;
How shall I thank you for doing my work for me ?"&#xD;
"It became my work."&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
r HOSE weeks, like others, came to an end. And then Mr.&#xD;
,   Linden gave notice to all and sundry of his scholars,&#xD;
that his time of seclusion was at an end-only giving way&#xD;
to advice so far, as to accept the daily use of Squire Stout-&#xD;
enburgh's lose carriage, until his health should be in a more&#xD;
assured state. Monday morning he was to take up his old&#xD;
routine of school duties; though done too fit for it, in the&#xD;
estimation of some people,-the doctor said it was a month&#xD;
}  too soon. And no -one could look at him and forget the&#xD;
last month's work,--a little exertion made the work very&#xD;
apparent; and as they sat at breakfast .Monday morning,&#xD;
9 Mrs. Derrick made up her own mind privately that Dr.&#xD;
r Harrison should have found some means to keep him in the&#xD;
house anl from work yet longer.  u the result of her&#xD;
meditations was not put in words; the effect betrayed itself&#xD;
in the extra care bestowed upon cups of coffee.--the only&#xD;
4 thing within her reach.&#xD;
It was a cold morning, true November, with its driving&#xD;
grey wind clouds, through which the cool sunbeams strag-&#xD;
gled fitfully; with trees shorn of their golden honours, and&#xD;
brown branches waving and twisting in the wind, and only&#xD;
mere specks of blue here and there overhead. The guills&#xD;
sailed to and fro above the Mong as if they rejoiced in the&#xD;
fierce gusts of northern wind'; the vessels shortened sail, or&#xD;
ran under bare poles. The wind shook the village windows,&#xD;
and poured dry leaves in every porch, and swept up the&#xD;
world generally-not much to the comfort of the same. In&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick's little eating-room indeed, it was warm enough,&#xD;
and the floor swept after another fashion; yet even there&#xD;
did the wind rush in, whenever the kitchen door opened,&#xD;
after Cindy and the hot cakes.&#xD;
"Mr. Linden," said Faith after her eye had gone explor-&#xD;
ingly to the window, the wind and the clouds,-"-I wish&#xD;
you would give the boys only half a day to day 1"&#xD;

"I fancy you could have your wish seconded thirty&#xD;
times," he said smiling. "No-not thirty times, but perha?&#xD;
twenty."&#xD;
"I don't think those wishes would be worth minding.;&#xD;
but I think mine is, Mr. Linden. I mean the reason of ity&#xD;
"I think yours is-if I could mind it. What is thA reaso,&#xD;
Miss Faith ?"&#xD;
"I am afraid you are not quite fit for a whole day's work,&#xD;
In school," she added' smiling.&#xD;
"You don't know what you are asking !-if I stay at&#xD;
home I shall talk nothing but French the whole afternoon.,"&#xD;
"Well," said Faith laughingly, "1 shouldol  esi.&#xD;
I could bear that."                  ldol    6sil&#xD;
"I couldn't-and you wouldn't. But you need not be&#xD;
uneasy, Miss Faith-I must not be at home." .&#xD;
She looked grave, but said no more.&#xD;
The wind was not more busy out of doors that.day, than&#xD;
the people within. Diligent and quick hands moved about&#xD;
in dairy and kitchen; and a quick and diligent, spirit as&#xD;
earnestly--(for in Faith's mind it was all one work; that&#xD;
was on the way to this).--dealt with problems and idioms&#xD;
in the study room that Faith liked best and where she was&#xD;
most secure. _But long enough before dinner she was help-&#xD;
ing Mrs. Derrick in the kitchen again.&#xD;
" Mother," she said, "you can't think how I dread to see&#xD;
Mr. Linden come home to-day! He won't speak one word&#xD;
of English to me."&#xD;
"I guess he would, if you wouldn't speak one word of&#xD;
French to him," said Mrs. Derrick sagaciously. "What&#xD;
kre you afraid of; child ?"  .  .&#xD;
"I am afraid just of that," said Faith sighing. "Of&#xD;
having to speak those French words."&#xD;
"Why you've been reading them to him, I'm sure," said&#xD;
her mother. "I didn't know anybody was afraid of him&#xD;
but me, Faith.. But if you don't like it, why don't you tell&#xD;
him so?".&#xD;
Faith however negatived that proposition with a dubious&#xD;
shake of the head; which meant, probably, that neither&#xD;
Mr. Linden nor herself would be satisfied with such a mode&#xD;
of procedure; and confined her present attentions to the&#xD;
dinner preparations. In which and other matters she be-&#xD;
&#xD;
caeso engaged that she forgot her fears; and going into&#xD;
thedining room some time after with a dish in her hands&#xD;
Sad finding Mr. Linden there, Faith asked him earnestly&#xD;
Sand with great simplicity, "how he felt after his morning's&#xD;
an wrk." Then remembering, or reminded by something in&#xD;
his face, she started away like a deer before any answer&#xD;
could be given; and only came back demurely with her&#xD;
~iother- -to receive his grave reverence and "Me voici,&#xD;
nnademoiselle !"-given just as if he had not seen her before.&#xD;
The half grave half laughing flash of Faith's eye spoke as&#xD;
much of amusement as of fear ; yet afraid she certainly was,&#xD;
for she did not so much as .speak English to her mother.&#xD;
The language of the eye was all she ventured; nor that&#xD;
boldly. It had to come, however, fear or no fear,--.the&#xD;
English might be dispensed with but not the French. She&#xD;
could not but try to understand the remarks or bits of in-&#xD;
formation which were given her-sometimes gravely some-&#xD;
times laughing; and if Mr. Linden was evidently waiting&#xD;
Sfor an answer-what could she do but try that too ! He&#xD;
Swas an admirable dictionary, very quick at seeing and sup-&#xD;
Splying her want pfa word, and giving his corrections of her&#xD;
Phraseology and pronunciation so gently and by the way,&#xD;
That fear partly lost itself in interest. His own speech was&#xD;
singularly smooth and perfect; and whenever Faith found&#xD;
Herself getting frightened, she was sure to be assailed with&#xD;
such a volley of swift flowing syllables, that she could do&#xD;
i  ohng but laugh,-after which Mr. Linden would come&#xD;
Back to the slower utterance which she could better under-&#xD;
Sstand. After all, Faith's words that first time were few,&#xD;
and it may safely be asserted that she did not in the least&#xD;
know what she was eating, and made no sort of a dinner.&#xD;
Of that last fact her instructor was well aware, but as his&#xD;
first "Mais mademoisplle, mangez I" received but little at-&#xD;
tention, he postponed that point till just as he was going&#xD;
away, and then made a rather stringent request to the same&#xD;
Soothe afternoon passed on, and eJlew itself out, and the&#xD;
sun went to bed and night began /to light her candles.&#xD;
Faith, standing at; the window (it was too cold to be out)&#xD;
saw the red gleam fading from earth and sky, and the cold&#xD;
bright stars coming one by one into view. Then the boys&#xD;

began to pass by,--some together and some alone; walking&#xD;
or running home, or playing ball by the way. Mr. Linde'&#xD;
carriage was a little behind them all, but he came at last,&#xD;
and gave her a bow and a smile from the gate though she&#xD;
thought herself standing too fa~r back to be seen.&#xD;
"Now Mr. Linden," said Faith when he came in,--"Iam&#xD;
so glad to speak to you againI How do you do ?" The&#xD;
question was not lightly given.&#xD;
"Miss Faith, did you finish your dinner ?"&#xD;
"No-" said Faith hesitating,--"but I am going to have&#xD;
some tea by and by. Aren't you well tired, Mr. Linden?"&#xD;
"Pretty well-Why didn't you ?"&#xD;
"I wanted to be doing something else,"-said Faith,&#xD;
giving the easy chair a little push into place, and then&#xD;
brightening up the fire. "I shall have tea in here to-night,&#xD;
Mr. Linden. But we must wait a little while for it, for&#xD;
Cindy is out. You won't be sorry to rest first."&#xD;
She was summarily, though very respectfully put in the&#xD;
easy chair herself.&#xD;
"By what rule of right and wrong did you do anything&#xD;
else first?  Do you know, Miss Faith, I did not finish mine&#xD;
either-I wanted another piece of bread, and could not&#xD;
get it!"                                          r&#xD;
"Why not, Mr. Linden ? I am sure there was bread on&#xD;
the table. But I am glad if you are hungry, for I have got&#xD;
something that you like. Now please rest !" she said spring-'&#xD;
ing up and beginning to arrange the table.&#xD;
"I am sure I asked you for it politely," he said with a&#xD;
smile, as he yielded to her "please rest." "What have you&#xD;
been about all day ?"&#xD;
"I have been learning my lessons-and trying how well&#xD;
I could get on by myself."&#xD;
"Get on by yourself ?" he said rather slowly and inquir.-&#xD;
ingly. "In what ?"&#xD;
"In the books-in my studies, Mr. Linden."&#xD;
"Are you tired of my help, Miss Faith ?"&#xD;
She gave all her eyes to the answer, both in their sweet.&#xD;
ness and their gravity. "Do you think I could let you&#xD;
spend all your time upon me, Mr. Linden when your&#xD;
whole day is given to such work ? I'll come to you for&#xD;
help whenever I can't get on without it;" she said with a .&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
smile, not exactly an enjoying one,-" but I know I can do&#xD;
Sa good deal by myself.-&#xD;
His eyes were given to the answer too, a little intently,&#xD;
but the smile that followed was different.&#xD;
"I think you will let mie do what I shall do, Miss Faith."&#xD;
"I suppose that t" said' Faith with a bright gleam in her&#xD;
eyes. She went out to see if Cindy had come back; but&#xD;
returned immediately, sat down and looked gravely into the&#xD;
fire.&#xD;
"What is the use of startling people in that way ?" Mr.&#xD;
Linden said, looking at her. "1 didn't know but you were&#xD;
going to send me to take up my abode at Mrs. Seacomb's!"&#xD;
"Startling, Mr. Linden!" said .Faith opening her eyes&#xD;
at him. "I saig itAecause I thought it was right. I&#xD;
didn't think it w6s pleasant."&#xD;
-,-   "Well," said he, "we were agreed upon that point.&#xD;
F  Now Miss Faith, as my time is precious, and I cannot well&#xD;
give any of it to people who have enough of their own-&#xD;
would it disturb you if I were to read aloud a little here&#xD;
for my own'amusement ?"&#xD;
She changed her place to come nearer, without saying&#xD;
anything, but with a face of quiet delight only half revealed.&#xD;
"What do you think of the relative and respective charms&#xD;
ofMirth and Melancholy, Miss Faith ?-I mean their&#xD;
charms to inward perception, not outward sight."&#xD;
"The pleasure of them ?" said Faith.&#xD;
"Yes-pleasure and satisfaction."&#xD;
"I-never thought there was any pleasure in Melancholy,"&#xD;
said Faith smiling at the idea, but smiling inquiringly too.&#xD;
In answer, Mr. Linden opened his book and gave her&#xD;
the Allegro and Penseroso,-gave them with not only a&#xD;
full appreciation, but with a delicate change and suiting&#xD;
of voice and manner-and look, even-that made them&#xD;
witching.&#xD;
And if ever a hearer was bewitched, that was Faith.&#xD;
She lent her ear to the music, her eye to the eye, her thought&#xD;
to the thought, in utter forgetfulness of all else. At first&#xD;
she listened quietly, sitting where she was, looking some-&#xD;
times at the fire, sometimes at the reader; but then she&#xD;
abandoned herself to full enjoyment, left her chair for a low&#xD;
seat near Mr..Linden, almost at his feet; and with upraised&#xD;

It wasn't made at first. Her look had come round slowly&#xD;
to the fire and slowly subsided. After sitting a minute so,&#xD;
she made her remark.&#xD;
"Buit Mr. Linden, none of that seemed much like Melan.&#xD;
holy to me ?"&#xD;
"That may be called the ideal of Melancholy," he said&#xD;
smiling.&#xD;
"What is an 'ideal'? But oh," said Faith starting up,&#xD;
"it-is time to have tea !--What is an 'ideal,' Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
It was impossible not to laugh a little-but equally un-&#xD;
possible to take that laugh amiss.&#xD;
"The particular mental standard of perfection by which&#xD;
every person measures other people and things; and as that&#xD;
is generally more perfect than reality, the ideal is supposed&#xD;
to exist only in the idea."&#xD;
She stood pondering the answer, with a somewhat hum.&#xD;
bled brow.&#xD;
"I think I know," she said shaking her head a little -..&#xD;
"but I shall have to ask what exactly you mean by a&#xD;
standard, Mr. Linden. B  and by-I must see toCindy&#xD;
now."&#xD;
And she ran off.  Cindy presently brought in the tray;&#xD;
and Faith followed, arranging and setting in order every-&#xD;
thing. The tea did not immediately follow, perhaps the&#xD;
fire had got low, or Mrs. Derrick was not ready, for Faith&#xD;
did not seem expectant. She stood on the rug before the&#xD;
fire, looking into it very soberly and ponsideratively. There&#xD;
was a little abstraction in her figure and- air. Suddenly&#xD;
she faced round where she stood.&#xD;
"Do you feel very tired indeed to-night, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"Not very-now," he said smiling. "I have been rest.-&#xD;
ing. I was a little more tired than usual when I came&#xD;
home."&#xD;

face and intent eye and varying play of lip, devoured it all,&#xD;
Sometimes the poetry certainly got beyond the bounds of&#xD;
her stock of knowledge; but that mattered not; for when.&#xD;
ever the reading failed, the reader filled up all the gap and&#xD;
Faith listened to him.  Precisely, what it was to have jus&#xD;
such a hearer, was best known to the reader himself; bit&#xD;
he closed the book silently. Faith's comment was pecti.&#xD;
liar.&#xD;
&#xD;
364&#xD;
&#xD;
lowly and deliberately she came round behind his chair&#xD;
l and stood leaning upon the back of it.&#xD;
"Mr. Linden-I want to ask you something.&#xD;
The tone was low and peculiar. It was a very common&#xD;
thing for her to be more or less moved by a little timidity;&#xD;
but now plainly Faith was afraid. It changed her voice,&#xD;
beyond the slight sweet touch that timidity often gave it.&#xD;
"You know I like to have you, Miss Faith."&#xD;
"I wanted to ask-if you would like,--or if you wouldn't&#xD;
dislikeif you would have any objection, to read and pray&#xD;
at night-----here, with us, --and let Cindy and Mr. Skip&#xD;
come in?"&#xD;
"I will, certainly,"Mr. Linden said: "how could I have&#xD;
any objection ? Miss Faith-will you please to come round&#xD;
here and sit down ?-Why are you so much afraid of me.?"&#xD;
She did not leave her position.&#xD;
"I didn't know whether you would like it," she said in a&#xD;
very low voice. "I asked mother to ask you, but she&#xD;
wouldn't,.-though she said she would like to have you do&#xD;
it. I wanted it particularly for mother's sake."-The last&#xD;
words were said little above a whisper.&#xD;
"I don't.see where the fear came from, yet."&#xD;
She was quite still, quite motionless, behind his chair&#xD;
He turned a little, so as to see heir face, and laid his hand&#xD;
upon hers.&#xD;
"Will you come round here and tell me, Miss Faith? I&#xD;
shall not let you stand up all the evening."&#xD;
She was looking, when he saw her, with the least bit of&#xD;
a smile upon .a mouth all unbent, and eyes that were full;&#xD;
a very happy, stirred face. It quieted down as soon as he&#xD;
turned; except the smile which played rather more.&#xD;
"Tell you what, Mr. Linden ?" she said not leaving her&#xD;
place.&#xD;
"What have I done to make myself such an ogre ?"&#xD;
"What is an ogre, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"A ferocious sort of anomaly that everybody is afraid&#xD;
of."&#xD;
"I don't know what you've done, Mr. Linden," she said&#xD;
half laughing. "I. am not enough frid to In.t s*n-&#xD;

"EnQugh to hurt me-I don't care about any other&#xD;
thing."&#xD;
A grave glance of her eye was regretful enough.&#xD;
"But it's true, Mr. Linden! I was a little afraid to ask&#xD;
what I wasn't sure you would like-that was all."&#xD;
"Well," he said with a reassuring smile, as he got up&#xD;
and took hold of both her hands and brought her out of&#xD;
position, "I am not much hurt yet-but I desire that the&#xD;
fear may not increase. And therefore, Miss Faith, I want&#xD;
to have you sit here in the firelight, so that I can keep&#xD;
watch of it."&#xD;
She smiled, as if it were beyond his ken now, but her&#xD;
words went to another point.&#xD;
"What time would you like, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"Whatever suits you."&#xD;
She was silent for a minute or two, with a very happy&#xD;
face, till the door opened. Then she sprang up and re-&#xD;
ceived and placed the tea and things which Cindy~ad&#xD;
brought in. There was a dainty supply to-night, perhaps&#xD;
in consideration of Mr. Linden's first day of out-door work,&#xD;
and in delicate sympathy and reward thereof. And Faith,&#xD;
in her happiest mood though as quiet as a mouse, was an&#xD;
excellent 'ministering: spirit' of the tea-table; to-night pa'.&#xD;
ticularly, for every sense and affection seemed to be on the&#xD;
alert.&#xD;
"How do you find all the boys, after their month out of&#xD;
school, Mr. Linden ?" she said, when waffles and cups of&#xD;
tea were fairly under weigh.&#xD;
"Very glad to see me-very much afraid I should tire&#xD;
myself; and some a little afraid they might share the&#xD;
fatigue. So things correct each other !-if they had not&#xD;
shewed the last fear, I might have felt the first."&#xD;
"How did that work ?" said Faith laughing a little.&#xD;
"It worked-" said Mr. Linden. "Is that intelligible,&#xD;
Miss Faith ?"&#xD;
Her smile and shake of the head said that it was.&#xD;
"Is Joe Deacon staying home yet ?" said Mrs. Derrick,&#xD;
"No, he began school again to-day."&#xD;
"I wonder whether the Squire is going off again," said&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick,-" or whether he's going to stay home."&#xD;
"I hyve heard nothing of his going away."&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"You were going to tell me what exactly a 'standard'&#xD;
- is Mr. Linden ?  At least !"- said Faith correcting her-&#xD;
f self,-" I was going to ask you."&#xD;
"There is a very intimate connexion between the two&#xD;
things," said Mr. Linden smiling.  "A  standard, in this&#xD;
sense, is-simply some fixed rule of the ought to be, by which&#xD;
the ismust be tried. Standard coin is that made according&#xD;
to the precise government regulation, and is the test of all&#xD;
other in the realm, as to size, weight, and alloy. So of&#xD;
standard weights and measures. For some things we have&#xD;
the Bible standard,-for most, each person has his own."&#xD;
"Then Mr. Linden," said Faith, "I think my 'ideal' of&#xD;
Melancholy is something disagreeable."&#xD;
"I don't believe you have any !" said he laughing.&#xD;
"You mean your idea, Miss Faith."&#xD;
"Do I ?" said Faith. "But perhaps you have such a&#xD;
9 thing, Mr. Linden'; isn't it disagreeable ?"&#xD;
"Not at all-and besides I haven't any. But the ideal&#xD;
of Melancholy is about as much like the reality, as a pic-&#xD;
ture of the Tragic Muse is like the fifth act of a tragedy."&#xD;
$.That Faith did not know the meaning of tragedy, was a&#xD;
fact which she wisely and self-denyingly kept to\ herself;&#xD;
and for the present turned her attention to supplying her&#xD;
. mother with a fresh waffle. And so with various bits. of&#xD;
talk, tea came to an end, and Mrs. Derrick was called out&#xD;
. to discuss some important matter with Mr. Skip.&#xD;
"Mother," said Faith finding her opportunity, "I asked&#xD;
Mr. Linden, and he will do that."-A little shadow came&#xD;
over Mrs. Derrick's face.&#xD;
S"Well, child ?" she said gently.&#xD;
"Mother-I have asked hin,-will you speak to Mr.&#xD;
Skip and Cindy ?"&#xD;
"I can't child-" said her mother, with the same tone&#xD;
and look. I'll go in myself, but I can't try to do any&#xD;
more."&#xD;
"Dear mother.-" said Faith,-" I wish you would !"&#xD;
Her mother turned and kissed her, but the difficulty was&#xD;
clearly not one to be overcome. The whole subject seemed&#xD;
to bring up some painful association.&#xD;
"He'll call them in himself; if you ask him, child."&#xD;
"Would it be right to ask him, mother ?"&#xD;

"WtIy yes !" said Mrs. Derrick-" I don't see why not.&#xD;
One of you must."&#xD;
With this thought Faith went back to the sitting-room.&#xD;
Clearly there was some strong feeling against her being&#xD;
the one, for after a little sober silent waiting, she spoke.&#xD;
"Mr. Linden-would you rather I should ask Cindy&#xD;
and Mr. Skip to come in ?-or will you ?"&#xD;
He knew, better than she did, how well the question&#xD;
shewed her own wish, and how simple a matter it was to&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"I will, Miss Faith, if you please. Is this the hour you&#xD;
have fixed upon ?"&#xD;
"I think so," she said,-"if you like it; because by and&#xD;
by they will be sleepy." And Mr. Linden at, once pro.&#xD;
ceeded to the kitchen.&#xD;
A busy murmur of tongues, and bright firelight glancing&#xD;
from keyhole and crevice, guided him through the narrow&#xD;
passage which, sooth to say, he had never trod before, to&#xD;
the door of the kitchen; the latch of which yielded on&#xD;
slight persuasion, and Mr. Linden walked in. Supper was&#xD;
over there, too, and the dishes were washed and put away,&#xD;
and Cindy with dishcloth in hand was rubbing down the&#xD;
kitchen table. In one corner of the hearth sat Mr. Skip&#xD;
on a half bushel measure, a full corn basket beside him, an&#xD;
empty one in front,l his hands busy with the shelling pro-&#xD;
cess; this hard work being diversified and enlivened with&#xD;
the continual additions he made to a cob house on the&#xD;
hearth. But, cob in hand, Mr. Skip paused when Mr.&#xD;
Linden came in, and looked up at this unusual apparition&#xD;
from under an extraordinary hat which drooped on all&#xD;
sides of his face, as if like its wearer it.had long given up&#xD;
all idea of keeping up appearances. The face itself was&#xD;
strong, shrewd, apt. And so Mr. Skip looked at Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den. Cindy on her part, did nothing but wring the dish-&#xD;
cloth and shake it out again, entirely oblivious of the greet-&#xD;
ing with which Mr. Linden favoured both parties; and&#xD;
she listened to the 'words he said about the ' corn, as if&#xD;
they had been Greek-double distilled. Those words were&#xD;
few.&#xD;
"Mr. Skip," he said then, "I think that so long as God&#xD;
keeps us here together every day, we ought to thank him&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.369&#xD;
&#xD;
for it together every night. I want you and Cindy to&#xD;
come into the parlour and let us begin to do it now."&#xD;
"Hey ?" said Mr. Skip, between want of understanding&#xD;
and want of belief in the testimony of his ears. Mr. Linden&#xD;
repeated his words, with a composed distinctness that could&#xD;
leave no manner of doubt.&#xD;
"Well1!".-said Mr. Skip. "What do you want us for&#xD;
to do?"&#xD;
"Come into the parlour."&#xD;
"I s'pose we'll be to come,'"-said Mr. Skip, dropping&#xD;
his cob and getting up and straightening himself. "Will&#xD;
you have us in now ?&#xD;
"Yes," Mr. Linden answered, and led the way.&#xD;
"Go along, Cindy !"   said Mr. Skip in ugrtone.&#xD;
"S'pose it don't take fur to see into this."&#xD;
Cindy obeyed, but without seeing 'fur' into anything-..&#xD;
even the parlour, though she tried for it. There was not&#xD;
very much to see. Mrs. Derrick (with a little shadow of&#xD;
recollective sorrow) had placed the old Bible by the lamp,&#xD;
and now sat leaning her head on her hand and did not look&#xD;
up as they came in. Faith's face was one of grave joy;&#xD;
but the gravity was so quiet that the joy was beyond the&#xD;
ken of so dull a vision as Cindy's. She sat with clasped&#xD;
hands on a low seat beyond the fire. And Cindy at last&#xD;
fixed her attention upon Mr. Linden, with only an occa-&#xD;
sional roll of her eyes towards Mr. Skip.&#xD;
It was a long time since such a service had been in that&#xD;
house,---a time at first swept by a storm of sorrow, then&#xD;
calmed and quieted into a stillness which had grown more&#xD;
and more bright, year by year. Whatever sunshine those&#xD;
years had seen, came from Faith; but that other faith,&#xD;
which should make even her more precious, had been un-&#xD;
known. And the words of the reading and prayer to-night,&#xD;
were to Mrs. Derrick like the renewing of things so long&#xD;
past, that, she could scarce bear it; and different as Mr.&#xD;
Li den was from any one she had ever known, that Chris-&#xD;
tian family likeness almost, to her feeling, transformed him.&#xD;
It was a very simple matter to him, truly,-vhy not?.-&#xD;
Why should it ever be anything else ? or why, when the&#xD;
fear of God is on the tongue should the fear of man be in&#xD;
the heart? Yet it was even more the love of dod than&#xD;

the fear, that his hearers perceived that night. Simple in&#xD;
word and tone cand manner, it was the simplicity of a feel.&#xD;
ing so full and strong that it needed no capillary tubes of&#xD;
speech to carry it upward. The prayer ended, and the&#xD;
retreating steps on their way along the kitchen passage,&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick came up to Faith, and putting her arms&#xD;
round her kissed first one cheek and then the other-then&#xD;
turned and left the room.  And Faith sat still, with that&#xD;
joy filling her heart so full that her head bent with the&#xD;
weight of it.&#xD;
One other comment she was destined to hear that night.&#xD;
"I must say, Miss Faith," said Cindy, "I like these new&#xD;
notions firstrate!  I always did say my prayers afore I&#xD;
went     ed, and I'm free to confess this saves a deal of&#xD;
trouble.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXX.&#xD;
SHE quiet of that very peaceful evening was for a short&#xD;
time interrupted by a call from Dr. Harrison. The&#xD;
doctor came, he said, to see how Mr. Linden felt after his&#xD;
day's work; and to tell Faith that his exhibition was in&#xD;
readiness for her and only waited a sunny day and her pre-&#xD;
sence. It was agreed that if the sun did not fail of shew-&#xD;
euing himself the next afternoon, Faith should not.;&#xD;
Tuesday was fair, and the afternoon came ont  liant&#xD;
with sunbeams. But the doctor's steps did not reach Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick's floor by some minutes so soon as he had pur-&#xD;
posed they should.&#xD;
Passing down the main street of Pattaquasset, Dr. Har-&#xD;
rison descried before him the well known figure of Squire&#xD;
Stoutenburgh, and the less familiar outlines of Squire Dea-&#xD;
con. And the doctor's near approach procured him the fa-&#xD;
f your of an introduction to the latter gentleman,-either be-&#xD;
cause the Squire desired it, or because the other Squire was&#xD;
tired of his companion and wanted to be off-which he&#xD;
was, as soon as the introduction was over. For in Mr.&#xD;
Stouthburgh's eyes the buttonhole of Dr. Harrison's soft&#xD;
coat was no more precious (to say the least) than that of&#xD;
his own grey Rough and Ready.&#xD;
"Squire Deacon is anxious about the state of Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den's health, doctor," he said,-" I refer him to you."&#xD;
The doctor made a slight inclination, graceful as all his&#xD;
inclinations were,' but also slight; intimating that he would&#xD;
have the honour of satisfying Mr. Deacon's inquiries but&#xD;
desired nothing more of him.&#xD;
"How's he getting along ?" said Squire Deacon-feel-&#xD;
ing the social duty thus imposed upon him.&#xD;
"There is hope that he will be restored to his pristine&#xD;
state of strength in the course of a few weeks, sir."&#xD;
"A few weeks 1" said Squire Deacon. "Why he's in&#xD;
school again, ain't he ?"&#xD;

"He has gone in a carriage," said the doctor, who-for&#xD;
some unaccountable reason had taken a fit of perversity,,&#xD;
"I understand he was in school yesterday."&#xD;
"Did you know him afore he come here, doctor ?"&#xD;
"I had not that honour, sir, till I came here myself."&#xD;
"Well I never saw anybody as did," said Squire Pea.&#xD;
con.-" I s'pose he comes from somewhere."&#xD;
"I ioubt it," said Dr. Harrison with the slightest possi.&#xD;
ble elevation of his eyebrows for an instant. Squire Dea.&#xD;
con, however, was not just the fool Dr. Harrison took hinm&#xD;
for; of which fact a little gleam in his .eyes gave notice,&#xD;
"'Taint extraordinary you don't like him, doctor," h&#xD;
said    lessly.  "Mr. Linden's a fine man, but 'most any&#xD;
pair     eels is one too many in some roads.7&#xD;

"Wheelbarrows have only one wheel, mostly," said&#xD;
Squire Deacon composedly.&#xD;
"You know better than I, sir. Might I enquire why&#xD;
you are anxious about the state of Mr. Linden's health?"&#xD;
"Don't know as I said I was anxious.-" said Squire&#xD;
Deacon.   "When a man's lived in a place as long as he&#xD;
has, it's nothing wonderful if folks ask whether he's going&#xD;
to hold on. All the women in my house think he's dead&#xD;
and buried, now."&#xD;
"Ah! He's a favourite 'in that line, is he ?"&#xD;
"Other lines just as much-for all .I know," said the&#xD;
Squire. "Can't say I ever just went in for all Mr. Sin.&#xD;
lins says-nor all Parson Somers says, neither,-cap't help&#xD;
that, doctor, if he is one o' your folks."&#xD;
"What have you against him ?"&#xD;
"I don't say nothing against him7" said Squire Deacon,--&#xD;
"except he's a fine .man.  Maybe you think that is."  ..&#xD;
"Is there anything further you would like to say on any&#xD;
subject, sir?"&#xD;
"Not much,, I guess, if that's the time o' day," said&#xD;
Squire Deacon looking at him with a queer little bit of a&#xD;
smile. "'Taint useful to get stirred up that way, doctor,&#xD;
just because a raan wishes you a good journey. But I can,&#xD;
just as easy wish you another-overturn -I s'pose you're&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
prettY sure to get one or t'other out o' the horses. It's&#xD;
all one to me-and I dare say it is to everybody else."&#xD;
"What is your name, sir?" said the doctor standing and&#xD;
looking at him in a sort of mazed consideration.&#xD;
"My name's Sam Deacon,"-,-said the Squire with his&#xD;
peculiar sort of sullen composure. "Your father and I've&#xD;
always been friends, anyhow."&#xD;
"Then.Mr. Deacon will you have the goodness to under-&#xD;
stand that I am not an agent for thei transaction of Mr.&#xD;
Linden's affairs; but as I am a friend of his, I will inform&#xD;
him that you are interested in the subject. That is all,&#xD;
"I11 go bail for the first part of that !" said S ' e Dea-&#xD;
con. "But it's your affairs I'm talkin' of--not  And&#xD;
I s'pose I've as good a right as all the rest of aquas-&#xD;
set-and give no offence, neither. I was goin' to make&#xD;
you my compliments, doctor-that's all; and if you don't&#xD;
think you'll ever want 'em, why there's no harm done-and&#xD;
enough said. All I want to know is, what do you get so&#xD;
stirred up for ?"&#xD;
"Is that all ?" said the doctor, as if he had a mind to&#xD;
know the whole before giving an answer.&#xD;
"All what ?" said Squire Deacon.&#xD;
"All that you wish to communicate ?"&#xD;
"I haven't communicated anything y t," said the Squire.&#xD;
"I guess you knew all that before."&#xD;
"Well," said the doctor, half laughing, though his ex-&#xD;
pression had changed more than once during the last five&#xD;
minutes,-"then my answer is easy. In the first place,&#xD;
Mr. Deacon, I have no affairs-therefore it is impossible&#xD;
to talk about them. In the second place, when I am in&#xD;
want of your compliments I will -send you mine. In the&#xD;
third place,-I declare I am at a loss how to answer you;&#xD;
for the nly thing I ever get stirred up for, is my break-&#xD;
fast!  ood afternoon!__"&#xD;
Staring no more civilities, the doctor made the best of&#xD;
his way to Ms. Derrick's. Faith was ready for. him, and&#xD;
more gently with.: her he set out on the road back again.&#xD;
It was not a time of day to meet people-one familiar face&#xD;

not seek Faith's face, but rested on the doctor with full&#xD;
effect.&#xD;
Arrived at the Judge's house, the doctor led her to the&#xD;
library, and there unlocked the door of a little cabinet&#xD;
room. On a table in the window, standing in the full sun'&#xD;
shine, was the object of their visit. It was simply a fine&#xD;
little Aquarium.  More delightfully new to Faith's eyes&#xD;
nothing could be; as the same eyes shewed. While they&#xD;
explored the wonders of the box, the doctor at his ease&#xD;
proceeded to unfold to her the various meanings of them.&#xD;
le enlarged upon the habits and characters of the several&#xD;
inmates of the Aquarium; he explained to her the phi-&#xD;
losop    f keeping the balance of vegetable and animal&#xD;
life a   hereby preserving both; he told which cre ture&#xD;
lived    n lwhi  other; what office they severally, s ie&#xD;
of them, perfor ed for the small section of Ocean in which&#xD;
they lived and its vitrified shores; and then taking up the&#xD;
subject of Sea anemones, the doctor told stories, of nata-&#xD;
ral truth, that with these living specimens before her en-&#xD;
tranced Faith out of all knowledge of place or time. Dr-&#xD;
Harrison asked no more. He gave her what she liked,&#xD;
and with admirable tact abstained from putting himself&#xD;
forward; any further than a quick eye, excellent speech,&#xD;
and full and accurate mind must make themselves known,&#xD;
and most gentle and graceful attention make itself felt.&#xD;
"Do you suppose," said he, when Faith was absorbedly&#xD;
watching the Anemones feed,---"that Mrs. Derrick would&#xD;
give  is thing house-room ?"&#xD;
Faith looked, but half comprehending.,&#xD;
"I am not always. here," said the doctor carelessly, as&#xD;
he was supplying another bit of flesh to the voracious&#xD;
flower,-" and I should like to have it somewhere that it&#xD;
would be taken care of. If I left it to Sophy for a week,&#xD;
I should expect to find on my return that the vegetables&#xD;
and fishes had eaten up each other. Don't you admire&#xD;
that crab ?"&#xD;
"Very much," said Faith.  "This little fish is just like&#xD;
some of the shells down on the shore."&#xD;

"little monster I The ocean world isn't much better than&#xD;

"Do you think the earth-world is like that ?" said Faith.&#xD;
"Don't you ?"&#xD;
"I don't know what it is like."&#xD;
"If you will permit me to say so, I hope you never will.-.&#xD;
any further than as you choose to make this a miniature of&#xD;
that. And things in miniature-are much less," said the&#xD;
doctor abstractedly, looking at the Anemone. 'Would&#xD;
you like to have this little ocean box in your house for&#xD;
awhile, Miss Faith ?-it could just as well as not. Indeed&#xD;
it would be rather a benefit to me."&#xD;
"0 I should like it !" said Faith. "But I should be&#xD;
afraid of its getting broken, Dr. Harrison."&#xD;
"I am not afraid," said he. "It would be in 1  ,danger&#xD;
there than here. As I told you, Sophy neither  s nor&#xD;
cares anything about such things; and she wo  either&#xD;
kill them with kindness or forget them altogether-most&#xD;
likely do both alternately. But with you they would be&#xD;
safe, for the simple reason that you love them."&#xD;
The sunbeams had left the window before Faith was at&#xD;
all aware of the passing away of the afternoon. And then,&#xD;
for once to her joy, Miss Harrison could not be found.&#xD;
They set out to walk home, and had got half way when a&#xD;
little rush of footsteps came up behincj/them, and Reuben&#xD;
and Sam passed by, arm in arm; o  ather half by-then&#xD;
paused and said good evening.&#xD;
" have you seen Mr. Linden to-night, Dr. Harrison ?"&#xD;
said Sam.&#xD;
"Good evening, sir I" said the doctor. "Have I the&#xD;
honour of knowing you?"&#xD;
"I should think you might," said Sam, in a tone not At&#xD;

'  him to-night, doctor?"&#xD;
"I should think I might, too," said Dr. Harrison looking&#xD;
t coolly over the 'young giant.' "Allow me to observe,&#xD;
i that 'to-night' is not come yet."&#xD;
"Did you ever 1" said Sam in an aside to Reuben, who&#xD;
* had stood perfectly still without speaking. "Well any time&#xD;
since he got home then, sir ?"&#xD;
"No, sir."&#xD;

"No, Reuben--I am just going horpe What's the&#xD;
matter ?"&#xD;
"Why he fainted in school--.wthat's all," said Sam,. "he&#xD;
said there was nothing the niatter.  Only we were go&#xD;
down to see how he got home, and I thought maybe&#xD;
doctor might tell us first." And not staying for more word&#xD;
the two boys walked on a few steps, then set off and soon&#xD;
ran themselves out of sight.&#xD;
The other two quickened their walk, the doctor mode&#xD;
ating his steps however to suit the strength of his com"&#xD;
panion.. But she soon took the lead, and Mrs. Derrick's&#xD;
house was reached in as short a space of time as the ground&#xD;
might be travelled without a speed which Faith did not dare&#xD;
assumear&#xD;
There vas nothing alarming in the little parlour. Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick sat knitting; Mr. Linden had been reading  rs'&#xD;
Ik                              gn, but&#xD;
now was talking-half laughing, half chiding--with the&#xD;
two boys who stood before him. Reuben stood silent,&#xD;
smiling a little; Sam's energy was at work.&#xD;
Faith came in quietly, with a face to which all her quick&#xD;
walk had not brought back the colour. She said noth-&#xD;
ing. But the doctor's tongue was free.&#xD;
"Why what's this Linden ?"&#xD;
"T-i- -s'id -h't&#xD;
This is-Liden-" said that gentleman coolly. "No&#xD;
boys-go off,-.I think I can live without seeing either of&#xD;
you again till to-morrow. What's the 'matter, Dr Harri.&#xD;
son ?"&#xD;
"Just and precisely what I was asking," said the doctor;&#xD;
while Faith glided to her mother and sitting down by her&#xD;
whispered enquiry. But Mrs. Derrick knew nothing-had&#xD;
heard nothing, apparently.&#xD;
"It's for you to state the case-""said Mr. Linden "You&#xD;
speak as if you had a warrant of arrest in our pocket "&#xD;
"Why " said the doctor, standing and looking down upon&#xD;
him,-" here's a wind that has blown from nowhere! Do&#xD;
you want me to lodge information against yourself ?"&#xD;
"I don't wish to lodge any."&#xD;
"Linden," said the doctor changing his tone to one of&#xD;
serious kidly interest, while Faith's eyes from her more&#xD;
disan set w ainorth daanswer,-"what is the matter?&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
"What nonsense have those boys been talking?" s id&#xD;
Mr. Linden-but his look carried the charge a little beyond.&#xD;
the range of his words. "I was faint for awhile-not quite&#xD;
in a 'deadly swownd,' however."&#xD;
"That young -scapegrace said and declared . you had&#xD;
fainted."&#xD;
"They are so used to their own red cheeks, they think&#xD;
red is 'the only colour," said Mr. Linden. "However, I&#xD;
believe he spoke true-but it was nothing worth speaking&#xD;
of, after all."&#xD;
"What was the c  se?".&#xD;
"I presumed a little upon the successful way in which I&#xD;
got through yesterday-tried to do a little too much to-day,&#xD;
had one or two things to try me-and so. Which of my&#xD;
boys do you honour with that title of scapegrace ?"&#xD;
"You musn't do so again," said the doctor seriously.&#xD;
There was no malice prepense to-day," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"What have you been about all the afternoon ?-I expect&#xD;
to hear that you have sailed up the Great Pyramid in a&#xD;
canal boat, or coasted Japan in a Chinese lantern."&#xD;
5  , "Nearly right," said the doctor. "We have been enact-&#xD;
tifinhe part of the wise men of Gotham-I can't imagine&#xD;
where I ever heard of them !.-.-who went to sea in a tub."&#xD;
"Went to see-what ?-" said Mr. Lindenlaughing.&#xD;
"Went to Se-vast-a-pooll!" said the doctor with&#xD;
perfect gravIly. "I hope you're better !"&#xD;
P "Don't I look well ?"&#xD;
"If I were to take the votes on that subject," said the&#xD;
i   doctor, "I presume the verdict would be unanimous. But&#xD;
looks are proverbially-unsatisfactory! Do you know what&#xD;
y  damage you have done me by your exploit this afternoon ?'&#xD;
"I should be very glad to hear."&#xD;
"Why you have brought me into discredit and disfavour&#xD;
with half Pattaquasset, man, because I have let you go out&#xD;
too! soon-don't you see ? Mrs. Derrick has already laid&#xD;
it to her account against me-which is getting to be a score&#xD;
I shall never dare to foot up."&#xD;
Faith had left the room for a minute, and coming back&#xD;
agan began to make ready the table for tea. Dr. Harrison's&#xD;
eyes followed her. She was not looking as she had looked&#xD;
at his anemones; quiet, sweet, and grave, she went rouno.&#xD;

gathering up the books, and arranging the cups and plates.&#xD;
But the doctor, though asked, would not stay. He went&#xD;
off and the tea was brought in.&#xD;
"Miss Faith," said Mr. Linden, "if you are half as ready&#xD;
for that exercise as I am, we shall get on superbly to-night."&#xD;
She almost started.&#xD;
"You, Mr. Linden!, Oh you're not fit for it !"&#xD;
"Not fit for it !-Miss Faith, how can you say that to&#xD;
me?"-&#xD;
"Let it be so to-night, Mr. Linden !"&#xD;
"I shall do nothing of the kind, Miss Faith, by your&#xD;
leave. You know I can rest here most comfortably, and&#xD;
make you work-after the same fashion, I hope. J am a&#xD;
little afraid," he said looking at her, "that you are working&#xD;
too much."&#xD;
"Why, Mr. Linden? How could I ?"&#xD;
"By not keeping your studies well balanced with fresh&#xD;
air."&#xD;
"0 no !" she said smiling. "The work is a great deal&#xD;
better than the fresh air. Besides, I have been out to-day."&#xD;
"You might as well say that bread is a great deal better&#xD;
than water. Yes, you have been out to-day, that is one,&#xD;
good thing. And I shall try to throw somewhat into that&#xD;
scale myself, if I live. But I want all 'the books to-night,&#xD;
Miss Faith-and to-morrow, you know, is a half holiday,&#xD;
but you need not expect to have one."   *&#xD;
Faith's tea went on after that in a manifestly different&#xD;
manner. Expeditiously the table was cleared after tea!&#xD;
And if ever Faith wrought with eager care to do perfec-&#xD;
tions and save her teacher every word and thought that&#xD;
could be spared, she did it then. So the exercise was.&#xD;
written, with most earnest guarding against anything 'ger-&#xD;
man' or 'sophisticated' in her letters.  Indeed Faith's&#xD;
handwriting, by dint of taking pains, was fast growing into&#xD;
stiff correctness-not without a certain beauty, of promise&#xD;
at least, but stiff still. And with all her other lessons, of&#xD;
thought or memory; what earnest quick effort could do was&#xD;
done that night, and done upon the back of a sound prep-&#xD;
aration.                  ,.&#xD;
Mr. Linden however did not spare mself words, not&#xD;
much, and care not at all: watching and guiiding his pretty&#xD;
&#xD;
scholar with equal gravity, gentleness, and attention; rarely&#xD;
,   diverging from the business view of the subject, unless&#xD;
Faith grew timid or frightened, in which case he indulged&#xD;
 himself with making her laugh, and so brought her back to&#xD;
business again. What views Mrs. Derrick took of the two,&#xD;
thus engaged, it would be hard to say; save that they were&#xD;
wondrous pleasant ones-a little puzzled, a little thoughtful,&#xD;
loving and pleased to the last degree.' How much she&#xD;
studied those two faces !-not Faith herself bestowed more&#xD;
care upon what she was about. But Faith came to con-&#xD;
clusions-Mrs. Derrick never did; wanting help from the&#xD;
very person who cleared the path of learning for herdaughter.&#xD;
His face-its gravity, its changes-she could not read; but&#xD;
she liked the study.&#xD;
The doctor's plan about the Aquarium was excessively&#xD;
distasteful to Mrs. Derrick. She read the meaning and&#xD;
grounds of it, which Faith entirely failed to read; but then&#xD;
to give them to her was hardly an advisable thing. So&#xD;
the Aquarium came, after a few days; and Faith having&#xD;
found that Mr. Linden could give her some help, if necess&#xD;
sary, in the care of it, relieved her mind of all concern about&#xD;
the responsibility and took the full good of the trust. In&#xD;
a sunny window it was placed, and many a happy minute&#xD;
between the times of other things Faith stood or sat there&#xD;
to watch the unfolding and shrinking Anemones, and the&#xD;
restless, eager, wild lives of the other and more distinctly&#xD;
animal inhabitants of this little section of Ocean. The&#xD;
only uncomfortable thing about it was that other people&#xD;
sometimes saw it and heard how it came there; and other&#xD;
people, Faith knew, drew very ridiculous inferences from&#xD;
nothing. And though ridiculous they were disagreeable.&#xD;
But however, she knew best how it came there and how&#xD;
simple a matter it wag; and it was never the way of her&#xD;
simplicity to trouble itself overmuch about ridiculous things.&#xD;
Another person, it may be remarked, knew how it got&#xD;
there; and he found it pleasant to come and see it some-&#xD;
times. This was generally in the afternoon, now, when Mr.&#xD;
Linden was not at home and Faith was not occupied in&#xD;
household duties. Pleasant talks were held over the Aqua-&#xD;
rium; for there was never an end of things that might be&#xD;
told of old and new discoveries codnne cted w th what was&#xD;

in it. The conversations diverged often to other matters,&#xD;
religious or scientific as the case might be; and were clever,&#xD;
bright, interesting, or amusing accordingly-and invariably.&#xD;
And so the time wore on towards the 29th. But in the&#xD;
fourth week of Mr. Linden's return to school duties, Faith&#xD;
began to have a new lesson-or rather she had it once and&#xD;
practised upon it many times.  That once was at the end&#xD;
of a Wednesday afternoon, in exquisite Indian summer&#xD;
weather; when other subjects being dismissed for the time,&#xD;
Mr. Linden gave his scholar an interesting and precise&#xD;
account of the process of respiration; passing thence to the&#xD;
obvious benefits of fresh air, 'and finally requesting her to&#xD;
put on her things and come out and take them. After which,&#xD;
it may be observed, Faith was never heard to say that studies&#xD;
yere "a great deal better than fresh air,"-often as the walk,&#xD;
was repeated.&#xD;
The other lessons made beautiful headway. Even the&#xD;
French talks at dinner. That was harder to Faith than&#xD;
any other trial to which she had been put. She shrank&#xD;
from it with great shrinking. But the desire to please her&#xD;
teacher overcame even fear.  Rather than not do that,--&#xD;
Faith ventured, right or wrong; and once fairly launched,&#xD;
of course, with his good help and her own endeavours, soon&#xD;
got into smoother sailing.&#xD;
Mr. Linden and the doctor now met not often; the doctor&#xD;
making his visits, as has been said, during school time. They&#xD;
met oftenest where the doctor went seldomest,-in those&#xD;
rooms where Dr. Harrison did sometimes let his profession&#xD;
call him, where Mr. Linden was drawn by somewhat beyond&#xD;
profession.  Sometimes this intercourse was only of the&#xD;
eye,-sometimes they walked home together; the curious&#xD;
friendship between them deepening, as it seemed, from all&#xD;
sources.&#xD;
Come home when Mr. Linden would, his room looked as&#xD;
if somebody had just stepped out of it. The fire was always&#xD;
in its best beauty; the hearth guiltless of ashes; the tem-&#xD;
perature genial whatever the weather out of doors might&#xD;
be ; the books, the papers, the table, in their wonted order&#xD;
or disorder, as fresh as if dust never fell  But the fairy of&#xD;
the place was always oiut of sight. *I&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXI.&#xD;
T HE 29th of November came on Wednesday, which per-&#xD;
mitted Mrs. Stoutenburgh to have her dinner at an&#xD;
earlier hour than would else have been possible. To this&#xD;
dinner the two older guests were invited-the boys were&#xD;
only to come to supper; and four o'clock was the time.&#xD;
Till near three, studies and reading were in full force,&#xD;
but then other duties claimed attention.&#xD;
"If I could only sit next you at dinner, Miss Faith," Mr.&#xD;
Linden said as he shut up the books, "we could talk French&#xD;
all the time 1-but there is no hope of that. And Miss&#xD;
Faith-" he said as she turned to go upstairs, "do. you&#xD;
know that all the things on my table are not in their proper&#xD;
place?"&#xD;
Very much wondering, Faith was for a moment at a&#xD;
loss.&#xD;
"What is wrong, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"I would not give it so harsh a name, Miss Faith-only&#xD;
I thought perhaps you would go in there before I come up&#xD;
and see that all is left just as usual,-if you would be so&#xD;
good."&#xD;
Faith went up, querying with herself whether Cindy&#xD;
could perhaps have been in there and committed some dire&#xD;
damage-or what it could be.&#xD;
What could it [-if ever a room was scrupulously in&#xD;
order, that was; and. the table-it, had not been stirred,&#xD;
nor a book upon it, since Faith's arranging hands ha been&#xD;
there. - Even writing implements were not laid abo t, as&#xD;
they often were,-the table was just as usual. Unless&#xD;
Yes, in front of the books stood a glass of water, and&#xD;
therein one dark velvet rose, truly of a 'Cramoisi supe-&#xD;
rieure,' failing to support itself upon its own green leaves,&#xD;
laid its face half coquettishly and half wearily upon dark&#xD;
sprigs of heliotrope and myrtle. Thence it looked at Faith.&#xD;
And Faith looked at it, with a curious smile of recognition,&#xD;
and yet of doubt,.-whether that could possibly be what he&#xD;
meant. But she was to see that all things were 'left just as&#xD;

usual'; it did not admit of a serious question. So lifting&#xD;
the glass and the rose, Faith and it went off together.&#xD;
IPaith's best dress, of course put on for this occasion, was&#xD;
a black silk. She had thought that a little extravagant at&#xD;
the time it was got; but Mrs. Derrick would have it., It&#xD;
was made with the most absolute plainness, high in the&#xD;
neck, where the invariable little white ruffle graced the&#xD;
white throat; but the sleeves were short, and similar white&#xD;
ruffles softened the dividing line between them and the well&#xD;
rounded fair arms. Her hair was as usual, her feet were&#xD;
as usual, only the shoes were of fresh neatness; but when&#xD;
Faith had with eyes that saw only them\, not herself, fast-&#xD;
ened the rose and myrtle on the bosom of her dress, a little&#xD;
figure stood there that in its soft angles and exquisite pro.&#xD;
priety of attire would have been noted in any circle of splen.&#xD;
dour, and might have satisfied the most fastidious lover of&#xD;
elegance. Wrapped up and hooded Faith went down&#xD;
stairs, and Mr. Linden put her in the Stoutenburgh car-&#xD;
riage, which rolled off to the mansion of the same name&#xD;
in a very short space of time.&#xD;
In solitary grandeur Faith was ushered into Mrs..Stout.&#xD;
enburgh's bedroom, where first the fire kept her company,&#xD;
and then Mrs. Stoutenburgh herself came in from another&#xD;
door and both unwrapped her and wrapt her up ! But&#xD;
when all that could be done was done, Mrs. Stoutenburgh&#xD;
ran off again, and told Faith, laughing, that she hadn't&#xD;
seen her yet-and was all ready for her in the parlour.&#xD;
Faiti being left to herself stepped out into the passage,&#xD;
where Mr. Linden was standing with folded arms before a&#xD;
window that looked out upon the closing November day.&#xD;
Faith came softly up beside him.&#xD;
"I've seen Mrs. Stoutenburgh," she said; "but she says&#xD;
she hasn't seen me. Are your flowers right now, Mr.&#xD;
Linden ?"&#xD;
"Miss Faith ! why do you wear velvet shoes ?"--he said&#xD;
turning full upon her. "You have not been down stairs ?"&#xD;
"No, certainly. I saw Mrs. Stoutenburgh up here.n"&#xD;
"Then shall I have the pleasure of taking you downy?-&#xD;
I see nothing that is not right," he added smiling.&#xD;
It was rather an odd new thing to Faith, to be taken&#xD;
owor. in, anywhere. The form of having a gentleman's&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
arm was something rather startling. But she did not-shew&#xD;
it. Down stairs they went, into the glowing parlour,&#xD;
where Faith was met and greeted by Mrs. Stoutenburgh de&#xD;
nouveau.&#xD;
"Ah Miss Faith !" said the Squire as he gave her his&#xD;
salutation, "how extravagant you a e to add roses to roses&#xD;
in that style ! Don't you know it' a waste of material ?"&#xD;
"No, sir. I shall use it all up."&#xD;
-     " I should like to see you after you get through !" said&#xD;
Mr. Stoutenburgh laughing., "Ask Mr. Linden if it's not&#xD;
waste."&#xD;
Mr. Linden however entirely declined to assent to any&#xD;
such p oposition,-nay, even hinted that if any one was to&#xD;
be changed with wasting roses just then, it was the Squire&#xD;
himself.&#xD;
"Yes, I think so too!" said Mrs. Stoutenburgh,-"but&#xD;
how funnily you always see through things and turn them&#xD;
about!"&#xD;
"Roses are not very opaque things to see through," he&#xD;
answered smiling, while Mrs. Stoutenburgh rescued Faith&#xD;
and putting her arm round her drew her off towards the&#xD;
sofa. Where Faith was glad to get at a distance from the&#xD;
rose-consumers. She felt rather nervous.&#xD;
"Where is Sam ?" she asked. "This is his day, isn't&#xD;
it?"&#xD;
"lHe was here a minute ago," said his mother,-" I guess&#xD;
he ran off when he heard you coming. He takes fits of&#xD;
being bashful once in a while,-they don't last long. Your&#xD;
mother wasn't afraid to let you come with our horses, was&#xD;
she0?"&#xD;
"No ma'am," Faith said,-"not at all. But she hasn't&#xD;
got back her old trust in horses and carriages generally.&#xD;
I wish she had.&#xD;
I don't-" said Nrs. Stoutenburgh,-"they're not to&#xD;
be trusted generally, child. Has your horse got well yet ?"&#xD;
"Not well. Mr. Skip says he's better, but we can't use&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"Well I wanted to talk to you about that-Mr. Stouten-&#xD;
burgh's been at me to do it this month. You know we've&#xD;
always got more horses on hand than we can use-anzd&#xD;
there's one of 'em that would just suit you. Won't you&#xD;

let him stand in your stable this winter ?-and give Crab a&#xD;
[          chance."&#xD;
" 0 no, Mrs. Stoutenburgh !.-.thank you !" said Faith,&#xD;
"I dare say C ab will get better-it won't be necessary;&#xD;
and you know  re don't ride much in winter. You're very&#xD;
kind to think of it."&#xD;
There- you are-as usual !" said Mrs. Stoutenburgh.&#xD;
"I'm always afraid to ask you anything, you keep such&#xD;
magnifying glasses. But now Faith, listen to reason. Not&#xD;
ride in winter !-why it's the very time for riding, if there's&#xD;
snow; and you could drive Jerry, or your mother could,&#xD;
just as well as Crab-he's as quiet as he can be. At the&#xD;
same time," said Mrs. Stoutenburgh with a little dance in&#xD;
her eyes, "if anybody else drives him, he can go a little&#xD;
faster."&#xD;
"I'll tell mother how good you are, Mrs.; Stoutenburgh.&#xD;
It isn't my business to give answers for her. But did you&#xD;
ever see me drive ?"&#xD;
"Not horses," said Mrs. Stoutenburgh laughing.&#xD;
"Not anything else, I am sure ? I used to want to go&#xD;
after the cows, but mother never would let me."&#xD;
But whatever Mrs. Stoutenburgh meant she did not&#xD;
explain, for dinner was announced, and the Squire came&#xD;
up to take possession of Faith again;.receiving his wife's&#xD;
little whispered "I've done it !" with all her own satisfac-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
In the dining-room Sam was at last visible, but the bash-&#xD;
ful fit had not gone off, and Faith's black silk was even&#xD;
more distracting than her white muslin. Her greeting of&#xD;
him was simple enough to have been reassuring.&#xD;
"I hope.you will be as happy a great many times as you&#xD;
are to-day, Sam," she said as she shook hands with him.&#xD;
"On the 29th of November, I mean."&#xD;
Perhaps Sam thought that doubtful-perhaps impos-&#xD;
sible,-perhaps undesirable. At all events his. words were&#xD;
ew; and though he was permitted the post of honour at&#xD;
faith's side, he did not do much for her entertainment at&#xD;
first.&#xD;
The dinner itself, service and style and all included, was&#xD;
sufficiently like the Squire and his wife. Handsome and&#xD;
substantial, free, bountiful, and with a sort of laughing an'r&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
'   of good cheer about it which more ceremony would have&#xD;
overed up. There was no lack of talk, either,-L-all the&#xD;
company having the ability therefor, and then, at least, the&#xD;
inclination. But if Mr. Linden now and then called Sam&#xD;
out of his abstraction, so did the Squire attack Faith;&#xD;
giving her a little sword play to parry as best she might.&#xD;
"Miss Faith," he said, "do you know to what a point&#xD;
you are, day by day, winding tip the curiosity of this town&#xD;
of Pattaquasset ?"&#xD;
"I, sir !" said Faith, apparently, by her eye and air,&#xD;
occupying the lace of the centre of motion to all this&#xD;
curiosity ;-the point of absolute rest.&#xD;
"My dear,"sal the Squire, "they sa  wo things about&#xD;
you! The first is that you never go o . Now don't&#xD;
trouble yourself to contradict that, but just tell me the&#xD;
reason. We're all friends here, you know."&#xD;
"Why I go out very often indeed, Mr. Stoutenburgh!"&#xD;
said Faith.&#xD;
"Didn't I tell you not to contradict me ? AhhMiss&#xD;
Faith !-young ladies never will take advice ! Well-the&#xD;
first thing is, as I said, that you never go out. The second,"&#xD;
said the Squire laughing, "is-that you do 1"&#xD;
"Well sir," said Faith merrily,-"they can't both be&#xD;
true-and there isn't anything very bad about either of&#xD;
them. Nor very curious, either, I think."&#xD;
"What I should like to know," said Mr. Linden, "is,&#xD;
who keeps watch at the gate ?"&#xD;
"Squire Deacon does, for one," said Sam promptly. "I&#xD;
see him there often enough."&#xD;
"When you come to relieve the guard ?" said Mr. Lin--&#xD;
den smiling. And the laugh was turned for the moment,&#xD;
rather to Sam's confusion.&#xD;
"So that's what the Squire's come back for, is it ?" said&#xD;
Mr. Stoutenburgh. "I thought somebody was .to blame&#xD;
for his going away."&#xD;
"Nobody was much to blame," said Mrs. Stoutenburgh.&#xD;
"I had a long talk with Sam the other day-Sam Dea-&#xD;
con, I mean," said the Squire, "and he was keen to get&#xD;
acquainted with Dr. Harrison. And as the doctor came&#xD;
along just then, I gave him a chance. I guess the doctor&#xD;
blessed me for it !-I did him. By the way, Miss Faith,&#xD;

I s'pose you've got acquainted with the doctor by this&#xD;
time ?"&#xD;
Yes-sir-very well-" Faith said quietly, though she&#xD;
felt the ground uneasy and unsafe.&#xD;
"Well what sort of a chap is he ?--up to anything be'&#xD;
sides running away with all he can lay his hands on ?"&#xD;
"Don't you know him, Mr. Stoutenburgh ?"&#xD;
"Can't say I do, Miss Faith,-it rather strikes me he's&#xD;
not anxious I should."&#xD;
"How can he be anxious, sir, when you are not ?" said&#xD;
Mr. Linden. "Isn't that expecting too much ?"&#xD;
The Squire laughed.&#xD;
"I don't expect too much of him," he said,-" and don't&#xD;
you expect too little. After all, I'd as soon take a boy's&#xD;
mind as a man's-and he Pnt popular among the boys. I&#xD;
thought he would be, after that exhibition-but he aint."&#xD;
Which remark Mr. Linden knew to be true,. though he&#xD;
did not say so.&#xD;
"Well, Mr. Stoutenburgh! if you don't like him why do&#xD;
you talk about him ?"said his wife. "Faith-you can play&#xD;
blind man's buff, I'm sure ?"&#xD;
"Wait a bit,-wait a bit," said the Squire-" I'm not&#xD;
ready to be blinded yet, if she is. You ladies are always&#xD;
in such a hurry ! Now Mr. Linden and, I want to have&#xD;
our ideas ,cleared up. What sort of a man is the doctor,&#xD;
Miss Faith? You say you know him 'very well,'--.do you&#xD;
like him 'very much'?"&#xD;
This shot brought Fith to a stand and obliged her, to&#xD;
be sure, to 'shew her \olours,' which she did bravely.&#xD;
Nevertheless she faced th Squire and answered steadily.&#xD;
"I like him a good deM1, Mr. Stou:tenburgh-.in some&#xD;
respects very much."&#xD;
" Hum-" said the- Squire, as he cut a persuasive piece&#xD;
of duck and putit on her plate  "Well wouldn't you like&#xD;
to tell me, my dear, what you mean by 'some respects' ?--&#xD;
That's Mrs. Stoutenburgh's word, and I never could find&#xD;
out yet."&#xD;
"I suppose it means different things in different cases "&#xD;
said Faith smiling.&#xD;
"Did you ever ?"-said the Squire, taking a generpd sur-&#xD;
vey of the table, which began with Faith and ended with&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Linden. "Aint that half of creation up to anything ?&#xD;
I tell you what, Miss Faith, if I'd been in that meadow&#xD;
otherr day, I'd have made Mazeppa of the doctor in no&#xD;
time,-Sam hasn't learnt to put his history in practice yet.&#xD;
And besides,"-said the Squire, with a peculiarly slow, inno-&#xD;
cent enunciation, "he never likes to do anything that would&#xD;
displease Mr. Linden !"&#xD;
"Mr. Stoutenburgh !" said his wife, though she was&#xD;
laughing merrily herself, "Can't you be quiet?  Faith,&#xD;
why don't you answer me&#xD;
"What, Mrs. Stoutenburgh ?"+Faith turned towards&#xD;
her a face from which, gentle as it was, the smile had dis-&#xD;
appeared.&#xD;
ap"You play blind man's buff, don't you, dear ?"&#xD;
"When I can," skid Faith.&#xD;
"The real question, Miss Faith," said Mr. Linden, whose&#xD;
grave unmoved look---unmoved unless by a little fear that&#xD;
she might be annoyed-would have been some help to her&#xD;
during her cross-examination if she had seen it,-"the real&#xD;
question is, whether you are willing to play to-night."&#xD;
"I am as willing as can be," said Faith.&#xD;
"I don't know whether they'll want to play it," said&#xD;
Mrs. Stoutenburgh, "but they may; and Sam's never con-&#xD;
tent unless I'm in the fun, whatever it is."&#xD;
"Of course Miss Faith will play," said the Squire,-&#xD;
"she never refuses to please anybody."&#xD;
"Mr. Linden said he would," said Sam.&#xD;
"But how shall you and I manage, Faith ?" said Mrs.&#xD;
Stoutenburgh. "They'd tell us in a minute by our dresses&#xD;
-as there are only two of us."&#xD;
Faith pondered this difficulty with an amused face.&#xD;
"Sam must lend us some of his jackets or coats, Mrs.&#xD;
Stoutenburgh. Our heads are the worst,-or mine is-&#xD;
you and Sam might be mistaken for each other."&#xD;
'But there'd be no use in Miss Faith's disguising her-&#xD;
self;" said Sam naively, "because she's so sweet."&#xD;
"You wouldn't have her disguise that, would you, Sam?"&#xD;
said Mr. Linden laughing.&#xD;
"What a boy 1" said his mother,-"and what a reflec-&#xD;
tion upon me !"&#xD;
"Why I meant her flowers !" said Sam,-"yof needn't&#xD;

all laugh so. I don't mean either that I didn't mean-,,)&#xD;
but what more he meant Sam left unsaid, which did not&#xD;
much stay the laughter.&#xD;
"'I will appoint two or three boys to play the part of&#xD;
the pigeon in hawking," said Mr. Linden, -"Miss Faith&#xD;
might get tired of being caught, if not of running away."&#xD;
"How do you know that, Mr. Linden ?" she said a little&#xD;
archly.&#xD;
" Truly," he answered, "I know it not-but most things&#xD;
are possible, even in blind man's buff. And all boys are&#xD;
not provided with silk gloves. But you shall not comnplaiu&#xD;
of not being caught-I promise you that."&#xD;
"Again !" she said with another soft flash of her eye,&#xD;
though now she coloured. "Don't you understand, Mr.&#xD;
Linden, that I don't intend to let anybody catch me ?--if&#xD;
I can help it."&#xD;
"Miss Faith, I have the most entire confidence in your,&#xD;
intentions !"&#xD;
Faith kept her energies for action, and said no more.&#xD;
And in a very harmonious temper the whole party left the&#xD;
dinner table and went back to the fire-lit parlour. All but&#xD;
Sam, who went to be ready for his particular guests in&#xD;
another room.&#xD;
His place was presently supplied by a new-coiner. There&#xD;
was a step in the hall-then the parlour door opened, and&#xD;
a little lady with a shawl round her shoulders, came in.&#xD;
"Good evening !" she said in a very cheery voice. "Why&#xD;
I didn't expect to find so many of you ! Is it a party,&#xD;
Mrs. Stoutenburgh,-and shall I go away ? or will you let&#xD;
me come in, now I've got here ?"&#xD;
"Come in, come in, Miss Essie, and make it a party,"&#xD;
said the Squire; while Mrs. Stoutenburgh took off the&#xD;
-shawl and answered,&#xD;
"Go away? why of course not ! It's only Sam's birth-&#xD;
da--you're not afraid of boys, I guess."&#xD;
"I'm not afraid, of anything," said Miss Essie, and her&#xD;
bright black eyes said it.too. "Isn't that Mr. Linden ?-.yes,&#xD;
I thought so. And Faith Derrick !-my! child, how you're&#xD;
dressed. What sort of a party have you got, Mrs. S.?".&#xD;
" Why, boys!1" said Mrs. Stoutenburgh, while Mr. Lin-&#xD;

"Good evening, Miss Essie-you know I am one of&#xD;

"Are you? I don't know much abou you, except by&#xD;
hearsay, you know. I am glad you are ere to-night. I&#xD;
shall study you, Mr. Linden."&#xD;
Mr. Linden bowed his ack  wledgments.&#xD;
"Will you want myhelp, Miss Essie ?"&#xD;
She laughed. "Come1" said she-" don't get on too&#xD;
fast! I am beginning to like you already. What are the&#xD;
boys doing, Mrs. Stoutenburgh?  Sam's birthday, did you&#xD;
sayn"&#xD;
" Yes, it's Sam's birthday,--I don't suppose they're&#xD;
doing much yet except coming," said Mrs. Stoutenburgh.&#xD;
"What they will do, no mortal can say."&#xD;
"And you'll let them do anything ! It must be a nice&#xD;
thing to be a boy, with such a mother as Mrs. Stouten-&#xD;
burgh, Mr. Linden."&#xD;
His "yes" came readily enough, but was unaccom-&#xD;
panied with -any other word whatever.  Mrs. Stouten-&#xD;
burgh's "Do hush !"-was sufficiently energetic though&#xD;
very low.&#xD;
"How old is Sam ?" was the instant question, as if the&#xD;
whisper had referred to him.&#xD;
"0 Sam can't get beyond fourteen till he's twenty," said&#xD;
Mrs. Stoutenburgh laughing. "I suppose by that time I&#xD;
sha'n't care how old he is."&#xD;
"I know who thinks he's a handsome fellow !" said Miss&#xD;
Essie shaking her head,-" and that's not you, Mrs. S. ' I&#xD;
know he's a smart one, for I pinned a blue ribband to his&#xD;
coat once. I wonder if he loves me properly for it.--&#xD;
Faith Derrick, how come you to be here, child ?"&#xD;
"Why because Mrs. Stoutenburgh asked me," said Faith,&#xD;
answering this sudden address with some surprise.&#xD;
"Wrong1" said Miss Essie. "There's some mistake&#xD;
about it. I've just come from hearing you talked of."&#xD;
"Whom did you hear, Miss Essie ?" said the Squire.&#xD;
"Come-give up your authority."&#xD;
"I was at Judge Harrison's," said Miss Essie, after a&#xD;

Linden, what do you think of the propriety of people's&#xD;
talking about people ?"&#xD;
"I think well of the propriety, when it exists."&#xD;
"Well what do you think of its existence?  Honestly,&#xD;
now. I want to get at your opinion."&#xD;
"I think its existence is rather limited and precarious,&#xD;
Miss Essie," said Mr..Linden smiling.  "It is. one of those&#xD;
things that may be said to have a delicate constitution."&#xD;
" Well," said Miss Essie again, smiling too, both with lips&#xD;
and eyes,-" how could people get along in such a place as&#xD;
Pattaquasset, for instance, without it ? People must talk.&#xD;
And it is so pleasant toknow that Mrs. Stoutenburgh's&#xD;
son Sam is fifteen years old and had a party on his birth-&#xD;
day; and that Mr. Linden and Miss Derrick were there&#xD;
and eat roast turkey; -and to know that Miss Essie de&#xD;
Staff went to New York to get a new carpet for her best&#xD;
room and what the new style is;-and that Miss Faith&#xD;
Derrick was run away with and brought home again, and&#xD;
went through adventures. How could we do without talk-&#xD;
ing of these things? Now perhaps you will say it's im-&#xD;
moral; but I'm in favour of a possible morality; and I&#xD;
say, how could Pattaquasset get along without all this ?"&#xD;
"Pattaquasset could get along without some of the&#xD;
things, to start with," said the Squire. "I don't know&#xD;
what you call 'pleasant,' Miss Essie, but I never was so&#xD;
angry in my life-since some rascal told me Mrs. Stouten-&#xD;
burgh was going to marry somebody else," he added laughing.&#xD;
"But- I say," said Miss Essie, "how could Pattaquasset&#xD;
get along without tallcing of these things ?and I ask Mr.&#xD;
Linden. I want to know his opinion."&#xD;
"I will not say that it could," said Mr. Linden.-"Miss.&#xD;
Essie, you knew Pattaquasset better than I do."&#xD;
"Well do you think there is any harm in talking of&#xD;
them ?&#xD;
"What do you think of the modern definition of a young&#xD;
lawyer, Miss Essie-' a man who is where he has no busi-&#xD;
ness to be, because he has no business where he ought&#xD;
to be'?"&#xD;
Miss Essie laughed, and laughed.&#xD;
"Don't Sam get along fast with his reading and writing,&#xD;
Mr. Stoutenburgh ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Always did-:" said the Squire; "and with everything&#xD;
else too. What are you talking about?  I lost that. I'd&#xD;
gone off to that rascal-"&#xD;
Miss Essie's laugh rang out again and her eyes danced.&#xD;
"That rascal!  Now for shame, Mr. Stoutenburgh!&#xD;
You know better.   I wonder if you. never had young&#xD;
horses yourself, and took Mrs. Stoutenburgh to ride, too.&#xD;
Now I like him very much. Mr. Linden, you know. Dr.&#xD;
Harrison, don't you?"&#xD;
"I should-a little."&#xD;
"Well aren't you a judge of character'? Do you think&#xD;
he deserves to be called a rascal ?"&#xD;
But Squire Stoutenburgh prevented the answer. "I&#xD;
wish you'd jus stop and let me catch up with you, Miss&#xD;
Essie," he said. "Now before we go any further, whoever&#xD;
said he was a rascal ?-I didn't."&#xD;
"Did you mean somebody else, Mr. Stoutenburgh ?"&#xD;
"That's the way you talk over pleasant things !" said&#xD;
the Squire. "If I hadn't hallooed after you, Miss Essie,&#xD;
.I should have had a challenge from the doctor before morn-&#xD;
ing-or a shot,-that's getting to be the fashion."&#xD;
"Do you think Dr. Harrison is that kind of man ?" said&#xD;
Miss Essie. "Mr. Linden, what kind of man do you&#xD;
s  think he is?  You can tell better than the Squire, and I,&#xD;
want to know."&#xD;
i     "Miss Essie !-he is my friend and I am his,-you can-&#xD;
not expect me to give you Dr. Harrison's components-&#xD;
'each with its Latin label on'!"&#xD;
"Not at all! but in general, how would you characterize&#xD;
him, if asked what sort of a man he was !"&#xD;
"I should perhaps decline.&#xD;
Miss Essie had no. chance to push her question, for Sam&#xD;
came with a demand for Mr. Linden himself, which was at&#xD;
once obeyed.&#xD;
A little while passed, and then Mr. Linden came back&#xD;
again; and walked composedly round to the back of&#xD;
Faith's chair. "Mrs. Stoutenburgh," he said, "will you&#xD;
let me take this lady away for five minutes ?--Miss Faith,&#xD;
will you come ?"&#xD;
Nothing loth, if the truth must be told, Faith rose up&#xD;

go any further) the whole quotation which I did not dare&#xD;
to give Miss Essie, though it would not have been meant&#xD;
for her, if I had." And he took down one of the books,&#xD;
and read-&#xD;
"'Her eye,-it seems a chemic test,&#xD;
And drops upon you like an acid;&#xD;
It bites you with unconscious zest,&#xD;
So clear and bright, so coldly placid ;&#xD;
It holds you quietly aloof,&#xD;
It holds,-and yet it does not win you;&#xD;
It merely puts you to the proof&#xD;
And sorts what qualities are in you,' &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
'There you are classified: she's gone&#xD;
Far, far away into herself;&#xD;
Each with its Latin label on,&#xD;
Your poor components, one by one,&#xD;
Are laid. upon their proper shelf&#xD;
In her compact and ordered mind,' &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
'0 brain exact, that in thy scales&#xD;
rCaest weigh the sun and never err,&#xD;
For once thy patient science fails,&#xD;
One problem still defies thy art;-..-&#xD;
Thou never cast compute for her&#xD;
The distance and diameter&#xD;
Of any simple human heart.'&#xD;
That's comforting doctrine-isn't it ?" he said smiling as&#xD;
he put up the book.&#xD;
"How good that is !" said Faith, as much in the spirit&#xD;
of enjoyment as of criticism. 'But it isn't just Miss Essie.&#xD;
It's more like ".- She stopped.&#xD;
"Well-who ? No, it is not Mis*s Essie."&#xD;
"I was going to say, Mrs. Somers-but it is not Mrs,.&#xD;
Somers, either. She is more kind than that.n"&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.                 393&#xD;
"Yes, I think so-though she keeps her kindness under&#xD;
lock and key, like her sweetmeats. Miss Faith, shall I&#xD;
give you a loophole view of those boys-before you ven-&#xD;
ture yourself among them ?"&#xD;
She said yes, with a bright face that skewed her primed&#xD;
for any enjoyment, or anything else perhaps, he might pro-&#xD;
pose. He knew the house, apparently, and led her out of&#xD;
one door and in at another, giving her little undertone&#xD;
remarks by the way.&#xD;
'"I know you and I agree in some of our notions about&#xD;
pleasant things," he said,," or I should not presume that&#xD;
you would find this one. To some people, you know,&#xD;
boys are mere receivers for Latin and Greek-to  e they&#xD;
are separate little pieces of humanity. I study them Lite as&#xD;
much as they do their lessons. Now you shall se them&#xD;
off their guard. This room is dark-but I know the way."&#xD;
He took her hand as he spoke, and led her through the&#xD;
darkness to a spot of shaded light at the further end of&#xD;
$ the room, whence too came laughter and voices; then drew&#xD;
back the curtain from a sash door and let her look in.&#xD;
It was pleasant, as he said,-the room was glowing with&#xD;
light, the boys in a knot about the fire; some sitting, some&#xD;
standing, one or two couchant upon the rug. Sam was&#xD;
the spokesman just then-the rest listening, interrupting,&#xD;
applauding; the flashing firelight sewing such different&#xD;
faces ! such varied indications 1-they looked like a little&#xD;
Congress of representatives.&#xD;
"What are they doing, Mr. Lindn? Sam is having a&#xD;
good time !-and all the rest of them for that matter."&#xD;
"I am not quite sure what they are doing, Miss Faith,-&#xD;
Sam looks as if' he might be recounting some of his own&#xD;
exploits-for the twentieth time."&#xD;
"But Reuben, who never would recount one of his, is&#xD;
five times as much of a nan."&#xD;
Yes,-I wonder what Miss Essie would say of the two,&#xD;
Srespectively. She means to study me to-night, you know,"&#xD;
he said smiling-" and I- mean she shall! There comes&#xD;
Mrs. Stoutenburgh-now I shall take you in.".&#xD;
Not by the sash door, but round again by another way&#xD;
they came upon the little company. Mrs. Stoutenburgh&#xD;
had been in before, and her reappearance had not made&#xD;

much change in the order of things; but when Faith came&#xD;
in every boy rose to his feet, and the admiring looks were&#xD;
only bounded by the number of eyes. They fell back right&#xD;
and left as she came on towards the fire; and once seated&#xD;
there in an easy chair, those who knew her came up to pay&#xD;
their respects-those who did not stood still and paid them&#xD;
at a distance, whispering and touching each other with,&#xD;
"My ! a'int she handsome !"-&#xD;
All of which amused at least two of the lookers-on.&#xD;
One or two of the boys Mr. Linden brought up and pre-&#xD;
sented. Faith however was presently out of her chair of&#xD;
state and wdund in and out among them, speaking to.&#xD;
thpse whom she knew or remembered at Neanticut. She&#xD;
wis in a little gale of good-fellowship by the time Mr.&#xD;
Linden with Miss Essie. returned to the room.&#xD;
"Well!1" said Miss Essie. "Now what's the first order&#xD;
of things?  Mr. Linden, these are all your boys, I sup.&#xD;
pose ?".&#xD;
"These are all and not all, Miss Essie."&#xD;
"Yes. Do they always do what you tell them ?"&#xD;
"They are extraordinary boys !" said Mr. Linden. "Not&#xD;
one of them has a will of his own."&#xD;
"Oh !" said Miss Essie. "What has become of their&#xD;
wills?  Have you stolen them?  Now I am going to put&#xD;
that to the proof. Sam Stoutenburgh-you are not twenty&#xD;
years old yet, your mother says; have you a will of your own?"&#xD;
"Mother says I have," replied Sam.&#xD;
"Ah !-you see !" said Miss Essie. "You sir,-I know&#xD;
you but I don't remember you,-your teacher says you&#xD;
haven't a will of your own-now is it true ? I want to&#xD;
know."&#xD;
"A will of my own, ma'am'?" Reuben repeated, looking&#xD;
doubtfully from Miss Essie to Mr. Linden. "Against whose,&#xD;
if you please ?"&#xD;
"Well-" said Miss Essie, a little surprised, and laugh-&#xD;
ing-" upon honour, will you tell the truth ?"&#xD;
"I'll try, ma'am."&#xD;
"Against . r. Linden's. Now upon honour !-I'll go&#xD;
bail for you."&#xD;
The bail was not needed. Reuben's quiet "No, ma'am,&#xD;
and don't want to have," was very forcible. -&#xD;
&#xD;
"I declare !" said Miss Essie turning to Mr. Linden,.-&#xD;
"you're a wonderful man !-For of course Sam's word is&#xD;
his mother's word, and that's nothing in the circumstances.&#xD;
I wish I had been so happy as to be a boy and go to&#xD;
school to you, Mr. Linden! All my life my trouble has&#xD;
been a will of my own; and I never found anybody that&#xD;
could deprive me of it."&#xD;
"Nor yourself ready to give it up ?"&#xD;
"Of- course ! but I never could, you know. It was&#xD;
stronger than I."&#xD;
"I'll tell you what," said Mrs. Stoutnburgh, coming&#xD;
up, "if you two people want to talk any more, you've got&#xD;
to stand out of the way,---Faith and I are going to have a&#xD;
game with these boys."&#xD;
"What sort of game ?"&#xD;
"Why blind man's buff," said Mrs. Stoutenburgh. "Sam&#xD;
.-go to my room and fetch that plaid ribband that lies on&#xD;
:4  the bed."&#xD;
"Now I'll tell you," said Mps Essie, "you must play&#xD;
this game as they do it up at Shckiaug. Any game wants&#xD;
a stake, you know, Mr. Stoutenburgh, to make it thoroughly&#xD;
interesting. You must play it this way. Everybody that&#xD;
e is caught and found, must answer any question the person&#xD;
catching chooses to ask. And if he refuses to answer, he&#xD;
r must answer some other question and give a reason for it.&#xD;
That'll make 'em fly round I"&#xD;
In the midst of a little general bustle that ensued, Faith&#xD;
was startled at finding that her rose and myrtle were gone.&#xD;
The next instant a hand'presented them unceremoniously&#xD;
under her face, and an abrupt voice announced, "Here's&#xD;
your flowers !"  It was even Phil Davids who had done it.&#xD;
Faith seized her flowers, and then sprang after Phil and&#xD;
thanked him very gratefully ; rightly hailing this civility as&#xD;
an omen for good. The flowers were next bestowed care-&#xD;
fully in a glass of water, to be in safety tilfthe play should&#xD;
beaver.&#xD;
Now began the fun of robing and disrobing. The ladies&#xD;
pinned up their silk skirts into order and quiet compass, and&#xD;
pulled on over their arms and shoulders whatever boys'&#xD;
gear would fit. Faith was jaunty in a little cloth jacket&#xD;
which covered her arms; Miss Essie wrapped about her&#xD;

a plaid travelling shawl of the Squire's. Mrs. Stouten.&#xD;
burgh deferred her disguising till she should need it, being&#xD;
in the first place to be the catcher, not the caught. Mr,&#xD;
Linden on his part chose to rely on his own resources for&#xD;
safety, but two or three of the boys tied on shawls and&#xD;
scarfs-soon discarded in the melee.&#xD;
If Sam's intent was to have a steady game of running;&#xD;
never to produce results-unless fatigue and laughter....h&#xD;
had well chosen the first 'catcher.' Mrs. Stoutenburgh's&#xD;
powers of entangle ent lay not in that line, though she&#xD;
ran about with the /nost utter good will and nierriment.&#xD;
But how the boys jumped over her arms !-or dived under&#xD;
them ! How Sam caught her round the waist, and even&#xD;
kissed her, regardless of danger ! She might have been&#xD;
playing till this time, if Mr. Linden had not interposed&#xD;
and gallantly suffered himself to be caught.&#xD;
"We'll have to step round now, I tell you!" said Qne of&#xD;
the boys,-"this'll be another guess sort of a run !"&#xD;
"Look out for yourself now, Miss Faith.!" said Reuben&#xD;
--both which things were profoundly true and necessary.&#xD;
.And Faith soon found out that she was the quarry-and that&#xD;
pigeons were of no avail. Whether Mr. Linden had heard&#xD;
her steps about his sick room till he had learned them by&#xD;
heart,-whether the theory of 'spirits touching' held good&#xD;
in this case,-he gave her a swift little run round the room,&#xD;
and shut her up gracefully in the corned. Then with the&#xD;
simplicity which characterized most of his proceedings,&#xD;
disregarding jacket and cap, he took hold of her hand and&#xD;
inquired,&#xD;
"Miss Faith-do you consider yourself disguised ?"&#xD;
The soft laugh which it was impossible to keep back,&#xD;
answered to his ear, as the flush which overspread Faith's&#xD;
face answered to eyes of the rest of the company.&#xD;
"That will do to begin with," he said as he took off the&#xD;
plaid ribband, while Mrs. Stoutenburgh laughed and&#xD;
clapped her hands after her own lively fashion.&#xD;
"But Miss Faith !" said Sam-"don't tie up your head,&#xD;
please 1-if you shut your eyes it will do just as well."&#xD;
"You can't see her eyes if they're shut, you foolish boy,"&#xD;
said Mr. Linden,-J'go oftf and attend to your own affairs.,&#xD;
Miss Faith, shall I tie this on-or do you wish for a deputy?"&#xD;

&#xD;
There is a great deal of character that comes out in a&#xD;
play! Miss Essie might have had excellent opportunity&#xD;
Y= for prosecuting her 'studies,' if she had not been busy on&#xD;
her own score. For Faith did not play like Mrs. Stouten-&#xD;
burgh. She played like herself-with a gentleness that&#xD;
never overstepped delicate bounds; but her foot was light&#xD;
and true, and her movements fearless ahd free as those of the&#xD;
very boys. It was a pretty game that she played. It would&#xD;
have been a short one, but that it was so hard to identify&#xD;
her captives. One boy after another Faith caught,"-to the&#xD;
feeling they were all alike ! At last her hand seized an-&#xD;
other prize, and her voice exclaimed, Mr. Stoutenburgh!&#xD;
There was a sharp change about now between the older&#xD;
and the younger people. Faith did her be t not to be&#xD;
caught again. But after half a dozen cha ges between&#xD;
Mr. Linden and the boys, he again had the pie sure of in-&#xD;
vesting her with the plaid ribband.&#xD;
May I give her the question ?" whispered  's Essie&#xD;
at Mr. linden's ear.&#xD;
"No indeed !" said.Mr. Linden.. "Miss Faith, what is&#xD;
the difference between a bird and a philosopher ?"&#xD;
Somewhat to the surprise as well as amusement of the,&#xD;
company, the answer to this was the heartiest, merriest bit&#xD;
of a laugh; then she said,&#xD;
"One looks round the corner, Mr. Linden !"&#xD;
"Well you won't see round the'corner now," he said&#xD;
softly and laughing as he tied on the ribband. "Miss&#xD;
Faith! do you mean to say I did ?"&#xD;
. She said 'no,' and ran away. But Faith was not in&#xD;
luck this time, for she caught Miss Essie. And Miss Essie&#xD;
in a few minutes got the chance she wanted at Faith. She&#xD;
wouldn't have had it, for Faith ran too well and vanished too&#xD;
skilfully; but a little knot of the boys getting into a knot&#xD;
just in her way and at the wrong time, Faith fell a prey.&#xD;
"Now," said her captor unbinding her ribband, "what do&#xD;
you think I am going to ask you ?"&#xD;
Faith was very doubtful on the subject, and waited in&#xD;
silence.&#xD;
"Only a matter of taste," said Miss Essie. " Who do&#xD;
you think".-(speaking slowly)-"is the handsomest mein&#xD;
in Pattaquasset ?"&#xD;

&#xD;
The colour mounted in Faith's cheeks too distinctly to&#xD;
leave any room for the doubt that no other answer was at&#xD;
hand. She avoided Miss Essie's black eyes.&#xD;
"Come !" said that lady.&#xD;
"I can't tell you,"-said Faith, amid the laughter of&#xD;
some of the company, which was enormous.&#xD;
"You can't !" said Miss Essie. "Now you are at my&#xD;
mercy. You have got to tell me something else and give&#xD;
your reason. What do you think is the best profession a&#xD;
man can follow ?"&#xD;
"Any one is good that is used right," said Faith, look-&#xD;
ing down and speaking with difficulty,-" but I suppose the&#xD;
best is a minister's."&#xD;
"Why ?" said Miss Essie, disappointed.&#xD;
"Because the business of that profession is to lead men&#xD;
to heaven;-that of others is only to fit them for earth."&#xD;
"My dear, you're a fine girl !" said the Squire--willing&#xD;
Faith sh uld say anything that cut out Dr. Harrison.&#xD;
"Miss Esie, what do you mean by asking her such a string&#xD;
of questions ?-how can she tell who's the handsomest&#xD;
man?   She wouldn't like to hurt Mr. Linden's feelings by&#xD;
saying me, nor to make us both mad by saying anybody,&#xD;
else if there was anybody else to speak of."&#xD;
"iou hush, Mr. Stoutenburgh !" said Miss Essie. "Don't&#xD;
you know how to ask questions? Now Faith Derrick-&#xD;
run off with yourself." Faith obeyed with a trifle less than&#xD;
her usual spirit; but the game presently called it back&#xD;
again. Darting about, like some gentle-hearted hawk,&#xD;
among those flying pigeons, she had seized one boy and an-&#xD;
other with her usual bad success in the matter of identify-&#xD;
ing, when the boys suddenly cleared away a little-anxious&#xD;
perhaps that Mr. Linden should be caught again; for of&#xD;
all the players he gave them the most fun. And so effec-&#xD;
tually did they clear the way-so ineffectually did he pro-&#xD;
tect himself! that the next grasp of Faith's hand was upon&#xD;
his arm. And her voice gravely announced that she knew,&#xD;
it.&#xD;
"Now Faith !" said Mrs. Stoutenburgh, "do puzzle him&#xD;
if you can-give him a hard question."&#xD;
"She does not want to ask me any questions," said Mr.&#xD;
Linden as he untied the ribband. "You forget, Mrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
Stoutenburgh, how many she can ask every day. Now&#xD;
'~with Miss Essie the case is quite different."&#xD;
wery quiet and pleasant was the lookbent on Faith,-&#xD;
veycool and undisturbed the manner.  &amp;amp;is5 Faith, are&#xD;
you tired ?-I must be philosophical enough to inform you&#xD;
that there is a shadow of puss-in-the-corner wn&#xD;
And a very plain expression of gratitude was in her&#xD;
eyes and smile as she answered, "No, I'm not tired, Mr.&#xD;
Linden-but I would as lieve look on as play."&#xD;
That seemed , to be the general grown-up mind; but&#xD;
before the looking on had lasted long, everybody was-called&#xD;
into another room to supper. There the boys were left&#xD;
somewhat to themselves at one end of the table, and the&#xD;
half dozen others stood or sat in the warm fireplace corner&#xD;
at the other. Mr. Linden indeed, and Squire Stoutenburgh,&#xD;
were both 'boys' very often; but their returns to the ladies&#xD;
were frequent and prolonged. Faith was enthroned in a&#xD;
great chair, and there petted by Mrs. Stoutenburgh, while&#xD;
everybody brought her things by turns-a privilege highly&#xD;
prized by some of the boys.Neither, could Miss Essie&#xD;
complain of want of attention, while Mrs. Stoutenburgh&#xD;
and Mr. Linden took laughing care of each other between&#xD;
whiles.&#xD;
" Miss Essie," he said as he brought her a cup of coffee,&#xD;
"where are you in the pursuit of knowledge ?"&#xD;
Miss Essie laughed; yet not a triumphant laugh, nor&#xD;
even a satisfied one; it might be considered doubtful.&#xD;
"I think,"s she said, "you are one of a sort I don't much&#xD;
understand, Mr. Linden-perhaps because I don't know&#xD;
them much. Aren't you one of what I may call the good&#xD;
sort?"&#xD;
Faith's laugh, which was indeed very low but unavoid-&#xD;
able, was the first testimony.&#xD;
"I hope you may-" said Mr. Linden,-" the words sound&#xD;
pleasant. I am not quite sure what they mean."&#xD;
"AhI There you are again" said Miss Essie. "As diffi-&#xD;
cult to catch at other things as at blind man's buff. Well&#xD;
I'll be frank with you, for I don't mean to offend you. . I&#xD;
mean, the sort of people ivho are called 'rigidly righteous'&#xD;
.--people who think it incumbent on them to be better than&#xD;
their neighbours."&#xD;

"0 no-" said Mr. Linden,-" I quite disclaim that.&#xD;
only think it incumbent on me to be better than inyself."&#xD;
"Yes, but you are one of the people I mean---.aren't&#xD;
you ?"&#xD;
"Not according to that term, Miss Essie. May I ask&#xD;
what you mean by the other ?"&#xD;
"Rigidly righteous ?"1&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"Why I told you-people that pretend to be better than&#xD;
people in general. People in general, you know, get on&#xD;
without pretending much to be good at all: and of course&#xD;
it's disagreeable to be brought short up at every turn with&#xD;
you ought not,' and 'you ought;' and whether it is said&#xD;
or acted don't make much difference. Now here's this&#xD;
child, a little while ago, thought she mustn't say anything&#xD;
was good but a minister.&#xD;
"Do you mean Christians ?" said Mr. Linden. .&#xD;
"Well-" said Miss Essie, "I hope we're all Christians,&#xD;
---aren't we?  We're not heathens."&#xD;
"I mean the followers of Christ. Is that what you&#xD;
meant ? I do wear the badge of that 'Legion of Honour.'"&#xD;
Miss Essie looked fidgeted. Faith was letting her ice-&#xD;
cream melt while she listened. Mrs. Stoutenburgh in the&#xD;
midst of supper-table attentions gave an anxious eye and&#xD;
ear to the conference, which she would not interrupt.&#xD;
"Well now tell me what you mean by that ?" said Miss&#xD;
Essie, feeling herself in some confusion, of terms at least.&#xD;
Can I find plainer words ? You know what was meant&#xD;
by a follower in the old feudal times ?"&#xD;
"No I don't, said Miss Essie beginning to sip her coffee&#xD;
again. "Tell me !"&#xD;
"A follower was one who binding himself to the service&#xD;
his lord required of him, thenceforth paid it-in peace or&#xD;
in war,-to the end of his life. .And the terms of agree-.&#xD;
ment were two-fold,-fidelity on the one side, protection&#xD;
on the other. 'They follow me,' says Christ, 'and I give.&#xD;
unto them eternal life'."&#xD;
"Yes, but," said Miss Essie, "do you think it is required&#xD;
that we should put ourselves so much out of the way to be&#xD;
good I think people were meant to enjoy themselves."&#xD;
"I enjoy myself-" said .Mr. Linden smiling a little-.&#xD;

"What think you makes the lark fly circling up into the&#xD;
r sunbeams, singing as he goes ?-is it duty ? is it to&#xD;
rise above the robins and sparrows ?"&#xD;
"I don't understand id you !" said1 Miss Essie respectfully.&#xD;
"That is just the inner life of many a Christian,-hip&#xD;
very heart-cry is,&#xD;
'Nearer, my God, to thee;&#xD;
Nearer to thee!&#xD;
E'en though it be a cross,&#xD;
That raiseth me. '-"&#xD;
"Well you think nobody can be safe that don't live just&#xD;
so?" persisted Miss Essie.&#xD;
"In whom such a life is not at least begun ?-How can&#xD;
it be, Miss Essie ? Safe ? without the blessing of God ?"&#xD;
"Well there we differ," said .the lady. "That's what I&#xD;
mean by being rigidly righteous. I think every one must&#xD;
judge for himself."&#xD;
A little more erect Mr. Linden stood, drawing himself&#xD;
=  up slightly-it was his wont sometimes under a touch of&#xD;
excitement, and spoke with his deep emphasis these words-.&#xD;
"'This is life eternal, to know thee, the only true God,&#xD;
and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.'.-Miss Essie, where&#xD;
is your permit for free judgment against the Bible ?"&#xD;
sr   "I didn't mean that," said Miss Essie, lowering her crest.&#xD;
"But I mean that everybody can't be good after your strict&#xD;
S       nwa"&#xD;
"I am not standing up for myself, you know," said he&#xD;
pleasantly, "nor denying that you have described me right;&#xD;
but what a follower of Christ ought to be, is no more rigid&#xD;
than sunlight-or than the wings of angels. Yet both&#xD;
sun and angels 'always do his commandment' who made&#xD;
them both."&#xD;
"Oh people can't be sunlight-nor angels neither, in this&#xD;
world. You're Utopian ! That's what I said.&#xD;
" They can be 'burning and shining lights,"' said Mr.&#xD;
Linden. "Miss Essie, will you gainsay the Bible ?  Why&#xD;
can they not ?"&#xD;
"They can be-.-.but I suppose they aren't obliged to be;&#xD;
or what is to become of us all ?" said Miss Essie, half&#xD;
seriously half defiantly.&#xD;

" That will depend upon whom we follow," he answered&#xD;
gravely.&#xD;
"Well now, Mr. Linden, how nany people in the-world&#xD;
are 'followers' in the way you have described them ?--and&#xD;
are all the rest going to destruction ?  Take the people in&#xD;
this room now, for instance,-boys and all here's twenty of&#xD;
us perhaps. How many do you suppose are here of your&#xD;
way of 'following'? You're one-who's another?  Stand&#xD;
off there, and see whom you can get to join you !"&#xD;
"Stand off and say with Moses-'who is on the Lord's&#xD;
side ?'-there would be several, Miss Essie."&#xD;
"Well count up," said Miss Essie. "I suppose they&#xD;
have no objection to shew themselves. You are one-who's&#xD;
another ?"&#xD;
"I am another," said Faith, rising and setting down her&#xD;
ice cream.&#xD;
"You !"-said Miss Essie turning the black eyes upon&#xD;
her,--'you look like it, child !"&#xD;
"You must put the 'rigid' out of your head," Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den said, with a smile which changed as he spoke.&#xD;
"Well who else ?" said Miss Essie, for some reason or&#xD;
other in an impatient temper. "Tell them your definition,&#xD;
will you, and ask who'll stand by you. Mrs. Stouten-&#xD;
burgh !-make them all stop and attend."&#xD;
"If I askthem you may think they come to please me."&#xD;
"No, no, you know how to say it. Mr. Stoutenburgh !-&#xD;
boys !-listen. I want to know how many there are here&#xD;
of a particular kind of people-Mr. Linden will tell you&#xD;
what kind."&#xD;
He spoke then-as Faith had once or twice heard him&#xD;
speak,.sending his voice through the room almost without&#xD;
raising it.&#xD;
"Miss Essie de Staff wishes to know how many there are&#xD;
here of a particular kind of people-those that 'have sworna&#xD;
unto the Lord, and will not go back.' Whoever is of that K&#xD;
number will please come over to this side."&#xD;
There was. a little astonished pause. Mr. and Mrs.&#xD;
Stoutenburgh, just then at the further end of the room, had&#xD;
moved at Miss Essie's summons, hut stopped short at the &#xD;
first sound of Mr. Inden's voice, and looked in a sort of i&#xD;
maze,--he clearly was not jesting, that was all they could&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
make out. That too the boys saw: but for a minute they&#xD;
stood like statues,-then Reuben stepped from the group&#xD;
and walked quietly, deliberately, over to where Mr. Linden&#xD;
K stood; the covenant-signing in his face glowing with the&#xD;
Free Church addition-'until death!'&#xD;
One and another followed him-one after' another,-&#xD;
Faith was surprised to see how many: ranging themselves&#xD;
about Mr. Linden. But something in it all touched him-&#xD;
stirred him,-something perhaps personal to himself and&#xD;
them; for after the first three or four had come he looked&#xD;
no more,-his eyes fell, and the firmly compressed lips&#xD;
could not quite conceal their trembling. He stood as&#xD;
statue-like as the boys had done.&#xD;
In the interest of a moment and a. scene that she never&#xD;
forgot, it was a simple thing that Faithliost thought of her&#xD;
own standing. Perhaps Miss Essie shared her oblivion of&#xD;
self for that minute; her look of uneasy curiosity changed&#xD;
to a sobriety that was almost awe. Perhaps self-recollec-&#xD;
tion came back; for after eying the dumb show with uncom-&#xD;
monly blank black eyes, both they and she suddenly started&#xD;
. into action.&#xD;
"That will do," she said with voice and gesture,-"you&#xD;
may go back-scatter ! and be boys again. Mr. Linden,&#xD;
what I complain of is, that you say you are on the Lord's&#xD;
side and that everybody else is not !"&#xD;
His thoughts came back slowly, as from some far-distant&#xD;
region,-he even turned to Faith and wheeled up a chair&#xD;
for her before he answered.&#xD;
"No, Miss Essie-.-those last words I believe I never said.&#xD;
But the 'Lord knoweth them that are his'-let each one&#xD;
have answering knowledge for himself."&#xD;
Miss Essie's look was not comfortable. She abandoned&#xD;
the point in hand, and swallowed her cold coffee.&#xD;
"What are you talking about ?" said Mrs. Stoutenburgh&#xD;
coming up t9 them. "What sort of a game was that, Miss&#xD;
Essie ?"&#xD;
"Nothing,"-said Miss Essie. "I said I would study&#xD;
Mr. Linden-and I have. I've found out two things about&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"I wonder if he's 'been studying too !" said Mrs. Stout-&#xD;

coffee's just as cold as Faith's ice is warm !-that comes of&#xD;
talking when you ought to be eating. Mr. Linden-just help&#xD;
Mr. Stoutenburgh with that little table, please--and I'll&#xD;
have the coffee-pot here and be comfortable."&#xD;
"And I shall yell Miss Essie a story about fishes," said&#xD;
Mr. Linden as he obeyed.&#xD;
Mrs. Stoutenburgh sat down behind her coffee-pot, while&#xD;
the gentlemen went back and forth between the two tables,&#xD;
bringing cups and cake and what else was needed for this&#xD;
'German cotillion,' as Mr. Linden called it. During which&#xD;
interlude Miss Essie, after taking an observant view of&#xD;
Faith, gave her a significant private admonition, that&#xD;
'somebody' would not like lher being there. Faith in vain&#xD;
endeavoured to get some light on this dark information;&#xD;
Miss, Essie was startling but enigmatical, and suddenly&#xD;
turned from her and asked Mr. Linden "what was the&#xD;
story he had promised ?"&#xD;
"Not much of a story, though I called it one. It has&#xD;
to do with the way different races'of fishes wear their&#xD;
bones."&#xD;
"Well?" said Miss Essie, using her eyes; while Faith&#xD;
forgot her flushed cheeks and used hers.&#xD;
"You are perhaps aware," he said smiling, "that even&#xD;
fishes have their inflexible points; in other words, a region&#xD;
of bone somewhere."&#xD;
Miss Essie bowed her head, mentally ejaculating, "You&#xD;
have !"&#xD;
"And all the fossil tribes, as well as those which now&#xD;
exist, are divided into two great classes, -those which&#xD;
wear their bones on the outside, and those which wear&#xD;
them within. The first have a perfect plate armour-&#xD;
jointed and fitted and carved, piece by piece; but the inner&#xD;
framework is merely cartilaginous. The others, while they&#xD;
shew nothing but pliant flesh, have an internal structure&#xD;
of bone which can outlast ages."&#xD;
"Curious 1" said Miss Essie, eying him all the while&#xD;
carefully.  "Then I suppose we are all fishes !"&#xD;
" I was thinking---apropos to our talk awhile ago-of&#xD;
the intangible, unseen nature of a Christian's strength.&#xD;
The moment his defence is worn on the outside, that mo-&#xD;
ment there is a failure of strength within. His real armour&#xD;
&#xD;
of proof is nothing more 'rigid,' Miss Essie, than 'the&#xD;
girdlof truth,'the breastplate of righteousness,'and 'for&#xD;
girdle oofalvio.",,&#xD;
a helmet the hope of salvation.&#xD;
Very   ood armour," said Miss Essie; "but can't he&#xD;
wear it without being unlike other people ?"&#xD;
"i wtCan he?"&#xD;
"Look here," said Squire Stoutenburgh, "what have&#xD;
you been about? If you've been studying anatomy, Mr.&#xD;
Linden, 'll go learn dancing 1&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXII.&#xD;
FAIT     pondered probably Miss Essie's enigmatical&#xD;
[ words; but she said nothing on the subject even to&#xD;
her mother. Other people's words and looks had produced&#xD;
their share of disturbance at the time; disturbance that&#xD;
Faith did not like to recollect. And she would not recol-&#xD;
lect it, practically. It left no trace on her face or behaviour.&#xD;
The simplicity of both, unchanged in a whit, testified for&#xD;
her that her modesty would not take such hints from other&#xD;
people's testimony, and that there was no folly in her to&#xD;
be set fluttering at the suggestion.&#xD;
The next Wednesday morning was one of great promise,&#xD;
--fair and soft and quiet, with November's sunshine soften-&#xD;
ing November's brown dress.&#xD;
"I think, Miss Faith," Mfr. Lindkn said before be went&#xD;
off after breakfast, "that you should take a short run or&#xD;
two, before you try that long one to Mattabeeset."&#xD;
"A run, Mr. Linden? Didn't I have one last night ?"&#xD;
"Truly yes,--.-but I mean on horseback. Will you take&#xD;
such a one to-day ?"&#xD;
"Yes1" said Faith, looking different things, especially&#xD;
pleasure,." but Mr. Linden, I don't know where I am to&#xD;
get a horse. Crab can't go now."&#xD;
"Well, as I am to play the part of page, and run by&#xD;
your side," said Mr. Linden, "I am rather glad he can't 1-.&#xD;
no disrespect to-his other good qualities. When will you&#xD;
be ready, Miss Faith ?"                            i&#xD;
The hour fixed upon had need to be early, for the days&#xD;
were short; so though books had a little time after dinner,&#xD;
it was but a little. Then the horses came; and Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den took Faith in charge, with words from her mothe that&#xD;
might have been very useful if they had been needed,-&#xD;
which in his case they hardly were. .A fact Which his re-&#xD;
ply, or the manner of it, seemed to impress upon Mrs. Der-&#xD;
rick's mind, for she saw them ride off with nothing but&#xD;
pleasure.&#xD;
Other people saw them with a variety of emotions. All&#xD;

the boys they met (except Sam) looked unqualified delight,&#xD;
.-from her window Mrs. Stoutenburgh gave them a gay&#xD;
wave of her hand; Miss Bezac on the sidewalk absolutely&#xD;
turned to look again. They rode leisurely up the grassy&#xD;
road, hardly beyond a walk at first, and it was not till the&#xD;
houses grew few and the road mire open, that Faith had&#xD;
her promised run-: which was but an easy trot, after all.&#xD;
"You must begin very gently, Miss Faith," said her&#xD;
companion as they walked their horses up a little hill.&#xD;
"Look how those topsails mark the water line !"&#xD;
"Yes--don't you like to see the white sails peeping over&#xD;
the trees?  I always do. But Mr. Linden, I don't get&#xD;
tired easily-you needn't be afraid. I can go just as fast&#xD;
as you like." She looked enough in the mood.&#xD;
"You know I am interested in the matter,-if I should&#xD;
come home to-morrow and find you gone to sleep at mid-&#xD;
da-.I should lose my French lesson! Now you may&#xD;
have another run."&#xD;
This run was rather a long one, yet came to an unex-&#xD;
pected end, for turning a woody point in the road the two&#xD;
riders saw a wagon before them, so directly in their way,&#xD;
that the run changed to a walk even before'they perceived&#xD;
that the wagon was in distress. Some bit of harness, some&#xD;
pin, had given way, and the driver had dismounted to re-&#xD;
pair damages. But moody, or intent upon his work,&#xD;
Faith's horse was close upon him before he looked up-&#xD;
then she saw it was Squire Deacon. He looked down&#xD;
again as suddenly, with only a slight motion of his hand&#xD;
to his hat.&#xD;
Faith's first impulse would have been to rush on; but&#xD;
she checked that. Her next would have been to wait and&#xD;
leave somebody else to speak first; but she overcame that&#xD;
too. So it was her very clear gentle voice that asked,&#xD;
"Are you in trouble here, Mr. Deacon ?"&#xD;
The Squire had no time to give his answer, and scarce&#xD;
a moment wherein to concoct it, for Mr. Linden had dis-&#xD;
mounted and now came between Faith's horse and the&#xD;
wagon, with,-" What is the matter, Squire Deacon ?-can&#xD;
I help you ?"&#xD;
The Squire looked up then, full, with a face that dark&#xD;
ened as he looked.&#xD;

"It's you, is it ?" he said slowly. "I thought it was&#xD;
Dr. Harrison !"&#xD;
"Can I help you ?" Mr. Linden repeated--and the tone&#xD;
was a little peremptory.&#xD;
Sullenly and slowly the Squire told the damage-the&#xD;
broken harness, the lost lynch-pin; and. let Mr. Linden&#xD;
take the first out of his hands, and do what he chose with&#xD;
it; looking on the while-then by degrees taking hold&#xD;
himself and working with him as with any other man, but&#xD;
throwing off jealously the kindness of his _ helper's words&#xD;
or manner. It was a grave kindness, certainly, but it did&#xD;
not belie the name. Faith sat looking on. After awhile&#xD;
her voice broke the silence.&#xD;
"Did you say a lynch-pin was wanting, Mr. Deacon?"&#xD;
"There's one gone."&#xD;
"I should like to be doing something to help. Will you&#xD;
lend me your knife, Mr. Deacon ?-and I'll try." But that&#xD;
brought a hand on her bridle.&#xD;
"I cannot trust your horse out of my sight, Miss Faith,.-&#xD;
I will get what is wanting."&#xD;
"There's no use in anyone's doing anything," said Squire&#xD;
Deacon, by way of a settler; and the harness work went on&#xD;
in silence.&#xD;
Faith waited a little.&#xD;
"I am not the least afraid," she said then, leaning over&#xD;
her horse's neck but speaking no name. " There's a place&#xD;
only a little way back where I think I can get a lynch-pin,-&#xD;
if anybody will lend me a knife. I'lease let me go and be&#xD;
doing something! I want to go."&#xD;
"This cord," said Mr. Linden, taking one up from the&#xD;
bottom of the wagon-" is it wanted for any special purpose,&#xD;
Squire Deacon?"&#xD;
"I guess if you ask Joe he could tell you," said the Squire&#xD;
with a glance that way. "'Twas good for something, but&#xD;
he's tied it in forty knots-just to see if I'd be fool enough&#xD;
to pick 'em out."&#xD;
"It would be very useful about this harness," said Mr.&#xD;
Linden,--"will you try and get rid of the knots ?"-and&#xD;
he handed Faith the cord, with a smile which said she must&#xD;
make that do instead of the lynch-pin-.&#xD;
Which Faith did not particularly like, for she had a strong&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
409&#xD;
&#xD;
hankering for the ride back to the bushes. She dropped&#xD;
the bridle upon her horse's neck, and began to exercise her&#xD;
patience and skill upon the knots.&#xD;
"I wish I had a knife !" she said as she did so, "and I'd&#xD;
shew you that I am not afraid."  And a little colour rose&#xD;
in her face, which rather grew.&#xD;
" That's easy," said Squire Deacon, looking suddenly up&#xD;
and extending his hand. "Here's one as'll cut through&#xD;
most thing .  Mr. Linden's head was bent over the har-&#xD;
ness,-nei her eye nor hand stirred from his work.&#xD;
"Thank you, Mr. Deacon," said Faith, feeling the blood&#xD;
rise to her brow,-" but I won't go for it now.-I'll do this&#xD;
first." In her confusion Faith did not see another person&#xD;
that joined the group, till he was standing at her horse's&#xD;
side.&#xD;
"What sort of a bee are you gettin' up here on the&#xD;
high-way ?" said Mr. Simlins in his good-humoured growl&#xD;
(and he had a variety.)  "What air you doin' on horse-&#xD;
back ?"&#xD;
"There's harness to be mended here, Mr. Simlins-and&#xD;
I'm making rope for it."&#xD;
"You go 'long !" said he.  "Who are you makin' rope&#xD;
for ? Give that to me ?" But Faith held fast.&#xD;
"'No, Mr. Simlins, you can't have it-I am bound to get&#xD;
out these knots. There is work doing round here, that&#xD;
perhaps you can help."&#xD;
Mr. Simlins stooped under her horse's head and went&#xD;
round to the other side, and then for the first time he got a&#xD;
full view.&#xD;
"That's the way you perform actions !" he said; seeming&#xD;
too profoundly struck to be at all wordy. "'Say and Seal'&#xD;
I guess you be ! What's the matter with you, Squire ?"&#xD;
"If anything is, I haint heard of it," said Mr. Deacon,&#xD;
with the knife lying heavy against his ribs. "Mr. Linden's&#xD;
turned harness-maker-that's the last news."&#xD;
"0 are you there, Mr. Simlins ?" said the new mechanic,&#xD;
looking up from his work.&#xD;
"Can't be more unlikely than you," said the farmer, be-&#xD;
ginning on his part to finger the broken harness. "Iow&#xD;

Squire Deacon, but he's as good at mendin' as you be at&#xD;
marrin'. What do you think ?".'&#xD;
"I don't see as one man has much to do with another,"&#xD;
said Mr. Deacon lucidly.&#xD;
"Yes, that will do," said Mr. Linden. "Now Miss&#xD;
Faith-give me that cord if you please, and you shall go,&#xD;
after the lynch-pin."&#xD;
"No," she said pleasantly,..-"it'll be done in a minute-..&#xD;
I want to finish it."&#xD;
"When did you get back from York, Squire ?" said Mr.&#xD;
Simlins-." and what took you away? I haint heerd yet.&#xD;
I never believed you were gone for good-though folks&#xD;
said it."&#xD;
"'Taint generally worth while to believe what folks says,"&#xD;
replied the Squire. "I've been back three weeks, I guess.&#xD;
Shouldn't wonder if I went again though."&#xD;
"Shouldn't wonder if you did," said Mr. Simlins. "I&#xD;
would if I was you-if I wanted to. Mr. Linden, it was a&#xD;
providential thing, that you should come along at this idio-&#xD;
matical moment. There aint another man in Pattaquasset&#xD;
would ha' done this so good as you"&#xD;
"There is another line of business open to me then,"&#xD;
said Mr. Linden, who had begun upon the other end of the&#xD;
piece of cord with opposition fingers.&#xD;
"What aint open to you ?" said Mr. Simlins. "Do you&#xD;
know of anything? Give us that cord-will you ?"&#xD;
"Yes, you may have it now-the knots are all out," said&#xD;
Mr. Linden, as he put the disentangled cord in the hands&#xD;
of Mr. Simlins and himself in the saddle. "Now Miss&#xD;
Faith, you shall have a 'lesson in lynch-pins-s'il vous&#xD;
plait."&#xD;
"You do beat all !" said Squire Deacon looking up from&#xD;
under his hat, and with a voice that kept his eyes com-&#xD;
pany.&#xD;
Faith looked very pretty as she turned her horse in obe-&#xD;
dience to- the intimation given her, with a somewhat demure&#xD;
smile and blush upon her face. Mr. Simlins looked, as well&#xD;
as the Squire, with a different expression.&#xD;
"Well, I guess you're about right!" was his answering&#xD;
remark. "I do believe he can get the whip hand of most&#xD;
things. He's a Say and Seal man, he says." To which,&#xD;
&#xD;
however, the Squire deigned no response. Stooping over&#xD;
his harness, fingering and fitting, he was silent a little; then&#xD;
spoke in a careless,-half inquiring half assenting sort of&#xD;
way.&#xD;
".What wonders me is, why he don't marry that girl out&#xD;
of hand. I reckon she'd follow him down that road as easy&#xD;
as she does down others. What's he waiting for ?"&#xD;
"I guess he haint pitched upon a likely place to settle&#xD;
yet,".-said Mr. Simlins, in a manner equally careless and&#xD;
devoid of reliable information. Squire Deacon gave a little&#xD;
inarticulate reply.&#xD;
"He'd better hurry up-" he said,-"Dr. Harrison's&#xD;
giving chase."&#xD;
"Is he ?" said Mr. Simlins. "lHe'll be where the dog was&#xD;
when he chased the wolf-if he's spry. I shouldn't won-&#xD;
der."&#xD;
"0-you think he's a wolf, do you ?" said Mr. Deacon.&#xD;
"Well-the doctor's chance paint much the worse of that."&#xD;
"Don't look very carnivorous," saidMr. Simlins, "but I&#xD;
paint sure.  I wouldn't be so quick in my presumptions,&#xD;
Squire. You'll shoot the wrong game one of these days-&#xD;
if you haintaiready."&#xD;
"Think so?" said the Squire. "Well, I paint after the&#xD;
game they are, any way, so it don't matter to me which of&#xD;
'em gets her. Most folks say it's like to be the doctor,-&#xD;
she seems tryin' 'em both by turns."&#xD;
The riders, on their part, had al short run back on the&#xD;
road they had come, to where there kvas a hedge and thicket&#xD;
and trees together; and Faith's horse being led close up to&#xD;
the side of the 'hedge, and she herself provided with a knife,&#xD;
she was free to cut as many lynch-pins as she chose. But&#xD;
at this point Faith handed back the knife. "I can't do it&#xD;
half so well;" she said. "I would rather you did it, Mr.&#xD;
Linden."&#xD;
"You would rather not dO it ?" he said looking at her.&#xD;
"Is no bread pleasant but that 'eaten in secret'?"&#xD;
Faith coloured very much. "I didn't care about doing&#xD;
it, Mr. Linden, except to be useful, and for the enterprise&#xD;
of going o for it by myself. And I didn't care about&#xD;
that, more than two minutes."&#xD;
"You know I had a charge about you before we came&#xD;

the hedge to use it. "But for that-or a like one in my&#xD;
own mind-you should have had your enterprise. There--&#xD;
I think that may serve the purpose."&#xD;
The lynch-pin being delivered, the riders left the distressed&#xD;
wagon behind; and again the free road stretched before&#xD;
them; the soft air and light filled all the way and even the&#xD;
brown tree stems with pleasantness. The horses felt they&#xD;
had had a rest and pricked up tkeir ears to be in motion&#xD;
again, and the minds of the riders perhaps felt a stir of the&#xD;
like kind.&#xD;
"Miss Faith," said Mr. Linden, "a German writer says,&#xD;
that 'one should every day read a fine poem, look upon an&#xD;
excellent picture, hear a little good music, and, if possible,&#xD;
speak a few sensible words."'&#xD;
"Why do you tell that to me, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"I consider it my duty to keep you well informed as to&#xD;
yours."&#xD;
"But then !" said Faith, who by dint of trotting had got&#xD;
into as merry a mood as her gentleness often wore, "I hope&#xD;
you will also think it your duty, Mr. Linden, to tell me&#xD;
hokv I can perform mine. Will you ?"&#xD;
"Of course !-please speak a few sensible words to me&#xD;
at once."&#xD;
"You begin with the easiest thing !" said Faith.&#xD;
"Yes, I am generally considerate. But as it is paiLof&#xD;
my duty to hear a little good music, I am willing you should&#xD;
sing first."&#xD;
Music he had, though not exactly of the specified sort;&#xD;
for Faith's laugh rolled along the road, like the chafing of&#xD;
silver pebbles in a brook.&#xD;
"Now for th next part," said Mr. Linden smiling.&#xD;
"11 think   ve done too much already," said Faith&#xD;
growing gray "Besides," she added, the corners of her&#xD;
mouth all alive again, "I don't remember what the next&#xD;
part is, Mr. Linden."&#xD;
"Why the sensible wordsl!-.-what are the most sensible&#xD;
you can think of on a sudden, Miss Faith ?"&#xD;
"I don't know that I could think of anything very sen-.&#xD;
sible on a sudden, Mr. Linden. Is it my duty to do it on&#xD;
sudden ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
413&#xD;
&#xD;
412&#xD;
&#xD;
E&#xD;
4&#xD;
a&#xD;
&#xD;
"It might be, Miss Faith. Indeed I think it is now!"&#xD;
"What would you like them to be about, Mr. Linden ?&#xD;
and .I'll try."&#xD;
"Nay, you may choose: sense is of universal applica.&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
"If I should say what was uppermost," said Faith, "it&#xD;
would be, How very pleasant what we are doing now, is I"&#xD;
"Which part?"&#xD;
"Both parts !-Every part! One makes the other more&#xD;
pleasant."  And Faith's happy face looked so.&#xD;
"Very sensible words" said Mr. Linden smiling, "I&#xD;
agree to them perfectly,-.which is, y-ou know, in every mind,&#xD;
the great test of sense. The picture, Miss Faith, we have&#xD;
before us."&#xD;
"Yes,-isn't it lovely to-day, Mr. Linden? and hasn't it&#xD;
been lovely ever- since we set out ? Except that broken&#xD;
harness-and I don't think that has hurt anything, either."&#xD;
"No, I am not sure that even the harness was much the&#xD;
worse. And 'it' has been very lovely. As for the poem,&#xD;
Miss Faith, you cannot be trusted with that-and must re-&#xD;
sign yourself to hearing it read. What shall it be ?"&#xD;
"I don't know," said Faith. "I know hardly any poe-&#xD;
try, Mr. Linden, except what I have heard you read.&#xD;
Will you read some, perhaps, this evening ?"&#xD;
"Yes-every evening, if you like,--if we are to follow&#xD;
Goethe's rule. Just before tea is a good time, don't you&#xD;
think so ?"&#xD;
"Yes indeed I" said Faith, whose colour rose from pure&#xD;
pleasure, as her thought went back to L'Allegro and I1 Pen.&#xD;
seroso. "I don't think there is any time pleasanter for it.&#xD;
But they're all pleasant.-I've dropped my 'whip, Mr./&#xD;
Linden!"-&#xD;
"I will get it for yaou," he said checking his horse, "if&#xD;
you will promise not to run away! I afraid of your&#xD;
'enterprising' spirit, Miss Faith."&#xD;
But her look at .him was a little touched and deprecat-&#xD;
ing. They turned their horses together and went back a&#xD;
few steps. There was no troble ii finding the whip, for&#xD;
just where it had been dropped, a boy stood holding it on&#xD;
high for Faith's acceptance. The boy was Phil Davids.&#xD;
" Thank you, Phil !" said Faith, surprised and gatefu1.&#xD;

"I see it go out of your hand," said Phil.&#xD;
"Yes," said Mr. Linden-whose smile and word of&#xD;
thanks had accompanied Faith's,-..-"Phil has singularly&#xD;
quick eyes. They have done me good service before."&#xD;
As they turned again, Farmer Davids stood at their&#xD;
horses' heads. They were just at the farmer's door, and&#xD;
he so entreated them to come in 'and rest,' that there was&#xD;
no refusing his hospitality. It was large, and various--.&#xD;
Pumpkin pies and cider, and much pouring forth of grati.&#xD;
tude and admiration for Mr. Linden's success with Phil.&#xD;
"What have you done to that fellow ?" his father re.&#xD;
marked admiringly to Mr. Linden. "You never see such&#xD;
an alteration in a boy. He used-oncet--to talk hard&#xD;
words agin you, sir;-you won't mind hearing it now; but&#xD;
he's come all about, and lately there's, nothing to Phil's&#xD;
mind can equal up to Mr. Linden. He don't say much&#xD;
about it, sir, but it's evident. And he's been at me and&#xD;
his mother this fortnight or two, to give him something to&#xD;
make a present toy you-the boys do, he says; and he'&#xD;
wants the best thing on the farm should go, and so do I,&#xD;
sir, if we knowed oncet what would be most favourable. It&#xD;
would be a kindness, sir, as I should be grateful for,-if&#xD;
you'd say what would do you most service or be most plea-&#xD;
sure-of anything that is on the farm;-fruit. or vegetables&#xD;
or dairy. We're plain folks, sir; I say what I mean.&#xD;
Take some pie, Mr. Linden!-some cider, sir ?".&#xD;
Answering these various questions and demands as best&#xD;
he might, Mr. Linden contrived to convince Mr. Davids&#xD;
that Phil himself was the thing "on the farm" that he&#xD;
cared most about; and his goodwill, better than any spe-&#xD;
cial maliifestation thereof; giving at the same time full and&#xD;
grateful thanks for the other things that had come to him&#xD;
when he was ill.&#xD;
"Yes," said Mr. Davids, smiling one of his grim and&#xD;
rare smiles,-" all that don't help our difficulty, you see.&#xD;
Well, Phil and I'll have to put our heads together. But&#xD;
there's one person can send nothing that will tell half his&#xD;
good feelings- of gratefulness to you,-and that's me."&#xD;
And a very unwanted softening of the stern man's eye and&#xD;
brow shewed that he spoke a gentle truth-.&#xD;
Kind words answered him,-words of personal kindness&#xD;
&#xD;
and interest, and deep pleasure too.t but Mr. Davids knew&#xD;
it was a pleasure, an interest, a kindness, that had each&#xD;
(like Samuel Rutherford's hope) "a face looking straight&#xD;
out unto that day !"&#xD;
Truly, "a ci4 that is set on an hill, cannot be hid 1"&#xD;
And the farmer felt it, and his manner softened, and his&#xD;
interest grew more wistful and intent with every minute&#xD;
they stayed.&#xD;
Faith was on horseback and Mr. Linden about to ol-&#xD;
low, when Farmer Davids arrested him with a low r mark&#xD;
and question.&#xD;
"She's a fine-faced girl-looks as her father ne n't ha'&#xD;
been ashamed of her. Looks good-like he di    Is she&#xD;
going to marry the son of Judge Harrison, sir ?&#xD;
"Dr. Harrison has told me nothing of the k4 ."&#xD;
"I heerd it "-said the farmer. "I didn't kno nothing,&#xD;
how it might be.  Good day, sir !  I hope y u'll 1ome&#xD;
again."  And they trotted off at last, with  gain the&#xD;
renewed feeling of liberty and pleasure of motion. But&#xD;
'the sun had descended perceptibly nearer to th horizon&#xD;
than he. was when they dismounted. However here was&#xD;
nothing to do but to ride, for the proposed route as a cir-&#xD;
cuit and they were passed the first half of the wa already.&#xD;
"That was good, Mr. Linden," said Faith.&#xD;
"Which part of it this time ?"&#xD;
"I don't mean the pumpkin pie and the cider," s e said&#xD;
smiling.&#xD;
"Do you feel rested ?"&#xD;
Oh yes ! t Rested and"'tired too. At least, quite re dy&#xD;
to move on again."&#xD;
"Yes, so am I. But do you know Goethe left but on&#xD;
very important item in his daily directions ?"&#xD;
"What was that?"&#xD;
"One should, if possible, every day give some one else&#xD;
a little pleasure."&#xD;
"Yes!1" said Faith. "And it's so true, and so easy.&#xD;
How much you gave there just now, Mr. Linden 1"&#xD;
"It was rather of their taking than my giving. But&#xD;
Miss Faith,&#xD;

That each body live uprightly in all manner ways?'"&#xD;

"Yes, Mr. Linden ! What are you thinking of?"&#xD;
"Just that-" he said smiling.   "A   thought of the&#xD;
darkness makes one want to trim the lights. Did you ever&#xD;
notice, Miss Faith, that many things which were written&#xD;
in a mere worldly sense, will bear a very sweet Christian&#xD;
application ? Take this for instance :--&#xD;
'Thus would I double my life's fading space,&#xD;
For he who runs it well, runs twice his race.&#xD;
And in this true delight,&#xD;
These unbought sports, that happy state,&#xD;
I would not fear nor wish my fate,&#xD;
But boldly say each night,-&#xD;
To-morrow let my sun his beams display,&#xD;
Or in clouds hide them; I have lived to-day.'"&#xD;
She listened with a b ight face at first; then as.the quo-&#xD;
tation was ended her fa e flushed, she turned, her eyes away,&#xD;
and a grave look of sorrow crept over her lips. But in a&#xD;
little while she looked again.&#xD;
"How many k6oks do you carry about in your head,&#xD;
Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"If I should tell you, Miss Faith, then you would&#xD;
know-and then I could never delude you any more ! Now&#xD;
we must quicken our pace, or we shall scarce get our poem&#xD;
before tea."&#xD;
For awhile the trotting was pretty brisk, then they&#xD;
drew bridle again and went gently on, but now towards&#xD;
the setting sun, whose bright rays were caught and held&#xD;
by the white sails that gleamed here and there in the dis-&#xD;
tance. Now they met lines of cattle, driven byisome bare-.&#xD;
footed boy or sunbonneted girl, and ploughmen trudged&#xD;
along the road behind their teams. Thicker curls of smoke&#xD;
from wayside chimneys spoke of supper, and where a house&#xD;
stood in the shadow of some bit of forest, lights were&#xD;
already gleaming from the windows.&#xD;
" How many things by season seasoned are&#xD;
To their right praise, and true perfection !"&#xD;
Which bit of excellent eulogy might also have been true&#xD;
of Quapaw creek and the bridge -over it, which they&#xD;
reached in seasonable time. -Quapaw creek was here a&#xD;
&#xD;
416&#xD;
&#xD;
little bit of a river, and the bridge over it was an  iig-&#xD;
P ficant little bridge -'no count,' in Squire Deacon'' lan-&#xD;
guage. But now, of all times in the year, the little bridge&#xD;
was already full of more than it could hold, literally, for,&#xD;
it couldn't hold what was upon it. A heavy farm-wagon&#xD;
loaded with some sort of produce had got fairly upon the&#xD;
bridge some hour or two before and then broken through;&#xD;
men and teams had for the present deserted it, and there&#xD;
was the way pretty effectually blocked up. What was to&#xD;
be done? They were not more now than a mile or two&#xD;
from home, but to go back and round by the nearest way&#xD;
would be several miles. The water was not very broad,&#xD;
ior generally deep; but the bank  and the bed of the&#xD;
stream were uneven and strewn   ith rocks and stones,&#xD;
small and great. It was fordable, certainly; a good rider&#xD;
might cross well enough; but a good rider would scarce&#xD;
choose to trust an unskilful one there. What was to be&#xD;
done ?&#xD;
doWe shall have to go back, Mr. Linden," said Faith;-&#xD;
"and you ,mustn't mind my riding fast now, or mother will&#xD;
be uneasy."&#xD;
Mr. Linden took the case into consideration.&#xD;
"Will you mind riding before me, Miss Faith ?"&#xD;
"What, sir ?" she said, not understanding.&#xD;
"Will you let me take you across ?"&#xD;
"How can you, Mr. Linden ?" she said, looking a little&#xD;
startled, and flushing.&#xD;
"Very easily-on my horse. Stay where you are a&#xD;
minute, and let me try the ford." And-not waiting for an&#xD;
answer to that, he rode down the bank and into the stream.&#xD;
It.was easy enough, for a man who knew what to do with&#xD;
his horse's mouth; not easy, nor perhaps safe for another.&#xD;
The footing needed to be chosen by the hand of the rider;&#xD;
so chosen it was good. Mr. Linden rode to the other side.&#xD;
and came back.&#xD;
"Will you try, Miss Faith ?"&#xD;
"Yes," she said, putting her horse in motion,-" I am&#xD;
not afraid.  I will follow you. It will be better than&#xD;
going round." But his horse did not stir.&#xD;
"I shall not follow you, Miss Faith,-and yet if you&#xD;
cross it must be before me. No other way is safe for you.~&#xD;

"Well, we can go round, can't we ?" said Faith.&#xD;
"Yes," he said,-as the sun dropped down behind the&#xD;
low horizon, and the cool shade fell on everything but the&#xD;
tree tops. "You know it is about six times as far. Are&#xD;
you afraid of my horse ?"&#xD;
"No, not when you hold him. I will do just what you&#xD;
please, Mr. linden," she said, though her colour mounted.&#xD;
"Then do not be afraid of me," he said, dropping his&#xD;
own bridle and gently disengaging the hand from hers.&#xD;
"Please take your foot out of the stirrup, .]liss Faith-.."&#xD;
and the transfer was made in a moment: she was lifted&#xD;
across the little space between the two horses, and seated&#xD;
in front of Mr. Linden, and held fast.&#xD;
"Are you afraid ?" he repeated, looking gravely down&#xD;
at her.&#xD;
"No sir.-Not a bit, Mr. Linden," she said, throwing a&#xD;
little more warmth into her words, for the first had been&#xD;
spoken somewhat under breath. So leaving the one horse&#xD;
fastened to a tree-branch, the other set forward with his&#xD;
unwonted burden, which indeed at first he did not much&#xD;
approve; pricking his ears, and sideling about, with some&#xD;
doubtfulness of intent. But being after all a sensible horse,&#xD;
and apprehending the voice and rein suggestions which&#xD;
were made to him, he began to pick his way slowly and&#xD;
carefully among the stones on the bank, and then through&#xD;
the stones in the river; setting down his feet with great&#xD;
judgment and precaution, and paying no heed to the rush-&#xD;
ing and splashing of the little stream, except by his ears-..&#xD;
which certainly worked, for once., And so the dangerous&#xD;
"pass" was soon behind them, and Mr. Linden dismounted&#xD;
and lifted Faith down, and seated her on a grey stone on&#xD;
the bank, while he went back for her horse. Which cross-&#xD;
ing, it may be observed, was accomplished much quicker&#xD;
than the last. The twilight was falling fast, and the little&#xD;
river, and the two horses as they forded its swift-current,&#xD;
looked shadowy enough; set off by the white foam on&#xD;
both. The evening wind began its fitful str, and swept&#xD;
the dry leaves past Faith's feet, and shodk the cedar&#xD;
boughs above her head; and so she sat there, and watched&#xD;
the crossing.&#xD;
"I have had the best picture to-day, Mr. Linden," she -&#xD;
&#xD;
id when she was placed in the saddle again.     "You&#xD;
ou ht to have seen the river, and you and the two horses&#xD;
coming over it, in this light, as I did. You don't know&#xD;
how pretty it was.  Now you'll let me ride fast, won't&#xD;
you ?-for mother will be looking for us."&#xD;
"As fast as you please-but after all, you have not seen&#xD;
my picture," he said smiling.&#xD;
~&#xD;
Faith profited by the per mission given and put her horse&#xD;
a pace that proved she was very much in earnest to pre-&#xD;
vent that 'looking for them' on Mrs. Derrick's part. She&#xD;
got out of the trot into a canter-or her horse did-and&#xD;
then away they flew; too fast to see or be hindered by any&#xD;
more friends or foes; till they drew bridle at home.&#xD;
It was too late to have the reading before tea. So to&#xD;
have tea as speedily as possible was the next object. And&#xD;
then they adjourned to the fire-lit sitting-room, where&#xD;
Faith lighted the lamp in uncertainty whether reading or&#xD;
studies was to be the next move.  Mr. Linden, however,&#xD;
went for his book-a little old volume, of which. Faith had&#xD;
never taken notice; and began, without doubt, the prettiest&#xD;
description of a garden that ever was written ;-&#xD;
"How vainly men themselves amaze,&#xD;
To win the palm, the oak, or bays::"-etc.&#xD;
The reader paused a moment, to tell more particularly&#xD;
what these leafy honours were, and then went on.&#xD;
r              "Fair Quiet, have I found thee here,&#xD;
And Innocence, thy sister dear?&#xD;
Mistakenlong, I sought you then&#xD;
In busy companies of men.&#xD;
Your sacred plants, if here below,&#xD;
Only among the plants will grow.&#xD;
Society is all but rude&#xD;
To this delicious solitude."&#xD;
At which words precisely, the spirit of contrariety&#xD;
opened the door and ushered in Dr. Harrison. All he saw,&#xD;
was Mr. Linden with a book, in one easy-chair; Mrs. ]Ier-&#xD;
.rick with her knitting in another; and a little further off,&#xD;
Faith, sitting on her low cushion and apparently doing&#xD;

nothing.  Probably for that reason the doctor made up&#xD;
to her first. He sat down beside her, and enquired in a&#xD;
low tone how the fishes were?  Faith answered that they&#xD;
were well; only one of them had been eaten up by the&#xD;
others.&#xD;
"You are a little tired and are feeling remarkably well&#xD;
to-mnigt," the doctor went on. "What have you been&#xD;
doing?"&#xD;
"I have been trying to do my duty," Faith said colour-&#xD;
ing and laughing.&#xD;
"Don't you always do that ?" said Dr. Harrison looking&#xD;
at her enquiringly.&#xD;
"But I didn't know what it was till to-day."&#xD;
"You are doing what is very uncommon with you," said&#xD;
the doctor;--"fighting me with my own weapons."  His&#xD;
smile was pleasant though acute; but Faith coloured ex-&#xD;
ceedingly.&#xD;
"I can't tell you exactly what duty I mean," she said,&#xD;
"but Mr. Linden can."&#xD;
"Do you take your notions of duty from him7"&#xD;
"To-day,"..--said Faith with a smile, sweet and with&#xD;
spirit enough too.&#xD;
"I maintain that duties are facts, not-notions," said Mr.&#xD;
Linden.&#xD;
"Hum.-" said the doctor turning,-" Now you are too&#xD;
quick for me. May one not have a notion of a fact ?"&#xD;
"One may. What are your notions about society and&#xD;
solitude ?"&#xD;
"Of duty in those regards?"&#xD;
"Not at all,-your notions of those facts."&#xD;
"Confused-" said the doctor,--"Incomprehensible-.&#xD;
Melancholy-and Distracting !"&#xD;
He had got up and assumed the position he seemed to&#xD;
like, a standing-place on the rug, from whence he could&#xD;
look down on everybody.&#xD;
"What do you say to this ?--&#xD;
'Two paradises were in one,&#xD;
To live in Paradise alone.'-&#xD;
I suppose that meets your 'notions.'"&#xD;
"No,"   'tlsaid the doctor,.--"not unless Eve were the para-&#xD;

V,&#xD;

Y  ya,&#xD;
&#xD;
dise. And even then, I shouldn't want her any more to&#xD;
myself than to let all the world come and see that she was&#xD;
mine."&#xD;
"It is a grave question," said Mr. Linden, "whether&#xD;
paradise becomes smaller by being divided. In other words,&#xD;
whether after sharing it with Eve, Adam still retained the&#xD;
whole of it for himself!"&#xD;
"Just the other way 1" said the doctor,--" it was doubled&#xD;
..or trebled.  For in the first place he had Eve; she was&#xD;
a second paradise;--then all her enjoyment of paradise&#xD;
was his enjoyment; that was a third;--and in short I&#xD;
should think the multiplication might go on ad infinitum-&#xD;
like compound -interest or any other series of happiness&#xD;
impossible to calculate."&#xD;
"Simple interest isn't a bad thing," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"Yes," said the doctor with an answering flash of his&#xD;
eye, "but it never contented anybody yet that could get it&#xD;
compound-that never I heard of. Does Miss Derrick un-&#xD;
derstand arithmetic ?"&#xD;
"Miss Derrick," said Mr. Linden, "how many angels&#xD;
can stand on the point of a (darning) needle without jost-&#xD;
ling each other ?"&#xD;
"Don't be deluded into thinking that is arithmetic," said&#xD;
the doctor. "Some of them would get their feet hurt.&#xD;
What duty has Mr. Linden been persuading you to do&#xD;
to-day ?"&#xD;
"Mr. Linden can tell," said Faith.&#xD;
Which appeal Mr. Linden answered by deliberately&#xD;
finishing his poem aloud, for the benefit of the company.&#xD;
"'What wondrous life is this I lead!&#xD;
Ripe apples drop about my head;&#xD;
The luscious clusters of the vine&#xD;
Upon my mouth do crush their wine.&#xD;
The nectarine, the curious peach,&#xD;
Into my hands themselves do reach.&#xD;
Stumbling on melons, as I pass,&#xD;
Ensnared with flowers, I fall on grass.'&#xD;
'Here, at the fountain's sliding foot,&#xD;
Or at some fruit-tree's mossy root,&#xD;
Casting the body's vest aside,&#xD;
My soul into the boughs does glide:&#xD;

The doctor listened, faithfully and enjoyingly; but his&#xD;
finishing comment was,&#xD;
"What a pity it is November !"&#xD;
"No," said Faith-"I think I enjoyed it better than I&#xD;
should in July."&#xD;
" Rousseau's doctrine," said the doctor.  "Or do you&#xD;
mean that you like the description better than the reality ?"&#xD;
"It was the reality I enjoyed," said Faith.&#xD;
"What have you got there, Linden ?"&#xD;
''Various old poets, bound up together."&#xD;
"What was that you read ?"&#xD;
"Andrew Marvell's 'Garden."'&#xD;
"It's a famous good thing !--though I confess my soul&#xD;
never 'glided into the boughs' of any tree when my body&#xD;
didn't go along. Apropos-Do you like to be on the back'&#xD;
of a good horse ?"&#xD;
"Why yes," said Mr. Linden, "when circumstances place&#xD;
me there."&#xD;
" Will you let me be a circumstance to do 'it ?  I have&#xD;
an animal of that description-with almost the facility of&#xD;
motion possessed by Andrew Marvell's soul. Will you try&#xD;
him ?"&#xD;
"Can he run ?" said Mr. Linden with comic demureness.&#xD;
"Fleetly. Whether away with you depends, you know,&#xD;
on what I have no knowledge of; but I should think not."&#xD;
"I should like to know beforehand--" said Mr. Linden&#xD;
in the same tone. "Eowever-Is it to be on simple or&#xD;
compound interest, doctor ?"&#xD;
"I never take simple interest," said Dr. Harrison. "I&#xD;
want all I can get."&#xD;
"Well if; I take your horse, what will you ride alongside&#xD;
of me?"&#xD;
"That is easily arranged," said the doctor. smiling.&#xD;

Linden smiling.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIII.&#xD;
THE week thereafter passed with the usual quiet business&#xD;
of those days. Friday evening, however, when the&#xD;
lamp was lit, instead of opening her books at once, Faith&#xD;
took the doctor's station on the rug.&#xD;
"Dr. Harrison has been here this afternoon, Mr. Linden;&#xD;
and asked me to go with you and him in the ride to-morrow."&#xD;
"Well, Miss Faith ?"&#xD;
"I was afraid at first that it might hinder the good of&#xD;
your ride, if I went; but Dr. Harrison said no; and he put&#xD;
it so that at last I said I would. But I am afraid of it still."&#xD;
"How did he put it ?"'&#xD;
"I don't know," said Faith half laughing ;.- in a way&#xD;
that left me no excuse ; as if he thought it would be more&#xD;
pleasure both to you and to him, to have me along."&#xD;
"Miss Faith, if you go, you must give me leave to keep&#xD;
very near you. I trust my own care better than Dr. Har.&#xD;
rison's. You will understand why I do it ?" Faith did not&#xD;
understand very well.&#xD;
"I supposed of course, Mr. Linden, you would be very&#xD;
near ! I knew mother would not let me go to ride with&#xD;
Dr. Harrison, but with you I thought she would not be&#xD;
afraid."&#xD;
He looked at her a little doubtfully-as if he wanted to&#xD;
say something; but whatever it might be, it was not what&#xD;
he did say,-a quiet&#xD;
"I will try and take care of you, Miss Faith." Which&#xD;
words were afterwards enlarged upon.&#xD;
"Miss Faith, may I trust that you will not fall behind&#xD;
my 'fleet' horse to-morrow ?"&#xD;
"Do you mean, if he goes very fast ?" said Faith, with&#xD;
questioning eyes.&#xD;
"His speed shall not put you to any inconvenience.&#xD;
Indeed it may chance that he will be obliged to go slower&#xD;
than you like,-in which case, Miss Faith, I hope your&#xD;
liking will change."&#xD;

The doctor came the next day in a gay mood.&#xD;
"I told you," said he, "I shouldn't be .content with&#xD;
simple interest-I wanted compound. I hope you approve&#xD;
4 of my addition to our plan ?"&#xD;
"So far so good," Mr. Linden said smiling.&#xD;
They went out, and Mr. Linden'stfirst move was towards&#xD;
the horse with the side saddle; not with the 'intention of&#xD;
mounting him, however: but a more particular, thorough,&#xD;
systematic examination of every buckle and strap of his&#xD;
harness, that particular horse had never had. Then Mr.&#xD;
Linden tre and held out his hand to Faith.&#xD;
She gave him hers with a facile readiness that quite pre-&#xD;
cluded interposition, and testified either that she ater&#xD;
pecte i t or head not expected it; most probably the latter.&#xD;
Dr. harrison bit his lips, but that was a second's emotion;&#xD;
his next step was to dismiss the groom who stood at the&#xD;
horse's head and take that office on himself.&#xD;
You are more careful than is absolutely necessary in&#xD;
this case," said he smiling. "This horse, Miss Faith, is&#xD;
the mate, presume, of the one Job used to take his exer-&#xD;
cise upon. I chose him, for you; thinking of Mrs. Derrick.&#xD;
-Give 'Stranger' to Mr.yLinden !"-The last words being&#xD;
a direction to the groom.&#xD;
A very different creature was Stranger! If it had been&#xD;
Sthe purpose of Dr. Harrison to give his friend so much to&#xD;
do with his own particular affairs that he would have no&#xD;
leisure to bestow on those of other people, he had chosen&#xD;
the horse at least well. A very fine and beautiful animal,&#xD;
he deserved all the-praise given him for facility of motion;&#xD;
no feet could disdain the ground more daintily; no carriage&#xD;
be more absolutely springy and soft. But the mischief and&#xD;
spirit of both the runaways combined would not match his&#xD;
case. He did not indec ppear to be vicious, and that en&#xD;
than a most vehement  sire to pleasehislantatn&#xD;
taamotvhmn            sietopeshislaall manner of eccentric ways, totally irrelevant to the pur-&#xD;
pose of gettIng Thead on the road or serving the will of his&#xD;
rider, might be called vice. It rather seemed the spirit of&#xD;
power in full play. However it were, there was no lack of&#xD;
either 'motionI or 'emotion' during the.fithalfmileofthef&#xD;
way; for Stranger's manner of getting over so much of&#xD;

&#xD;
the ground was continually either calling Faith's blood into&#xD;
her cheeks, or driving it out from them.&#xD;
They were well matched, 'however, the horse and the&#xD;
rider,-and the spirit of power in equal exercise. Neither&#xD;
did Mr. Linden seem averse to the play-though Stranger&#xD;
presently found that what play he indulged in, was clearly&#xD;
matter of concession; his name, as regarded his rider, soon&#xD;
lost its point. On the whole, the performance came as near&#xD;
the ' Centaurship' declared impossible by Dr. Harrison, as&#xD;
most things have in modern times; but so far as the doctor&#xD;
had any stake depending upon Stranger's antics, so far he&#xD;
lost. Mr. Linden had never seemed more absolutely at&#xD;
leisure to attend to other people's affairs, and had rarely, it,&#xD;
may be said, attended to them more thoroughly, than during&#xD;
that 'springy' half mile. An occasional Pas seul round&#xD;
the minuet of his companions, rather heightened the effect.&#xD;
On another score, too, perhaps the doctor lost; for what-&#xD;
ever efforts he made, or she made, it was simply impossible&#xD;
for Faith to attend to anything else whatever with any show&#xD;
of consecutiveness, but the said horse and his ride  An&#xD;
attention sufficiently accounted for in the first place  the&#xD;
startled changes of colour in her face; latterly the clour&#xD;
rose and became steady, and- a little varying play of s1ile&#xD;
on lip and eye during the third quarter of a mile attested&#xD;
the fact that other "emotions" had displaced that of fear.&#xD;
Clearly the doctor had lost upon Stranger.&#xD;
"How do you like him ?" he said at last speaking across&#xD;
Faith who was not "good" for conversation.&#xD;
"Very much."&#xD;
"I see you'do-and he likes you, which is, to be sure, a&#xD;
correlative position. As I see he don't fill your hands, may&#xD;
I impose upon you the care of my sister? We are an un-&#xD;
even number you are-aware, and as I thought it desirable&#xD;
not to look odd, I gave her permission to go with us."&#xD;
Dr. Harrison did not see-if Faith did-the tiniest bit&#xD;
of a glance that sought her face while he was speaking;&#xD;
but nothing could be easier than the terms in which Mr.&#xD;
Linden declared himself ready to take charge of any&#xD;
number of ladies,-it was only equalled by Stranger's hound&#xD;
the next minute-.&#xD;

Miss Harrison's company, nobody guessed. They turned in&#xD;
at Judge Harrison's gate, and found Miss Sophy all ready for&#xD;
them. But to Faith, the play was suddenly taken out of&#xD;
"the play." She and Dr. Harrison set forward to be sure,&#xD;
over a pleasant road, in delicious weather; the doctQr was in&#xD;
one of his balmiest moods; and though quietly, she was very&#xD;
well mounted. It was pleasant, or would have been pleas-&#xD;
ant; but all the while, what was Stranger doing behind her&#xD;
that she could not see I Then in answering some kindly,&#xD;
graceful remark of the doctor's, Faith chid herself for un-&#xD;
gratefulness, and roused herself to give and take what good&#xD;
was in her power.&#xD;
The ride was pleasant after that! The air in all its calm&#xD;
sweetness was well tasted; the barren landscape, never&#xD;
barren to Faith's eyes, was enjoyed at every step. Her&#xD;
horse went agreeably, and the talk between her and Dr.&#xD;
Harrison grew interesting and enlivening.&#xD;
Meanwhile Mr. Linden's horse and his companion were&#xD;
at the antipodes-of each other. Thoroughly good and&#xD;
estimable as Miss Harrison was, she never left the beaten&#xD;
track,-and Stranger never kept in it. Between these two&#xD;
opposites Mr. Linden amused himself as best he might.&#xD;
To do him justice he tried his best to amuse his companion.&#xD;
Several miles of way lhad been passed over, when in a&#xD;
broad grassy reach of the road, the two riders ahead fell&#xD;
back upon the rest of the party; Faith taking Miss Harri-&#xD;
son's side, while the doctor drew up by Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"How does it go ?" he said good humouredly.&#xD;
"What is the impersonal in this case ?" said Mr. Linden,&#xD;
while Stranger snorted and bounded, and by every means&#xD;
in his power requested the doctor to keep at a distance.&#xD;
"A conglomerate, for whichI found no better term. You,&#xD;
Stranger, and my sister, and the world generally."&#xD;
"Stranger is in a sufficiently ardent mood, for his share-&#xD;
he gives me a fine view of the country," said Mr. Linden,&#xD;
as the creature brought himself to a tolerably erect position,&#xD;
and seemed to like it so well as to be in no hurry to come&#xD;
down ; and when he did, took the precaution to take his&#xD;
hind feet off the ground before the fore feet touched. "Miss&#xD;
Faith-how does, this agree with your ideal of Melan-&#xD;

Faith forgot to answer, or thought answers impertinent.&#xD;
"That horse frightens me out of my wits," said Miss&#xD;
Harrison.  "I have been jumping out of the saddle half&#xD;
the time, since Icame out. Sometimes he'll go very quietly...&#xD;
as nice as anybody---and then he'll play such a caper as he&#xD;
did then. That was just because Julius came up alongside&#xD;
of him. He had been going beautifully this last mile. I&#xD;
wish he'd have nothing to do with such a creature !"&#xD;
"I suppose he's very pleasant to ride," said Faith eying&#xD;
the creature.&#xD;
Perhaps Stranger--with his full, wild eyes, took note of&#xD;
this look of partial favour, for he backed a little from the&#xD;
doctor, and came dancing round by Faith, and there danced&#xD;
along at her side for a few minutes; evidently in an excited&#xD;
state of mind. His rider meanwhile, gave Faith a quiet&#xD;
word of admonition about keeping so loose a rein, and asked,&#xD;
in the same half undertone, if she felt tired?&#xD;
"0 no !" Faith said with a look of thanks and pleasure.&#xD;
"That piece of care I must trust in your hands-d-on't&#xD;
forget that I do so trust it. How would you like to cross&#xD;
Quapaw creek on this piece of quicksilver ?"'&#xD;
"I don't think you'd like to have me 1" Faith said very&#xD;
decidedly. "I never saw anything so beautiful, quite, Mr.&#xD;
Linden-that I recollect at this minute," she added smiling.,&#xD;
"I want to dance with you to-day-more than I ever did&#xD;
before," he answered, smiling too. "Miss Faith if you&#xD;
have not yet said the 'few sensible words,' or if you have&#xD;
any left, won't you please say them to me ?"&#xD;
" That question comes like a constable upon all'iny sense,"&#xD;
said Faith laughing, "and it feels as I suppose a man does&#xD;
when he is clapped on the shoulder."&#xD;
"But then the man cannot run away, you know."&#xD;
"Nor my sense don't," said Faith,-"that I know of-&#xD;
but it feels as if it hadn't possession of itself; Mr. Linden."&#xD;
"Well see if it is equal to this demand --.What would ben&#xD;
the consequences if you and I were to start off and scour&#xD;
the country 'on our own hook,' as people say ?"&#xD;
"I think our 'hook' would draw two people after usn"&#xD;
said Faith, looking very much amused and a little afraid of&#xD;
being overheard.,&#xD;
" That is a melancholy fact ! And my self-indulgence&#xD;
&#xD;
needs to be kept in check. Miss faith," he said dropping&#xD;
his voice still more, "Stranger regrets very much that he&#xD;
must now go through that figure of the cotillion called&#xD;
'Ladies change '1" And with a low and laughing bow, Mr.&#xD;
Linden reined back his horse and returned to his former&#xD;
place with all the soberness that circumstances allowed.&#xD;
There was no soberness whatever in the face with which&#xD;
Faith recommenced her tete-a-tete with Miss Harrison.&#xD;
Thy doctor was perfectly in order.&#xD;
"I have been thinking," he said, "since my question of&#xD;
how the world went with you, what a very insignificant&#xD;
thing, as to extent 'the world' of any one person is."&#xD;
." Compared with the universe," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"What sort of a world have you got into?" said Dr.&#xD;
Harriskn somewhat impatiently. " No-the actual extent&#xD;
of yourand my consciousness-of that field of action and&#xD;
percep on which we magnificently call our world! What&#xD;
a mighty limited field it.is 1"&#xD;
"I think you describe it correctly," said Mr. Linden:&#xD;
"it is both mighty and limited. A little space railed off&#xD;
for every man-and yet larger than that man can ever fill."&#xD;
"It seems to me too insignificant to be worth filling."&#xD;
"There is a little outlet on every side that makes it im-&#xD;
possible to fill ?"&#xD;
"What do you mean ?"&#xD;
"I mean, that while our action at every step touches other&#xD;
people, and their consequent action moves on with like effect,&#xD;
the limits of our power in this world can never be known."&#xD;
"Will you think me impertinent if I ask once more what&#xD;
you mean ?-or rather, ask you to enlarge a little ?"&#xD;
"If a man plants the first clover seed or thistle-down&#xD;
in some great continent," said Mr. Linden, "from whose&#xD;
little field is it, that in a hundred years the whole land&#xD;
bears thistles or clover ?"&#xD;
"It won't,",said the doctor, "if a hundred other things&#xD;
are sown at the same time. And so it seems to me in life-&#xD;
that one action is counteracted by another, urliversally,-.&#xD;
and nothing makes anything !--of any avail."&#xD;
" If noting is of any avail, things don't counteract each&#xD;
other. You are proving my position."&#xD;
The doctor smiled, not unpleasantly.&#xD;

"I see," he said, "you can maintain any position you&#xD;
choose to take,--on the ground or in the air ! I must give&#xD;
way to you on this ground."  And Dr. Harrison reined,&#xD;
back his horse and came into Faith's neighbourhood.&#xD;
"Miss Derrick, the road is getting too contracted for such&#xD;
a procession--will you draw bridle ?"&#xD;
"I don't want to ride behind, Dr. Harrison," said Faith&#xD;
looking laughingly back at him. "I'll go on in front."&#xD;
Which she did, so briskly that the doctor had to bestir&#xD;
himself to come up with her.&#xD;
"I didn't know," he said, and he spoke somewhat in&#xD;
earnest,--"I didn't know that you cared anything about&#xD;
eminence or preeminence."            t&#xD;
" Didn't you, Dr. Harrison ?"&#xD;
"Do you?"      '&#xD;
"I don't know-" said Faith gravely. "Eminence?.--&#xD;
yes, I should care very much for that, in some things. Not&#xD;
for preeminence, I think. There's Mr. Simlins !--and I&#xD;
must speak to him." Faith's horse which had been on, an&#xD;
easy canter, came to a stand; and so must the doctor. Mr.&#xD;
Simlins too was on horseback.&#xD;
"Mr. Simlins," said Faith after giving him her hand,&#xD;
"will you have half a day's leisure Monday or Tuesday?"&#xD;
"Leisure ?" said the farmer with his best growl-" no, I&#xD;
sha'n't have it if you take it."&#xD;
"Do you think I may take it ?"&#xD;
"I don't suppose there's anybody that can hinder you,"&#xD;
said Mr. Simlins--"without excepting my own identity. I&#xD;
can't. Do you want to go up yonder again ?"&#xD;
The doctor interposed to make offers of his father's&#xD;
horses, carriage, and servants; but Faith quietly negatived&#xD;
them all.&#xD;
"How did you get home the other night ?" said the farmer.&#xD;
"Did you get over the river ?" Then shifting his ground&#xD;
as Miss Harrison and Stranger came up into the group, he&#xD;
changed his question.&#xD;
"I say Mr. Linden1.-I heerd Quapaw creek was choked&#xD;
up the other night-how did you get home ?"&#xD;
"The same way I expect to now," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"How did you, Mr. Simlins." .&#xD;
" The harness was all right," said Mr. Simlins--." if any.&#xD;
&#xD;
thing else was in a disorganized state, 'twas somebody's&#xD;
fault besides your. That lynch-pin made trouble though;&#xD;
it didn't fit more places than one. Did you get across&#xD;
Quapaw creek on your horses ?"&#xD;
"Do you suppose I crossed on foot ?" said Mr. Liden&#xD;
smiling. "Do you take me for a witch, Mr. Simlins ?"&#xD;
"I haven't just made up    mind about that, said the&#xD;
farmer. "I've a temptation   think you air. What's-&#xD;
that you're on?"                      .A.&#xD;
"Only a broomstick in disguise, Mr. Simlins. As he&#xD;
belongs to Dr. Harrison, I am willing to own so much.&#xD;
"ie's as well-shaped a broomstick as ever I see, said&#xD;
the farmer consideratively. "I shouldn't mind puttin' him&#xD;
in harness. Well good-day   I'm glad this girl didn't&#xD;
have to go all round again the other night-I was afeard&#xD;
she had. I'll take you over creation," he sung out after&#xD;
her as they parted company,-"and I'll be along Mponday.&#xD;
"Quapaw creek ?" said Dr. Harrison, as the iterrupted&#xD;
procession took up its line of march again,- I think&#xD;
remember that. What was the matter ?"&#xD;
"The bridge was broken, with a loaded wagon upon it,&#xD;
Faith explained.&#xD;
"And you crossed by fording ?"&#xD;
S"Yes."&#xD;
"Isn't it rather a difficult ford?  If I remember right,&#xD;
the bed of the stream is uneven and rough; doesn't it&#xD;
require some guiding of the horses?"&#xD;
"I believe so-yes. It isn't safe for an ignorant rider."&#xD;
S"I didn't give you credit," said he looking at her, for&#xD;
S)being such a horsewoman. That is quite a feat for a lady."&#xD;
Faith coloured high. But she was not going a second&#xD;
time to fight the doctor 'with his own weapons.' A very&#xD;
little she hesitated, then she said boldly, though not in very&#xD;
bold tones it must be confessed,-&#xD;
"I am not a horsewoman-Mr. Linden carried me over.&#xD;
The doctor looked very moody for a few minutes; then&#xD;
his brow brightened. Faith's straightforward truth had&#xD;
served her as well as the most exquisite piece of involution.&#xD;
The doctor could not very wl see the face with which her&#xD;
words were spoken and had to make up his mnd upon&#xD;
them alone.&#xD;

left Qiapaw creek in, the distance-and talked of all manner&#xD;
of pleasant things. And so, with no second break of the&#xD;
j    order of march, they went on and went home.&#xD;
"Mr. Linden," said Faith when she was lighting the lamp&#xD;
for study in the evening,-"you'll never ask anything of me&#xD;
so hard to do as that was to-day."&#xD;
"Hard ?" he replied. "Why ?"&#xD;
"To keep in front, where I could not see you and that&#xD;
horse."&#xD;
"Miss Faith! I am very sorry !-.But you know I had&#xD;
you in charge-I felt hound to keep you in sight."&#xD;
I know,"..-she said; and sat down to her work.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
HERE was no more riding after that-the weather&#xD;
T    grew too cold, and Mattabeeset was put off till&#xD;
spring; but with walks and talks and,, reading aloud,&#xD;
G osthe's maxim was well carried out. For there is music&#xD;
that needs no composer but Peace, and fireside groups that&#xD;
are not bad pictures in stormy weather. And so December&#xD;
began to check off its short days with busy fingers.&#xD;
There came a sudden interruption to all this, except De..&#xD;
cember's part of it. For a letter arrived from Miss Delia&#xD;
Danforth, at Pequot, begging that Faith would come and&#xD;
spend a little time with her. Miss Delia was very unwell,&#xD;
and suffering and alone, with the exception of her brother's&#xD;
French wife; and she wrote with longing desire to see&#xD;
Faith. Mr. Danforth had been some years dead, and&#xD;
the widow and the sister who had lived so long together&#xD;
with him, since his death had kept their -old household life,&#xD;
in a very quiet way, without him. But now Miss Danforth&#xD;
longed for some of her own kindred, or had a special liking&#xD;
or desire for Faith's company, for she prayed her to come.&#xD;
And it was not a call that Faith herself a moment doubted&#xD;
about answering. Mrs. Derrick's willingness lingered, for&#xD;
various natural reasons; but that too followed. It was&#xD;
clear that Faith ought not to refuse.&#xD;
The day before she was to go, Mrs. Derrick made here&#xD;
self unusually busy and tired,.so as to spare Fait's study-&#xD;
time; and thus it fell out, that when night came and&#xD;
prayers were over, Mrs. Derrick went straight to bed;&#xD;
partly from fatigue, partly to be ready for an early start&#xD;
nest day; for she was to drive Faith over to Pequot.. No&#xD;
such need or inducements sent Faith to bed; and the two&#xD;
students planned a longer evening of work than common,&#xD;
to anticipate lost time. But when the hours were about&#xD;
half spent, Cindy came to the door and called out, "Miss&#xD;
Faith !"-Faith left her book and went to the door, which&#xD;
she held open.&#xD;

"There, was a boy come to-night," said Cindy, "from&#xD;
that old starvation creator down by Barley point, and he&#xD;
says she's more in a box than ever.  Haint a crumb of&#xD;
bread for breakfast-nor supper neither, for that."&#xD;
"Is the boy here now ?"&#xD;
"Why sakes no t" said Cindy. "1He come while youwas&#xD;
to supper. I s'pose I might ha'telled ye before, but then&#xD;
again I was busy bakin' cakes--and I'm free to confess I&#xD;
forgot. And prayers always does turn everything out of&#xD;
my head. I 'can't guess how I thought of it now. Mr.&#xD;
Skip's away' to-night, too," said Cindy in 'conclusion.&#xD;
Faith shut the door behind her.&#xD;
"It's too far for you to go alone. Can you find some-&#xD;
body to go with you, Cindy? I'll put up a basket of things&#xD;
for her."&#xD;
"Aint a soul in sight-" said Cindy. "I'd as lieves go&#xD;
the hull way alone as to snoop round, hunting folks."&#xD;
"Then Cindy, if you'll get ready I'll go with you. She&#xD;
must have something."&#xD;
Cindy looked at her. "Guess you better get fixed first,&#xD;
'Miss Faith. 'Taint hardly worth my while, I reckon. Who&#xD;
shouldn't we have after us !"&#xD;
"Just have your shawl and bonnet ready, Cindy, wll&#xD;
you ?" said Faith gravely,-."and I'll be ready in a very few&#xD;
minutes."&#xD;
She went with business speed to pantry and cellar, and&#xD;
soon had a sizeable basket properly filled. Leaving that in&#xD;
. 1Cindy's charge, Faith went back to the sitting-room, and&#xD;
came and stood by the table, and said quietly, "I can't do&#xD;
any more to-nightt Mr. Linden. I must be busy in another&#xD;
way. I am going out for a little while."&#xD;
"May I ask-not from curiosity-with whom?" he said&#xD;
looking up at her.&#xD;
"With Cindy-to attend to some business she didn't&#xD;
tell me of in proper time."  Faith had laid her books&#xD;
together and was going off. Mr. Linden rose from the&#xD;
table.b&#xD;
"With me, if you please, Miss Faith. I will not intrude&#xD;
upon your business."&#xD;
"It's no business to be intruded upon!" she said with&#xD;
her simple look into his face. "But Cindy and I can do&#xD;

it. Please do not let me take you away ! I am not afraid&#xD;
...-much."&#xD;
"Miss Faith, you want a great many lessons yet !-and&#xD;
I do not deserve this. Don't you know that in Mrs/Derrick's&#xD;
absence I am guardian of her house-and of you? I will&#xD;
go with you, or without you-just as you choose," he added&#xD;
smiling. "ff you would rather study than walk, you shall.&#xD;
Is the business too intricate for me to manage ?"&#xD;
"It's only to carry some things to an old woman who is&#xD;
in great want of them. They can't wait till to-morrow. If&#xD;
you will go, Mr. Linden,-.-I'll be. ready in a minute. I'd&#xD;
like to go."&#xD;
She ran to get ready, and-fMr. Linden went to the&#xD;
kitchen and took the basket from Cindy, and then waited&#xD;
at the front door till Faith came, and they went out into&#xD;
the moonlight together. A. very bright moonlight, and&#xD;
dark shadows-dark and still; only one of them seemed&#xD;
to move; but that one made Faith glad of her change of&#xD;
companions.  Perhaps it made the same suggestion to&#xD;
Mr. Linden, for his first words looked that way.&#xD;
"Miss Faith, you did not do quite right, to-night. Don't&#xD;
you know-" with a gentle half smiling tone-"you must&#xD;
not let anything make you do wrong ?"&#xD;
Her look and tone were both very confiding, and touched&#xD;
with timidity.&#xD;
"Did I, Mr. Linden? I didn't mean it."&#xD;
"I know that.-but you must remember for another&#xD;
time." And he went off to other subjects, giving her talk&#xD;
and information that were perhaps better than books. The&#xD;
walk was good, too; the air bracing, and the village sights&#xD;
and sounds in a subsiding glimmer and murmur. The&#xD;
evening out of doors was worth as much as the evening&#xD;
within doors could have been. Faith thought so. The way&#xD;
was down the road that led to Barley point, branching off&#xD;
from that. The distance to the poor cottage seemed short&#xD;
enough, but if it had seemed long Faith would have felt&#xD;
herself well paid-so much was the supply needed, so joy-&#xD;
fully was it received. The basket was left there for Mr.&#xD;
Skip to bring home another time, and at a rather late hour&#xD;
in the evening the return walk began.&#xD;
The night was sharp and frosty, and still, now, with a&#xD;

&#xD;
depth of silence. The moon, high and full, beamed down&#xD;
in silver splendour, and the face of the earth was all white&#xD;
or black. The cold, clear light, the sharp shadows angling&#xD;
and defining everything, the absolute stillness-how well&#xD;
they chimed !-and chime they did, albeit noiselessly. In&#xD;
that bracing air the very steps of the two homeward bound&#xD;
people seemed to sprin more light and elastic, and gave&#xD;
little sound. They we ht on together with a quick even&#xD;
step,-the very walking was pleasant. For a while they&#xD;
talked busily too,-then Thought came in and claimed her&#xD;
place, and words ceased.&#xD;
They had left the. turn to the belt of woods, and were&#xD;
now passing one or two empty fields where low hedges made&#xD;
a black line of demarcation, and the moonlight seemed even&#xD;
whiter than before. Faith was on the side next the road,&#xD;
and both a little way out, for the walking was smoother&#xD;
and dryer.&#xD;
How it was done Faith could not tell-the next two&#xD;
seconds seemed full of separate things which she remem-&#xD;
bered afterwards-but her hand was disengaged from Mr.&#xD;
Linden's arm, and he was standing before her and she be-&#xD;
hind him, almost before she had fairly seen a little flash of&#xD;
red light from the hedge before them. A sharp report-a&#xD;
powdery taint on the sweet air, came then to give their&#xD;
evidence-to what ?&#xD;
That second past, Mr. Linden turned, but still stand-&#xD;
ing so as to shield her, and laid both hands on her shoul-&#xD;
ders.&#xD;
"Are yoni hurt ?" he said, in a voice lowered by feeling,&#xD;
not intent.&#xD;
One bewildered instant she stood mute-perhaps with no&#xD;
breath for words; the next minute, with a motion too un-&#xD;
expected and sudden to be hindered, lifting both hands she&#xD;
threw his off, bounded to one side to be clear of him,,and&#xD;
sprang like a gazelle towards the spot where the red flash&#xD;
had caught her eye. But she was caught and stopped&#xD;
before she reached it, and held still.-That same shield&#xD;
between her and the hedge.&#xD;
"Did it touch you?" Mr. Linden repeated.&#xD;
"No-Let me ! let me !"--she said eagerly endeavouring&#xD;
to free herself.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ike was silent a moment-a deep drawn breath the only&#xD;
replyP but he did not loose his hold.&#xD;
"My dear child;" he said, "you could find nothing-for&#xD;
what would you go ?"--the tone was very gentle, even&#xD;
moved. "You must walk on before me as quick as you&#xD;
can. Will you promise to do it? I will keep you in&#xD;
sight."&#xD;
"Before you ?-no. What are you going, to do?  Are&#xD;
you touched ?"--ller voice changed as she went on.&#xD;
'"I am not hurt-and mean to do nothing to-night but&#xD;
follow you home. But give me your promise, Miss Faith,&#xD;
-you must not stand here."&#xD;
" Why in front? will they be behind us ?"&#xD;
"I must have you in sight-and I will not have you&#xD;
near me." And letting go his hold he said, almost impera-&#xD;
tively,&#xD;
"I will trust you. Walk on before me 1-Miss Faith, you&#xD;
must not delay a moment."&#xD;
"I will go with you," she said low, and, clinging to his&#xD;
arm ;-"Your safety is in being near me. I will not delay.&#xD;
Come !"-&#xD;
But the hand was taken off again, and held in both his&#xD;
while he spoke.&#xD;
"I will not have you anywhere near ine! If you do not&#xD;
walk on far in front, I shall,- and keep watch of you as&#xD;
best I can."  And he let go her hand, and stepped back&#xD;
with a quick pace that soon put some distance between&#xD;
them. She stood.still a moment, looking, and then sprang&#xD;
back till she. reached him; speaking with a low vehemence&#xD;
that did not seem like Faith.&#xD;
"I will not do it, Mr. Lindyn-I will not ! I will not!&#xD;
-Come, come! don't stay here !"&#xD;
Whatever Mr. Linden felt at that appeal-and he was&#xD;
not a man' to feel it lightly-lis words lost none of their&#xD;
firmness.&#xD;
"I shall not stir until you are ten yards in front of me!l-&#xD;
unless I leave you as far behind."&#xD;
She planted herself for an instant before him and looked&#xD;
in his face, with eyes of quiet but most eloquent beseech-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
"No"-he repeated-" you must go on and fear nothing.&#xD;

Child-  there is no restraint to the Lord, to save by many&#xD;
or by few.'&#xD;
She did not answer, even by the little shake of the head&#xD;
which sometimes with her stood in place of words. She&#xD;
turned, went swiftly forward, with a straight, even, unslack-&#xD;
ening pace, which did not falter nor stop for a long, long&#xD;
piece of the way; how long it was by the-mind's measure-&#xD;
ment it would be hard to tell. It was one breathless sense&#xD;
of pain and fear; of which moonlight and shadows and&#xD;
the points of the way all made part and were woven in&#xD;
together. Her ears were tingling for that sound; her eyes&#xD;
only measured unconsciously the distances and told off the&#xD;
waymarks. Down the little pitch of the road where that&#xD;
to Barley point forked off; then by a space of clear fences&#xD;
where hedgerows were not, and a barn or two rose up in&#xD;
the moonlight; through gates where the post shadows&#xD;
were black and deep, by the skirting bushes that now and&#xD;
then gathered about the rails. She walked as fast as she&#xD;
could and keep her strength.  That was unconsciously&#xD;
measured too. It had seemed to her, in her agony of&#xD;
pleading before the commencing of this strange walk, that&#xD;
it was impossible she should do it. She was doing it now,&#xD;
under a force of will that she had not been able to with-&#xD;
stand; and her mind was subdued and strained beyond the&#xD;
power of thinking. Her very walking seemed to her me-&#xD;
chanical; intensely alive as her senses were all the time.&#xD;
There was a transient relief at corning into the neighbour-&#xD;
hood of a house, and a drear feeling of desolation and in-&#xD;
creased danger as she left it behind her; but her pace&#xD;
neither faltered nor flagged. She looked round sometimes,&#xD;
but never paused for that. Before the more thickly settled&#xD;
part of the village was reached her step grew a little&#xD;
slower, pi-obably from the sheer necessity of filling strength;&#xD;
but steady it was, at whatever rate of travel. When at&#xD;
last they turned the sandy corner into the broad street or&#xD;
main way of -the village, where houses and gardens often&#xD;
broke the range of hedgeway or fence, and lights spoke&#xD;
to lights in the neighbouring windows, Faith stopped and&#xD;
stood leaning against the fence. In another moment she&#xD;
was drawn away from that to a better support.&#xD;
"Are you faint ?" Mr. Linden said.&#xD;
&#xD;
11cr 'no' was faint, buYthe  nswer was true for all the&#xD;
rest of her.&#xD;
He drew her hand within his arm, and went on silently;&#xD;
but how glad he was to see her home, Faith might guess&#xD;
from the way she was half carried up the steps and into&#xD;
the hall, and the door shut and locked behind her. After&#xD;
the same fashion she was taken into the sitting-room and&#xD;
placed in the easy chair, And her wrappers unfastened and&#xD;
taken off with very gentle and quick hands. She offered&#xD;
almost as little help as hindrance, and her head sank imme-&#xD;
diately.&#xD;
He stood by her, and repeated his question about faint-&#xD;

ness.&#xD;
"0 no, sir.-I'm not faint. It's nothing," Faith said,&#xD;
but as if her very voice was exhausted. And crossing her&#xD;
arms upon the table, close to which the easy chair stood,&#xD;
she laid her head down upon them. Her mother might&#xD;
well say she had a baby face. It looked so then.&#xD;
Mr. Linden's next move was to get a glass of wine, and&#xD;
with gentle force and persuasion to make her swallow it;&#xD;
that done, he stood leaning upon the back of her chair,&#xD;
silently, but with a very, very grave face.&#xD;
She kept her position, scarcely stirring, for some length&#xD;
of time, except that after a while she did her face in her&#xD;
hands. And sitting so, at last she spoke, in a troubled&#xD;
tone.&#xD;
"-What can be done, Mr. Linden ?-to put a stop to&#xD;
this."&#xD;
"I will try what can be done," he answered, though not&#xD;
as if that point were uppermost in his mind. "I think I&#xD;
can find a way. I wish ,nothing gave me more uneasiness&#xD;
than that?"&#xD;
"Do you think there is any way that you can do it,&#xD;
thoroughly ?"&#xD;
"Yes, I think so," he repeated. "There are ways of&#xD;
doing most things. I shall try. Do not you think about&#xD;
it, Missy Faith,-I have something now to make me glad&#xD;
you are going to Pequot. Before, I could only remember&#xD;
how much I should miss my scholar."&#xD;
",Why are you glad now, Mr. Linden ?"  Faith's voice&#xD;
was in as subdued a state of mind as her face.&#xD;

&#xD;
few minutes to do this; and then Mr. Linden laid the books&#xD;
together, and drawing the old Bible towards him once&#xD;
more, he turned to the ninety-first Psalm and read it aloud.&#xD;
Read it with full heart-felt effect; which made the words&#xD;
'fall like the dew they are, upon the weary little flower&#xD;
Faith was: Then he bade her once more goodnight.&#xD;
Shewent refreshed; yet to become a prey to struggling&#xD;
thoughts which for a while prevented refreshment from&#xD;
having its lawful action. How much of the night and of&#xD;
the early morning Faith spent in these thoughts, 'and in&#xD;
the fruit of them, is uncertain; for the evening's work&#xD;
would sufficiently have accounted for her worn look the&#xD;
next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Change of air will be good for you-till this air is in&#xD;
a better state."&#xD;
She made no answer. In a few minutes she rose up,&#xD;
gathered her wrappers into one hand, and turning to Mr.&#xD;
Linden held out the other to him; with a very child's look,&#xD;
which however was rather doubtful about meeting his. His&#xD;
look had lost none of its grave concern.&#xD;
"Are you better ?" he said. "Will you promise to go&#xD;
right to sleep, and leave all troublesome matters where&#xD;
alone they can be taken care of?"&#xD;
The faintest kind of a smile flitted across her face. "I&#xD;
don't know"-she said doubtfully,---" I don't know what I&#xD;
can do, Mr. Linden."&#xD;
"I have told you."&#xD;
"I'll try-the last part," she said with a somewhat more&#xD;
defined smile as she glanced up !at him. It was as grave&#xD;
and gentle a smile as is often known.&#xD;
"You must try it all," he said, giving her hand the same&#xD;
touch it had had once before. "Miss Faith, I may use&#xD;
your words-I think you will never give me harder work to&#xD;
do than I have had to-night !"&#xD;
She could not bear that. She stood with eyes cast&#xD;
down, and a fluttering quiver upon, her lip ; still, because&#xD;
the effort to control herself was at the moment as much as&#xD;
she could do. It was successful, though barely; and then,&#xD;
without venturing another look, she said her low 'Good-&#xD;
night, sir'; and moved away. She was accompanied as far&#xD;
as the door, but then Mr. Linden paused, with his hand on&#xD;
the latch.&#xD;
"Shall you take any work-I mean book work-with you&#xD;
to Pequot ?-or will your hands find too much else to do ?"&#xD;
"I meant to take some-I meant to do a good deal-I&#xD;
hope so."&#xD;
"Then can you come back to the great chair for ten&#xD;
minutes, and let me give you a word or two of direction ?"&#xD;
She came immediately and sat down. And Mr. Linden&#xD;
went back to where they had been interrupted early in the&#xD;
evening, and told her what and where and how to go on in&#xD;
the various books, till she should see him again; putting&#xD;
marks here ande there to save her trouble, or pencilling&#xD;
some explanation which might be needed. It took but a~&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXV.&#xD;
&#xD;
''/     UST   I go to Pequot ?" was the first thought&#xD;
that entered Faith's mind the next morning.&#xD;
And the advancing daylight, with its" clear steadfast&#xD;
way of looking at things, said, "Yes, you must." "Is&#xD;
there anything I-who know most about this business-.&#xD;
can do to put an end to it ?" That was a second thrilling&#xD;
question. The same daylight gave its frank answer ~&#xD;
"No, you cannot-you cannot." Faith took both answers,&#xD;
and tlen sought, in the very spirit of a child, to "leave&#xD;
all troublesome things where alone they could be taken&#xD;
care of.&#xD;
"There is a faculty in this,'' saith Leighton, "that all&#xD;
persons have not." But the spirit of a child can do it;&#xD;
and the spirit of a Qhristian, so far as it is right, 'is none&#xD;
other. Faith went down stairs, in spite of inward sorrow&#xD;
and trembling, with a quiet brow. It was very much the&#xD;
face of last night, for its subdued look, and in spite of the&#xD;
night's rest, in its paleness too; though the colour played&#xD;
there somewhat fitfully. Sorrowful note-of that Mr. Linden&#xD;
took, or the pained look of last night had not passed off&#xD;
from his face,-or bpth might be true. So far as the most&#xD;
gentle, quick-sighted, and careful attention could be of&#xD;
avail, the breakfast was pleasant ;--otherwise it was but a&#xD;
grave affair. Even Mrs. Derrick looked from one to the&#xD;
other, with thoughtfulness that was not merely of Faith's&#xD;
going away.&#xD;
There was little time however for observations. Directly&#xD;
after breakfast the wagon was got ready; and when they&#xD;
were bestowed in it and Mr. Linden's farewell had bade&#xD;
Faith remember all his injunctions the night before, he&#xD;
-turned and walked on to. his own place of work and the&#xD;
mother and daughter set forth on their journey.&#xD;
In a small insignificant house, in a by street of Pequot,&#xD;
was the little, very od  household of the two, Miss and&#xD;
Madame Danforth. The, kept no servant; they lived quite&#xD;

to themselves; the various work of the household they&#xD;
shared between them and made it as good as play; and no&#xD;
worse than play seemed all the rest of their quiet lives.&#xD;
But Miss Dilly was ill now and unable to do her part; and&#xD;
what was worse,'and more, she had lost her wonted cheer-&#xD;
ful and gay way of looking at things.  That the little&#xD;
Frenchwoman never lost; but it takes two to keep up a&#xD;
shuttlecock, and Faith was welcome in that house.&#xD;
What work she did there for the next two or three-&#xD;
weeks was best known-not to herself-but to the two old&#xD;
ladies whose hearts she cheered. And they knew not all;&#xD;
they did not know the leap of Faith's heart at the thought&#xD;
of home, whenever, morning or noon or night, it came into&#xD;
her head. She kept it out of her head as much as she&#xD;
could.&#xD;
And s   went about from the top to the bottom of the&#xD;
house, ev n after the first day she came, the same sort of&#xD;
sunbeam she was at home.  She took in hand Miss Dan.&#xD;
forth's broom and duster, and did Cindy's part of setting&#xD;
cups and saucers; but that was a small matter. The help-&#xD;
ful hand which made itself so busy and the voice which ran&#xD;
+  music all up and down the house, were never forgotten,&#xD;
- even by the Frenchwoman. To Miss Danforth, feeble and&#xD;
ailing, Faith ministered differently, and did truly the work&#xD;
of an angel. More than once before the second day was&#xD;
done, Miss Dilly repeated, "Faith, child, how glad I am I&#xD;
sent for you !"-And Madame DInforth took to her mightily;&#xD;
opened heart and arms without reservation; and delighting&#xD;
to have her company, carried her down into the kitchen and&#xD;
initiated Faith into deep mysteries of the science and art&#xD;
the head quarters of; which' are there. Now did Faith&#xD;
learn new secrets about coffee, about eggs, about salads and&#xD;
about vegetables, that she never knew before; and for some&#xD;
unknown reason she was keen to learn, and liked the half&#xD;
hours over the kitchen fire with Madame Danforth so well,&#xD;
that the little Frenchwoman grew proud other pupil.&#xD;
It was the third day of Faith's being at Pequot. Faith&#xD;
was engaged in some gentle offices about the room, folding&#xD;
up clothes and putting drawers in order. Miss Danfortli's&#xD;
eye watched her, following every movement, till Madame&#xD;
D~anforth left the room to go out on business,~ Faith was&#xD;

summoned then to her aunt's side. It was the darkening&#xD;
part of the afternoon. Faith sat down at the foot of Mi&#xD;
Danforth's great easy chair, looked into the fire, and won,&#xD;
dered what they were doing at Pattaquasset.&#xD;
"And so, Faith, child, you're taken to new ways,&#xD;
hear."&#xD;
To Faith's quick ear, Miss Danforth's voice skewed a&#xD;
purpose.  It was less brisk than its old wont.    Her&#xD;
answer was as simple as possible. "Yes, aunt Dilly. It's&#xD;
true."&#xD;
"You don't think you're any better than you used to be&#xD;
--do you ?"&#xD;
"No, ma'am. Yet my life is better, I hope."&#xD;
"I don't believe it.! How could it be ?"&#xD;
"In this at least, that I am the servant of God now,&#xD;
Before, I ne er thought of serving him."&#xD;
"I never did," said Miss Dilly. "But",-&#xD;
There was a silence. Faith's heart leapt to hear this&#xD;
confession, but she said nothing and sat still as a mouse.&#xD;
"How's Mr. Linden getting on in Pattaquasset ?"&#xD;
"well."&#xD;
"You like him as well as ever ?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
Alert questions. Rather faint answers.&#xD;
"Do you remember what he said one night, about every-&#xD;
body'being precious? Do you remember it, Faith ?"&#xD;
"Yes, ma'am-.very well."&#xD;
"I suppose I have thought. of it five hundred and fifty&#xD;
times," Miss Dilly went on. "What were the words, Faith ?,&#xD;
do you know 'em ?"&#xD;
Faith did not move, only repeated, and if they had been&#xD;
literal diamonds every word would not have seemed so&#xD;
precious to her,-..&#xD;
"'They shall be mine, saith the Lord, in the day when&#xD;
Imace up my jewels.'&#xD;
"That's it !" said Miss Dilly.  "Now go on, can you,,&#xD;
Faith, and tell me what it means."&#xD;
"It is spoken of the people that fear the Lord, aunt&#xD;
Dilly-it goes on-&#xD;
"'And I will spare them, as a man spareth his own&#xD;
son that serveth him. Then shall ye return and discern&#xD;
&#xD;
445&#xD;
&#xD;
between the righteous and the wicked, between him that&#xD;
serveth God and him that serveth him not."&#xD;
'' Tell me more, Faith," said Miss Danforth presently&#xD;
in a subdued voice. "I don't understand one thing about&#xD;
it from beginning to end."&#xD;
In answer to which Faith turned, took a Bible, and as&#xD;
one did of old, preached unto her Jesus. It was very simple&#xD;
preaching. Faith told her aunt the story even very much&#xD;
as she had told it to Johnny Fax; and with the same&#xD;
sweet grave face and winning tongue whi qh had drawn the&#xD;
children.  As earnest as they,. Miss Pilly listened and&#xD;
looked, and brought her strong sense to bear upon the&#xD;
words. Not with the same ease of understanding. . She&#xD;
said little, excepting to bid Faith 'go on,'.-in a tone that&#xD;
told the quest she was upon-unsatisfied yet.&#xD;
Faith went on, but preferred to let the Bible words&#xD;
speak instead of her own. It brought Mrs. Custers to&#xD;
mind again, though this time Faith's joy of heart .made&#xD;
her words ring as from a sweet silverArumpet. So they&#xD;
fell on the sick woman's ear; nor was there stay or inter-&#xD;
ruption till Faith heard the hall door close below. She&#xD;
shut the book then; then her arm came round Miss Dan-&#xD;
forth's neck, and her kisses spoke well enough the glad&#xD;
sympathy and encouragement Faith spoke in no other way.&#xD;
One earnest return answered her.&#xD;
From that time, to read the Bible to her aunt was&#xD;
Faith's work; morning, noon, and tight, literally; some-&#xD;
times far into the night. For Mist Danforth, embracing&#xD;
what she had never known before, as the light gradually&#xD;
broke upon her; and feeling that her time for study might&#xD;
be made short, was in eager haste a d longing to acquaint&#xD;
herself with the broad field of ties and privileges, all&#xD;
new, now laid open before     Faith could not read too&#xD;
much; Miss Dilly could   listen too long.&#xD;
"Faith, child," she said one night, late, when they were&#xD;
alone,--"can't you pray for me?"&#xD;
"I do, aunt Dilly."&#xD;
"No, no ! but I mean, can't you pray with me ?-now,&#xD;
here. Can't you, Faith ?"&#xD;
Faith kissed her ; hid her face in her hands and trembled;&#xD;
and then knelt and prayed. And many a time after that.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
T HE Saturday before Christmas, which was moreover&#xD;
the day but one before, Squire Stoutenburgh went&#xD;
over to Pequot; and having checked off his business items,&#xD;
drove straight to Madame Danforth's. The door was&#xD;
opened to him by the Frenchwoman, who took him into a&#xD;
little room very like herself, and left him; and in another&#xD;
minute or two Faith came in. Her exclamation was with&#xD;
the unmistakeable tone and look of pleasure.&#xD;
"My dear, I am very glad to see you!" was part of the&#xD;
warm reply. "How do you do ?"&#xD;
"I do very well, sir."&#xD;
"Ah1!"-said the Squire,-"I suppose so. Well I'll&#xD;
give you a chance to do better. My dear, I'm going to&#xD;
carry you off,-you're wanted."&#xD;
"Am I?" said Faith with a quick change. ' here's&#xD;
nothing the matter ?"&#xD;
"Nothing bad," said the Squire. "At least ope not !&#xD;
Will you go home with me this afternoon ?"&#xD;
"O yes, sir-and very glad ! But did mother send&#xD;
for me ?"&#xD;
"Sent for you if I could get you, Miss Faith. I don't&#xD;
suppose she'll ever really interfere with your doings-if you&#xD;
choose t go and live in the Moon, but she's half sick'for&#xD;
the sigh of you. That's prevalent just now," said the&#xD;
Squire, :'and she's not the worst case. The doctor went&#xD;
off for ear he should take it;-but some people have&#xD;
duties, ou know, and can't stir."&#xD;
There was a tiny peachblossom tinge on Faith's cheek,&#xD;
which the Squire was pleased to take note of. She stood&#xD;
with a thoughtful face the while.&#xD;
"I'll be ready, Mr. Stoutenburgh. When will you come&#xD;
for me ?"&#xD;
The time was fixed, and Faith made her explanations&#xD;
to her friends; promising that if need were she would&#xD;
come back again, or her mother, after Christmas. Miss&#xD;
Dilly let her go very willingly, yet most unwillingly; and&#xD;

&#xD;
Madame Danforth's reluctance had nothing to balance it.&#xD;
So it was that Faith's joy had its wonted mixture of gravity&#xD;
when she met the Squire again.&#xD;
"If you're not going to be glad to get home, I'm a rich&#xD;
man if I'll go in with you 1" he said as he put her in the&#xD;
sleigh and tucked her up with shawls and buffalo robes.&#xD;
"That's the way 1-first get power and then abuse it."&#xD;
"Power ! Mr. Stoutenburgh. What do you mean?    I&#xD;
am very glad to go home. Don't I look so ?"  She cer-&#xD;
tainly did.&#xD;
I mean that I haven't seen anybody smile since you&#xD;
went away," said Mr. Stoutenburgh, proceeding to tuck&#xD;
himself up in like manner. "Except Dr. Harrison. He&#xD;
kept himself in practice while he staid."&#xD;
Faith was silent; eying the snowy road and the jingling&#xD;
horse heads, with 'a bounding feeling of heart that she was&#xD;
going home. She dared allow it to herself now.&#xD;
"What do you guess made the doctor leave that fly-&#xD;
away horse of his for Mr. Linden to tame ?" said the&#xD;
Squire. "Has he any particular reason for wishing to&#xD;
break his neck ?"&#xD;
"Did he do that ?"&#xD;
"Break his neck?-why no, not yet,-I suppose the&#xD;
j doctor lives in hopes. You take it coolly, Miss Faith!&#xD;
upon my word."&#xD;
"Mr. Stoutenburgh !-I meant, did he leave the horse&#xD;
for him. Dr. Harrison knew there wasn't much danger,&#xD;
Mr. Stoutenburgh."&#xD;
Mr. Stoutenburgh touched up his own team.&#xD;
"I guess !"-he said slowly, "the doctor don't just know&#xD;
how much danger there is. So Pattaquasset 'll have a&#xD;
chance to come down on both feet-which that horse&#xD;
don't do often. We've had all sorts of goings on, Miss&#xD;
Faith."&#xD;
"Have you, sir ?" The question was put quietly enough,&#xD;
but there was a little tinge of curiosity, too.&#xD;
"Yes," said the Squire, shaking his whip. "Sam Dea-&#xD;
coh's gone away and Mr. Linden's grown unpopular. Aint&#xD;
that news?&#xD;
"What do you mean, sir ?"&#xD;
"Why Sam Deacon's gone away.-" the Squire repeated&#xD;

coolly. "He was getting rather too much of a sporting'&#xD;
character for our town, so a friend of mine that was going&#xD;
to Egypt-or somewhere--took him along. You needn't&#xD;
be uneasy about him, Miss Faith -he'll be taken care of&#xD;
I should have sent him a worse journey, only I was over.&#xD;
ruled."&#xD;
"And is he gone to Egypt ?" said Faith.&#xD;
"Hardly got so far yet," said the Squire. A'But I&#xD;
/thought it would be good for Sam's health-he's been a&#xD;
little weaker than usual about the head lately."&#xD;
"That was only half of your news, Mr. Stoutenburgh,"&#xD;
Faith said after another interval of musing.&#xD;
"'Tother half's nothing wonderful. Mr. Linden's getting&#xD;
unpopular with everybody in town that he don't make up to&#xD;
on the right side; and as there's a good many of them,&#xD;
I'm afraid it'll spread. I've done my best to tell him how&#xD;
to quiet the matter, but yiou might just as well tell a pep.&#xD;
peridge which way to grow! Did you ever try to make&#xD;
him do anything ?" said the Squire, facing round upon Faith.&#xD;
The startling of Faith's eyes was like a flash; and some-&#xD;
thing so her colour went and came. The answer was a&#xD;
very orderly, "Yes, sir."&#xD;
"Hum-I s'pose he did it,-guess I'll come to you next&#xD;
time I want anything done. Are you cold, my dear ?" said'&#xD;
the Squire renewing his efforts at wrapping up.&#xD;
Faith's desire for Pattaquasset news was satisfied. She&#xD;
manifested no more curiosity about anything; and so far as&#xD;
appeared in words, was contented with her own thoughts.&#xD;
That however would have been a rash conclusion.  For&#xD;
thoughts do occupy that do not content; and Faith could&#xD;
willingly have spared the hints in Mr. Stoutenburgh's last&#xD;
speech-and indeed in several others. She by no means&#xD;
understood them thoroughly; yet something of the drift&#xD;
and air of them she did feel, and felt as unnecessary. There&#xD;
had been already in Faith's mind a doubtful look towards&#xD;
the last evening she had spent in Pattaquasset; a certain&#xD;
undefined consciousness that her action that night might&#xD;
have said or seemed to say-she knew not what. She could&#xD;
find no fault with it, to herself; there had been nothing that&#xD;
she could help; but yet this consciousness made her more&#xD;
tender upon anything that touched the subject. She had&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
449&#xD;
&#xD;
thought of it, and put it out of her head, several'times in&#xD;
these last weeks; and now Mr. Stoutenburgh's words had&#xD;
just the effect to make her shy. Faith's mind however&#xD;
had been fall of grave and sweet things of late, and was&#xD;
in such a state now. The principal feeling, which the&#xD;
Squire's words could not change, was of very deep and&#xD;
joyous happiness; she was exceeding glad to go home; but&#xD;
at the same time in a mood too quiet and sober for the&#xD;
wine of joy to get into her head.&#xD;
Squire Stoutenburgh too seemed satisfied,--perhaps with&#xD;
the uncold hue of Faith's cheeks; and now drove on at a&#xD;
rapid rate, talking only of indifferent matters. The horses&#xD;
trotted quick over the smooth snow, and the gathering lead&#xD;
Teolour overhead was touched with gleams of light here and&#xD;
there, as the sun went down behind the Pattaquasset out-&#xD;
lines. Swiftly they jingled along, crossing the ferry and&#xD;
mounting the hill; past trees and barns and village houses&#xD;
-then into the main street: down which the horses flew&#xD;
with a will, thinking of oats and their good Stable, and un-&#xD;
willingly reined in at Mrs. Derrick's door.&#xD;
It was dark by that time-Faith could see little but the&#xD;
lights glimmering in the windows, and indeed had no time&#xD;
to see much; so suddenly and softly was she lifted out of&#xD;
r the sleigh the moment it stopped. Then Mr. Linden's&#xD;
voice said,&#xD;
"Thank you, Mr. Stoutenburgh1"&#xD;
"That's one way of thanking me !" said the Squire.&#xD;
"However--I suppose it's all right,"--and gave his impa-&#xD;
tient horses their way.&#xD;
"Why Mr. Linden," said Faith half laughing, but with&#xD;
a little of the old timidity in her voice,-"how could you&#xD;
see me before I saw you ?"&#xD;
"For various reasons, Miss Faith. How do you do ?"&#xD;
He led her on, into the house and into the tea-room, there&#xD;
to delight her mother's heart and make her mother's eyes&#xD;
overflow.&#xD;
"Pretty child 1" Mrs. Derrick said,-" I never will let you&#xD;
go away again for anybody I"&#xD;
Faith laughed, and kissed her and kissed her; but did&#xD;
not take that moment to say what she thought-that Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick would have to let her go again in a few days perhaps,&#xD;

and for Miss Danforth herself. Then her eye glanced at the&#xD;
tea-table, as it might at an *ungoverned kingdom--or a&#xD;
vacated sphei-e; an  the fulness of her heart broke out,&#xD;
"Mother !--Pm ad to be home again !" The tone said&#xD;
it yet more than t e words. And then with a sudden&#xD;
movement, she went off a step to Mr. Linden and held out&#xD;
her hand to him, albeit ever so little shyly. The hand was&#xD;
taken and kept, his eyes taking a quiet survey of her the&#xD;
while.&#xD;
"Miss Faith, you want to be set to work ! Some people&#xD;
will neglect themselves if they have a chance."&#xD;
"I haven't done much work since I have been away, Mr.&#xD;
Linden."&#xD;
He smiled -what was he reading in her face?  "You&#xD;
don't know what you have done, child," he said. "But she&#xD;
looks glad, Mrs. Derrick,-and we are very glad to have&#xD;
her."  Whereupon F th was conducted to the tea-table&#xD;
without more delay; Mrs. Derrick feeling sure that she&#xD;
was starving both with cold and hunger.&#xD;
Faith had no appearance of 'being cold; and though she&#xD;
certainly did eat her supper as if she was glad to be at&#xD;
home, it was not with the air of a person with whom his&#xD;
bread and butter is the first thought. Gladness shone in&#xD;
every look and movement; but at the same time over all&#xD;
the gladness there was a slight veil; it might be gravity,&#xD;
but it might not be all gravity, for part of it was very like&#xD;
constraint; the eyes were moreready to fall than to rise;&#xD;
and the words, though free to come, had a great facility&#xD;
for running in short sentences. But Mrs. Derrick was too&#xD;
happy to notice such light streaks of mist in the sunshine,&#xD;
and talked away at a most unusual rate,-telling Faith how&#xD;
Mr. Linden had ridden that 'wild horse,' and had found&#xD;
time to teach her little class, and In general had done&#xD;
everything else-for everything seemed to hinge upon him.&#xD;
Mr. Linden himself-with now and then a word to qualify,&#xD;
or to make Faith laugh, took a somewhat special and quiet&#xD;
care of her and her wants at the table; all which seemed&#xD;
to Faith (in her mood) very like little gentle suggestions&#xD;
at that veil ;-othrwise, he was rather silent.&#xD;
-Then followed prayers, with all the sweet warm infiu-&#xD;
ences of the tIme; and then Faith, might sit and talk or 130&#xD;

silent, as she liked; rest being considered the best work for&#xD;
ithat evening. It would seem that she liked to be silept,---&#xD;
;   if that were a fair conclusion from her silence. Her eye&#xD;
took happy note of the familiar things in and about the&#xD;
'  room; then she sat and looked into the fireplace, as glad to&#xD;
see it again maybe,-or doubtful about looking elsewhere.&#xD;
As silently, for a few minutes, Mr. Linden took note of her:&#xD;
then he spoke.&#xD;
"Miss Faith, will you let me give you lessons all through&#xD;
the holidays ?"&#xD;
She gave him a swift blushing glance and smile. , If&#xD;
you liJ e to do it, Mr. Linden-and if IJam here."&#xD;
here do you find those two 'ifs'?"&#xD;
"I thought, perhaps, when I came away from Pequot&#xD;
to-day, that I might go back again after Monday. I am&#xD;
afraid aunt Dilly will want me."&#xD;
"How much must people want you, to gain a hearing ?"&#xD;
"There are different kinds of wanting," Faith said&#xD;
gravely. "Aunt Dilly may miss me too much."&#xD;
"And the abstract 'too much,' is different from the com-&#xD;
parative. What about that other 'if'?"&#xD;
"'The other if' ?-I don't know that there is anything&#xD;
about it, Mr. Linden," Faith said laughing.&#xD;
"Whence did it come ?.-before it 'trickeled,' as Bunyan&#xD;
.says, to your tongue ?"&#xD;
"I don't know, sir !"-&#xD;
"Miss Faith!--I did not think you would so forget me&#xD;
in three weeks. Do you want to hear the story of a very&#xD;
cold, icy little brook ?" he said, with a sort of amused de-&#xD;
mureness that gave her the benefit of all his adjectives.&#xD;
She looked up at him with earnest eyes not at all amused,&#xD;
but that verged on being hurt; and it was with a sort of&#xD;
fear of what the real answer might be, that she asked what&#xD;
he meant.&#xD;
"Miss Faith, I mean nothing very bad," he said with a&#xD;
full smile at her then. "When I really think you are build.&#xD;
ing yourself an ice palace, I shall spend my efforts upon&#xD;
thawing, not talking. What have you been doing all these&#xD;

With a little bit of answering smile she said, in a deli-.&#xD;

to aunt Dilly."&#xD;
"I know,-.I understood that. Are not my words true&#xD;
still ?"&#xD;
Gravity and shyness, all except the gravity that belonged&#xD;
to her and to the subject, broke away from Faith. She rose&#xD;
up and stood beside Mr. Linden, moved, lappy, and glad&#xD;
with. the gladness of full sympathy.&#xD;
"It has been a pleasant two weeks, Mr. Linden !---though&#xD;
I would have liked to be at home. Aunt Dilly has wanted&#xD;
t" Bible, morning, noon, and night;-.and it was wonder.-&#xD;
ff to read it to her! It has been my business, all these&#xD;
days."&#xD;
"My dear child! I am very glad !" he said, taking her&#xD;
hand. "Wonderful ?-.--yes, it is wonderful to read, kP one&#xD;
who wants it."&#xD;
"She wanted it so much,"-.Faith said, catching her&#xD;
breath a little. -"And understood it, Mr. Linden. Very&#xD;
soon it was all-or mostly.--clear to her. I read, to her&#xD;
sometimes till twelve o'clock at night-and sometimes&#xD;
began at four in the morning."&#xD;
Mr. Linden looked at her with a mingling of expressions.&#xD;
"I am afraid that was not good for you,..-..if one dare&#xD;
say it of any work done in that service. Do you know how&#xD;
much the Bible is like that pillar of fire which guided the&#xD;
Israelites, but to those who were not of Israel became a&#xD;
pillar of cloud,-from which 'the Lord looked out' but 'to&#xD;
trouble them' ?"&#xD;
Faith's eye watched him as he spoke, and caught the&#xD;
power and beauty of the illustration; but she did not&#xD;
speak. Until after thinking and mn using a while she said&#xD;
softly, "It don't trouble aui't Dilly."&#xD;
Mr. Linden drew up a chair for her near his town, buit&#xD;
&#xD;
made no other comment upon her or her musings at first,-&#xD;
thn abruptly-----"And you think she will want you gain ?"&#xD;
There is nobody else to do this for her," sai Faith;&#xD;
and again was silent. "lHow do you suppose it al began&#xD;
with aunt Dilly, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"As to means ?-I cannot tell.&#xD;
.   It began from a few words, which I dare say you have&#xD;
forgotten but which she and I remember,-words that you&#xD;
siid one'evening when she was herd last summer, about&#xD;
everybody's being  recious in one sense.-You repeated&#xD;
that passage-   y shall be mine, saith the Lord,'-you&#xD;
, know."&#xD;
Faith did not know what a soft illumination was in her&#xD;
eyes, or she would probably not have turned the light of it&#xD;
so full upon Mr. Linden as at one or two points of her&#xD;
speech she did. It was a grave, sweet look that answered&#xD;
her; but then his eyes went off to the fire without further&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
Faith did not again interrupt the silence; a silence th&#xD;
to judge by the faces of both was pleasant to both. Til&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick came in, who indeed could not be very long&#xD;
K absent. Then Faith left her place, sat down on a low seat&#xD;
by her mother and caressingly took possession of her hands&#xD;
Aand arms. She made no more startling propositions that&#xD;
night of going back to Pequot again; and the minutes&#xD;
of the evening flowed on-as such minutes do.&#xD;
The Sunday which followed was one as quietly happy&#xD;
as is often known in this world. And the next day was&#xD;
Christmas.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVII.&#xD;
S o came the holiday week, wherein was to be done so&#xD;
i much less than usual-and so much more. Mr.&#xD;
Linden's work, indeed, was like to double on all hands;&#xD;
for he was threatened with more tea-drinkings, dinners,&#xD;
suppers, and frolics, than the week would hold. How&#xD;
should he manage to give everybody a piece of him, and&#xD;
likewise present himself entire to the assembled boys when.&#xD;
ever they chose to assemble ?.--which promised to be&#xD;
pretty often. How should he go skating, sliding, and&#xD;
sleigh-riding, at all hours of the day and night, and yet&#xD;
spend all those hours where he wanted to spend them? It&#xD;
as a grave question; and not easy, as he remarked to&#xD;
aith, to hold so.many feelings in his hands and hurt none&#xD;
of them. So with the question yet undecided, Christmas&#xD;
day came.&#xD;
It was a brilliant day-all white and blue; the sky like&#xD;
a sapphire, the earth like a pearl; the sunbeams burnished&#xD;
gold.&#xD;
" Ha' ye but seen the light fall of the snow,&#xD;
Before the soil hath smutched it?"-&#xD;
Such was Pattaquasset, Christmas morning.    And the&#xD;
bright lily,&#xD;
"1Before rude hands have touched it.,"&#xD;
that was Faith Derrick when she came down stairs. The&#xD;
dainty little crimson silk hood which Mrs. Derrick had&#xD;
quilted for her, was in her hand, brought down for dis-&#xD;
play ; but at present the sitting-room was empty, and&#xD;
Faith passed on to her work-basket, to put the hood in&#xD;
safe keeping. She found a' pre-occupied basket. At some&#xD;
unknown hour of thi night, Santa Claus had come and&#xD;
left upon it his mark in the shape of a package: a rather&#xD;

&#xD;
large and rather thin package, but done up with that in-&#xD;
fallible brown paper and small cord which everybody knows&#xD;
by instinct. Who ever looked twice at a parcel from that&#xD;
w d doubted whence it came?&#xD;
Faith's cheeks took an additional tinge, quite as brilhant&#xD;
as if the crimson hood had been on. What doubtful fingers&#xD;
lsfted the package from the basket!&#xD;
The thing..--wHatever it was-had been done up care-&#xD;
fully.  Beneath the brown paper a white one revealed&#xD;
itself, beneath that a red leather portfolio-made in the&#xD;
pretty old-fashioned style, and securing its contents by&#xD;
means of its red leather tongue. But when Faith had&#xD;
wtdrw   this, and with the caution always' exercised on&#xD;
sith occasions 'had also drawn out the contents, she found&#xD;
the prettiest continuation of her Italian journey, in the&#xD;
shape of very fine photographs of all sorts of Italian places&#xD;
and things, mingled with here and there an excursion into&#xD;
the Swiss mountains.&#xD;
A few almost awe-stricken glances Faith gave. How&#xD;
good it was she was alone ! she would not have cared tq&#xD;
have the door open and anybody come in, at that minute.&#xD;
Then she put the photographs in the portfohleather&#xD;
scarcely seen, and looked at the outside of the red  ,&#xD;
felt of its smooth surface with admiring fingers that hardly&#xD;
believed what they touched, and a face glowmg with a very&#xD;
deep glow by this time.  Faith thoughtherself rich, e-&#xD;
yond the imagination of a millioaire.  he could have sat&#xD;
there with her riches nobody knows how long, and not&#xD;
wanted breakfast; but she dreaded somebody's coming in;&#xD;
and besides, gratitude and pleasure quickened her sense of&#xD;
other people's wanting breakfast. So after a little mute&#xD;
amazed consideration oher happis -e  fd    hed off&#xD;
folito the kitchen to signalize the Christmas breakfast.-and&#xD;
perhaps spend a few of her too manyadame Danforth's&#xD;
preparation and production of on delicacies; and when&#xD;
nice, but in Pattaquasset unheard Qf, Flai  and when&#xD;
all the rest of the breakfast was ready, Faith demurely went&#xD;
in with  her dish.           1d   m n  o   r  i d n&#xD;
She had not a word of eknavedhimn or Mrnd Linenr&#xD;

with a manner and look which were graceful enough; being&#xD;
at once, open and shy, very bright, and yet veiled with a&#xD;
shade of reserve. She had been over the fire, so her face&#xD;
was naturally a little rosy. There was no particular reserve&#xD;
about him,-his "Merry Christmas" was not only wished&#xD;
but carried out, so far as breakfast time extended. Faith&#xD;
might be as demure as she liked, but she had to be merry&#xD;
too; so on the whole the breakfast room was beaming with&#xD;
mere than sunlight. Yes, it was a merry Christmas V.&#xD;
merry without and merry within,-.-that sort of merriment&#xD;
which "doeth good like a medicine." Gay voices and steps&#xD;
and snowballing on the broad street; gay snowbirds and&#xD;
chickadees sin the branches; in the house glad faces; over&#xD;
and upon all, clear sunshine and the. soft hush of a winter's&#xD;
morning.&#xD;
"What are you going to do to-day, mother ?" said Faith&#xD;
towards the close of breakfast time.&#xD;
"I'd rather look at you than anything else, child," said&#xD;
her mother, "but I've got to go out, you know. What are&#xD;
you going to do Faith ?"&#xD;
"All sorts of things, mother. Mr. Linden ?"--&#xD;
"All sorts of things, Miss Faith-therefore we shall&#xD;
probably meet quite often in the course of the day," he&#xD;
said smiling. "Will you give me any commands ?"&#xD;
"Perhaps-if I can. Mother, how are we to get to Mrs.&#xD;
Somers' to-night ?--is Crab well ?"&#xD;
"O Crab's gone away for the winter, child, and we've&#xD;
got Mr. Stoutenburgh's Jerry. To be sure-that's since&#xD;
you went away."&#xD;
aThe first thing for Faith was the Christmas dinner, into&#xD;
which she plunged, heart and hand. - The turkey, the&#xD;
apples, and the pies, were all seen to at last; and about&#xD;
an hour before dinner Faith was ready to take off her&#xD;
kitchen apron and go into the parlour. She longed for a&#xD;
further touch and eyesight of that red leather.&#xD;
She had it, for that hour; as dainty a luxuriating&#xD;
over her treasures as anybody ever had. Faith pondered&#xD;
and dreamed over the photographs, one after another;&#xD;
with endless marvel and querying of numberless questions&#xD;
springing out of them,-general and particular, historical,&#xD;
natural, social, and artistic or scientific. -Questions that&#xD;
&#xD;
All-&#xD;
a&#xD;
pro, I&#xD;
. Yi&#xD;
tbr'&#xD;
&#xD;
sometimes she knew 'only enough to form vaguely. What&#xD;
a looking over of prints that was ! such an hour as is&#xD;
known by few, few of those who have seen engravings all&#xD;
their lives. Nay, further than that;-such as is not known&#xD;
by many a one that stands on the Bridge of sighs, and&#xD;
crosses the Mer de glace, and sees the smoke curling up,&#xD;
from Vesuvius. For once in a while there is an imaginary&#xD;
traveller at home to whom is revealed more of the spirit of&#xD;
beauty residing in these things, than hundredsof those who&#xD;
visit them do ever see. Who&#xD;
"Feels the warm Orient in the noontide air,&#xD;
And from cloud-minarets hears the sunset call to prayer."&#xD;
Before dinner time was quite on the stroke came home&#xD;
Mr. Linden, who betaking himself first upstairs and then into&#xD;
the sitting-room, brought Faith her Christmas breastknot of&#xD;
green and red. Stiff holly leaves, with their glossy sheen,&#xD;
and bright winterberries-clear and red, set each other off&#xD;
like jewellers' work; and the soft ribbon that bound them&#xD;
together was of the darkest possible blue. It was as dainty&#xD;
a bit of floral handicraft as Faith had often seen.&#xD;
"Will you wear it, Miss Faith ?" Mr. Linden said as he&#xD;
laid it on the table by her.&#xD;
Faith had come out of her dream, and gave the holly&#xD;
and winterberries a'downcast look of recognition. It was&#xD;
given in silence, but the pleasure which had been upper-&#xD;
most for some time presently made her overcome shyness,&#xD;
and looking up gratefully she exclaimed, "Mr.. Linden-&#xD;
what pleasure yoi rpave given me !"-The soft colour which&#xD;
had been in her cheeks before, mounted instantly to deep&#xD;
crimson, and she added timidly, "Wasn't it you ?"&#xD;
"What pleasure you give me!".-he said with a smile&#xD;
at her-crimson and all. "Yes, it was I."&#xD;
"It seems to me I have been at those places to-day,"&#xD;
she went on, looking over at the sofa where her portfolio&#xD;
lay. "I have been fancying your sister standing here and&#xD;
there and looking at something I saw in the picture. Now&#xD;
I can understand a little better what she was writing&#xD;
about."&#xD;
"I'am very glad you like them! Some time you must&#xD;

let me give you any explanations they may need. What&#xD;
have, you found for me to do this afternoon ?"&#xD;
"Aren't you going to be busy, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"About something--your business shall come first."&#xD;
"It can wait," said Faith very brightly.  "It was just&#xD;
that, Mr. Linden.--I was going to ask you some time to&#xD;
shew them to me. I have been looking at some of them&#xD;
by myself, and going into a great many things over them&#xD;
that I could not understand. But any time will do for&#xD;
that-as well as to-day."&#xD;
"And to-day as well as any time"--he said smiling;&#xD;
"but I suppose we must wait till after dinner."&#xD;
There was great satisfaction at that dinner, not to say in&#xD;
it-yhich indeed the dinner merited. There was the re-&#xD;
maining glow of the pleasant morning, and a little dawning&#xD;
of the afternoon, besides the hour's own light. Faith&#xD;
indeed was the radiating point of pleasure, which the two&#xD;
others watched and furnished with new supplies. Then&#xD;
after dinner came the Italian work, and she had as elabo-&#xD;
rate and careful answers and information as she wished for.&#xD;
Mr. Lindeif could go back and tell her where each place&#xD;
got its name, and what had been its history, with many&#xD;
stories of its climate and productions and traditions; and&#xD;
so one by one Faith went over again her new treasures.&#xD;
One by one,-until the short afternoon began to fade, and it&#xD;
was time to dress for Mrs. Somers'; and they had made but&#xD;
little progress into the portfolio, after all. Yet it was a&#xD;
great 'progress' to Faith ;-a grand procession through&#xD;
the years of history and the stages of civilization and the&#xD;
varying phases of nature and humanity.&#xD;
Very tenderly the photographs were restored to the&#xD;
portfolio and the red leather tongue drawn through, with&#xD;
a little breath heavy with pleasure, and Faith carried off the&#xD;
whole to be put where profane hands should not get hold&#xD;
of it. Then the comparatively ignoble business of dressing&#xD;
occupied her. And Mrs. Derrick yet more, who of course&#xD;
was there to help and look on; while Faith's head was er-&#xD;
e ratically in her portfolio, or at Rome, or at Florence, or--&#xD;
elsewhere,---as the case might be. Her dress was this&#xD;
evening the same she had worn to Mrs. Stoutenburgh's, but&#xD;
the knot of holly and winterberries transformed. her more&#xD;
&#xD;
than the rose and myrtle had done; and she stood an un-&#xD;
doubted guest of Christmas night. Faith herself took&#xD;
somewhat of the effect, which her thought however concen-&#xD;
trated.&#xD;
"Mother," she said as she looked in the glass,-" I never&#xD;
yaw anything so pretty !"&#xD;
"Neither did I, child,", said Mrs. Derrick smiling.&#xD;
Faith took still'closer note of the beauty of her breast-&#xD;
knot; and then gathering up her crimson hood and cloak,&#xD;
they went down stairs. It was not quite the hour yet for Mrs.&#xD;
Somers'. Mr. Linden was ready and in the sitting-room;&#xD;
but Faith did not this time call his attention to her bouquet.&#xD;
She came in and sat down very quietly in a corner of the&#xD;
sofa. Ile paused in his walk up and down the room how-&#xD;
ever, noting her well as she came in and took her seat;&#xD;
coming presently to take one at her side ; and then catch-&#xD;
ing up a book from the table he proceeded to give her the&#xD;
ice palace of the little brook, with which he had threatened&#xD;
her before.-&#xD;
'Down swept the cold wind from the mountain peak;&#xD;
From the snow five thousand summers old"-etc.&#xD;
"0," exclaimed Faith, "I have seen just such a brook! I&#xD;
have played in it; when mother was afraid I should take&#xD;
cold, and wouldn't let me stay. But that's as good as the&#xD;
brook," she added timidly.&#xD;
"without the danger of taking cold. You are quite&#xD;
sure it has not chilled you, Miss Faith ? -do you feel 'win-&#xD;
ter-proof'?"&#xD;
I think I do, for to-day," said Faith. "If the evening&#xD;
were to be even very dis agreeable, I think I could stand it."&#xD;
Which remark was perhaps significant.&#xD;
-   The tinkle of Jerry's bells now made itself heard at the&#xD;
door, and Faith was shawled and cloaked and wrapped up&#xD;
by her mother in the house and by Mr. Linden in the&#xD;
sleigh. He was more skilful about it than Squire Stouten-&#xD;
burgh; and contrived to enclose Faith in a little wigwam&#xD;
of buffalo robes, without letting her feel the weight of&#xD;
them. Then they dashed off- Jerry well disposed for&#xD;
exercise after his five minutes' stand, and spurning the&#xD;

snow from a light enough pair of heels. How merrily the&#xD;
bells jingled! how calmly and steadily the stars shone&#xD;
down!   There was no moon now, but the whitened earth&#xD;
caught and reflected every bit of the starlight, and made it&#xD;
by no means dark ; and the gleams from cottage windows&#xD;
came out and fell on the snow in little streaks of brightness,&#xD;
Sleighs enough abroad !-from the swift little cutters and&#xD;
large family sleighs that glided on towards the parsonage,&#xD;
down to sledding parties of boys, cheered only by a cow-&#xD;
bell and their own laughter. Tinkle, tinkle-everywhere,-&#xD;
near by and in the distance; the dark figures just casting a&#xD;
light shadow on the roadside, the merry voices ignoring&#xD;
anything of the kind.&#xD;
Mrs. Somers' house was a good long drive from Mrs,&#xD;
Derrick's. The road was first on the Tway to Mr. Simlins';&#xD;
from there it turned off at right angles and went winding&#xD;
crookedly down a solitary piece of country; rising and&#xD;
falling over uneven ground, twisting out of the way of a&#xD;
rock here and there, and for some distance skirting the&#xD;
edge of a woodland. There was light enough to see by,&#xD;
but it was not just the piece of road one would choose of&#xD;
a dark night; and Faith felt thankful Squire Neacon was&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVIII.&#xD;
N the dressing-room Faith was seized upon in the&#xD;
warmest manner by Mrs. Stoutenburgh, who looked&#xD;
very pretty in her dress of bright crimson silk.&#xD;
"I'm so glad you've come back, dear. And how well&#xD;
you're looking !--a little thin, though. But you'll soon&#xD;
make up for that. You're just as lovely as you can be,&#xD;
Faith-do you know it ?"&#xD;
"No, ma'am."-Her flowers, she knew, were as lovely as&#xD;
they could be. "Jerry brought us, Mrs. Stoutenburgh,&#xD;
after all, and pretty fast too."&#xD;
"0 he can go fast enough. You needn't look so sober,&#xD;
child-of course no one thinks so but me, and nobody ever&#xD;
minds what I say. That's pretty, I suppose you'll allow,"&#xD;
she said laughing, and bending down closer to Faith's&#xD;
holly leaves,--"what is it, Faith ? basswood ?"'&#xD;
"Don't you know holly, Mrs. Stoutenburgh? And the&#xD;
berries are winterberries."&#xD;
"Yes my dear-I perceive. You mustn't get angry with&#xD;
me, child-I tell you nobody does, not even your grave&#xD;
escort. At least not for anything I do to him. Well I'll&#xD;
go, down and electrify people with the news that you're&#xD;
coming.' And the crimson dress floated off to the tune&#xD;
of a light step and a merry voice. And more slowly and&#xD;
more doubtfully the black dress and winterberries followed&#xD;
her. Perhaps in very truth Faith would have been willing&#xD;
that Mr. Stoutenburgh should have taken her under his&#xD;
broad wing for that going down stairs. At least she was&#xD;
as absolutely grave and quiet as anybody ever saw her,&#xD;
and a little more inclined to be shrinking. But Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den was alone in the hall at that minute, so there was no&#xD;
one else to shrink from; and if Faith wanted to shrink&#xD;
from him, she hardly could,-Lthere was such an absence of&#xD;
anything to alarm her, both in his look and manner.&#xD;
Therefore, though she had to go down stairs upon his arm,&#xD;
and pass sundry people on their way up, Faith felt that he&#xD;

was a shield between her and the glances and words which&#xD;
he so little regarded. Eyes and tongues indeed ventured&#xD;
but little in his presence; but that protection of course&#xD;
extended only to the centre of the drawing-room, and the&#xD;
welcome which Faith received from Mrs. Somers, --then&#xD;
she must shield herself. Then truly, for a while, she was&#xD;
taken possession of by Squire Stoutenburgh, who walked&#xD;
with her up and down, and said all manner of kind things.&#xD;
Faith had no particular skill toyshield herself from any.&#xD;
thing, and indeed gave herself no thought about it. She&#xD;
took what came, in, a simple and quiet spirit, which was&#xD;
very apt to strike like a bee the right part of every flower;&#xD;
or that perhaps carried its own honey along. So she walked&#xD;
up and down with Mr. Stoutenburgh; and so she afterwards&#xD;
entered into the demands of a posse of her old and young&#xD;
friends who had not seen her for a good while&#xD;
Amidst a little group of these people, collected benignly&#xD;
around Faith, Dr. Harrison presently intruded himself.&#xD;
Now Dr. Harrison was a lion, and the smaller animals&#xD;
naturally fell off from him, which was precisely what he&#xD;
expected them to do. The doctor hpd the field soot clear.&#xD;
"What have you been doing to yourself?" he said to&#xD;
Faith with the kindly, familiar manner which had grown&#xD;
up between them.&#xD;
"Taking good care,"--she said, in smiling answer to his&#xD;
question.&#xD;
"Who took the care? yourself?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"I thought so."&#xD;
"Why, Dr. Harrison ?"&#xD;
"Excuse me," said he. "Anybody else would have done&#xD;
it better."&#xD;
"No," said she shaking her head,---"you are wrong."-&#xD;
"You have been-" said he, looking at her,-"you have&#xD;
been 'doing your duty' too hard."&#xD;
"Can one do that, Dr. Harrison ?"&#xD;
"Certainly !"&#xD;
"I haven't been doing it this time."&#xD;
"Do you remember," he said sitting down by her and&#xD;
lowering his voice,--" what you said once about the flowers&#xD;
of the wilderness ?"             ,-&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"Would you like to see some of them ?"&#xD;
"In the wilderness ?"&#xD;
"No," said he smiling. - "I can shew you one family of&#xD;
them, by their portraits, here-to-nght."&#xD;
"I would like to see them in the wilderness or anywhere !"&#xD;
said Faith.&#xD;
"Then if you'll come with me"-&#xD;
And the next thing was Dr. Harrison s walking off the&#xD;
black silk and winterberries before all the eyes of the peo.&#xD;
ple and through one room after another, till a little one-side&#xD;
room was reached which was not a thoroughfare to any-&#xD;
thing. In this little room was a table and a lamp, upon it,&#xD;
and also several very large thin books. There was also,&#xD;
which was singular, a very comfortable easy chair. In this&#xD;
Dr. Harrison installed his charge close by the table, and&#xD;
drew up one-of the volumes.&#xD;
"I am going to introduce to you," he said, "the whole&#xD;
family of the Rhododendrons."&#xD;
"Rhododendron ?"--.said Faith. "I never saw them.&#xD;
"It is their loss," said the doctor; "but here they are."&#xD;
It was as he said ;-the whole family of the plant, in the&#xD;
most superb style of portraiture and presentation. Full&#xD;
size and full colour; one of the most magnificent of such&#xD;
works. Faith had never seen a Rhododendron, and even&#xD;
in her dreams had never visited a wilderness where such&#xD;
flowers grew. Her exquisite delight fully satisfied Dr:&#xD;
2 Harrison, and quite kept her attention from herself and the&#xD;
fact of her being shut off from the rest of the company.&#xD;
Now and then one. and another would drop:in and look&#xD;
at what they were about, with curiosity if not with sympa-&#xD;
thy; but Rhododendrons were not alluring to most of the&#xD;
people, nor to'say truth was Dr. Harrison. With most&#xD;
urbane politeness he dispersed any desire to remain and&#xD;
look over his proceedings which might have been felt by&#xD;
some of the intruders; or contrived that they should find&#xD;
nothing to detain them.&#xD;
It was a long business, to turn over all those delicious&#xD;
portraits of floral life and give anything like a sufficient&#xD;
look at each one. Such glories of vegetable beauty Faith&#xD;
had never imagined. It was almost a new revelation.&#xD;

There were deep brilliant crimsons; there was the loveliest&#xD;
rose-colour, in large heads of the close elegant flowers;&#xD;
there were, larger still and almost incredible in their mag.&#xD;
nificence, enormous clusters of cream-coloured and tinted&#xD;
and even of buff. There were smaller and humbler mer.&#xD;
bers of the family, which would have been glorious in any&#xD;
other companionship. There were residents of the rich&#xD;
regions of the tropics; and less superb members of the&#xD;
temperate zones; there were trees and shrubs; and there&#xD;
were little bushy, hardy denizens of the highest and bar.&#xD;
renest elevations of rocks and snow to which inflorescence&#xD;
ever climbs. Faith almost caught her breath.&#xD;
"And these are in the wilderness !" she said.&#xD;
"Yes. What then ?" said the doctor. Faith did not&#xD;
say.&#xD;
"You are thinking they 'waste their sweetness' ?"&#xD;
"o no, indeed ! I don't think that."&#xD;
"You are thinking something. Please let me be the&#xD;
better for it."               -&#xD;
"One ought to be the better for it," said Faith.&#xD;
"Then I hope you won't refuse it to me" said Dr. Har-&#xD;
rison gently laughing at her. 's-             D&#xD;
"I was thinking, Dr. Harrison, what the Bible says,--.&#xD;
'He hath made everything beautiful in his time';...and,.&#xD;
'God saw Severything that he had made, and behold it was&#xD;
'very good.'&#xD;
'The doctor turned over the leaf to a new Rhododen-&#xD;
dron. Faith's thoughts went to Pequot, and her heart&#xD;
gave a bound of joy at the remembrance of the sick woman&#xD;
there. .&#xD;
Mrs. Stoutenburgh's crimson dress was so softly worn&#xD;
f' and managed, that the wearer thereof' was close in Dr.&#xD;
'rHarrison's neighbourhood for a minute before he was aware&#xD;
of her presence; which quiet motions, it should be ob-&#xD;
served, were habitual to Mrs. Stoutenburgh, and not at all&#xD;
assumed for the occasion. Therefore it was with no idea&#xD;
of startling anybody, that she said presently, "My dear&#xD;
Faith, what are you looking at through those. Rhododen-&#xD;
drons ?" Faith started, and looked up with a bit of a&#xD;
smile.&#xD;
"What do you see, Mrs. Stoutenburgh ?" said the doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
"0 several things," said the lady, passing her hand softly&#xD;
over Faith's brow, and then with one of her sudden im-&#xD;
pulses putting her lips there. '"Do you like them, Faith ?"&#xD;
"Does not Mrs. Stoutenburgh like them ?" said the doc-&#xD;
tor, as he placed a chair for her in the best position:left for&#xD;
seeing.&#xD;
"Thank you," said she laughing. "Icame here to be&#xD;
seen this evening. And so ought some other people. How&#xD;
much do you pay for the monopoly, doctor ?"&#xD;
"I really don't knobV!" said Dr. Harrison with a very&#xD;
slight rise of his handsome eyebrows. "I am in Patta-&#xD;
quasset-which is to me a region of uncertainties. You&#xD;
will know better than I, Mrs. toutenburgh."&#xD;
"Well," said Mrs. Stouten  gh with a wicked look at&#xD;
the doctor for his sole benefit,--" sp king of iRhododen-&#xD;
drons, which you've seen often enough before,-.-don't you&#xD;
admire this-which you have not seen before ?" and she&#xD;
touched Faith's holly leaves with the tip of her little glove.&#xD;
"I should think it must stir what Mr. Linden calls your&#xD;
'nerves of pleasant sensation."'&#xD;
"I am honoured by your estimation," said the doctor&#xD;
laughing slightly. "Miss Derrick's taste is matchless. It&#xD;
is an act of benevolence for her to wear flowers."&#xD;
Faith's very brow crimsoned, till she bent it from view as&#xD;
much as she could. In all her truth she could not rise up&#xD;
there and confess that her skill was not the skill to be com-&#xD;
mended. Sle wanted a shield then.&#xD;
"Don't flatter yourself that you are an object of charity,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Stoutenburgh turnings over another 'loaf to give&#xD;
Faith employment.   " They're talking of games in the&#xD;
other room, dear," she added in a gentle voice,-" may I&#xD;
tell Mrs." Somers you will play too ?"&#xD;
"Yes ma'am, certainly !"'&#xD;
"They're not ready yet-sit still and enjoy your prints&#xD;
-I'll see what they are about." And the lady left&#xD;
the room. Dr. Harrison sought some particularly .fine&#xD;
specimens and engaged Faith in talk about them and&#xD;
their localities and habits, till her self-possession was&#xD;
restored.&#xD;
" Have you heard the news about Mr. Linden ?" he asked&#xD;
with most nonchalant carelessness.&#xD;

"What news ?" said Faith, doubtful whether he meant&#xD;
Squire Stoutenburgh's chapter or some other.&#xD;
"Then he hasn't told you himself ?"&#xD;
"No," said Faith.&#xD;
"I thought you ought to be authority," the doctor went&#xD;
on in the same tone.  "It is very good news--for him..I&#xD;
hope it is true. They say-I have heard,--how beautiful&#xD;
the droop of those petals is !---and the shade of colour is&#xD;
rare---.They say, that he has a very dear friend abroad; I&#xD;
mean in  urope, somewhere. Do you think it is true ?"&#xD;
"Yes, said Faith. She thought it was not wonderful&#xD;
news.&#xD;
"I mean a lady friend ?" said the doctor..&#xD;
"Yes," said Faith again. She knew now what the doc-&#xD;
tor meant, but she did not feel inclined to enter into the&#xD;
subject or to enlighten him at all. Then too Mr. Linden&#xD;
might have more friends than one abroad !-It flashed upon&#xD;
her like a curious illumination.&#xD;
"Then the story is true ?" said the doctor.&#xD;
"I don't know, sir," said Faith in some distress. "I&#xD;
know nothing about it."&#xD;
"But you don't know that it is not true ?" said he look-&#xD;
ing at her.&#xD;
"No,.sir. I don't know."&#xD;
Dr. Harrison's further questions and remarks were cut&#xD;
short by the entrance of the very person referred to; who&#xD;
coming up with his usual light, alert step, held out his hand&#xD;
first of all to the questioner.&#xD;
"Good evening, doctor!-how do you do again ? Miss&#xD;
Faith, may I take you away from these beauties ?" And&#xD;
the released hand was offered to her.  She put hers in it&#xD;
very willingly but very silently; Faith dared not say a word&#xD;
to him about the Rhododendrons or about anything else.&#xD;
"Ah, you have two hands again," said Dr. Harrison,&#xD;
"and you turn-it against me !"&#xD;
"Not that fact-" Mr. Linden said as he went off. And&#xD;
then slackening his step, he talked or made Faith talk-......&#xD;
and laugh--every inch of the way into the room- where all&#xD;
the rest were clustered ready for blind man's buff. It was&#xD;
a triumph of his skill,-or of his power',-for she had left&#xD;
the Rhododendrons in a mood most shy and quiet, and dis.-&#xD;

posed to keep so. Dr. Harrison had not followed them,Jbut&#xD;
soon made his entrance upon the company by another door.&#xD;
"What is going on? or off, Mrs. Stoutenburgh?" he&#xD;
whispered to that lady.&#xD;
"Why the bandage is going on, and we're going off,"&#xD;
said she laughing. "Will you be blinded first, doctor ?"&#xD;
e"Blind man's buff 1" said the doctor shrugging his shoul-&#xD;
ders comically.  "Barbarous! I would rather 'go off' too&#xD;
-but anything to please you, Mrs. Stoutenburgh. A game&#xD;
to see how much a man without his five senses can do&#xD;
against other people who have them." But the doctor&#xD;
gallantly stepped up to Mrs. Somers.&#xD;
"I represent the forlorn hope for the evening, aunt&#xD;
Ellen. Has anybody volunteered to be the first victim?"&#xD;
"You are the last person in the room that ought to vol-&#xD;
unteer," said Mrs. Somers,.-"however, blindness is pro-&#xD;
verbial in some cases. Miss Essie will bandage your eyes,&#xD;
Julius-and use her own for you in the meanwhile, I dare-&#xD;
say. Miss Essie, here is a candidate."&#xD;
"Not for Miss Essie's good offices" said the doctor. "I&#xD;
know her. I shall not trust her. I will put myself in safe&#xD;
hands."-&#xD;
And with an inexpressible air of carelessness and easy&#xD;
pleasure-taking, Dr. Harrison carried his handsome person&#xD;
across the room to where Faith yet stood by the side of&#xD;
Mr. Linden ; stood looking rather sober. She had not&#xD;
brought any of the rosy Rhododendron colour away in her&#xD;
face; or else it had faded. The doctor came up and spoke&#xD;
in an  ndertone as wilfully and gracefully independent as&#xD;
his maner.&#xD;
"If I ask you to do me the honour to put this handker-&#xD;
chief over my eyes, Miss Derrick, I suppose you will not&#xD;
know what it signifies ?"&#xD;
"No, sir," said Faith, with a very slight smile and extra&#xD;
colour.&#xD;
"Where I have been," said the doctor,--"where we&#xD;
never play it!--it is played in this way. My entreating&#xD;
you to blind my eyes, signifies that without them I shall&#xD;
endeavour to find you."&#xD;
"Then I wish you'd get somebody else to do it, Dr. Har-&#xD;
rison."&#xD;

"You are not in earnest ?" said the doctor.&#xD;
"Very much in earnest."&#xD;
"But I should observe," said he smiling, "that even the&#xD;
unkindness of your refusal would not change my endeavour.&#xD;
I only give you, as in honour bound, the chance of doing all&#xD;
you can to prevent my succeeding. Will you do it ?"&#xD;
He tendered the handkerchief. Faith coloured a little&#xD;
more, but to put a stop to his absurdities, as they seemed&#xD;
to her, and to her consequent prominence before the eyes of&#xD;
people; she accepted the office. Dr. Harrison kneeled at&#xD;
her feet, and Faith put the handkerchief round his eyes&#xD;
and tied it on; endeavouring, to do her justice, to perform&#xD;
the task thoroughly. She was not quite sure how well it&#xD;
was done, after all,-for the doctor had interposed a gentle&#xD;
'Softly,' as she was drawing the knot and had at the same&#xD;
time also raised his hand to ease the bandage. But Faith&#xD;
had to let it go so; and simply resolved to take care of&#xD;
herself.&#xD;
Many eyes, meanwhile, surveyed this performance with&#xD;
much edification, glancing too at the motionless figure who&#xD;
at Faith's side looked down upon it. But when the smile&#xD;
in those eyes touched the lips as well, Mrs. Stoutenburgh&#xD;
wag roused to a pitch of delight; 'and running into the&#xD;
middle of the room to meet the doctor as he came to take his&#xD;
stand, she clapped her hands exclaiming, "O doctor I doctor !&#xD;
--how could you let anybody tie anything over your eyes"&#xD;
" Is there treachery, Mrs. Stoutenburgh ?" said the doctor&#xD;
with a comic stop.&#xD;
"Where ?"-said the lady.&#xD;
"Nay,-I know where," said the doctor. And turning&#xD;
from her he addressed himself to the game.&#xD;
. But though Dr. Harrison shewed himself a keen player&#xD;
the game came to no sudden termination. And Faith&#xD;
could not help doubting that her work had not been too&#xD;
effectual. It was beyond question, even if she had not been&#xD;
forewarned, that the doctor was endeavouring to find--or&#xD;
endeavouring to catch her. In vain Mrs. Stoutenburgh's&#xD;
crimson and Miss Essie's blue floated past him and rustled&#xD;
behind him.   In vain Mrs. Somers'Lurple stood in his&#xD;
way. The skirt of that one black silk could go nowhere&#xD;
that some one of the doctor's senses did not inform him of&#xD;
&#xD;
Cit Closely he followed upon her flight, and keen work&#xD;
Faith found it, play as well as she would. She began to&#xD;
get out of breath, and the amusement and fun grew&#xD;
uproarious.&#xD;
It was when her foot was failing that the doctor's gained&#xD;
strength: between him and the prize there was now no&#xD;
Iarrier; no leap could avail Faith in the corner where she&#xD;
was at last hemmed in. Slowly and securely the doctor&#xD;
advanced, first himself and then his hands, and caught-Mr.&#xD;
Linden! Caught him unmistakeably too,-there was no&#xD;
help for it; and Dr. Harrison in his astonishment forgot to&#xD;
pronounce him somebody else !&#xD;
"Confound you 1" said the doctor slowly and comically-&#xD;
"how did you get here ?"&#xD;
"Are you fatigued ?" said Mr. Linden, taking off the&#xD;
bandage. "Miss Faith, you did this part of your work&#xD;
very ill."&#xD;
"How did you get here ?" repeated the dbctor, taking&#xD;
hold of his arm and shaking it slightly. "I wasn't looking&#xD;
for you, man."&#xD;
"What were you looking for ?" said Mr. Linden, with a&#xD;
laughing return of the doctor's gaze.     C&#xD;
"Shall I put that on for you ?" said the latter with a sort&#xD;
of complicate expression, which however never lost its&#xD;
grace and ease. And then began another chase-but not&#xD;
of Faith this time,.-perhaps Mr. Linden thought she&#xD;
J needed rest. And the changes ran round the company,&#xD;
but never (as it happened) including Faith or Dr. EIarrison,&#xD;
until they reached the finishing round of the game. Then&#xD;
it was Mr. Linden's turn again to wear the bandage, and&#xD;
then he gave Faith the sort of run he had given her before&#xD;
at Mrs. Stoutenburgh's,.-and with the same success.&#xD;
"Haven't they played blind man's buff long enough ?"&#xD;
Faith whispered, when the bandage was taken off her cap-&#xD;
tor. She was flushed, a little, and sober more than a little.&#xD;
"Yes-I will move a change," he answered in the same&#xD;
tole.. Which he did, after a short consultation.&#xD;
"Dr. Harrison.--you have' seen 'the Butterfly,' I sup-&#xD;
pose?"&#xD;
" The butterfly ?" said the doctor. "I have seen many&#xD;
--of all colours; but the butterfly par excellence, I know&#xD;
voL. I.                40&#xD;

"The one I mean combines more colours," said Mr. Lin.&#xD;
den.  "What were you doing in France, not to see it ?"&#xD;
"Seeing other things, I suppose. However, now you&#xD;
speak of it,,I believe that butterfly has flown over me.&#xD;
sometime."&#xD;
"Please to imagine yourself a gay rover for the nonce,"&#xD;
said Mr. Linden, leading the doctor persuasively into the&#xD;
middle of the floor. "Just suppose you are a Purple Em-&#xD;
peror-will you doctor?   Miss Essie wants a story and&#xD;
forfeits,-J shall leave you to gratify her."' But he himself&#xD;
went to give Miss Faith a seat. That was done with a&#xD;
very different manner from the gay, genial way in which he'&#xD;
had addressed the doctor: it was genial enough, certainly,&#xD;
but grave.°&#xD;
"You do not feel well?" he said, as he wheeled up an&#xD;
easy chair for her. It was spoken too low for any one&#xD;
else to hear.&#xD;
"Yes, I do,".-said Faith quickly. But he face flushed&#xD;
deep, and her eye though it glanced towards him, failed&#xD;
timidly of meeting his; and her voice had lost all the spring&#xD;
of pleasure.&#xD;
"then cannot you keep the promise you made about a&#xD;
disagreeable evening ?" The tone was very low still-(he&#xD;
was arranging her footstool and chair) a little concerned&#xD;
too, a little-or Faith fancied it-but indeed she was not&#xD;
quite sure what the third part was; and then the doctor&#xD;
began his work.&#xD;
For a minute or two she did not hear him, or heard&#xD;
without heed. She was thinking over Mr. Linden's ques-&#xD;
tion and struggling with it. For its slight tone, of remon-&#xD;
strance perhaps, only met and stirred into life the feeling&#xD;
she was trying to keep down. Her lip took one of its sor-&#xD;
rowful curves for an instant; but then Dr. Harrison came&#xD;
towards them.&#xD;
"What insect on the face of the earth, Linden, will you&#xD;
be? What does he resemble most, Miss Derrick ?"&#xD;
"I am not particular about being on the face of .the ~&#xD;
earth," said Mr. Linden,.-"the air will do just as well"&#xD;
The doctor was waiting for Faith's answer. .Under the&#xD;
&#xD;
exig en-  of the moment she gave it him, glancing up first&#xD;
the figure beside her, perhaps to refresh her memory-&#xD;
ar imagination-and smiling a little as she spoke.&#xD;
"I don't think of any he is like, Dr. Harrison.&#xD;
S"Do you think I am like a purple butterfly ?" said the&#xD;
doctor.&#xD;
"Yes, a little,"-said Faith. But it was with a face of&#xD;
such childlike.soberness that the doctor looked hard at her.&#xD;
"What do you think you are like yourself?" said he;&#xD;
not lightly.&#xD;
"I think I am a little like an ant," said Faith.&#xD;
The doctor turned half round on his heel.&#xD;
"'Angels and ministers of grace' 1" was his exclamation.&#xD;
"Most winged,.gentle, and ethprial of all the dwellers in,&#xD;
or on, anthills,-know that thy similitude is nothing&#xD;
meaner than a flower. You must take the name of one,&#xD;
Miss Faith-all the ladies do-,what will you be ?"&#xD;
"What will you be ?" Mr. Linden repeated,-"Mignon-&#xD;
'  ette ?-that is even below the level of some of your ant-&#xD;
hills."&#xD;
"If you please,"-she said.&#xD;
"Or one of your Rhododendrons ?" said the doctor-&#xD;
"that is better; for you have the art-or the nature,&#xD;
indeed,-of representing all the tints of the family by turns&#xD;
.-.except the unlovely ones. ,Be a Rhodora1"&#xD;
"No"-said Faith-"I am not like that-nor like the&#xD;
other, but I will be the other."&#xD;
"Mignonette"-said the doctor. "Well, what shall we&#xD;
call him? what is he like ?"&#xD;
"I think," said Faith, looking down very gravely, not&#xD;
with the flashing eye with which she would have said it&#xD;
another time,-"he is most like a midge."&#xD;
The little laugh which answered her, the way in which&#xD;
Mr. Linden bent down and said,'"How do you know, Misa&#xD;
Faith ?" were slightly mystifying to Dr. Harrison.&#xD;
"I don't know,"-she said smiling; and the doctor with&#xD;
one or two looks of very ungratified curiosity left them and&#xD;
returned to his post.&#xD;
" What are they going to play, Mr. Linden ?" said Faith.&#xD;
The doctor's explanation, given to the rest generally, she&#xD;
had not heard.&#xD;

"Do you know what a family connexion you have give&#xD;
me, Miss Faith ?--The proverb declares 'that 'the mother&#xD;
of mischief is no bigger than a midge's wing.'&#xD;
An involuntary little caught breath attested perhaps&#xD;
Faith's acquiescence in the truth of the proverb; but&#xD;
the doctor's words prevented the necessity of her speaking,&#xD;
"Miss Essie-Ladies and gentlemen! Please answer&#xD;
to your names, and thereby proclaim your characters. Mrs,&#xD;
Stoutenburgh, what are you ?"&#xD;
"A poppy, I think," said Mrs. Stoutenburgh laughing,&#xD;

incapable of naming himself."&#xD;

"No, I'll be a cricket-J'm so spry," said the Squire,-.&#xD;
"and I'll be down upon you in some other form, doctor."&#xD;
"You'll have to fly higher first," said the doctor. "Miss&#xD;
Essie declares herself to be a purple Althama. Miss Davids&#xD;
-an evening primrose. Miss Deacon-a cluster rose.&#xD;
Miss Fax-a sweet pink. Miss Chester-a daisy.- Miss&#xD;
Bezac-what shall I put you down ?" The butterfly was&#xD;
making a list of his flowers and insects, and cards had been&#xD;
furnished to the different members of the party, and pencils,&#xD;
to do as much for themselves.&#xD;
"I'd as lieve be balm as anything else, if I knew how,"&#xD;
said Miss Bezac; "but I shouldn't call that putting me&#xD;
down."&#xD;
"That  fits, anyhow," said Squire Stoutenburgh.&#xD;

i   "Ha1--I don't know, my dear," said Mr. Somers&#xD;
blandly. "I think I am-.a--out of place."&#xD;

Essie--"hyacinth and laburnum."&#xD;

belongs to the butt rfly."&#xD;
"In other words some one has .put Dr. Harrison in a&#xD;
flutter," said Mrs. toutenburgh.&#xD;
to fa  en't begun  et," said the doctor wheeling round&#xD;
to face her; "when I do, my first business will be to cut&#xD;
you up, Mrs. Stoutenburgh."&#xD;
"Miss Faith," said Mr. Linden while theroll went on,&#xD;
"I have not forgotten your question,-they,- and we, are&#xD;
going to play a French game called 'the Butterfly and the&#xD;
Flowers; wherein I, a midge, am in humble attendance on&#xD;
a sprig of mignonette. Whenever our butterfly gardener&#xD;
chooses to speak the name of any flower 'or insect, that&#xD;
Flower or-insect must reply: when he speaks of the.gar-&#xD;
dener, you flowers must extend one hand in token of we-&#xD;
come, we insects draw back in dismay: if the gardener&#xD;
brings his watering-pot, or there falls a shower of rain,&#xD;
you must hold up your head for joy-I must kneel down&#xD;
for fear. If the sunshine is mentioned,. we are free to&#xD;
rejoice together-standing up and making demonstrations.&#xD;
You may reply, Miss Faith, either in your own words or&#xD;
quotations, so that you mention some one of your com-&#xD;

his voice for Faith's benefit,-" 'Two suns hold not their&#xD;
courses in one sphere 1'."-Then aloud-"Invisibilityis a&#xD;
great thing----.when you can make up your mind to it, but&#xD;
Althea with the purple eye' looks on life differently."&#xD;
"I look on it soberly," said Miss Essie-&#xD;
"'Flutter he, flutter he, high as he will,&#xD;
A butterfly is but a butterfly still.&#xD;
And 'tis better for us to remain where we are,&#xD;
In the lowly valley of duty and cake,&#xD;
Than lonely to soar to the-heights above,&#xD;
Where there's nothing to do and nothing to love."&#xD;
&#xD;
panions; but if you fail to speak, or break any other rule,&#xD;
you must pay a forfeit first and redeem it afterwards."'&#xD;
"I may mention either insect or flower ?" said Faith.&#xD;
"Yes, just what you like."&#xD;
"If everybody is ready," said the doctor, "I will begin&#xD;
by remarking that I find myself in an 'embarras de rich-&#xD;
esses'-so many sweets around me that I-a butterfly..&#xD;
know not which to taste first; and such an array of ene-&#xD;
mies hostile alike to the flowers and me, that I know not&#xD;
which to demolish first. I hope ,a demolishing rain will&#xD;
fall sonle of these days--ah! that is gratifying ! behold&#xD;
my enemies shrinking already, while the flowers lift up&#xD;
their heads with pleasure and warm themselves in the rays&#xD;
of the sun. What is mignonette doing ?"&#xD;
There was a general outcry of laughter, for as the gen-&#xD;
tlemen had kneeled and bent their heads, and the flowers&#xD;
had risen to greet the sun,--Faith, in her amusement and&#xD;
preoccupation had sat still. She rose now, blushing a&#xD;
little at being called upon.&#xD;
"Mignonette loves the sun without making any show for&#xD;
it. She has no face to lift up like the white lily.&#xD;
"The white lily isn't sweet like lavender," said Miss&#xD;
Julia.&#xD;
"And the lavender has more to do in the linen press&#xD;
than among butterflies," said Mrs. Somers.&#xD;
"It is good to know one's place," said the doctor.&#xD;
"But the butterfly, seeking a safe resting place, flutters&#xD;
with unpoised flight, past the false poppy which flaunts&#xD;
its gay colours on the sight."&#xD;
"And fixes its eyes on the distant gardener with his&#xD;
watering-pot"---said Mrs. Stoutenburgh, 'stretching forth&#xD;
her hand, sibyl-like, towards the now prostrate doctor,-.&#xD;
"whereat the mignonette rejoices."&#xD;
"All the flowers rejoice," said the mignonette, "and the&#xD;
cricket jumps out of the way."&#xD;
"Into the sunshine" -said Mr.' Stoutenburgh, laughing;&#xD;
--" but the moth feels doubtful."&#xD;
"The moth"-said Mr. Somers-."he-..--don't like the&#xD;
sunshine'so well as the rain. He---ha--he wishes he was&#xD;
a midge there, to get under shelter."&#xD;
"A midge here he can't be," said Mr. Linden, dropping&#xD;
&#xD;
"I'll flutter no more ! after that"--said the doctor.&#xD;
"I'll creep into the heart of the white lily and beg it to&#xD;
shelter me."&#xD;
"It won't hide you from the sun nor from the rain," said&#xD;
the white lily,-" and I'd as lieve. shelter a spider. be-&#xD;
sides.'&#xD;
Faith forgot again that she must welcome the sun; but&#xD;
she was not the only one who had incurred forfeits. Nor&#xD;
the last one who should. For while that interesting mem-&#xD;
ber of society who called himself spider, made his reply,&#xD;
Mr. Linden's attention naturally wandered-or came back;&#xD;
and the lively dialogue which then ensued between Messrs.&#xD;
Snail, Wasp, Beetle, etc. failed to arouse him to the duties&#xD;
of a midge or the fear of the gardener: he forgot everything&#xD;
else in the pleasure of making Mignonette laugh. Stand-&#xD;
ing half before her at last, in some animated bit of talk,&#xD;
more than one sunbeam and watering-pot had come and&#xD;
gone, unnoticed by both midge and mignonette,-a fact of&#xD;
which some other people took note and smilingly marked&#xD;
down the forfeits.&#xD;
"Mr. Linden"-said the voice of Miss Essie at his&#xD;
elbow-" do you know what the doctor is saying ?-'The&#xD;
mother of mischief is no bigger than a midge's wing!1' You'd&#xD;
better speak to him:"&#xD;
Mr. Linden turned, with a laughing, recollective glance-&#xD;
"Who speaks slightingly of the midge ?-let him have&#xD;
a dose of syrup of poppies 1".  °&#xD;
"I guess you can find balm," said Mrs. Stoutenburgh&#xD;

"He shall have it if he wants it, said Miss Bezac_.&#xD;
that is if I've got it,-ough I rather guess he's got it&#xD;
himself,--I'm sure I don't know what he hasn't got. And&#xD;
it don't strike me he looks as if he wanted it, either, if I&#xD;
had. But it's funny I should and not the doctor--though&#xD;
to be sure most things are,-and he's gone to 'the butter.&#xD;
fly's ball and the grasshopper's feast. "'&#xD;
"The grasshopper's feast being just now announced,"4&#xD;
said Mrs. Somers stepping forward, "I shall hope to set&#xD;
the flowers free from their natural enemies without mbe&#xD;
delay."&#xD;
"I shall not confess to that!" said Mr. Linden under-&#xD;
tone.  "But will you come, Miss Faith-the insects are all&#xD;
gone--&#xD;
'Save the few that linger, even yet,&#xD;
Round the Alyssum's tuft and the Mignonette.'"&#xD;
The midge's prompt action had perhaps disappointed&#xD;
several other people. Dr. Harrison at any rate contrived&#xD;
with Miss Essie to be the immediately preceding coupletia&#xD;
the walk to the supper-room,.&#xD;
"I'm glad of some refreshment !" said the doctor; "but-&#xD;
terflies cannot live on the wing. Linden ! have you been&#xD;
singing all the evening, in the character of a midge ?"&#xD;
"No," said Mr. Linden-"all the singing I have done&#xD;
has been in my own character."&#xD;
"I am glad to hear it. By the way," said Dr. Harrison&#xD;
as they reached the supper-room and paired off from their&#xD;
respective charges,-" I am sorry to hear that Pattaquasset&#xD;
has no hold on you, Linden."&#xD;
"Indeed ?" said Mr. Linden,-an 'indeed' which might&#xD;
refer to the doctor's sorrow, or the supposed fact.&#xD;
"Nay I know nothing about it !" said the doctor lightly&#xD;
as he attacked the .supper-table-.'"but Miss Derrick tells&#xD;
me it is true that your heart is in another place."&#xD;
"Dr. Harrison !" Mr. Linden said, with a momentary&#xD;
erectness of position. But he said no more; turning off&#xD;
then towards Faith with her oysters. And the gentle re-&#xD;
spect and quick attention with which she was served, Fai h&#xD;
might feel, and take note of-yet not guess that its peculiar&#xD;
tone this night was warring, hand to hand, within the injus&#xD;
&#xD;
4 twice done her name. The doctor had unwittingly betrayed&#xD;
at least one point of talk held-over the Rhododendrons-&#xD;
furnished a clue he dreamed not of; and stirred a power&#xD;
of displeasure which perhaps he thought Mr. Linden did&#xD;
not possess.&#xD;
ith did not indeed guessanything from the manner of&#xD;
the latter to her, although she felt it; she felt it as his own,&#xD;
kind and watchful and even affectionate; but like him, be-&#xD;
longing to him, and therefore not telling upon the question.&#xD;
With a very humbled and self-chiding spirit, she was endeav-&#xD;
ouring to keep the face and manner which suited the) place,&#xD;
above a deep sinking of heart which was almost overcom-&#xD;
ing. Her success was like the balance of her mind-doubt-&#xD;
ful. Gentle her face was as ever; all the crosses of the&#xD;
evening had not brought an angle there; but it was sha-&#xD;
dowed beyond the fitness of things ; and she was still and&#xD;
retiring so far as it was possible to be, shrinking into a&#xD;
very child's.lowness of place.&#xD;
Ladies were in the majority that night and the gentlemen&#xD;
were obliged to be constantly on the move. In one of the&#xD;
minutes when Faith was alone, Mrs. Stoutenburgh came up.&#xD;
"Faith," she whispered, "have you been doing anything&#xD;
to vex my friend ?"&#xD;
Faith started a little, with a sort of shadow of pain&#xD;
crossing her face.&#xD;
"Who is your friend, Mrs. Stoutenburgh ?"&#xD;
"Hush, child !" she answered-"your friend, if you like&#xD;
it better." And she added softly but seriously, "Don't vex&#xD;
him,--he doesn't deserve it."&#xD;
Faitl's lip was that touchingly sorrowful child's lip for&#xD;
an instant.  She was beyond speaking.   Then came up&#xD;
help, in the shape of Miss Essie; with questions about the&#xD;
forfeits and about Mr. Linden. All Mrs. Stoutenburgh's&#xD;
kindness made itself into a screen for Faith, on the instant,&#xD;
-neither eyes nor tongues were allowed to come near her.&#xD;
"Mr. Linden !" said Miss Essie as he just then came up,&#xD;
"will you help us give out forfeits?  Who do you think is&#xD;
best to do it?"&#xD;
"Mr. Linden,"-said Mrs. Somners, "we are all very anx-&#xD;
ions to know whether all the reports about you are&#xD;
true."&#xD;

Mr. Linden bowed to the anxiety, but gave it no further&#xD;
heed.&#xD;
"Are they ?" she repeated.&#xD;
"Do all the reports agree, Mrs. Somers ?"&#xD;
"I must confess they are at swords' points."&#xD;
"Then they cannot all be true,-let them fight it out."&#xD;
"But suppose some of the fighting should come upon&#xD;
you ?"&#xD;
"That is a supposition I have just refused to take up,"&#xD;
said Mr. Linden, stepping towards the table a d bringing&#xD;
a bunch of grapes to Faith's plate,&#xD;
"Yes, but everybody hasn't the patience of Job," said&#xD;
Mrs. Somers. "Julius, for instance."&#xD;
".He has at least his own ways of obtaining inf'ormation,'n&#xD;
said Mr. Linden, and Faith felt the slight change of voice.&#xD;
"Miss Essie, what will you have ?"&#xD;
"Has the doctor any forfeits to pay ?" was the somewhat&#xD;
irrelevant answer. "I should so like to see you two set&#xD;
against each other!  Dr. Harrison!-have you any for.&#xD;
feits ?"?&#xD;
"No," sid the doctor ;-" but as'severe service to per-&#xD;
form as if had. Linden, we shall want your help-it's too&#xD;
much for one man."&#xD;
Faith edged away behind this growing knot of talkers,&#xD;
and presently was deeply engaged in conversation with Miss&#xD;
Cecilia Deacon, at a table in the corner, and alternating&#xD;
her attention between grapes and words. Then Squire&#xD;
Stoutenburgh walked softly up and.stood behind Faith's&#xD;
chair.&#xD;
"My dear, will you have anything more ?"&#xD;
No, sir, thank you."&#xD;
"Then I am going to carry you off!" said the Squire,--&#xD;
"if I wait a quarter of a second more I shall lose my&#xD;
chance. Come!"&#xD;
Faith was very willing to come, indeed; and they Went&#xD;
back to the drawing-room, all the company pouring after&#xD;
them; and Faith feeling as if she hid got under a kind&#xD;
of lee shore, on Mr. Stoutenburgh's arm. It could not&#xD;
shelter her long, for the forfeits began.&#xD;
The doctor and Mr. Linden, with Miss Essie and Mrs.&#xD;
Stoutenburgh for coadjutors, were constituted the awarding&#xD;
&#xD;
committee; and the forfeits were distributed to them indif-&#xD;
ferently. There were many to be redeemed; and at first&#xD;
there was a crowd of inferior interest, Messrs. Spider and&#xD;
'Wasp, Mesdemoiselles White Lily and Cluster rose; who were&#xD;
'easilydisposed of and gallantly dismissed. But there were&#xD;
others behind.. One of Faith's forfeits came up; it was&#xD;
held by Dr. Harrison.&#xD;
"Please to stand forth, Miss Derrick, and hear your sen-&#xD;
tence," said the doctor, leading her to a central position in&#xD;
the floor; which Faith took quietly, but with what inward&#xD;
rebellion one or two people could somewhat guess.&#xD;
"Have the goodness to state to the company what you&#xD;
consider to be the most admirable and praiseworthy of all&#xD;
the characters of flowers within your knowledge; and to&#xD;
describe the same, that we may judge of the justness of your&#xD;
opinion."&#xD;
;    "Describe the character ?" said Faith in a low voice.&#xD;
/ "Yes. If you please."&#xD;
She stood silent a moment, with downcast eyes, and did&#xD;
not raise them when she spoke. Her colour was hardly&#xD;
heightened, and though her voice rose little above its for-&#xD;
mer pitch, its sweet accents were perfectly audible every-&#xD;
where. The picture would have been enough for her for-&#xD;
feit.&#xD;
'The prettiest character of a flower that I know, is that&#xD;
of a little species of Rhododendron. It is one of the least&#xD;
handsome, to look at, of all its family; its beauty is in its&#xD;
living. It grows on the high places of high ihountains,&#xD;
where frost and barrenness give it no help nor chance; but&#xD;
there, where no other flower ever blossoms, it opens its&#xD;
flowers patiently and perseveringly; and its flowers are&#xD;
very sweet. Nothing checks it nor discourages it. As.&#xD;
soon as the great cold lets it come, it comes; and as long&#xD;
as the least mildness lets it stay, it stays. Amidst snow&#xD;
and tempest and desolation it opens its blossoms and&#xD;
spreads its sweetness, with nobody to see it nor to praise&#xD;
it; where from the nature of the place it lives in, its work&#xD;
is all alone. For no other flower will bear what it bears.&#xD;
'-Will that do ?" said Faith, looking up gravely at her&#xD;
questioner.&#xD;
.Very gently, very reverently even, he took her hand, put&#xD;

it upon his arm and led her to a seat, speaking as he went&#xD;
low words of gratified pardon asking. "You must foi.&#xD;
give me 1" he said. "Forfesits must be forfeits, you know,&#xD;
I couldn't resist the temptation."&#xD;
"Now wasn't that pretty ?" whispered ~Iiss Essie in the&#xD;
mean time in Mr. Linden's ear'&#xD;
He had listened, leaning against the martelpiece, and&#xD;
with shaded eyes looking down; and now to."Miss Essie8&#xD;
question returned only a grave bend of the head.&#xD;
"ifyou have been looking at the floor all this while, you&#xD;
have lost something," said the lady. "Do you know your&#xD;
turn comes next ?  Mr Linden-     ladiess and gentlemen !&#xD;
is condemned to tell us what he holds the mst precious&#xD;
thing in this world; and to justify himself in hns opinion by&#xD;
an argument, a quotation, and an illustration !"-.&#xD;
"Now will t e find means to evade his sentence!" said&#xD;
Mrs. Stoutenburgh laughing.&#xD;
"He has confessed himself addicted to witchcraft in m&#xD;
hearing," said the doctor, who had remained standing by&#xD;
Faith's chair.&#xD;
"The most precious thing in the world," said Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den, in a tone as carelessly graceful ashis attitude, "is that&#xD;
which cannot be bought,-for if money could buy it, theii&#xD;
perfecionney equally valuable. Take for illustration, the&#xD;
"I don't understand,"--said Miss Essie; "but perhaps&#xD;
I shall when I hear the rest."&#xD;
He smiled a little and gave the quotation on that point&#xD;
in his own clear and perfect manner.&#xD;
"A sweet, attractive kind of grace;&#xD;
A full assurance given by looks ;&#xD;
Continual comfort in a face;&#xD;
The lineaments of gospel books,--&#xD;
I trow that countenance cannot lye&#xD;
Whose thoughts are legible in the eye."'&#xD;
The quotation was received variously, but in general&#xD;
with vast admiration. Miss Essie turned to Mrs. Stouten-&#xD;
burghand remarkepd , haf lo,,&#xD;
"That's easy to understand. I was dull."&#xD;
"Wha do ou hinkof i ?"said the doctor softly, stoop-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing towards Faith. But if she heard she did not answer&#xD;
him. She sat with downcast eyes that didmot move. She&#xD;
had been wondering whether that was a description of&#xD;
='pet,'-or of somebody else.&#xD;
Faith," whispered Mrs. Stoutenburgh's kind mischiev-&#xD;
ous voice in her ear,-"in whose face do you suppose he&#xD;
finds 'continual comfort'?" But she was sorry the next&#xD;
Sinstant,for the pained, startled look which flashed up at&#xD;
her. Sorry and yet amused-the soft little kiss on Faith's&#xD;
cheek was smiling although apologetic.&#xD;
"Mr. Linden," said the doctor, who held the bag of for-&#xD;
feits,--"it is your duty to punish Miss Essie with some in-&#xD;
fliction, such as you can devise."&#xD;
"Miss Essie," said Mr. Linden,- walking gravely up to&#xD;
her, "if there is any person in this room towards whom&#xD;
you entertain and pi/actise malicious, mischievous, and under-&#xD;
hand designs, you are hereby sentenced to indicate the&#xD;
2 person, declare the designs, and to 'shew cause.&#xD;
"Why I -never did in my life 1" said Miss Essie, with a&#xD;
mixture of surprise and amusement in her gracious black&#xD;
eyes.°&#xD;
"The court is obliged to refuse an unsupported negative,"&#xD;
said Mr. Linden bowing.&#xD;
IWe  " said Miss nEssie, with no diminishing of the&#xD;
lustre of her black orbs,--" I had a design against you,&#xD;
sir 1".                               .&#xD;
"Of what sort?" said Mr. Linden with intense gravity,&#xD;
while everybody else laughed in proportion.&#xD;
"I had a design to enter your mmd by-private fraud, and&#xD;
steal away its secrets;--and the reason was, because the&#xD;
door was so terribly strong and had such an uncommon&#xD;
good lock! and I couldn't get in any other way."&#xD;
"I hope that is news to the rest of the company," said&#xD;
Mr. Linden laughing as he bowed his acknowledgments.&#xD;
"It is none to me ! Miss Essie, may your shadow never be&#xD;
less !"-.&#xD;
t you ashamed !" said Miss Essie reproachfully.&#xD;
"Didn't such a confession deserve better ?+ Who's next;&#xD;

Then was there an opening of eyes and a pricking of ears&#xD;
of all the rest of the company.  Only Faith herself sat as&#xD;
still as a mouse, after one little quick glance over to where&#xD;
the person stood in whose hands she was. He stood look.&#xD;
ing at her,--then walked wit great deliberation across the&#xD;
room to her low seat, and   king both her hands lifted&#xD;
her up.&#xD;
"You need not be frightened," he said softly, as keeping&#xD;
one hand in his clasp he led her back to where he had&#xD;
been standing; then placed her in a great downy easy&#xD;
chair in that corner of the fireplace, and drew up a foot.&#xD;
stool for her feet.&#xD;
"Miss Faith," he said, "you are to sit there in absolute&#xD;
silence for the next fifteen minutes. If anybody speaks to&#xD;
you, you are not to answer,-if you are longing to speak&#xD;
yourself you must wait. It is also required that you look&#xD;
at nobody, and hear as little as possible." With which&#xD;
fierce sentence, Mr. Linden took his stand by the chair to&#xD;
see it enforced.&#xD;
"What a man you are !" said Mrs. Stoutenburgh laugh.&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
"That's not fair play !''said Mrs. Somers.  "She don't&#xD;
want to sit there-if you think she does, you're mis-&#xD;
taken."&#xD;
"She should have been more careful then," said Mr.&#xD;
Linden. "Dr. Harrison, you have the floor."&#xD;
Dr. Harrison did not appear to think that was much of&#xD;
a possession;-to judge by his face, which cast several very&#xD;
observant glances towards the chair, and by his manner&#xD;
which for a moment was slightly abstracted and destitute&#xD;
of the spirit of the game. Miss Essie's eyes took thesame&#xD;
direction, with a steady gaze which the picture justified.&#xD;
Faith sat where she had been placed, in most absolute&#xD;
obedience to the orders she had received,-except possibly&#xD;
---not probably-the last one. The lids drooped over her&#xD;
eyes, which moved rarely from the floor, and never raised&#xD;
themselves. Her colour had risen indeed to a rich tint,&#xD;
where it stayed; but Mrs. Somers' declaration ne*erthe-&#xD;
less was hardly borne out by a certain little bit-in smile&#xD;
which lurked there too, spite of everything.. Otherwise&#xD;
she sat like an impersonation f silence, happily screened,&#xD;
&#xD;
by not looking at anybody, from any annoyance of the eyes&#xD;
that were levelled at her and at the figure that held post&#xD;
by her side.&#xD;
Mrs. Stoutenburgh," said the doctor, "you have my&#xD;
aunt Ellen."&#xD;
Mrs. Stoutenburgh however was lenient in that quarter,&#xD;
and told Mrs. Somers they would require nothing of her&#xD;
but the three last items of Pattaquiasset news-which she,&#xD;
as pastor's wife, was bound to know. And Mrs. Somers&#xD;
was not backward in declaring them; the first' being the&#xD;
engagement of two people who hated each other, the second&#xD;
the separation of two people who loved each other; the&#xD;
third, that Mr. Linden shot hiiself-to make a sensa-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"Mr. Linden," said the doctor, "you come next-and&#xD;
you are mine. What shall I do with you ?"&#xD;
"Why--anything," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"Well-I am greatly at a loss what you are good for,"&#xD;
said the doctor lightly,-"but onthe whole I order yondo&#xD;
preach a sermon to the company."&#xD;
"Have you any choice as to the text ?"&#xD;
"I am not in the way of those things," said the doctor&#xD;
laughingly.  "Give us the lesson you think we want&#xD;
most."&#xD;
The clear, grave look that met him -Dr. Harrison&#xD;
had seen it before. The change was like the parting&#xD;
of a little bright vapour, revealing the steadfast blue&#xD;
beneath.&#xD;
"Nay doctor, you must bid me do something else!. I&#xD;
dare not play at marbles with precious stones."&#xD;
There was probably a mixture of things in the doctor's&#xD;
mind;--but the outward show in answer to this was in the&#xD;
highest degree seemly and becoming. The expression of&#xD;
Dr. Harrison's face changed; with a look gentle and&#xD;
kind, even winning, he came up to Mr. Linden's side and&#xD;
took his hand.&#xD;
"You are right" said he, "and I have got my sermon&#xD;
-which I deserve. But now, Linden, that is not your&#xD;
fonrfi;--for that you must tell me-honestly-what you&#xD;
tikof me."  There was always a general air of careless-&#xD;
ness about Dr. Harrison, as to what" he said himself~ or&#xD;

what others said in his presence. Along with this care.&#xD;
lessness, which whether seeming or real was almost inva.&#xD;
riable, there mingled now a friend's look and tone and&#xD;
something of a friend's apology making.&#xD;
"But do ydu want me to tell everybody else ?" said Mr.&#xD;
Linden, smiling in his old way at the doctor. "Do you&#xD;
like to blush before so many people ?"&#xD;
"That's your forfeit !" said the doctor resuming also&#xD;
his old-fashioned light tone. "You're to tell me--and you&#xD;
are not to tell anybody else I"&#xD;
"Well-if you will have it," said Mr. Linden looking&#xD;
at him,-"Honestly, I think you are very handsome.!...of&#xD;
course that is news to nobody but yourself."&#xD;
"Mercy on you, man !" said the doctor; "do you think&#xD;
that is news to me?"&#xD;
"It is supposed to be-by courtesy," said Mr. Linden&#xD;
laughing.&#xD;
"Well---give me all the grace courtesy will let you,"&#xD;
said the doctor; whetheraltogether lightly, or with some&#xD;
feeling, it would have been hard for a by-stander to tell.&#xD;
"Is Miss Derrick's penance out?  She comes next-.-and&#xD;
Miss Essie has her."&#xD;
"No,"--said Mr. Linden consulting his watch. "I am&#xD;
sorry to interfere with your arrangements, doctor, but justice&#xD;
must have its course."&#xD;
" Then .there is a 'recess'"-said the doctor comically.&#xD;
"Ladies and gentlemen-please amuse yourselves. "-.'&#xD;
THe had no intention of helping them, it seemed, for&#xD;
he.stood fast in his place and talked to Mr. Linden&#xD;
in a different tone till the minutes were run out. No-&#xD;
thing. could be more motionless than the occupant of the&#xD;
chair.&#xD;
"Miss Faith," Mr. Linden said then, "it is a little hard&#xD;
to pass from one inquisitor to another-but I must hand&#xD;
you over to Miss Essie."                      '°''&#xD;
Faith's glance at him expressed no gratification. Mean-&#xD;
while the doctor had gone for Miss Essie and brought her&#xD;
up to the fireplace.&#xD;
" Miss Derrick," said the black-eyed lady, "I wish yo&#xD;
to tell-as the penalty of your forfeit-why, when you&#xD;

&#xD;
thought the Rhododendron tle most perfect flower, you&#xD;
did not take it for your name ?&#xD;
If anybody had known the pain this question gave&#xD;
Faith-the leap of dismay that-her heart made ! Nobody&#xD;
knew it; her head drooped, and the colour rose again to&#xD;
be sure; but one hand sheltered the exposed cheek and&#xD;
the other was turned to the fire. She could not refuse&#xD;
to answer, and with the doctor's weapons she would&#xD;
not; but here, as once before, Faith's straightforwardness&#xD;
saved her.&#xD;
"Why didn't you call yourself Rhodora ?" repeated Miss&#xD;
Essie. And Faith answered,-&#xD;
"Because another name was suggested to me."&#xD;
The question could not decently be pushed any&#xD;
further; and both Miss Essie and the doctor looked as&#xD;
if they had failed. Faith's own tumult and sinking of&#xD;
heart prevented her knowing how thoroughly this was&#xD;
true.&#xD;
"And you two people," said Mr. Linden, come and&#xD;
ask Miss Derrick why she chose to appropriate a cha-&#xD;
racter that she thought fell short of perfection !-what is&#xD;
the use of telling anybody anything, after that ?"&#xD;
"I am only one people," said Miss Essie.&#xD;
"I am another," said the doctor; "and I confess my-&#xD;
self curious. Besides, a single point of imperfection&#xD;
might be supposed, without injury to mortal and human&#xD;
nature."&#xD;
"Julius," said Miss Harrison, "will you have the good-&#xD;
ness to do so impolite a thing as to look at your watch?&#xD;
Aunt Ellen will expect us to set a proper example.&#xD;
Dear Faith, are you bound to sit in that big chair all&#xD;
night ?"&#xD;
Then there was a general stir and break-up of the&#xD;
party. One bit of conversation Faith was fated to hear&#xD;
as she slowly made her way out of the dressing-room&#xD;
door, among comers and goers: the first speaker was a&#xD;
young De Staff.&#xD;
"Since that shooting affair there's been nothing but&#xD;
reports about you, Linden."&#xD;
"Reports seldom kill," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
T was pretty late when Jerry and his lite sleigh-load&#xD;
got clear of the gates. The stars were as bright as&#xD;
ever, and now they had the help of the old moon; which&#xD;
was pouring her clear radiance over the snow and sending&#xD;
long shadows from trees and fences. The fresh air was&#xD;
pleasant too. Faith felt it, and wondered that starlight&#xD;
and snow and sleigh-bells were such a different thing from&#xD;
what they were a few hours before. She chid herself, she&#xD;
was vexed at herself, and humbled exceedingly. She en-&#xD;
deavoured to get back on the simple abstract ground she&#xD;
had held in her own thoughts until within a day or two;&#xD;
she was deeply ashamed that her head should have allowed&#xD;
even a flutter of imagination from Mr. Stoutenburgh's&#xD;
words, which now it appeared might bear a quite contrary.&#xD;
Anse to that which she had given them. What was she,&#xD;
to have anything to do with them? Faith humbly said,&#xD;
nothing. And yet,-she could not help that either,-the&#xD;
image of the possibility of what Dr. Harrison had suggested,&#xD;
raised a pain that Faith could not look at. She sat still&#xD;
and motionless, and heard the sleigh-bells without knowing&#xD;
to what tune they jingled.&#xD;
It was a quick tune, at all events,.-for the first ten or&#xD;
fifteen minutes Jerry dashed along to his heart's content,&#xD;
and his driver even urged him. on,.-then with other sleighs&#xD;
left far behind and a hill before him, Jerry brought the&#xD;
tune to a staccato, and Mr. Linden spoke. But the words&#xD;
were not very relevant to either stars or seigh'-bells.&#xD;
"Miss Faith, Ithought you knew me better."&#xD;
They startled her, for she was a minute or two without&#xD;
answering ; then' came a gentle, and also rather frightened,&#xD;
"Why ?-.-why do you say that, Mr.. Linden ?"&#xD;
"Do you think you know me ?" he said, turning towards&#xD;
her with a little bit of a smile, though the voice was grave.&#xD;
"Do you think you have any idea how much I care about&#xD;
you(?"&#xD;

think you do," she said. "I am sure ou do-very&#xD;
much !"                                 youo-vey&#xD;
"Do you know how much ?"-and the smile was&#xD;
then, and followed by a moment's silence. "I shall notfuly&#xD;
to tell you, Miss Faith; I could not if I'would-but tre&#xD;
is something on the other side of the question which Iwane&#xD;
you to tell me."&#xD;
And Jerry walked slowly up the snowy hill, and the&#xD;
slight tinkle of his bells was as silvery as the starlight of&#xD;
Orion overhead.&#xD;
Faith looked at her questioner and then off again,&#xD;
rich colour was    mantling in her cheeks. But the&#xD;
silence was breathless. Jerry's bells only announced it.&#xD;
And having by that time reached the top of the hill he&#xD;
chose.and was permitted-.to set off at his formerpace;&#xD;
fligin of te sow igt and left, and toshis  mpace;&#xD;
on the cool night air. Down that hill, and up the next&#xD;
and down that--and along a level bit of road to te foot&#xD;
of another,--then slowly.    .he&#xD;
"Miss Faith," said Mr. Linden when they were half way&#xD;
up, "do you never mean to speak to me again ?"&#xD;
A very low-breathed although audible "yes."&#xD;
"Is that all you mean to say ?--I shall take it verycom-&#xD;
prehensively."                          eivr     o-&#xD;
She was willing probably that he should take it anyway&#xD;
that e pleased; but to add was as much beyond Faith's&#xD;
power at the moment as to subtract fro  her one word.&#xD;
She did not even look.&#xD;
"Do you know what this silence is promising ?" Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den said in the same tone, and bending down by h   I&#xD;
do---and yet I want to hear you speak once more. If there&#xD;
is any reason why I should try not to love you better tha K&#xD;
all the rest of the world, you must tell me now."&#xD;
One other quick, inquiring, astonished glance her eyes&#xD;
gave into his face; and then, as usual his wish  h  er&#xD;
speak made her speak, through all the intense difficulty.&#xD;
There was a minute's further hesitation and thenditheicrds,&#xD;
very low, very simple, and trembling        words&#xD;
"Do-if you can."&#xD;
"Do try?" he said in a lower and graver tone.&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.                 489&#xD;
"Try ?"--she said; then with a change of voice and in&#xD;
very much confusion,-"O no, Mr. Linden 1"&#xD;
"I should not succeed-" was all his answer, nor was&#xD;
there time for much more ; for having now turned ito the&#xD;
sain street where other homeward-bound sleighs were&#xD;
flying along, there was nothing to do but fly along with&#xD;
the rest; and a very few minutes brought them home.&#xD;
ir. Skip was probably-reposing 'in parts unknown, for&#xD;
there was no sign of him at his post; and when Faith had&#xD;
been silently taken out of the sleigh and into the hall, Mr.&#xD;
Linden went back to Jerry-telling her she must take good&#xD;
care of herself for five minutes.&#xD;
Bewilderedly, and trembling yet, Faith turned into the&#xD;
sitting-room. It was warm and bright, Mrs. Derrick having&#xD;
only lately left it; and taking off hood and cloak i a sort&#xD;
of mechanical way, with fingers that did not feel the strings,&#xD;
she sat down in the easy chair and laid her head on the arm&#xD;
of it ; as very a child as she had been on the night of that&#xD;
terrible walk;-.wondering to herself if this were Christmas&#xD;
day--if she were Faith Derrick-and if anything were any-&#xD;
thing !-but with a wonder of such growing happiness as&#xD;
made it more and more difficult for her to raise her head&#xD;
up. She dreaded-with an odd kind of dread which con-&#xD;
tradicted itself-to hear Mr. Linden come in; and in the&#xD;
abstract, she would. have liked very much to jump up and&#xD;
run away ; but that little intimation was quite enough ti&#xD;
hold her fast. She sat still drawing quick little breaths.&#xD;
The loud voice of the clock near by, striking its twelve&#xD;
strokes, was not half so. distinct to her as that light step in&#xD;
the hall which came so swiftly and quick to her side.&#xD;
"What is the problem now, pretty child ?" Mr. Linden&#xD;
said, laying both hands upon hers,-" it is too late for study&#xD;
to-night.  You must wait till to-morrow and have my&#xD;
help."&#xD;
She rose up at that, however gladly she would have hid-&#xD;
den the face her rising revealed; but yet with no awkward-&#xD;
ness she stood before him, rosily grave and shy, and with&#xD;
downcast eyelids that could by no means lift themselves up&#xD;
to shew what was beneath; a fair combination of the child's&#xD;
character and the woman's nature in one; bothi spoken&#xD;
fairly and fully. Mr. Linden watched her for a nute,&#xD;

&#xD;
softly passing his hand over that fair brow; then drew he,&#xD;
closer.&#xD;
"I suppose I may claim Mr. Stoutenburgh's privilege.&#xD;
now," he said. But it was more than that he took. And&#xD;
then with one hand still held fast, Faith was put back in&#xD;
her chair and wheeled up to the fire 'to get warm,' and&#xD;
Mr. Linden sat down by her side.&#xD;
Did he really think she needed it,when she was rosy to&#xD;
her fingers' endsP But what could she do, but be very still&#xD;
and very happy. Even as a flower whose head is heavy&#xD;
with dew,--never more fragrant than then, yet with the&#xD;
weight of its sweet burden it bends a little;-like that was&#xD;
the droop of Faith's head at this minute. Whither had the&#xD;
whirl of this evening whirled her'? Faith did not know.&#xD;
She felt as if, to some harbour of rest, broad and safe; the&#xD;
very one where from its fitness it seemed she ought to be.&#xD;
But shyly and confusedly, she felt it much as a man feels&#xD;
the ground, who is near taken off it by a hurricane. Yet&#xD;
she felt it, for her head drooped more and more.&#xD;
"Faith," Mr. Linden said, half smiling, half seriously,&#xD;
"what has made you so sober all this evening-..so much&#xD;
afraid of me ?"&#xD;
The quick answer of the eye stayed not a minute; the&#xD;
blush was more abiding.,&#xD;
"You don't want me to tell you that !"-..she said in soft&#xD;
pleading.&#xD;
"Do you know now who I think has--..&#xD;
'A sweet attractive kind of grace'?"&#xD;
"0 don't, please, speak so, Mr. Linden 1" she said bow-&#xD;
ing her face in her hands,---"it don't belong to me."-;And&#xD;
pressing her hands closer, she added, "You have made me&#xD;
all I am--that is anything."&#xD;
" There is one thing I mean to make you---if I live," he&#xD;
answered smiling, and taking down her hand. "Faith,&#xD;
what do you mean by talking to me in that style ?---haven't&#xD;
you just given me leave to think what I like of you ? You&#xD;
deserve another half hour's silent penance."&#xD;
.A little bit of smile broke upon her face which for an&#xD;
instant she tried to hide witl4 her other hand. But she&#xD;
dropped that and turned the face towards hin, rosy, grave,.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.                491&#xD;
and happy, more than she knew, or sh  aps would have&#xD;
hidden it again. Her eyes indeed on y saw his and fell&#xD;
instantly; and her words began and stopped,&#xD;
"There is one comfort-"&#xD;
"What, dear child ?"&#xD;
"That you know what to think," she said, looking up&#xD;
with a face that evidently rested in the confidence of that&#xD;
fact.&#xD;
"About what?" Mr. Linden said with an amused look.&#xD;
"I have known what to think about you for some time."&#xD;
"I meant that,"--she said quietly and with very down-&#xD;
cast eyes again.&#xD;
"I am not in a good mood for riddles to-night," said&#xD;
Mr. Linden,-"just what does this one mean?'&#xD;
"Nothing, only-" said Faith flushing,-"you said-"&#xD;
She was near breaking down in sheer confusion, but she&#xD;
rallied and went on. "You said I had given you leave to&#xD;
think what you liked of me,-and I say it is a comfort that&#xD;
you know what to think."&#xD;
Mr. Linden laughed.&#xD;
"You are a dear little child !" he said, "Being just the&#xD;
most precious thing in the world to me, you sit there and&#xD;
rejoice that I am in no danger of overestimating you-&#xD;
which is profoundly true. My comfort in knowing what&#xD;
to think, runs in a different line."&#xD;
It is hard to describe Faith's look; it was a mixture of so&#xD;
many things. It was wondering, and shamefaced; and curi-&#xD;
ous for its blending of humility and gladness; but gladness&#xD;
moved to such a point as to be near the edge of sorrowful&#xD;
expression. She would not have permitted it to choose such&#xD;
expression, and indeed it easily took another line; for even&#xD;
as she looked, her eye caught the light from Mr. Linden's and&#xD;
the gravity of her face broke in a sunny and somewhat ob-&#xD;
stinate smile, which Faith would have controlled if she could.&#xD;
"That penance was not so very bad,"-she said, perhaps&#xD;
by way of diversion.&#xD;
"I enjoyed it," said Mr. Linden,-"I am not sure that&#xD;
everybody else did. Are you longing for another piece of&#xD;
rest ?-Look up at me, and let me see if I ought to keep&#xD;
you here any longer."&#xD;
She obeyed, though shyly ; the smile lingering round her&#xD;

&#xD;
lips yet, and her whole face, to tell the truth, bearing much&#xD;
more resemblance to the dawn of a May morning than to&#xD;
the middle pf a December night. Mr. Linden was in some&#xD;
danger of forgetting why he had asked to see it; but when&#xD;
her eyes fell beneath his, then he remembered.&#xD;
"I must let you go," he said,--" I suppose the sooner I&#xD;
do that, the sooner I may hope to see you again. Will&#xD;
you sleep diligently, to that eid ?"&#xD;
"I don't know-" she said softly; rising at the same&#xD;
time to gather up her wrappers which lay strewed about,&#xD;
around and under her. Her lips had the first answer to&#xD;
that ; only as lie let her go Mr. Linden said,&#xD;
"You must try."&#xD;
And a little scarce-spoken "yes" promised it.&#xD;
It,was easier than she thought. When Faith had got to&#xD;
her room, when she had as usual laid down her heart's&#xD;
burden.-.-joyful or careful-in her prayer, there came soon&#xD;
a great subsiding; and mind and body slept, as sleep comes&#xD;
to an exhausted child; or as those sleep, at any age, whose&#xD;
hearts bear no weight which God's hand can bear for them,&#xD;
and who are contented to leave their dearest things to the&#xD;
same hand. There was no 'ravelled sleeve of care' ever in&#xD;
Faith's mind, for sleep to knit up; but 'tired nature's sweet&#xD;
restorer' she needed like the rest of the human family; and.&#xD;
on this occasion sleep did her work without let or hindrance&#xD;
from the time ten minutes after Faith's head touched her&#xD;
pillow till the sun was strong and bright on the morning of&#xD;
the 26th of December. Yes, and pretty high up too; for&#xD;
the first thing that fell upon her waking senses was eight&#xD;
clear strokesof the town clock.&#xD;
Faith got up and dressed herself in a great hurry and in&#xD;
absolute dismay; blushing to think where was her mother;&#xD;
and breakfast-.and everybody-all this while, and whit&#xD;
everybody was thinking of her. From her room Faifh&#xD;
went straight to dairy and kitchen. She wanted her han ls&#xD;
full this morning. But her duties in the kitchen were do e;&#xD;
breakfast was only waiting, and her mother talking to the&#xD;
butcher. Faith stood till he was dismissed and had turned&#xD;
his back, and then came into Mrs. Derrick's arms.&#xD;
"Mother !-.why didn't you call me1"&#xD;
"Pretty child !" was the fond answer, "why should I ?-.&#xD;
&#xD;
I've been up to look at you half a dozen times, Faith, to&#xD;
V make sure you were not sick; but Mr. Linden said hey was&#xD;
t  i no hurry for breakfast-and of course I wasn't. Did,&#xD;
y ou have a good time last night?"&#xD;
"I should think you ought to be in a hurry for breakfast&#xD;
by this time."  And Faith busied herself in helping Cindy&#xD;
put the breakfast on the table.&#xD;
"You run and, call Mr. Linden, child," said her mother,&#xD;
"and I'll see to this. He was here till a minute ago, and&#xD;
then some of the boys wanted to see him."&#xD;
Faith turned away, but with no sort of mind to present&#xD;
herself before the boys, and in tolerable fear of presenting&#xD;
herself before anybody. The closing hall door informed&#xD;
her that one danger was over; and forcing herself to brave&#xD;
the other, she passed into the sitting-room just as Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den reentered it from the hall. Very timidly then she ad-&#xD;
;T vanced a few steps to meet him and stood still, with cheeks&#xD;
as rosy as it was possible to be, and eyes that dared not&#xD;
lift themselves up.&#xD;
The greeting she had did not help either matter very&#xD;
much, but that could not be helped either.&#xD;
.'What colour are your cheeks under all these roses ?"&#xD;
Mr. Linden said smiling at her. "My dear Faith, were&#xD;
you quite tired out?"&#xD;
"No-You must think so," she said with stammering&#xD;
lips-" but breakfast is ready at last. If you'll go in-I'll&#xD;
come, Mr. Linden."&#xD;
"Do you want me to go in first?"&#xD;
'(Yes. I'll come directly."&#xD;
He let her go, and went in as she desired; and having&#xD;
persuaded Mrs. Derrick that as breakfast was on the table&#xD;
it had better have prompt attention, Mr. Linden engaged&#xD;
her with a lively account of the people, dresses, and doings,&#xD;
which had, graced the Christmas party; keeping her mind&#xD;
pretty well on that subject both before and after Faith&#xD;
made her appearance. How little it engrossed him, only&#xD;
one person at the table could even guess. But she knew,&#xD;
and rested herself happily under the screen he spread out&#xD;
for her; as quiet and demure as anything that ever sat&#xD;
at a breakfast table yet. And all the attention she received&#xD;
was as silent as it was careful; not till breakfast was over&#xD;

&#xD;
did Mr. Linden give her more than a passing word ; but then&#xD;
he inquired how soon she would be ready for philosophy.&#xD;
Faith's hesitating answer was "Very soon;"-then as&#xD;
Mr. Linden left the room she asked, "What are you going&#xD;
to do to-day, mother ?"&#xD;
"O just the old story, "said Mrs. Derrick,--'"two or&#xD;
three sick people I must go and see,-and some well people&#xD;
I'd rather see, by half. It's so good to have you home,&#xD;
dear !" And she kissed Faith and held her off and looked&#xD;
at her-several feelings at work in her face. "Pretty&#xD;
child," she said, "I don't think I ever saw you look so&#xD;
pretty."&#xD;
Faith returned the kiss, and chid h r face in her mother's&#xD;
neck; more things than one were in her mind to say, but&#xD;
not one of them could get out. SJe could only kiss her&#xD;
mother and hold her fast. The wrds that at last came,&#xD;
were a very commonplace remark about-"going to see&#xD;
to the dinner."   'J&#xD;
"I guess you will !" said Mrs. Derrick--" with Mr.&#xD;
Linden waiting for you in the other room. I wonder what&#xD;
he'd say to you, or to ine either. And besides-people&#xD;
that want to see about dinner must get up earlier in the&#xD;
morning."&#xD;
The words, some of them, were a little moved; but&#xD;
whatever Mrs. Derrick was thinking of, she did not explain,&#xD;
only bade Faith go off and attend to her lessons and make&#xD;
up fir lost time.&#xD;
Which after some scouting round kitchen and dairy,&#xD;
Faith did. She entered the sitting-room with the little&#xD;
green book in -her hand, as near as possible as she would&#xD;
have done three weeks ago. Not quite.&#xD;
She had a bright smile of welcome, and Mr. Linden&#xD;
placed a chair for her and _placed her in it; and then the&#xD;
lessons went oh with all their old gentle care and guidance.&#xD;
More, they could hardly have-though Faith sometimes&#xD;
fancied there was more; and if the old sobriety was hard&#xD;
to keep up, still it was done, for her sake. A little play&#xD;
of the lips which she could sometimes see, was kept within&#xD;
very quiet bounds; whatever novelty there might be in look&#xD;
or manner was perhaps unconscious and unavoidable. She&#xD;
might be watched a little more than formerly, but her wor~k&#xD;
&#xD;
K   none the less; and Mr. Linden's -explanations and cor-&#xD;
rections were given with just their old grave freedom, and&#xD;
no more. And yet how different a thing the lessons were&#xD;
to him !-&#xD;
As to Faith, her hand trembled very much at first, and&#xD;
even her voice; but for all that, the sunshine within was&#xD;
easy to see, and there came a bright flash of it sometimes.&#xD;
i   In spite of timidity and shyness, every now and then some-&#xD;
thing made her forget herself, and then the sunlight broke&#xD;
out; to be followed perhaps by a double cloud of gravity.&#xD;
But for the rest, she worked like a docile pupil, as she&#xD;
always had done.&#xD;
Apparently her teacher's thoughts had not been con-&#xD;
fined to the work, if they had to her; for when all was&#xD;
done that could be done before dinner, he made one of&#xD;
those sudden speeches with which he sometimes indulged&#xD;
himself.&#xD;
'"Faith-I wish you would   sk me to do half a dozen&#xD;
almost impossible things for you."&#xD;
What a pretty, wondering look she gave.fiim. One of&#xD;
the flashes of the sunlight came then. But then came an&#xD;
amused expression.&#xD;
"What would be the good of that, Mr. Linden?"&#xD;
"I should have the pleasure of doing them."&#xD;
"I believe you would," said Faith. "I think the only&#xD;
things quite impossible to you are wrong things."&#xD;
"The only thing you ever did ask of me was impossible,"&#xD;
he said with a smile, upon which there was a shadow too&#xD;
-as if the recollection pained him. "Child, how could&#xD;
you ?-It half broke my heart to withstand you so, do you&#xD;
know that? I want the almost impossible things to make&#xD;
me forget it."&#xD;
Her lip trembled instantly and her command of herself&#xD;
was nearly gone. She had risen for something, and as he&#xD;
spoke she came swiftly behind him, putting herself where&#xD;
he could not see her face, and laid her hand on his shoulder.&#xD;
It lay there as light as thistle-down ; but it was Faith's&#xD;
mute way of saying a great many things that her voice&#xD;
oould not.&#xD;
Very quick 'and tenderly Mr. Linden drew her forward&#xD;
again, and tried the power of his~ lips to still hers.&#xD;

"Hush, dear child !" he said-"you must not mind any-&#xD;

to be afraid of. And you must not claim it as your pre-&#xD;
rogative to get before me in danger and behind me at all&#xD;
other times-because that is just reversing the proper,&#xD;
order of things. Faith, I am going to ask an almost im-&#xD;
possible thing of you."&#xD;
"What is it ?" Faith was secretly glad, for afraid of his,&#xD;
requests she could not be.&#xD;
You will try todo it ?".&#xD;
"Yes-certainly I"&#xD;
"It is only to forget that 'Mr. Linden'is any part of my&#xD;
name, he said smiling.&#xD;
She -had been rosy enough before, but now the blood&#xD;
reddened her very brow, till for one instant she put up her&#xD;
hands to hide it.&#xD;
"What then ?"-she said in a breathless sort of way.&#xD;
"What you like"-..he answered brightly. "I have not&#xD;
quite as many names as a Prince Royal, but still enough&#xD;
to choose from. You may separate, combine, or invent, at&#xD;
your pleasure."&#xD;
There came a summons' to dinner then; and part of the&#xD;
hours which should follow thereafter, Mr. Linden was&#xD;
pledged    sp  d somewhere with somebody-away from&#xD;
home. - Bu promised to be back to tea, and before that,&#xD;
if he could; and so left Faith to the quiet companionship&#xD;
of her mother and her lessons-if she felt disposed for them.&#xD;
They were both in the sitting-room together, Mrs. Derrick&#xD;
and the books,-both helping the sunlight that came in at&#xD;
the windows. But Faith neglected the books, and came to&#xD;
her mother's side. She sat down and put her arms round&#xD;
her, and nestled her head on her mother's bosom, as she&#xD;
had done in the morning. And then was silent. That&#xD;
might have' been just what Mrs. Derrick expected, she&#xD;
was so very ready for it; her work was dropped so in-&#xD;
stantly, her head rested so fondly on Faith's. But her&#xD;
silence was soon broken.&#xD;
"How long do you think I can wait, pretty child ?"&#xD;
she said in the softest, tenderest tone that even she could&#xD;
use.&#xD;

"Supose you tell me.&#xD;
"Do you know, mother ?" said Faith in a low, changed&#xD;
tone and drawing closer. But Mrs. Derrick only repeated,&#xD;
"What, child ?"&#xD;
"What Mr. Linden has said to me,"-she whispered.&#xD;
"I knew what he would"-but the words broke off there,&#xD;
d Mrs. Derrick rested her head again in silence as abso-&#xD;
lute as Faith's.&#xD;
For awhile; and then Faith lifted up her flushed face&#xD;
and began to kiss her.&#xD;
"Mother   -why don't you speak to me?"&#xD;
It was not very easy to speak-.Faith could see that ; but&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick did command her voice enough to give a sort&#xD;
of answer.&#xD;
*  "He had my leave, child,-..at least he has talked to me&#xD;
about you in a way that I should have said no to, if I had&#xD;
meant it,-.and he knew that. Do you think I should&#xD;
have let him stay here all this time if I had not been&#xD;
willing?"&#xD;
Faith laid her head down again.&#xD;
"Mother-dear mother !".--she said,-" I want more&#xD;
than that!"-&#xD;
She had all she wanted then,-Mrs. Derrick spoke clearly&#xD;
and steadily, though the tears were falling fat.&#xD;
"I am as glad- as you are, darling-.or as he 18,--I can-&#xD;
not say more than that. So glad that you should be so&#xD;
happy-so -glad to have such hands in which to leave you."&#xD;
The last words were scarce above a whisper.&#xD;
Faith was desperate. She did not cry, but she did&#xD;
everything else. With trembling fingers she stroked her&#xD;
mother's face; with lips that trembled she kissed her; but&#xD;
Faith's voice was steady, whatever lay behind it.&#xD;
"Mother-smother!--.why do you do so? why do you&#xD;
speak so  i  Does this look like gladness?" And lps and&#xD;
hands kissed away the tears with an eagernesse that was to&#xD;
the last degree tender.&#xD;
"Why yes, child !" her mother said rousing up, and&#xD;
with a little bit of a smile that did not belie .her words,--&#xD;
"I tell you I'm as glad as I can be!-Tears don't mean&#xD;
anything, Faith,-I can't help crying'sometimes. But I'm&#xD;
jUst as glad as he is," she repeated, trying. her soothing&#xD;

powers in turn,--"and if you'd seen his face as I did when&#xD;
he went away, you'd think that was enough. I don't know&#xD;
whether I could be," she added softly, "if I thought he&#xD;
would take you away from me--but I know he'll never do&#xD;
that, from something he said once., Why pretty child!&#xD;
any one but a baby could see this long ago,--and as for&#xD;
that, Faith, I believe I love him almost as well as you do,&#xD;
this mmIute."&#xD;
The last few minutes had tried Faith more than she&#xD;
could bear, with the complete reaction that followed. The&#xD;
tears that very rarely made their way from her eyes in any.&#xD;
body's sight, came now. But they were not permitted to&#xD;
be many; her mother hardly kn w they were come before&#xD;
they were gone; and half nestli ig in her arms, Faith lay&#xD;
with her face hid; silent and quiet. It seemed to Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick as if she was too far off still, for she lifted Faith&#xD;
softly up, and took her on her lap after the old childish&#xD;
fashion, kissing her once and again.&#xD;
"Now, Pretty child," she said, softly stroking the un-&#xD;
covered cheek, "keep your hands down and tell   e all&#xD;
about it. I don't mean every word," she added sfiling,&#xD;
"but all you like to tell."&#xD;
But Faith could not do that. She made Very lame work&#xD;
of it. She managed only with much difficulty to give her&#xD;
mother a very sketchy and thin outline of what sh wanted&#xD;
to know; which perhaps was as much as Mrs. Derrick ex-&#xD;
pected; and was given with a simplicity as bare of additions&#xD;
as her facts were. A very few words told all she had to&#xD;
tell. Yes, her mother was satisfied,--she loved to hear&#xD;
Faith speak those few words, and to watch her the while&#xD;
--herself supplying all'deficiencies; and then was. con-&#xD;
tent that her child should lie still. and go to sleep, if&#xD;
she chose--it was enough to look at her and think: re-&#xD;
joicing with her and for her with a very pure joy, if it was&#xD;
sometimes tearful.&#xD;
Faith presently changed her position, and gave a very&#xD;
particular attention to the smoothing of the hair over her&#xD;
mother's forehead.  Then pulling her cap straight, and:&#xD;
giving her a finishing look and kiss,.she took a.low seat&#xD;
close beside her, laid one of her study books on her mother's&#xD;
lap, resting one arm there fondly, and went hai'd to work;&#xD;
&#xD;
remarking however that Mrs. Derrick might talk as much&#xD;
she liked and she would talk too. But Mrs. Derrick&#xD;
either did not want to talk, or else'she did not want to in-&#xD;
terrupt; for she watched Faith and smiled upon her, and&#xD;
stroked her hair, and said very little.&#xD;
Just at the end of the afternoon, when Faith was finish-&#xD;
ing her work by firelight, Mr. Linden came. in. She did&#xD;
not see the look that passed between her mother and him&#xD;
--she only knew that they held each other's hands for a&#xD;
minute silently,-then one of the hands was laid upon her&#xD;
forehead.&#xD;
"Little student-do you want to try the fresh air ?"&#xD;
She said yes; and&amp;amp; without raising her eyes, ran off to&#xD;
get ready. In another minute she was out in the cool&#xD;
freshness of the December twilight.&#xD;

THE walk lasted till all the afterglow had faded and all&#xD;
the stars come out, and till half Pattaquasset had&#xD;
done tea; having its own glow and starlight, and its flow&#xD;
of conversation to which the table- talk was nothing.&#xD;
Of course, Faith's first business on reaching home was&#xD;
to see about the tea. She and Mrs.. Derrick were happily&#xD;
engaged together in various" preparations, and Mr. Linden&#xD;
alone in the sitting-room, when the unwelcome sound of a&#xD;
knock came at the front door; and the next minute his&#xD;
solitude was broken im upon.-&#xD;
"Good evening !" said the doctor. "Three-quarters&#xD;
of a mile off 'I heard the clarion of the unseen midge !' so&#xD;
I thought it was best to come to close quarters with the&#xD;
enemy.-There is nothing so annoying as a distant hum-&#xD;
ming in ypur ears. How do you do ?". He had come up&#xD;
and laid his hand on Mr. Linden's shoulder before the latter&#xD;
had time to rise.&#xD;
"What a perverse taste 1" Mr. Linden said, laughing and&#xD;
springing up. "All the rest of the world Ithink a near-by&#xD;
humming so much worse."&#xD;
"Can't distinguish at a distance," said the doctor ;-_." one&#xD;
doesn't know whether it's a midge or a dragon-fly. How&#xD;
is Mignonette ? and Mignonette's mother ?"&#xD;
"They were both well the last time I saw them. In what&#xD;
sort of a calm flutter are you, doctor ?"&#xD;
"Do you think that is my character ?" said the doctor,&#xD;
taking his favourite position on the rug.&#xD;
You go straight to the fire--like all the rest of the&#xD;
tribe," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"Is it inconsistent with the character of such an extra-&#xD;
ordinary midge, to go straight to the mark ?"&#xD;
"Nobody ever saw a midge do that yet, I'll venture to&#xD;
say."&#xD;
"And you are resolved, to act in character," said the&#xD;
doctor gravely. "You have got clean away from the&#xD;
(500)&#xD;
&#xD;
point. I asked you last night to tell me what you thought&#xD;
of me. We are alone now-do it, Linden!I"&#xD;
"Why do you want to know?"&#xD;
"I don't know. A man likes to talk of himself-cela&#xD;
s'entend--but I care enough about you, to care to know&#xD;
how I stand in your thoughts. If you asked me how I&#xD;
stand in my own, I could not tell you; and I should like&#xD;
to know how the just balances of your mind-I'm not&#xD;
talking ironically, Linden,-weigh and poise we;-what&#xD;
sort of alloy your mental tests make me out. ,No mat-&#xD;
ter why !_-indulge me, and let me have it. I presume&#xD;
it is nothing better than philosophical curiosity. I am-&#xD;
every man is to himself-au enigma-a mystery;-and I&#xD;
should like to have a sudden outside view-from optics that&#xD;
I have some respect for."&#xD;
"I gave you the outside view last night," Mr. Linden&#xD;
said. But then he came and stood near the doctor and&#xD;
answered him simply; speaking with that grave gentleness&#xD;
of interest which rarely failed to give the speaker a place&#xD;
in people's hearts, even when his words failed of it.&#xD;
"I think much of you, in the first place,-and in the&#xD;
second place, I wish you would let me think more ;-you&#xD;
stand in my thoughts as an object of very warm interest,&#xD;
of very earnest prayer. Measured-not by my standards,&#xD;
but by those which the word of God sets up, you are like&#xD;
your own admirablymade and adjusted microscope, with&#xD;
all the higher powers left off. The only enigma, the only&#xD;
mystery is, that you yourself cannot see this."&#xD;
Dr. Harrison looked at him with a grave, considerative&#xD;
face, drawing a little back; perhaps to do it the better.&#xD;
"Do you mean to say, that you do such a thing as pray&#xD;
for me?"&#xD;
A. slight, sweet smile came with the answer.-"Can you&#xD;
doubt it?"&#xD;
"Why I might very reasonably doubt it,-though not&#xD;
your word.- Why do you,-.-may I ask ?"&#xD;
"What can I do for a man in deadly peril, whom my&#xD;
arm cannot reach ?" The tone was very kindly, very earn-&#xD;
est; the eyes with their deep light looked full into the&#xD;
doctor's.&#xD;
Dr. IHarrison was silent, meeting the look and taking&#xD;

the depth and meaning of it, so far as fathomable by husu&#xD;
The two faces and figures, fine as they both were, made a&#xD;
strange contrast. The doctor's face was in one of its&#xD;
serious and. good expressions; but the other had come&#xD;
from a region of light which this one had never entered,&#xD;
And even in attitude--the dignified unconsciousness of the&#xD;
one, was very different from the satisfied carelessness of the&#xD;
other.&#xD;
"May I further ask," he said in a softened tone,- .." why&#xD;
you do this for me?"'&#xD;
"Because I care about you."&#xD;
"It's incredible !" said the doctor, his eye wtgvering, how.&#xD;
ever. "One man care about another ! Why, man I&#xD;
be the worst enemy you have in the world, for aught you&#xD;
know."&#xD;
"That cannot hinder my being your friend."&#xD;
"Do you know," said the other looking at him half&#xD;
euriously,--"I am ready to do such a foolish thing as to&#xD;
believe you? Well--be as much of a friend to me as you&#xD;
can; and I'll deserve it as well as I can--which maybe&#xD;
won't be very well. Indeed that is most likely !" He had&#xD;
stretched out his hand to Mr. Linden however, and clasped&#xD;
his warmly. He quitted it now to go forward and take&#xD;
that of Faith-.&#xD;
She came in just as usual, and met the doctor with her&#xD;
wonted manner; only the crimson stain on her cheek tell-&#xD;
ing anything against her. - She did not give him much&#xD;
chance to observe that; for Cindy followed her with the&#xD;
tea things and Faith busied herself about the table. The&#xD;
doctor went back to his stand and watched her.&#xD;
"Mignonette has changed colour," he remarked pre-&#xD;
sently. "flow is that, Miss Derrick ?"&#xD;
"How is what, sir ?"&#xD;
f "Hiow come you to change the proper characteristics&#xD;
of mignonette?  Don't you know that never shews high&#xD;
brillhancy ?"&#xD;
"  su  ose I am not mignonette to-night," said Faith,&#xD;
returning o the safer observation of the tea-table.&#xD;
"Are y u my flower, then? th Rhodora ?" he said&#xD;
with a low red tone, coming near her. '&#xD;
If Faith heard, she did not seem to hear this question.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
Her attention was bestowed upon the preparations for tea,&#xD;
till Mrs. Derrick came in to make it; and then Faith found&#xD;
a great deal to do in the care of the other duties.of the&#xD;
table. It was a mystery, how she managed it; she who&#xD;
generally had as much leisure at meals as anybody wanted.&#xD;
Dry Harrison's attention however was no longer exclusively&#xD;
given to her.&#xD;
"Do you always have these muffins for tea, Mrs. Der-&#xD;
rick ?" he remarked with his second essay.&#xD;
"Why no !" said Mrs. Derrick,-" we have all sorts of&#xD;
other things. Don't you like muffins, doctor ?"&#xD;
"Like them !" said the doctor. "I am thinking what&#xD;
a happy man Mr. Linden must be."&#xD;
"Marvellously true 1" said Mr. Linden. "I hope you'll&#xD;
go home and write a new 'Search after happiness,' ending&#xD;
it sentimentally in muffins."&#xD;
"Not so," said the doctor. "I should only begin it in&#xD;
muffins-as I am doing. But my remark after all had a&#xD;
point;-for I was thinking of the possibility of detaching&#xD;
anybody from such a periodical attraction. Mrs. Derrick,&#xD;
I am the bearer of an humble message to you from my&#xD;
sister and father-who covet the honour and pleasure of&#xD;
your presence to-morrow evening. Sophy makes me use-&#xD;
ful, when she can. I hope you will give me a gracious&#xD;
answer--for yourself and Miss Faith, and so make me use-&#xD;
ful again. It is a rare chance ! I am not often good for&#xD;
anything."&#xD;
"I don't know whether I know how to give what you&#xD;
call gracious answers, doctor," said Mrs. Derrick pleasantly.&#xD;
"I'm very much obliged to Miss Sophy, but I never go&#xD;
anywhere at night."&#xD;
With the other two the doctor's mission was more&#xD;
successful; and then he disclosed the other object of his&#xD;
visit.&#xD;
"Miss Derrick, do you remember I once threatened to&#xD;
bring the play of Portia here-and introduce her to&#xD;
you ?"&#xD;
"I remember it," said Faith.&#xD;
"Would it be pleasant to you that I should fulfil my&#xD;
threat this evening ?"&#xD;

t"I don't know, sir," said Faith smiling,-" till I hea&#xD;
the play.",&#xD;
"Mr. Linden,.......what do you think ?" said the doctor,&#xD;
also with a smile.&#xD;
"I am ready for anything-if you will let me be impolite&#xD;
enough to finish writing a letter while I hear the first part&#xD;
of your reading."&#xD;
"To change the subject slightly-what do you suppose,&#xD;
Mr. Linden, would on the whole be the effect, on society,&#xD;
if the hand of Truth were in every case to be presented&#xD;
without a glove ?" The doctor spoke gravely now.&#xD;
"The effect would be that society would shake hands&#xD;
more cordially-I should think," said Mr. Linden; "though&#xD;
it is hard to say how such an extreme proposition would&#xD;
work."&#xD;
"Do you know, it strikes me that it would work just the&#xD;
other way, and that hands would presently clasp nothing&#xD;
but daggers' hilts. But there is another question..-.How&#xD;
will one fair hand of truth live among a crowd of steel&#xD;
gauntlets ?"&#xD;
"What ?" Mr. Linden said, with a little bending of his&#xD;
brows upon the doctor. "I am wearing neither glove nor&#xD;
gauntlet,-what are you talking about ?.-.And my half-&#xD;
finished letter is a fact and no pretence."&#xD;
"I sha'n't believe you," said the doctor, "if you give my&#xD;
fingers such a wring as that. Well, go to your letter,&#xD;
and I'll take Miss Derrick to Venice--if she will let me."&#xD;
Venice !-That exquisite photograph of the Bridge of&#xD;
Sighs, and "the palace and the prison on each hand,"&#xD;
about which such a long, long entrancing account had been&#xD;
given by Mr. Linden to her-the scene and the talk rose&#xD;
up before Faith's imagination; she was very ready to go&#xD;
to Venice. Its witching scenery, its strange history, floated&#xD;
up, in a fascinating, strange cloud-view; she was all ready&#xD;
for Shylock and the Rialto. Nay, for the Rialto,-not for&#xD;
Shylock; him, or anything like. him, she had never seen&#xD;
nor imagined. She was only sorry that Mr. Linden had&#xD;
to go to his letter; but there was a compensative side to&#xD;
that, for her shyness was somewhat less endangered. With&#xD;
only the doctor and Shylock to attend to, she could get&#xD;
along very well'.&#xD;
&#xD;
Shyness and fears however, were of very short endurance.&#xD;
To Venice she went,-Shylock she saw; and then she saw&#xD;
nothing else but Shylock, and those who were dealing with&#xD;
him; unless an occasional slight glance towards the distant&#xD;
table where Mr. Linden sat at his writing, might be held&#xD;
to signify that she had powers of vision for somewhat else.&#xD;
It did not interrupt the doctor's pleasure, nor her own.&#xD;
Dr. Harrison had begun with at least a double motive in&#xD;
his mind; but man of the world as he was, he forgot his&#xD;
unsatisfied curiosity in the singular gratification of reading&#xD;
such a play to such a listener. It was so plain that Faith&#xD;
was in Venice! She entered with such simplicity, and also&#xD;
with such intelligence, into the characters and interests of&#xD;
the persons in the drama; she relished their words so well;&#xD;
shd weighed in such a nice balance of her own the right&#xD;
and the wrong, the true and the false, of whatever rested&#xD;
on nature and truth for its proper judgment;.-she was so&#xD;
perfectly and deliciously ignorant of the world and the ways&#xD;
of it! The fresh view that such pure eyes took of such&#xD;
actors and scenes, was indescribably interesting; Dr. Har-&#xD;
rison found it the best play he had ever read in his life. He&#xD;
made it convenient sometimes to pause to indoctrinate&#xD;
Faith in characters or customs of which she had no ade-&#xD;
quate knowledge; it did not hurt her pleasure; it was all&#xD;
part of the play.-&#xD;
In the second scene, the doctor stopped to explain the&#xD;
terms on which Portia had been left with her suitors.&#xD;
"What do you think of it?"&#xD;
"I think it was hard," said Faith smiling.&#xD;
"What would you have done if you had been left so 1"&#xD;
"I would not have been left so."&#xD;
"But you might not help yourself. Suppose it had been&#xD;
a father's or a mother's command? that anybody might&#xD;
come up and have you, for the finding-if they could pitch&#xD;
upon the right box of jewelry ?"&#xD;
"My father or mother would never have put such a com-&#xD;
mand on me," said Faith looking amused.&#xD;
"But you may suppose anything," said the doctor lean-&#xD;
ing forward and smiling. supposee they had ?"&#xD;
"Then you must suppose me different too," said Faith&#xD;

laughing.  "Suppose me to have been like Portia; and I&#xD;
should have done as she did."&#xD;
The doctor shook his head and looked gravely at her.&#xD;
"Are you so impracticable ?"&#xD;
"Was she ?" said Faith.&#xD;
"Then you wouldn't think it right to obey Mrs. Derrick&#xD;
in all circumstances?".&#xD;
" {ot if she was Portia's mother," said Faith.&#xD;
"   ppose you had been the Prince of Arragon-which&#xD;
casket would you have chosen ?" said Mr. Linden, as he&#xD;
came from his table, letter in hand.&#xD;
"I suppose I should have chosenias he did," said the&#xD;
doctor carelessly-"I really don't remember how that&#xD;
was. I'll tell you when I come to him. Have you done&#xD;
letter-writing ?"&#xD;
"I have done writing letters, for to-night. Have I per-&#xD;
mission to go to Venice in your train ?&#xD;
"I am only a locomotive," said the doctor.  "But youth&#xD;
know, with two a train goes faster. If you had another&#xD;
copy of the play, now, Linden.-.-and we should read it as I&#xD;
have read Shakspeare in certain former times---take dif.&#xD;
ferent parts--I presume the effect would excel steam-&#xD;
power, and befelectric. Can you ?"&#xD;
Thiswas agreed to, and the "effect" almost equalled the&#xD;
doctor's prognostications. Even Mrs. Derrick, who had&#xD;
somewhat carelessly held aloof from his single presentation&#xD;
of the play, was fascinated now, and drew near and dropped&#xD;
her knitting. It would have been a very rare entertainmentE&#xD;
to any that had heard it; but for once an audience of two.,&#xD;
was sufficient for the stimulus and reward of the readers.&#xD;
That and the actual enjoyment of the parts they were play-&#xD;
ing.. Dr. Harrison read well, with cultivated and critical&#xD;
accuracy. His voice was good and melodious, his English a&#xD;
enunciation excellent ; his knowledge of his author thorough,&#xD;
as far as acquaintanceship went; and his habit of reading&#xD;
a dramatically practised one. But Faith, amid all her de-&#xD;
light, had felt a want in it, as compared with the reading&#xD;
to whic4 of late she had been accustomed; it did not give&#xD;
the soul and heart of the author-though it gave everything&#xD;
else.' That is what only soul and heart can do. Not that&#xD;
Dr. Harrison was entirely wanting in those gifts either;&#xD;
&#xD;
they lay somewhere, perhaps, in him; but they are not the&#xD;
ones which in what is called 'the world' come most often or&#xD;
readily into play; and so it falls out that one who lives&#xD;
I there long becomes like the cork oak when it has stood&#xD;
Flonguntouched in its world ; the heart is encrusted with a&#xD;
monstrous thick, almost impenetrable, coating of bark.&#xD;
When Mr. Linden joined the reading, the'pleasure was&#xD;
perfect; the very contrast between the two characters and&#xD;
the two voices made the illusion more happy. Then Faith&#xD;
was in a little danger of-betraying herself; for it was diffi-&#xD;
cult to look at both readers with the same eyes; and if she&#xD;
tried to keep her eyes at home, that was more difficult&#xD;
still.&#xD;
In the second act, Portia says to Arragon,&#xD;
"In terms of choice I am not solely led&#xD;
Biy nice direction of a maiden's eyes," etc.&#xD;
"What do you think of that, Miss Derrick ?" said the&#xD;
doctor pausing when his turn came. "Do you think a&#xD;
ladys choice ought to be so determined ?"&#xD;
Faith raised her eyes, and answered, "No, sir."&#xD;
"By what then? You don't trust appearances?"&#xD;
Faith hesitated.&#xD;
"I should like to hear how Portia managed," she said,&#xD;
with a little heightened colour. "I never thought much&#xD;
about it."&#xD;
"What do you think of Portia's gloves, doctor ?" said&#xD;
Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"llum"-said the doctor. "They are a pattern !-soft&#xD;
as steel, harsh as kid-leather. (hey fit too, so exquisitely!&#xD;
But, if I were marrying her, I hink I should request that&#xD;
she would give her gloves into my keeping."&#xD;
"Then would your exercise of power be properly thwarted.&#xD;
Every time you made the demand, Portia would, like a jug-&#xD;
gler, pull off and surrender a fresh pair of gloves, leaving&#xD;
ever a pair yet finer-spun upon her hands."&#xD;
"I suppose she would," said the doctorcomically. "Come!&#xD;
I won't marry her. And yet, Linden,-one might do worse.&#xD;
Such gloves keep off a wonderful amount of friction."&#xD;
"If' you happen to have fur which cannot be even stroked&#xD;
the wrong way!"&#xD;

&#xD;
The doctor's eye glanced with fun, and Faith laughed,&#xD;
The reading went on. And went on without much pausing,&#xD;
until the lines-...&#xD;
"0 ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly&#xD;
To seal love's bonds new made, than they are wont&#xD;
To keep obliged faith unforfeited !&#xD;
Who riseth from a feast,&#xD;
With that keen appetite that he sits down?&#xD;
Where is the horse, that doth untread again&#xD;
His tedious measures with the unabated fire&#xD;
That he did pace them first? All things that are,&#xD;
Are with more spirit chased than enjoyed."&#xD;
"Do you believe in that doctrine, Miss Faith ?" said the&#xD;
doctor, with a gentle look in her direction.&#xD;
"I suppose it is trueof some things,"-she said after a&#xD;
minute's consideration.&#xD;
"What a wicked truth it is, Linden !" said the doctor.&#xD;
"There is 'an error i' the bill,'" said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
Faith's eyes looked somewhat eagerly, the doctor's philo..&#xD;
sophically.&#xD;
"Declare and shew," said the doctor. "I thought it was&#xD;
a universal, most deplorable, human fact; and here it is, in&#xD;
Shakspeare, man; which is another word for saying it is in&#xD;
humanity,"&#xD;
"It is true only of false things. The Magician's coins&#xD;
are next day but withered leaves-the real gold is at com'-&#xD;
po~iind interest."&#xD;
The doctor's smile was doubtful and cynical; jFaith's had&#xD;
"Where is your 'real gold'?" said the doctor.&#xD;
"Do  you expect me to tell you?" said Mr. Linden&#xD;
laughing. "I have found a good deal in the course of my&#xD;
life, and the interest is regularly paid 'in."&#xD;
"Are you talking seriously ?"&#xD;
"Ay truly. So may you."&#xD;
"From any other man, I should throw away your words&#xD;
as the veriest Magician's coin; but if they are true metal-&#xD;
why I'll ask you to take me to see the Mint some day !"&#xD;
"Let thme remind you," said. Mr. Linden, "that there are&#xD;
forna set-ngs in Shakspeare.- What do you think of this,&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
'Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks&#xD;
Within his bending sickle's compass come;&#xD;
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,&#xD;
But bears it out e'en to the edge of doom.&#xD;
If this be error, and upon me proved,&#xD;
I never writ, nor no man-ever loved.'"&#xD;
&#xD;
"There's an error proved upon me," said the doctor,&#xD;
biting his lips as' he looked at Faith who had listened de-&#xD;
lightedly. "Come on! I'll stop no more.  The thing is,&#xD;
Linden, that I am less happy than you--I never found any&#xD;
real gold in my life!"&#xD;
bAh you expect gold to come set with diaonds,--ald&#xD;
that cannot always be. I don't doubt you have gold&#xD;
enough to start a large fortune, if you would only rub it&#xD;
up and make it productive."&#xD;
The doctor made no answer to that, and the reading&#xD;
went on; Faith becoming exceedingly engrossed with the&#xD;
progress of the frama. She listened with an eagerness&#xD;
which both the readers amusedly took heed of, asthe suc&#xD;
cessive princes of Morocco and Arragon made their trial;&#xD;
;r  the doctor avowing by the way, that he thought lie should&#xD;
have "assumed desert" as the latter prince did, and received&#xD;
the fool's head for his pains. Then they came to the beau-&#xD;
tiful "casket scene." The doctor.had somehow from the&#xD;
-   beginning left Portia in Mr. Linden's hands; and now gave&#xD;
with great truth and gracefulness the very graceful words&#xD;
of her successful suitor. He could put truth into these,&#xD;
and did, and accordingly read beautifully; well heard, for&#xD;
the play of Faith's varying face skewed she went along&#xD;
thoroughly with all the fine turns of thought and feeling;&#xD;
here and elsewhere. But how well and how delicately Mr.&#xD;
Linden gave Portia! That Dr. Harrison could not have&#xD;
done; the parts had fallen out happily, whether by chance&#xD;
or design. Her ladylike and coy play with words-her&#xD;
transparent veil of delicate shifting turns of expression--&#xD;
contriving to say all and yet as if she would say nothing-&#xD;
were rendered by the reader with a grace of tone every&#xD;
.way fit to them. Faith's eye ceased to look at anybody,&#xD;
and her colour flitted, as this scene went on; and when&#xD;
Portia's address to her fortunate wooer was reached--that&#xD;
very noble and dignified declaration of her woman's mind,&#xD;

when she certainly pulled off her gloves, wherever else she&#xD;
might wear them;-Faith turned her face quite away from&#xD;
the readers and with the cheek she could not hide sheltered&#xD;
by her hand--..as well as her hand could-she let nobody&#xD;
but the fire and Mrs. Derrick seeswhat a.flush covered the&#xD;
other. Very incautious in Faith, but it was the best she&#xD;
could do. And the varied interests that immediately fol-&#xD;
lowed, of Antonio's danger and deliverance, gradually&#xD;
brought her head round again and accounted sufficiently&#xD;
for the colour with which her cheeks still burned. The&#xD;
Merchant of Venice was not the only play enacting that&#xD;
-evening; and the temptation to break in upon the one, made&#xD;
the doctor, as often as he could, break off the other; though&#xD;
the interest of the plot for a while gave him little chance.&#xD;
"So shines a good deed in &amp;amp; naughty world."&#xD;
"Do you suppose, Miss Derrick," said Dr. Harrison&#xD;
with his look of amused pleasure,--" that is because the&#xD;
world is so dark ?-or because the effects of the good diedI&#xD;
reach to such a distance ?"&#xD;
"Both," said Faith immediately.&#xD;
"You think the world is so bad ?"k&#xD;
"1 don't know much of the world," said Faith,-.-"but I&#xD;
suppose the shining good deeds aren't so very many."&#xD;
"What makes a good deed shining ?" said the doctor.&#xD;
Faith glanced at Mr. Linden. But he did not take it up,&#xD;
and she was thrown back upon her own resources. She&#xD;
thought a bit.&#xD;
"I suppose,".-.she said,--"its coming from  the very&#xD;
spirit of light.E&#xD;
"You must explain," said the doctor good-humouredly.&#xD;
but smiling,-t' for that puts me in absolute darkness."&#xD;
"I don't know very well how to tell what I mean," said i&#xD;
Faith colouring and looking thoughtful ;-" I think I know. i&#xD;
Things that are done for the pure love of God and truth, I I&#xD;
think, shine; if they are ever so little things, because really&#xD;
there is a great light in them.' I think they shine more&#xD;
than some of the greater things that people call very bril-&#xD;
liant, but that are lone from a lower motive."&#xD;
"I should like"-said the doctor-" Can you remember&#xD;
an instance or two ? of both kinds ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
c&#xD;
&#xD;
510&#xD;
&#xD;
Well Faith remembered an instance or. two of one kind,&#xD;
which she could not instance. She sought in her memory.&#xD;
"When Daniel kneeled upon his knees three times a day to&#xD;
pray, with his windows open, after the king's law had for-&#xD;
bidden any one to do it on pain of death,-" said Faith-&#xD;
"I think that was a shining good deed!"&#xD;
"But that was a very notable instance," said the doctor.&#xD;
"It was a very little thing he did," said Faith. "Only&#xD;
kneeled down to pray in his own room. And it has shined&#xD;
all the way down to us."&#xD;
"And in later times," said Mr. Linden,-"when the ex-&#xD;
ploring shallop of the Mayflower sought a place of settle-&#xD;
ment, and after beating about in winter storms came to&#xD;
anchor Friday night at Plymouth Rock;--all Saturday&#xD;
was lost in refitting and preparing, and yet on Sunday they&#xD;
would not land. Those two dozen men, with no human&#xD;
eye to see, with every possible need for haste1"&#xD;
"That hasn't shined quite'so. far," said the doctor, "for&#xD;
it never reached me.  And it don't enlighten me now!&#xD;
I should have landed."&#xD;
"Do you know nothing of' the spirit of Say and Seal,&#xD;
as well as the province ?" said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"As how, against landing ?"&#xD;
"They rested that day 'according to the commandment.&#xD;
Having promised to obey God in all things, the seal of their&#xD;
Obedience was unbroken."&#xD;
"Well, Miss Faith," said the doctor-"Now for a counter&#xD;
example."&#xD;
"I know so little of what has been done," said Faith.&#xD;
"Don't you remember some such things yourself, Dr. Har-&#xD;
rison ?-Mr. Linden?"-The voice changed and fell a little&#xD;
as it passed from one to the other.&#xD;
"General Putnam went into the wolf's den, and pulled:&#xD;
him out"-said the doctor humorously,-"that's all I can&#xD;
think of just now, and it is not very much in point. I don't&#xD;
know that there was anything very bright about it except&#xD;
the wolf's eyes !-But here we are keeping Portia out of&#xD;
doors, and Miss Derrick waiting! Linden-fall to."' And&#xD;
with comical life and dramatic zeal on the doctor's part, in&#xD;
a few minutes more, the play was finished.&#xD;

"Mrs. Derrick," said the doctor gravely as he rose and&#xD;
stood before her,-"I hope you approve of plays."&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick expressed her amusement and satisfaction,&#xD;
"Miss Faith," he said extending his hand,--.." I have to&#xD;
thank you for the most perfect enjoyment I have ever had&#xD;
of Shakspeare. I only wish to-morrow evening would roll&#xD;
off on such swift wheels-but it would be too much. Look&#xD;
where this one has rolled to!" And he chewed his watch&#xD;
and hurried) off; that is, if Dr.1 Harrison could be said to&#xD;
do such a thing.&#xD;
The rest of the party also were stirred from their quiet.&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick went out; and Mr. Linden, coming behind&#xD;
Faith as she stood by the fire, gently raised her face till he&#xD;
could have a full view of it, and asked her how she liked&#xD;
being in Venice?&#xD;
"Very much," she said, smiling and blushing at him,_...&#xD;
"very much!"&#xD;
"You are not the magician's coin 1" he said, kissing her.&#xD;
"You are not even a witch. Do you know how I found'&#xD;
that out?"&#xD;
"No"--she said softly, the colour spreading over her&#xD;
face and her eyes falling, but raised again immediately to&#xD;
ask the question of him.&#xD;
"A witch's charms are always dispelled whenever she&#xD;
tries to cross running water !"-&#xD;
She laughed; an amused, bright, happy little laugh, that&#xD;
it was pleasant to hear.&#xD;
"But what did Dr. Harrison mean,-by what he said&#xD;
when he thanked me ? What did he thank me for ?"&#xD;
"He said for a new enjoyment of Shakspeare."&#xD;
"What did.he mean ?"&#xD;
"Do you understand how the sweet fragrance of mig-&#xD;
nonette can give new enjoyment to a summer's day ?"&#xD;
She blushed exceedingly. "But, Mr. Linden, please&#xD;
don't talk so! And I don't want to give Dr. Harrison&#xD;
enjoyment in that way."&#xD;
"Which part of your sentence shall I handle first ?" he&#xD;
said with a langhing flash of the eyes,--"'Dr. Harrison'-&#xD;
or 'Mr. Linden'?"&#xD;
" The first," said Faith laying her hand deprecatingly on&#xD;
his arm ;-." and let the other alone !"&#xD;

"So-as I don't deserve," she said raising her grave&#xD;

;wrong things."&#xD;
He looked at her, with one of those rare smiles which&#xD;
belonged to her; holding her hand with a little soft motion&#xD;
of it to and fro upon his own.&#xD;
"I am not sure that I dare promise 'to be good," he&#xD;
said,-"I am so apt to speak of things as I find them.&#xD;

She looked up and smiled. So much friction or promise&#xD;
of it, as there is about the blue sky's reflection in the clear&#xD;
deep waters of a mountain lake-so much there was in the&#xD;
soft depth-and reflection-of Faith's eyes at that moment.&#xD;
So deep,-so unruffled ;--and as in the lake, so in the look&#xD;
